important source of background in rare event searches, such as neutrinoless
double-$\beta$ decay and dark matter direct detection experiments. When a
sample mass of hundreds of grams is available, $\gamma$-counting measurements
can be performed. However, there are other cases where only grams of sample can
be used. For these cases, better sensitivities are required.
  In this paper, in collaboration with the Astroparticle Physics group at
Carleton University, the capabilities of the A.E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at the
University of Ottawa for $^{210}$Pb measurements are discussed. PbF$_{2}$ and
PbO targets were used, selecting in the low energy sector, respectively,
(PbF$_{3}$)$^{-}$ or (PbO$_{2}$)$^{-}$ ions.
  For fluoride targets, the blank $^{210}$Pb/$^{206}$Pb ratio was in the
10$^{-14}$ to 10$^{-13}$ range, but current output was lower and less stable.
For oxide targets, current output showed better stability, despite a
significant difference in current output for commercial PbO and processed
samples, and background studies suggested a background not much higher than
that of the fluoride targets. Both target materials showed, therefore, good
performance for $^{210}$Pb AMS assay.
  Measurements of Kapton films, an ultra-thin polymer material, where masses
available are typically just several grams, were performed. 90% C.L. upper
limits for the $^{210}$Pb specific activity in the range of 0.74-2.8 Bq/kg were
established for several Kapton HN films.

First, falling to the Coulomb center is discussed at $Z>137/2$ for a spinless
boson and at $Z>137$ for electron. Then, focus is concentrated on description
of deep electron levels and spontaneous positron production in the field of a
finite-size nucleus with the charge $Z>Z_{\rm cr}\simeq 170$. Next, these
effects are studied in application to the low-energy heavy-ion collisions.
Then, we consider phenomenon of ""electron condensation"" on levels of upper
continuum crossed the boundary of the lower continuum $\epsilon =-m$ in the
field of a supercharged nucleus with $Z\gg Z_{\rm cr}$. Finally, attention is
focused on many-particle problems of polarization of the QED vacuum and
electron condensation at ultra-short distances from a source of charge. We
argue for a principal difference of cases, when the size of the source is
larger than the pole size $r_{\rm pole}$, at which the dielectric permittivity
of the vacuum reaches zero, and smaller $r_{\rm pole}$. Some arguments are
presented in favor of the logical consistency of QED. All problems are
considered within the same relativistic semiclassical approach.

  Training",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper describes an end-to-end solution for the relationship prediction
task in heterogeneous, multi-relational graphs. We particularly address two
building blocks in the pipeline, namely heterogeneous graph representation
learning and negative sampling. Existing message passing-based graph neural
networks use edges either for graph traversal and/or selection of message
encoding functions. Ignoring the edge semantics could have severe repercussions
on the quality of embeddings, especially when dealing with two nodes having
multiple relations. Furthermore, the expressivity of the learned representation
depends on the quality of negative samples used during training. Although
existing hard negative sampling techniques can identify challenging negative
relationships for optimization, new techniques are required to control false
negatives during training as false negatives could corrupt the learning
process. To address these issues, first, we propose RelGNN -- a message
passing-based heterogeneous graph attention model. In particular, RelGNN
generates the states of different relations and leverages them along with the
node states to weigh the messages. RelGNN also adopts a self-attention
mechanism to balance the importance of attribute features and topological
features for generating the final entity embeddings. Second, we introduce a
parameter-free negative sampling technique -- adaptive self-adversarial (ASA)
negative sampling. ASA reduces the false-negative rate by leveraging positive
relationships to effectively guide the identification of true negative samples.
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RelGNN optimized by ASA for
relationship prediction improves state-of-the-art performance across
established benchmarks as well as on a real industrial dataset.

the exponential growth of energy consumption, SE and EE continue to elicit
increasing attention in academia and industries. Consequently, a study of the
trade-off between these metrics is imperative. In contrast with existing works,
this study proposes an efficient SE and EE trade-off algorithm for saving
energy in downlink Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to concurrently optimize
SE and EE while considering battery life at the Base Station (BS). The scheme
is formulated as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) and its Pareto
optimal solution is examined. In contrast with other algorithms that prolong
battery life by considering the idle state of a BS, thereby increasing average
delay and energy consumption, the proposed algorithm prolongs battery life by
adjusting the initial and final states of a BS to minimize the average delay
and the energy consumption. Similarly, the use of an omni-directional antenna
to spread radio signals to the user equipment in all directions causes high
interference and low spatial reuse. We propose using a directional antenna
instead of an omni-directional antenna by transmitting signals in one direction
which results in no or low interference and high spatial reuse. The proposed
scheme has been extensively evaluated through simulation, where simulation
results prove that the proposed scheme is efficiently able to decrease the
average response delay, improve SE, and minimize energy consumption.

resource usage of these jobs also typically fluctuates considerably. Therefore,
multiple jobs usually get scheduled onto the same shared resources to increase
the resource utilization and throughput of clusters. However, job runtimes and
the utilization of shared resources can vary significantly depending on the
specific combinations of co-located jobs.
  This paper presents Hugo, a cluster scheduler that continuously learns how
efficiently jobs share resources, considering metrics for the resource

offline grouping of jobs with online reinforcement learning to provide a
scheduling mechanism that efficiently generalizes from specific monitored job

high energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Mobile Agent (MA)
has been proven to be a viable alternative to the traditional client-server
data gathering model. MA has the ability to migrate among network nodes based
on an assigned itinerary, which can be formed via Single Itinerary Planning
(SIP) or Multiple Itinerary Planning (MIP). MIP-based data gathering approach
solves problems associated with SIP in terms of task duration, energy
consumption, and reliability. However, the majority of existing MIP approaches
focus only on reducing energy consumption and task duration, while the
Event-to-sink throughput has not been considered. In this paper, a Clone
Mobile-agent Itinerary Planning approach (CMIP) is proposed to reduce task
duration while improving the Event-to-sink throughput in real-time
applications, especially when the MA is assigned to visit a large number of
source nodes. Simulation results show that the CMIP approach outperforms both
Central Location-based MIP (CL-MIP) and Greatest Information in Greatest
Memory-based MIP (GIGM-MIP) in terms of reducing task duration by about 56% and
16%, respectively. Furthermore, CMIP improves the Event-to-sink throughput by
about 93% and 22% as compared to both CL-MIP and GIGM-MIP approaches,

of a single diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center for continuous real-time

prevents optical emissions from the NV center. Fluctuating magnetic fields,
however, can kick the NV center out of the dark state, leading to a sequence of
single-photon emissions. A time series of the photon counts detected can be
used for magnetic field estimations, even when the average photon count per
update time interval is much smaller than 1. For a theoretical demonstration,
the nuclear spin bath in a diamond lattice is used as a model fluctuating
magnetic environment. For fluctuations with known statistical properties, such
as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Bayesian inference-based estimators can lead
to an estimation variance that approaches the classical Cramer-Rao lower bound
and can provide dynamical information on a timescale that is comparable to the
inverse of the average photon counting rate. Real-time sensing using coherent
population trapping adds a new and powerful tool to the emerging technology of
quantum sensing.

$\mathsf{dilation}$ is the maximum round complexity of any of the given jobs,
and the $\mathsf{GlobalCongestion}$ is the total number of messages in all jobs

Both are inherent lower bounds for any scheduling algorithm.
  Then, we present a randomized scheduling algorithm which runs $t$ jobs in
$O(\mathsf{GlobalCongestion} + \mathsf{dilation}\cdot\log{n}+t)$ rounds and
only requires that inputs and outputs do not exceed $O(n\log n)$ bits per node,
which is met by, e.g., almost all graph problems. Lastly, we adjust the

lead to significant quantification variability. Hence image-to-image or
scanner-to-scanner translation is a crucial frontier in the area of medical
image analysis with a lot of potential applications. Nonetheless, a significant
percentage of existing algorithms cannot explicitly exploit and preserve
texture details from target scanners and offers individual solutions towards
specialized task-specific architectures. In this paper, we design a multi-scale
texture transfer to enrich the reconstruction images with more details.
Specifically, after calculating textural similarity, the multi-scale texture
can adaptively transfer the texture information from target images or reference
images to restored images. Different from the pixel-wise matching space as done
by previous algorithms, we match texture features in a multi-scale scheme
implemented in the neural space. The matching mechanism can exploit multi-scale
neural transfer that encourages the model to grasp more semantic-related and
lesion-related priors from the target or reference images. We evaluate our
multi-scale texture GAN on three different tasks without any task-specific
modifications: cross-protocol super-resolution of diffusion MRI, T1-Flair, and
Flair-T2 modality translation. Our multi-texture GAN rehabilitates more
high-resolution structures (i.e., edges and anatomy), texture (i.e., contrast
and pixel intensities), and lesion information (i.e., tumor). The extensively
quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior results in inter-protocol or inter-scanner translation over

independently to Kasteleyn and to Temperley and Fisher -- consists of changing
the sign of some of the entries in the adjacency matrix so that the Pfaffian of
the new matrix gives the number of perfect matchings, and then evaluating this
Pfaffian. Another classical method is to use the Lindstr\""om-Gessel-Viennot
theorem on non-intersecting lattice paths to express the number of perfect
matchings as a determinant, and then evaluate this determinant. In this paper
we present a new method for solving the two dimensional dimer problem, which
relies on the Cauchy-Binet theorem. It only involves facts that were known in
the mid 1930's when the dimer problem was phrased, so it could have been
discovered while the dimer problem was still open.
  We provide explicit product formulas for both the square and the hexagonal
lattice. One advantage of our formula for the square lattice compared to the
original formula of Kasteleyn, Temperley and Fisher is that ours has a linear
number of factors, while the number of factors in the former is quadratic. Our
result for the hexagonal lattice yields a formula for the number of periodic
stepped surfaces that fit in an infinite tube of given cross-section, which can
be regarded as a counterpart of MacMahon's boxed plane partition theorem.

be fast in pores providing slow ion diffusion and vice versa. Unlike electrodes

boost power density, which may find practical applications in supercapacitor

within resource constrained environments, though at the expense of capturing
static content. The sparse nature of event streams enables efficient downstream
processing tasks as they are suited for power-efficient spiking neural
networks. One of the challenges associated with neuromorphic vision is the lack
of interpretability of event streams. While most application use-cases do not
intend for the event stream to be visually interpreted by anything other than a
classification network, there is a lost opportunity to integrating these
sensors in spaces that conventional high-speed CMOS sensors cannot go. For
example, biologically invasive sensors such as endoscopes must fit within
stringent power budgets, which do not allow MHz-speeds of image integration.
While dynamic vision sensing can fill this void, the interpretation challenge
remains and will degrade confidence in clinical diagnostics. The use of
generative adversarial networks presents a possible solution to overcoming and
compensating for a vision chip's poor spatial resolution and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we methodically apply the Pix2Pix network to
naturalize the event stream from spike-converted CIFAR-10 and Linnaeus 5

classification of naturalized event streams, which converges to within 2.81% of
equivalent raw images, and an associated improvement over unprocessed event

the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical
infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However,
harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far
reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment.
An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending
information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium,
thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been
investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access
to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most
research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS.
However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to
totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making
CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain
functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant
methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine
learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial
ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient.
This paper is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions
between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper
concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research
directions. Furthermore, with this paper, readers can have a thorough
understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS
and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area.

theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden
inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication
sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices

how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed

details of few-body observables are washed out in favor of a featureless steady
state. Even in isolated quantum many-body systems, limited to reversible
dynamics, thermalization typically prevails. However, in these systems, there
is another possibility: many-body localization (MBL) can result in preservation
of a non-thermal state. While disorder has long been considered an essential
ingredient for this phenomenon, recent theoretical work has suggested that a
quantum many-body system with a uniformly increasing field -- but no disorder
-- can also exhibit MBL, resulting in `Stark MBL.' Here we realize Stark MBL in
a trapped-ion quantum simulator and demonstrate its key properties: halting of
thermalization and slow propagation of correlations. Tailoring the interactions
between ionic spins in an effective field gradient, we directly observe their
microscopic equilibration for a variety of initial states, and we apply
single-site control to measure correlations between separate regions of the
spin chain. Further, by engineering a varying gradient, we create a
disorder-free system with coexisting long-lived thermalized and nonthermal
regions. The results demonstrate the unexpected generality of MBL, with
implications about the fundamental requirements for thermalization and with
potential uses in engineering long-lived non-equilibrium quantum matter.

supercritical Hopf bifurcation gives rise to branches of standing waves and
traveling waves. The SCM is solved by means of a full Newton method coupling

verified for the traveling waves, the SCM reproduces the nonlinear frequency

Multiscale modeling seeks to understand these interactions by exploiting the

the behavior at a finer scale. This requires the repeated solution of
computationally expensive finer-scale models, and often a priori knowledge of
those aspects of the finer-scale behavior that affect the coarser scale (order

two-scale setting where we learn the fine-scale behavior from off-line

calculations. The approach draws from recent successes of deep neural networks,
in combination with ideas from model reduction. The approach builds on the
recent success of deep neural networks by combining their approximation power
in high dimensions with ideas from model reduction. It results in a neural
network approximation that has high fidelity, is computationally inexpensive,
is independent of the need for a priori knowledge, and can be used directly in
the coarse scale calculations. We demonstrate the approach on problems

the model by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ in addition to the

  differential equations",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bayesian methods have been widely used in the last two decades to infer
statistical properties of spatially variable coefficients in partial
differential equations from measurements of the solutions of these equations.
Yet, in many cases the number of variables used to parameterize these
coefficients is large, and obtaining meaningful statistics of their values is
difficult using simple sampling methods such as the basic Metropolis-Hastings
(MH) algorithm -- in particular if the inverse problem is ill-conditioned or
ill-posed. As a consequence, many advanced sampling methods have been described
in the literature that converge faster than MH, for example by exploiting
hierarchies of statistical models or hierarchies of discretizations of the
underlying differential equation.
  At the same time, it remains difficult for the reader of the literature to
quantify the advantages of these algorithms because there is no commonly used
benchmark. This paper presents a benchmark Bayesian inverse problem -- namely,
the determination of a spatially-variable coefficient, discretized by 64
values, in a Poisson equation, based on point measurements of the solution --
that fills the gap between widely used simple test cases (such as
superpositions of Gaussians) and real applications that are difficult to
replicate for developers of sampling algorithms. We provide a complete
description of the test case, and provide an open source implementation that
can serve as the basis for further experiments. We have also computed $2\times
10^{11}$ samples, at a cost of some 30 CPU years, of the posterior probability
distribution from which we have generated detailed and accurate statistics
against which other sampling algorithms can be tested.

multiple scenes significantly increases the variance of samples collected for
policy gradient computations. Current methods, effectively continue to view
this collection of scenes as a single Markov decision process (MDP), and thus
learn a scene-generic value function V(s). However, we argue that the sample
variance for a multi-scene environment is best minimized by treating each scene
as a distinct MDP, and then learning a joint value function V(s,M) dependent on
both state s and MDP M. We further demonstrate that the true joint value
function for a multi-scene environment, follows a multi-modal distribution
which is not captured by traditional CNN / LSTM based critic networks. To this
end, we propose a dynamic value estimation (DVE) technique, which approximates
the true joint value function through a sparse attention mechanism over
multiple value function hypothesis / modes. The resulting agent not only shows
significant improvements in the final reward score across a range of OpenAI

Union (EU) energy system raises the feasibility question of using only
renewables across all energy sectors. As one of the EU's leading industrialized
countries, Germany has adopted several climate-action plans for the realistic
implementation and maximum utilization of renewable energies in its energy
system. The literature review shows a clear gap in comprehensive techniques
describing an open modeling approach for analyzing fully renewable and
sector-coupled energy systems. This paper outlines a method for analyzing the
100% renewable-based and sector-coupled energy system's feasibility in Germany.
Based on the open energy modeling framework, an hourly optimization tool
'OSeEM-DE' is developed to investigate the German energy system. The model
results show that a 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled system for
electricity and building heat is feasible in Germany. The investment capacities
and component costs depend on the parametric variations of the developed
scenarios. The annual investment costs vary between 17.6 and 26.6 bn Euro/yr
for volatile generators and between 23.7 and 28.8 bn Euro/yr for heat
generators. The model suggests an investment of a minimum of 2.7-3.9 bn Euro/yr
for electricity and heat storage. Comparison of OSeEM-DE results with recent
studies validates the percentage-wise energy mix composition and the calculated
Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values from the model. Sensitivity
analyses indicate that storage and grid expansion maximize the system's
flexibility and decrease the investment cost. The study concludes by showing
how the tool can analyze different energy systems in the EU context.

potential privacy leakage while giving a better generalization power to unseen

show that it can significantly outperform the baseline neural model without

vanishes on a boundary surface ball $\partial D \cap B_{5R}(0)$. We consider an
effective version of its singular set (up to boundary) $\mathcal{S}(u):=\{X\in

polarization singularity.This is carried out by analyzing the evolution
equation of the Stokes parameters that is derived from the nonlinear
Schrodinger type equation. The problem is explored from two aspects:The first
is concerning the single mode Stokes parameter that is described by the
propagation distance $ z $. The trajectory of the polarization singularities is
simply given by the points satisfying a rule: $ S_3 (z) = +(-)S_0 $ and $ 0 $
($ S_3 $ represents the third component of the Stokes parameters), which form a
tube like surface centered with the C-line surrounded by L-surfaces in the
presence of the linear as well as the nonlinear birefringence. It is pointed
out that the optical activity (or chirality) plays an ""obstacle"" to reveal the
polarization singularity. As the other aspect, we consider the field theoretic
aspect of the Stokes parameters, for which a special solution, called an
optical skyrmion, is constructed to explicate the polarization singularity.The
skyrmion forms a {tube}, and the dynamical content of which is briefly
discussed. On the basis of the work presented here further analysis would be
expected to reveal hidden aspects of polarization optics.

This paper axiomatizes two closed related and yet different heuristics, narrow
bracketing and correlation neglect, by relaxing the independence axiom in the
expected utility theory. The flexibility of our framework allows for
applications in various economic problems. First, our model can explain the
experimental evidence of narrow bracketing over monetary gambles. Second, when
one source represents background risk, we can accommodate Rabin (2000)'s
critique and explain risk aversion over small gambles. Finally, when different
sources represent consumptions in different periods, we unify three seemingly
distinct models of time preferences and propose a novel model that
simultaneously satisfies indifference to temporal resolution of uncertainty,
separation of time and risk preferences, and recursivity in the domain of
lotteries. As a direct application to macroeconomics and finance, we provide an
alternative to Epstein and Zin (1989) which avoids the unreasonably high timing

Graph structures among time series are found in diverse domains, such as web

been recent progress in graph modeling and in time series forecasting,
respectively, but an expressive and scalable approach for a network of series
does not yet exist. We introduce Radflow, a novel model that embodies three key
ideas: a recurrent neural network to obtain node embeddings that depend on
time, the aggregation of the flow of influence from neighboring nodes with
multi-head attention, and the multi-layer decomposition of time series. Radflow
naturally takes into account dynamic networks where nodes and edges change over
time, and it can be used for prediction and data imputation tasks. On
real-world datasets ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand nodes,
we observe that Radflow variants are the best performing model across a wide
range of settings. The recurrent component in Radflow also outperforms N-BEATS,
the state-of-the-art time series model. We show that Radflow can learn
different trends and seasonal patterns, that it is robust to missing nodes and
edges, and that correlated temporal patterns among network neighbors reflect
influence strength. We curate WikiTraffic, the largest dynamic network of time
series with 366K nodes and 22M time-dependent links spanning five years. This
dataset provides an open benchmark for developing models in this area, with
applications that include optimizing resources for the web. More broadly,
Radflow has the potential to improve forecasts in correlated time series
networks such as the stock market, and impute missing measurements in
geographically dispersed networks of natural phenomena.

contrast, the low- and intermediate-mass XRB XLFs, as well as the total XLF of

Our method suggests a non-negligible contribution from low- and possibly
intermediate-mass XRBs to the total XRB XLF of M83, i.e. between 20 and 50%, in
broad agreement with X-ray based XLFs. More generally, we caution against

shape students' approaches to problem solving and learning. Physics education
research recommends grading practices that encourage students to provide
evidence of understanding via explication of the problem-solving process.
However, TAs may not necessarily grade in a manner that encourages students to
provide evidence of understanding in their solutions. Within the context of a
semester-long TA professional development course, we investigated whether
encouraging TAs to use a grading rubric that appropriately weights the
problem-solving process and having them reflect upon the benefits of using such
a rubric prompts TAs to require evidence of understanding in student solutions.
We examined how the TAs graded realistic student solutions to introductory
physics problems before they were provided a rubric, whether TAs used the
rubric as intended, whether they were consistent in grading similar solutions,
and how TAs' grading criteria changed after discussing the benefits of a
well-designed rubric. We find that many TAs typically applied the rubric
consistently when grading similar student solutions but did not require
students to provide evidence of understanding. TAs' written responses, class
discussions, and individual interviews suggest that the instructional
activities involving the grading rubrics in this study were not sufficient to
change their grading practices. Interviews and class discussions suggest that
helping TAs value a rubric that appropriately weights the problem-solving
process may be challenging partly due to the TAs past educational experiences

tasks. They have wide applications in different areas such as economics,
digital health, business process management and IT infrastructure monitoring.
Timestamped event sequences contain ordered events which carry at least two
attributes: the event's label and its timestamp. Suffix and remaining time
prediction are about obtaining the most likely continuation of event labels and
the remaining time until the sequence finishes, respectively. Recent deep
learning-based works for such predictions are prone to potentially large
prediction errors because of closed-loop training (i.e., the next event is
conditioned on the ground truth of previous events) and open-loop inference
(i.e., the next event is conditioned on previously predicted events). In this
work, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture for open-loop training to
advance the suffix and remaining time prediction of event sequences. To capture
the joint temporal dynamics of events, we harness the power of adversarial
learning techniques to boost prediction performance. We consider four real-life
datasets and three baselines in our experiments. The results show improvements
up to four times compared to the state of the art in suffix and remaining time
prediction of event sequences, specifically in the realm of business process
executions. We also show that the obtained improvements of adversarial training
are superior compared to standard training under the same experimental setup.

replace problematic, habituated voice production mechanics with optimal voice
production technique(s), yielding improved voice quality. However, treatment
often fails because patients have difficulty differentiating their habitual
voice from the target technique independently, when clinician feedback is
unavailable between therapy sessions. Therefore, with the long term aim to
extend clinician feedback to extra-clinical settings, we built two systems that
automatically differentiate various voice qualities produced by the same
individual. We hypothesized that 1) a system based on i-vectors could classify
these qualities as if they represent different speakers and 2) such a system
would outperform one based on traditional voice signal processing algorithms.
Training recordings were provided by thirteen amateur actors, each producing 5
perceptually different voice qualities in connected speech: normal, breathy,
fry, twang, and hyponasal. As hypothesized, the i-vector system outperformed
the acoustic measure system in classification accuracy (i.e. 97.5\% compared to
77.2\%, respectively). Findings are expected because the i-vector system maps
features to an integrated space which better represents each voice quality than
the 22-feature space of the baseline system. Therefore, an i-vector based

However, the limited vaccine capacity creates another massive challenge: how to
distribute vaccines to mitigate the near-end impact of the pandemic? In the
United States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching mass
vaccination sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where to
locate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign.
This paper tackles this question with a novel data-driven approach to optimize
COVID-19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state-of-the-art
epidemiological model, called DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinations
and the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We then integrate
this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location of
vaccination sites and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated as
a bilinear, non-convex optimization model. To solve it, we propose a coordinate
descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution and
simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based on
demographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approach
increases the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by an estimated $20\%$,
saving an extra $4000$ extra lives in the United States over a three-month
period. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives -- by
reducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurting
others -- and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors -- by
achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.

  Our approach is based on the polynomial partitioning technique.
  For example, our ray-shooting algorithm processes a set of $n$ triangles in
$R^3$ into a data structure for answering ray shooting queries amid the given
triangles, which uses $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ storage and preprocessing, and
answers a query in $O(n^{1/2+\varepsilon})$ time, for any $\varepsilon>0$. This
is a significant improvement over known results, obtained more than 25 years

$n^{5/8}$. The algorithms for the other problems have similar performance
bounds, with similar improvements over previous results.

adopted in deep learning as well as convex optimization. In practice, the last
iterate is commonly used as the final solution to make decisions. However, the
available regret analysis and the setting of constant momentum parameters only
guarantee the optimal convergence of the averaged solution. In this paper, we
fill this theory-practice gap by investigating the convergence of the last
iterate (referred to as individual convergence), which is a more difficult task
than convergence analysis of the averaged solution. Specifically, in the
constrained convex cases, we prove that the adaptive Polyak's Heavy-ball (HB)
method, in which only the step size is updated using the exponential moving
average strategy, attains an optimal individual convergence rate of
$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$, as opposed to the optimality of $O(\frac{\log t}{\sqrt

shows how the HB momentum and its time-varying weight help us to achieve the
acceleration in convex optimization but also gives valuable hints how the
momentum parameters should be scheduled in deep learning. Empirical results on
optimizing convex functions and training deep networks validate the correctness
of our convergence analysis and demonstrate the improved performance of the

we can consider the signal model, where the signal is composed of the

the soft-decision input to the main decoder is the innovation, we show that the
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in estimating the binary input is expressed in
terms of the distribution of the encoded block for the main decoder. It is
shown that the obtained MMSE satisfies indirectly the known relation between
the mutual information and the MMSE in Gaussian channels. Thus the derived MMSE

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-person pose estimation is a fundamental and challenging problem to many
computer vision tasks. Most existing methods can be broadly categorized into
two classes: top-down and bottom-up methods. Both of the two types of methods
involve two stages, namely, person detection and joints detection.
Conventionally, the two stages are implemented separately without considering
their interactions between them, and this may inevitably cause some issue
intrinsically. In this paper, we present a novel method to simplify the
pipeline by implementing person detection and joints detection simultaneously.
We propose a Double Embedding (DE) method to complete the multi-person pose
estimation task in a global-to-local way. DE consists of Global Embedding (GE)
and Local Embedding (LE). GE encodes different person instances and processes
information covering the whole image and LE encodes the local limbs
information. GE functions for the person detection in top-down strategy while
LE connects the rest joints sequentially which functions for joint grouping and
information processing in A bottom-up strategy. Based on LE, we design the
Mutual Refine Machine (MRM) to reduce the prediction difficulty in complex
scenarios. MRM can effectively realize the information communicating between
keypoints and further improve the accuracy. We achieve the competitive results
on benchmarks MSCOCO, MPII and CrowdPose, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalization ability of our method.

MAXI, NICER, and NuSTAR. The source flux increased for $\sim 10^3$ s after the
discovery, decayed rapidly over $\sim$ 5 orders of magnitude in 5 days, and
then remained almost constant over 9 months. Large-amplitude short-term
variations on time scales of 1--$10^4$ s were observed throughout the decay. In
the initial flux rise, the source showed a hard power-law shaped spectrum with
a photon index of $\sim 1.0$ extending up to $\sim 30$ keV, above which an
exponential cutoff was present. The photon index increased in the following
rapid decay and became $\sim 2$ at the end of the decay. A spectral absorption
feature at 3--4 keV was detected in the decay. It is not straightforward to
explain all the observed properties by any known class of X-ray sources. We
discuss the possible nature of the source, including a Galactic low mass X-ray
binary with multiple extreme properties and a tidal disruption event by a
supermassive black hole or a Galactic neutron star.

research on factor 1 (characteristics of instruction and learning tools), there
has been less focus on factor 2 (students' characteristics, and in particular,
motivational factors). Here, we focus on the baseline motivational
characteristics of introductory physics students obtained from survey data to
inform factor 2 of the framework. A longitudinal analysis of students'
motivational characteristics in two-semester introductory physics courses was
performed by administering pre- and post-surveys that evaluated students'
self-efficacy, grit, fascination with physics, value associated with physics,
intelligence mindset, and physics epistemology. Female students reported lower
self-efficacy, fascination and value, and had a more ""fixed"" view of
intelligence in the context of physics compared to male students. Grit was the
only factor on which female students reported averages that were equal to or
higher than male students throughout introductory physics courses. These gender
differences can at least partly be attributed to the societal stereotypes and
biases about who belongs in physics and can excel in it. The findings inform
the framework and have implications for the development and implementation of

that traveling waves in a singularly perturbed woodpile chain have a single

solitary waves in diatomic Hertzian chains without precompression. Comparing

low-dimensional systems by fabricating ultrathin films, quantum wires, or
quantum dots with flat interfaces. Some experiments have been performed on
ultrathin compounds of strongly correlated electron systems. However, since it
is technically difficult to control multiple elements precisely, most of the
properties of artificially fabricated low-dimensional compounds fall into
uncharted territory. Here we show that extraordinary metal-insulator
transitions that oscillate depending on the scale occur in CaRuO_3 films with a
thickness of around several unit cells. We grow high-crystalline CaRuO_3
ultrathin films, whose surface roughness is controlled at 199 pm, by molecular
beam epitaxy. We observe that resistivity oscillates with a magic thickness of
25 {\AA}, which changes by 3 and 9 orders of magnitude at room temperature and
at low temperature, respectively. These changes are much larger than quantum
size effects. We also confirm the same periodicity with photoelectron
spectroscopy by etching the ultrathin film. Considering the large energy,
periodicity and anisotropy, we conclude that the oscillating transitions
originate from the commensurability of Mott insulation triggered by Peierls
instability arising from a dual restriction on the dimensions in wavenumber
space and real space. We have shown the possibility of producing new functional
materials by controlling film thickness on electron correlated compounds at the

deceleration planning system (EDPS), which aims to maximize energy recuperation
of regenerative braking of connected and autonomous electrified vehicles. A
recuperation energy-optimal speed profile is computed based on the impending
deceleration requirements for turning or stopping at an intersection. This is
computed to maximize the regenerative braking energy while satisfying the
physical limits of an electrified powertrain. In automated driving, the
powertrain of an electrified vehicle can be directly controlled by the vehicle
control unit such that it follows the computed optimal speed profile. To obtain
smooth optimal deceleration speed profiles, optimal deceleration commands are
determined by a parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model that is
obtained by regression analyses with real vehicle driving test data. The
parameters are dependent on preview information such as residual time and
distance as well as target speed. The key design parameter is deceleration
time, which determines the deceleration speed profile to satisfy the residual
time and distance constraints as well as the target speed requirement. The
bounds of deceleration commands corresponding to the physical limits of the
powertrain are deduced from realistic deceleration test driving. The state
constraints are dynamically updated by considering the anticipated road load
and the deceleration preference. For validation and comparisons of the EDPS
with different preview distances, driving simulation tests with a virtual road
environment and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity are presented. It is
shown that the longer preview distance in the EDPS, the more
energy-recuperation. In comparison with driver-in-the-loop simulation tests,
EDPS-based autonomous driving shows improvements in energy recuperation and
reduction in trip time.

networks on the adversarial variants generated by their natural data. However,
as the training progresses, the training data becomes less and less attackable,
undermining the robustness enhancement. A straightforward remedy is to
incorporate more training data, but sometimes incurring an unaffordable cost.
In this paper, to mitigate this issue, we propose the guided interpolation
framework (GIF): in each epoch, the GIF employs the previous epoch's meta
information to guide the data's interpolation. Compared with the vanilla mixup,
the GIF can provide a higher ratio of attackable data, which is beneficial to
the robustness enhancement; it meanwhile mitigates the model's linear behavior
between classes, where the linear behavior is favorable to generalization but
not to the robustness. As a result, the GIF encourages the model to predict
invariantly in the cluster of each class. Experiments demonstrate that the GIF
can indeed enhance adversarial robustness on various adversarial training
methods and various datasets.

'ethics' currently deployed (Wagner 2018) in determining whether AI is 'good'
given the limitations of ethics as a frame through which AI issues can be
viewed. In order to circumvent these limits, we use instead the language and
conceptualisation of 'Good Data', as a more expansive term to elucidate the
values, rights and interests at stake when it comes to AI's development and
deployment, as well as that of other digital technologies. Good Data
considerations move beyond recurring themes of data protection/privacy and the
FAT (fairness, transparency and accountability) movement to include explicit
political economy critiques of power. Instead of yet more ethics principles
(that tend to say the same or similar things anyway), we offer four 'pillars'
on which Good Data AI can be built: community, rights, usability and politics.
Overall we view AI's 'goodness' as an explicly political (economy) question of
power and one which is always related to the degree which AI is created and
used to increase the wellbeing of society and especially to increase the power
of the most marginalized and disenfranchised. We offer recommendations and
remedies towards implementing 'better' approaches towards AI. Our strategies
enable a different (but complementary) kind of evaluation of AI as part of the
broader socio-technical systems in which AI is built and deployed.

and continuously covered by two high-cadence surveys. The light-curve modeling
indicates that the anomalies are generated by source crossings over the
planetary caustics induced by planetary companions to the hosts. The estimated
planet/host separation (scaled to the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$)
and mass ratio are $(s, q) = (1.81, 1.24\times10^{-3})$ and $(s, q) = (1.25,

never appeared in the training data, has arisen hot research interests. The key
of implementing ZSL is to leverage the prior knowledge of classes which builds
the semantic relationship between classes and enables the transfer of the
learned models (e.g., features) from training classes (i.e., seen classes) to
unseen classes. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods are
relatively limited with incomplete semantics. In this paper, we explore richer
and more competitive prior knowledge to model the inter-class relationship for
ZSL via ontology-based knowledge representation and semantic embedding.
Meanwhile, to address the data imbalance between seen classes and unseen
classes, we developed a generative ZSL framework with Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs). Our main findings include: (i) an ontology-enhanced ZSL
framework that can be applied to different domains, such as image
classification (IMGC) and knowledge graph completion (KGC); (ii) a
comprehensive evaluation with multiple zero-shot datasets from different
domains, where our method often achieves better performance than the
state-of-the-art models. In particular, on four representative ZSL baselines of
IMGC, the ontology-based class semantics outperform the previous priors e.g.,
the word embeddings of classes by an average of 12.4 accuracy points in the
standard ZSL across two example datasets (see Figure 4).

is seen, often highly variable and associated with outbursts in the optical and
X-rays. Most models of the radio emission include an ionized region within the
dense wind of the red giant star, that is kept ionized by activity on the white
dwarf companion or its accretion disk. In some cases there is on-going shell
burning on the white dwarf due to its high mass accretion rate or a prior nova
eruption, in other cases nuclear fusion occurs only occasionally as recurrent
nova events. In this study we measure the spectral indices of a sample of
symbiotic systems in the Southern Hemisphere using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array. Putting our data together with results from other surveys, we
derive the optical depths and brightness temperatures of some well-known
symbiotic stars. Using parallax distances from Gaia Data Release 3, we
determine the sizes and characteristic electron densities in the radio emission

a factor of 100 in linear size. These numbers are consistent with a picture
where the rate of shell burning on the white dwarf determines the radio
luminosity. Therefore, our findings also suggest that radio luminosity can be
used to determine whether a symbiotic star is powered by accretion alone or
also by shell burning.

two related models of random hypergraphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. In the
first (edge-independent) model, a random hypergraph $H_1$ is constructed by
fixing a parameter $p$ and allowing each of the $n$ vertices to join each of
the $m$ edges independently with probability $p$. In the parameter range in
which $pn \rightarrow \infty$ and $pm \rightarrow \infty$, we show that with
high probability (w.h.p.) $H_1$ has discrepancy at least $\Omega(2^{-n/m}
\sqrt{pn})$ when $m = O(n)$, and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{pn \log\gamma })$ when
$m \gg n$, where $\gamma = \min\{ m/n, pn\}$. In the second (edge-dependent)
model, $d$ is fixed and each vertex of $H_2$ independently joins exactly $d$
edges uniformly at random. We obtain analogous results for this model by
generalizing the techniques used for the edge-independent model with $p=d/m$.
Namely, for $d \rightarrow \infty$ and $dn/m \rightarrow \infty$, we prove that
w.h.p. $H_{2}$ has discrepancy at least $\Omega(2^{-n/m} \sqrt{dn/m})$ when $m
= O(n)$, and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{(dn/m) \log\gamma})$ when $m \gg n$, where
$\gamma =\min\{m/n, dn/m\}$. Furthermore, we obtain nearly matching asymptotic
upper bounds on the discrepancy in both models (when $p=d/m$), in the dense
regime of $m \gg n$. Specifically, we apply the partial colouring lemma of
Lovett and Meka to show that w.h.p. $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ each have discrepancy
$O( \sqrt{dn/m} \log(m/n))$, provided $d \rightarrow \infty$, $d n/m
\rightarrow \infty$ and $m \gg n$. This result is algorithmic, and together
with the work of Bansal and Meka characterizes how the discrepancy of each
random hypergraph model transitions from $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$ to $o(\sqrt{d})$ as
$m$ varies from $m=\Theta(n)$ to $m \gg n$.

Commonly existing methods are first trying to localize object regions, then

lengthy to run. This work aims to solve this detect-and-read problem in a
lightweight way by integrating multi-digit recognition into a one-stage object

feature extraction (one for localizing, one again for classifying) but also
provides useful contextual information around object regions for

architecture, loss function, data augmentation and training make the method
robust, efficient and speedy. Secondly, we made a public benchmark dataset of
diverse real-life 1D barcodes for a reliable evaluation, which we collected,
annotated and checked carefully. Eventually, experimental results prove the
method's efficiency on the barcode problem by outperforming industrial tools in
both detecting and decoding rates with a real-time fps at a VGA-similar

genomic research, and hence to pave the way towards personalized genomic

differential privacy (LDP) for privacy-preserving sharing of correlated data
and propose a genomic data sharing mechanism under this privacy definition. We
first show that the original definition of LDP is not suitable for genomic data
sharing, and then we propose a new mechanism to share genomic data. The
proposed mechanism considers the correlations in data during data sharing,
eliminates statistically unlikely data values beforehand, and adjusts the
probability distributions for each shared data point accordingly. By doing so,
we show that we can avoid an attacker from inferring the correct values of the
shared data points by utilizing the correlations in the data. By adjusting the
probability distributions of the shared states of each data point, we also
improve the utility of shared data for the data collector. Furthermore, we
develop a greedy algorithm that strategically identifies the processing order
of the shared data points with the aim of maximizing the utility of the shared
data. Considering the interdependent privacy risks while sharing genomic data,
we also analyze the information gain of an attacker about genomes of a donor's
family members by observing perturbed data of the genome donor and we propose a
mechanism to select the privacy budget (i.e., $\epsilon$ parameter of LDP) of
the donor by also considering privacy preferences of her family members. Our
evaluation results on a real-life genomic dataset show the superiority of the
proposed mechanism compared to the randomized response mechanism (a widely used

transportation system due to its environmental and energy sustainability.
However, in many large cities, EV drivers often fail to find the proper spots
for charging, because of the limited charging infrastructures and the
spatiotemporally unbalanced charging demands. Indeed, the recent emergence of
deep reinforcement learning provides great potential to improve the charging
experience from various aspects over a long-term horizon. In this paper, we
propose a framework, named Multi-Agent Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning
(Master), for intelligently recommending public accessible charging stations by
jointly considering various long-term spatiotemporal factors. Specifically, by
regarding each charging station as an individual agent, we formulate this
problem as a multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning task. We first
develop a multi-agent actor-critic framework with the centralized attentive
critic to coordinate the recommendation between geo-distributed agents.
Moreover, to quantify the influence of future potential charging competition,
we introduce a delayed access strategy to exploit the knowledge of future
charging competition during training. After that, to effectively optimize
multiple learning objectives, we extend the centralized attentive critic to
multi-critics and develop a dynamic gradient re-weighting strategy to
adaptively guide the optimization direction. Finally, extensive experiments on

the adversarial search with different norms results in disparately structured

structure-enhancing algorithms. These new structures for adversarial examples
might provide challenges for provable and empirical robust mechanisms. Because
adversarial robustness is still an empirical field, defense mechanisms should
also reasonably be evaluated against differently structured attacks. Besides,
these structured adversarial perturbations may allow for larger distortions
size than their $\ell_p$ counter-part while remaining imperceptible or
perceptible as natural distortions of the image. We will demonstrate in this

recursive procedure to compute the weight distribution that arises in
successive cancellation decoding of polar codes along any decoding path. This
solves the open problem recently posed by Polyanskaya, Davletshin, and
Polyanskii. Using this recursive procedure, at code length n, we can compute
the weight distribution of any polar cosets in time O(n^2). We show that any
polar code can be represented as a disjoint union of such polar cosets;
moreover, this representation extends to polar codes with dynamically frozen
bits. However, the number of polar cosets in such representation scales
exponentially with a parameter introduced herein, which we call the mixing
factor. To upper bound the complexity of our algorithm for polar codes being
decreasing monomial codes, we study the range of their mixing factors. We prove
that among all decreasing monomial codes with rates at most 1/2, self-dual
Reed-Muller codes have the largest mixing factors. To further reduce the
complexity of our algorithm, we make use of the fact that, as decreasing
monomial codes, polar codes have a large automorphism group. That automorphism
group includes the block lower-triangular affine group (BLTA), which in turn
contains the lower-triangular affine group (LTA). We prove that a subgroup of
LTA acts transitively on certain subsets of decreasing monomial codes, thereby
drastically reducing the number of polar cosets that we need to evaluate. This
complexity reduction makes it possible to compute the weight distribution of
polar codes at length n = 128.

batches of training data (typically, ordered triplets) to annotate, in order to
progressively improve a learned model of a metric over some input domain as
rapidly as possible. Standard approaches, which independently assess the
informativeness of each triplet in a batch, are susceptible to highly
correlated batches with many redundant triplets and hence low overall utility.
While a recent work \cite{kumari2020batch} proposes batch-decorrelation
strategies for metric learning, they rely on ad hoc heuristics to estimate the
correlation between two triplets at a time. We present a novel batch active
metric learning method that leverages the Maximum Entropy Principle to learn
the least biased estimate of triplet distribution for a given set of prior
constraints. To avoid redundancy between triplets, our method collectively
selects batches with maximum joint entropy, which simultaneously captures both
informativeness and diversity. We take advantage of the submodularity of the
joint entropy function to construct a tractable solution using an efficient
greedy algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization that is provably
$\left( 1 - \frac{1}{e} \right)$-optimal. Our approach is the first batch
active metric learning method to define a unified score that balances
informativeness and diversity for an entire batch of triplets. Experiments with

crucial for investors to seek maximized profits from the stock market. Many
event-driven methods utilized the events extracted from news, social media, and
discussion board to forecast the stock trend in recent years. However, existing
event-driven methods have two main shortcomings: 1) overlooking the influence
of event information differentiated by the stock-dependent properties; 2)
neglecting the effect of event information from other related stocks. In this
paper, we propose a relational event-driven stock trend forecasting (REST)
framework, which can address the shortcoming of existing methods. To remedy the
first shortcoming, we propose to model the stock context and learn the effect
of event information on the stocks under different contexts. To address the
second shortcoming, we construct a stock graph and design a new propagation
layer to propagate the effect of event information from related stocks. The
experimental studies on the real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of our
REST framework. The results of investment simulation show that our framework
can achieve a higher return of investment than baselines.

sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) mapping using pointer-generator networks that

defense game, in which the intruders' team tries to enter the territory, and a
team of defenders protects the territory by capturing intruders on the
perimeter of the territory. The objective of the defenders is to detect and
capture the intruders before the intruders enter the territory. Each defender
independently senses the intruder and computes his trajectory to capture the
assigned intruders in a cooperative fashion. The intruder is estimated to reach
a specific location on the perimeter at a specific time. Each intruder is
viewed as a spatio-temporal task, and the defenders are assigned to execute
these spatio-temporal tasks. At any given time, the perimeter defense problem
is converted into a Decentralized Multi-UAV Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task
Allocation (DMUST-MTA) problem. The cost of executing a task for a trajectory
is defined by a composite cost function of both the spatial and temporal
components. In this paper, a decentralized consensus-based bundle algorithm has
been modified to solve the spatio-temporal multi-task allocation problem, and
the performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out based on
Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach to solve the perimeter defense game under different
scenarios. Performance comparison with a state-of-the-art centralized approach
with full observability, clearly indicates that DMUST-MTA achieves similar
performance in a decentralized way with partial observability conditions with a
lesser computational time and easy scaling up.

the AP's receive beamforming vectors, and the UEs' energy partition strategies

(BCD) algorithm is first proposed to effectively solve the non-convex TCTB
maximization problem with guaranteed convergence. In order to reduce the
computational complexity and facilitate lightweight online implementation of

architectures. The first one takes channel state information (CSI) as input,
while the second one exploits the UEs' locations only for online inference. The
two data-driven approaches are trained using data samples generated by the BCD
algorithm via supervised learning. Our simulation results reveal a close match

engines do not meet. Third, we quantify the hypothetical economic value of the

$\Xi_b(2S)$, $\Xi_b(1P)$, and $\Xi_b(1D)$ have small decay widths of less than
20 MeV, and these states have good potentials to be observed in the
$\Xi_b^\prime \pi$ and $\Xi_b^{\prime *} \pi$ invariant masses. Further, most
of the $6_F$ multiplets are relatively narrow and may decay into the $\Xi_b
\pi$, $\Xi_b^\prime \pi$, $\Xi_b^{\prime *} \pi$, and $\Lambda_b \bar K$ final
states. Considering the masses and strong decay behaviors, we can assign the
newly observed $\Xi_{b}(6100)$ resonance as the $\Xi_b(1P)$ state with
$J^P=3/2^-$ and interpret the $\Xi_{b}(6227)$ structure as the $J^P=3/2^-$
$\Xi_b^\prime(1P)$ state with a proper mixing angle. We expect that our
predictions for these excited bottom strange baryons will provide helpful
information for future experimental research.

heavy-ion scattering is proven to be due to the refraction of the scattering
wave by a deep, attractive real optical potential. The nuclear rainbow pattern,
established as a broad oscillation of the Airy minima in the elastic cross
section, originates from an interference of the refracted far-side scattering
amplitudes. It is natural to expect a similar rainbow pattern also in the
inelastic scattering of a nucleus-nucleus system that exhibits a pronounced
rainbow pattern in the elastic channel. Although some feature of the nuclear
rainbow in the inelastic nucleus-nucleus scattering was observed in experiment,
the measured inelastic cross sections exhibit much weaker rainbow pattern,
where the Airy oscillation is suppressed and smeared out. To investigate this
effect, a novel method of the near-far decomposition of the inelastic
scattering amplitude is proposed to explicitly reveal the coupled partial-wave
contributions to the inelastic cross section. Using the new decomposition
method, our coupled channel analysis of the elastic and inelastic
$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering at the refractive energies
shows unambiguously that the suppression of the nuclear rainbow pattern in the
inelastic scattering cross section is caused by a destructive interference of
the partial waves of different multipoles. However, the inelastic scattering
remains strongly refractive in these cases, where the far-side scattering is
dominant at medium and large angles like that observed in the elastic
scattering.

language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership
problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms - one is

polyhedra - and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded

generalize the input-output relations extracted from training data. In this
study, we investigated this through experiments with various species of
autoencoders and evaluated their information processing phase with an accurate
kernel-based estimator of mutual information. Given sufficient training data,
vanilla autoencoders demonstrated the compression phase, which was amplified
after imposing sparsity regularization for hidden activities. However, we found
that the compression phase is not universally observed in different species of
autoencoders, including variational autoencoders, that have special constraints
on network weights or manifold of hidden space. These types of autoencoders
exhibited perfect generalization ability for test data without requiring the
compression phase. Thus, we conclude that the compression phase is not
necessary for generalization in representation learning.

contribution is a rendezvous algorithm with an online update rule of the

recursive feasibility. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of

$A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$, is known to be a measure of the sedimentation of BSS in
GCs. In this work, we calculate $A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$ for 11 open clusters (OCs)
using a combined list of main-sequence turn-off stars, sub-giant branch stars,
and red-giant branch stars as reference population. The BSS, the reference
populations, and the cluster members are identified using the proper motions
and parallaxes from the Gaia DR2 data. In a subset of clusters, the BSS are
confirmed cluster members on the basis of radial velocity information available
in the literature. Using the Pearson and Spearman rank correlation
coefficients, we find weak correlations between the estimated values of
$A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$ and other markers of dynamical ages of the clusters, i.e.,
the number of central relaxations a cluster has experienced since its
formation, and the structural parameters of the clusters. Based on statistical
tests, we find that these correlations are similar to the corresponding

language is an Indo-European language spoken by more than 30 million people in
several countries, but due to the lack of speech and text resources, there is
no speech recognition system for this language. To fill this gap, we introduce
the first speech corpus and pronunciation lexicon for the Kurdish language.
Regarding speech corpus, we designed a sentence collection in which the ratio
of di-phones in the collection resembles the real data of the Central Kurdish
language. The designed sentences are uttered by 576 speakers in a controlled
environment with noise-free microphones (called AsoSoft Speech-Office) and in
Telegram social network environment using mobile phones (denoted as AsoSoft
Speech-Crowdsourcing), resulted in 43.68 hours of speech. Besides, a test set
including 11 different document topics is designed and recorded in two
corresponding speech conditions (i.e., Office and Crowdsourcing). Furthermore,
a 60K pronunciation lexicon is prepared in this research in which we faced
several challenges and proposed solutions for them. The Kurdish language has
several dialects and sub-dialects that results in many lexical variations. Our
methods for script standardization of lexical variations and automatic
pronunciation of the lexicon tokens are presented in detail. To setup the
recognition engine, we used the Kaldi toolkit. A statistical tri-gram language
model that is extracted from the AsoSoft text corpus is used in the system.
Several standard recipes including HMM-based models (i.e., mono, tri1, tr2,
tri2, tri3), SGMM, and DNN methods are used to generate the acoustic model.
These methods are trained with AsoSoft Speech-Office and AsoSoft
Speech-Crowdsourcing and a combination of them. The best performance achieved
by the SGMM acoustic model which results in 13.9% of the average word error
rate (on different document topics) and 4.9% for the general topic.

  Robotics",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of trajectory optimization algorithms is to achieve an optimal
collision-free path between a start and goal state. In real-world scenarios
where environments can be complex and non-homogeneous, a robot needs to be able
to gauge whether a state will be in collision with various objects in order to
meet some safety metrics. The collision detector should be computationally
efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and
rapid gradient descent during optimization. However, methods today lack an
elegant approach to detect collision differentiably, relying rather on
numerical gradients that can be unstable. We present DiffCo, the first, fully
auto-differentiable, non-parametric model for collision detection. Its
non-parametric behavior allows one to compute collision boundaries on-the-fly
and update them, requiring no pre-training and allowing it to update
continuously in dynamic environments. It provides robust gradients for
trajectory optimization via backpropagation and is often 10-100x faster to
compute than its geometric counterparts. DiffCo also extends trivially to
modeling different object collision classes for semantically informed
trajectory optimization.

all stakeholders is a reliable and secure connection. Reliability can be

communication technologies in different scenarios. This includes long-range
technologies like DAB+ and cellular networks and short- and medium-range
technologies like ETSI ITS G5 or RFID. Those technologies can only be used if
messages transmitted via the wireless communication links are protected.
Protection not only means encryption but most importantly means to verify if
the data was sent by a legit sender. This is a necessary requirement for a
recipient to trust the data received. In ITS, transmitted data could be used
for user tracing and collection of user data. Therefore, a communication system
should be designed in such a way that personal user data is protected. The user
must be untraceable, but nevertheless able to use all services without
limitations. In this paper, we describe the approach and ideas we took to
design a secure hybrid communication architecture that is at the same time data

second-harmonic generation is enhanced in topological semimetals in general is
a challenging open question because their band structure entangles the
contributions arising from trivial bands and topological band crossings. In
this work, we circumvent this problem by studying RhSi, a chiral topological
semimetal with a simple band structure with topological multifold fermions
close to the Fermi energy. We measure second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a
wide frequency window, $\omega\in [0.27,1.5]$eV and, using first principle
calculations, we establish that, due to their linear dispersion, the
contribution of multifold fermions to SHG is subdominant as compared with other
regions in the Brillouin zone. Our calculations suggest that parts of the bands
where the dispersion is relatively flat contribute significantly to SHG. As a
whole, our results suggest avenues to enhance SHG responses.

dynamical model learning is presented. The dynamical model combines an a priori
known, physically derived, state-space model with a radial basis function
expansion representing unknown system dynamics and inherits properties from
both physical and data-driven modeling. The method uses an extended Kalman
filter approach to jointly estimate the state of the system and learn the
unknown system dynamics, via the parameters of the basis function expansion.
The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a
similar approach with globally supported basis functions. By using compactly
supported radial basis functions and an approximate Kalman gain, the
computational complexity is considerably reduced and is essentially determined
by the support of the basis functions. The approximation works well when the
system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in
the state-space domain. The method is exemplified via two intelligent vehicle
applications where it is shown to: (i) have competitive system dynamics
estimation performance compared to the globally supported basis function
method, and (ii) be real-time applicable to problems with a large-scale

maximize the performance of such teams by grouping workers according to a set

no say in the team formation process. Depriving users of control over who they
will work with stifles creativity, causes psychological discomfort and results
in less-than-optimal collaboration results. In this work, we propose an
alternative model, called Self-Organizing Teams (SOTs), which relies on the
crowd of online workers itself to organize into effective teams. Supported but
not guided by an algorithm, SOTs are a new human-centered computational
structure, which enables participants to control, correct and guide the output
of their collaboration as a collective. Experimental results, comparing SOTs to
two benchmarks that do not offer user agency over the collaboration, reveal
that participants in the SOTs condition produce results of higher quality and
report higher teamwork satisfaction. We also find that, similarly to machine
learning-based self-organization, human SOTs exhibit emergent collective
properties, including the presence of an objective function and the tendency to
form more distinct clusters of compatible teammates.

when these measures represent that the market is more efficient, the volatility

broadcast can collude up to the minimum non-collusion condition to determine
state information of the other non-colluding receivers. We analyse three
resource scenarios for the receivers: receivers can share entanglement without
classically communicating, can just use classical communication, or have both
entanglement and classical communication. Using results from secure multi-party
communication, we find that when the receivers can share entanglement and
communicate classically, they can receive messages from the sender at a
non-zero rate with verifiable secure collaboration. In the entanglement only
case a positive capacity is not possible. In the classical communication case,
a non-zero rate of communication is achievable but the communication complexity

elucidate this relaxation asymmetry for discrete-state Markovian systems

Depending on the magnitude of the energy gap, heating can be faster or slower
than cooling, irrespective of the transition rates between states. Our results
clarify the relaxation asymmetry for discrete-state systems and reveal several
hidden features inherent in thermal relaxation.

the screening of electric charge on the surface of porous electrodes by ions in
an adjacent electrolyte. This so-called electric double layer (EDL) exhibits an
intricate interplay with the electrolyte's temperature that was the focus of
several recent studies. In one of them, Janssen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119,
166002 (2017)] experimentally determined the ratio
$\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ of reversible eat flowing into a
supercapacitor during an isothermal charging process and the electric work
applied therein. To rationalize that data, here, we determine
$\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ within different models of the EDL using
theoretical approaches like density functional theory (DFT) as well as
molecular dynamics simulations. Applying mainly the restricted primitive model,
we find quantitative support for a speculation of Janssen et al. that steric
ion interactions are key to the ratio $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$.
Here, we identified the entropic contribution of certain DFT functionals, which
grants direct access to the reversible heat. We further demonstrate how
$\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ changes when calculated in different
thermodynamic ensembles and processes. We show that the experiments of Janssen
et al. are explained best by a charging process at fixed bulk density, or in a
""semi-canonical"" system. Finally, we find that
$\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ significantly depends on parameters as
pore and ion size, salt concentration, and valencies of the cat- and anions of
the electrolyte. Our findings can guide further heat production measurements
and can be applied in studies on, for instance, nervous conduction, where
reversible heat is a key element.

computation of retractions on the orthogonal manifold always involves some

attracts it towards the manifold. One iteration of the landing algorithm only
involves matrix multiplications, which makes it cheap compared to its

of candidates in such elections, standard algorithms for classical sequential
voting rules (such as those proposed by Thiele and Phragm\'en) are rendered

establish algorithmic results and axiomatic guarantees that go beyond those
obtainable in the general multiwinner setting. Assuming that approvals are
symmetric, we show that proportional approval voting (PAV), a well-established

computable, and its sequential variant (seq-PAV), which does not provide any
proportionality guarantees in general, fulfills a rather strong guarantee known

grand-canonical partition function of the hard-sphere model in $d$ dimensions.
Up to a fugacity of $\lambda < \text{e}/2^d$, the runtime of our algorithm is
polynomial in the volume of the system. This covers the entire known

  Key to our approach is to define a discretization that closely approximates

challenging because performance may drop significantly after quantization.
Prior arts often discretize the network weights by carefully tuning
hyper-parameters of quantization (e.g. non-uniform stepsize and layer-wise
bitwidths), which are complicated and sub-optimal because the full-precision
and low-precision models have a large discrepancy. This work presents a novel
quantization pipeline, Frequency-Aware Transformation (FAT), which has several
appealing benefits. (1) Rather than designing complicated quantizers like
existing works, FAT learns to transform network weights in the frequency domain
before quantization, making them more amenable to training in low bitwidth. (2)
With FAT, CNNs can be easily trained in low precision using simple standard
quantizers without tedious hyper-parameter tuning. Theoretical analysis shows
that FAT improves both uniform and non-uniform quantizers. (3) FAT can be
easily plugged into many CNN architectures. When training ResNet-18 and

multi-task visual perception network on unrectified fisheye images to enable
the vehicle to sense its surrounding environment. It consists of six primary
tasks necessary for an autonomous driving system: depth estimation, visual
odometry, semantic segmentation, motion segmentation, object detection, and
lens soiling detection. We demonstrate that the jointly trained model performs
better than the respective single task versions. Our multi-task model has a
shared encoder providing a significant computational advantage and has
synergized decoders where tasks support each other. We propose a novel camera
geometry based adaptation mechanism to encode the fisheye distortion model both
at training and inference. This was crucial to enable training on the WoodScape
dataset, comprised of data from different parts of the world collected by 12
different cameras mounted on three different cars with different intrinsics and
viewpoints. Given that bounding boxes is not a good representation for
distorted fisheye images, we also extend object detection to use a polygon with
non-uniformly sampled vertices. We additionally evaluate our model on standard
automotive datasets, namely KITTI and Cityscapes. We obtain the
state-of-the-art results on KITTI for depth estimation and pose estimation
tasks and competitive performance on the other tasks. We perform extensive
ablation studies on various architecture choices and task weighting

ultraluminous X-ray source, M51 ULX-7, with the archival Changra observations.
With ~20 days of monitoring in the superorbital descending state, we discovered
three dips with separations of ~2 and ~8 days via the Bayesian block technique.
A phase-dispersion minimization and a $\chi^2$ test suggest that the dip is
likely recurrent with a period of ~2 days, consistent with the orbital period
of M51 ULX-7. We interpret the dip as an obscuring of the emission from the
pulsar by the vertical structure on the stream-disk interaction region or the
atmosphere of the companion star. Both interpretations suggest the viewing
angle to be ~60 degrees. Given that the magnetic field of M51 ULX-7 is
moderately high, $B\sim10^{13}$ G, low geometric beaming with $b\lesssim1/2$ is
sufficient to explain the observed flux and the presence of dips. Obscuration
of the stellar wind remains an alternative possible origin and further
monitoring of the dips will be required.

Spatial path index modulation (SPIM) is helpful in improving this gain by
utilizing additional signal bits modulated by the indices of spatial paths. In
this paper, we introduce model-based and model-free frameworks for beamformer
design in multi-user SPIM-MIMO systems. We first design the beamformers via
model-based manifold optimization algorithm. Then, we leverage federated
learning (FL) with dropout learning (DL) to train a learning model on the local
dataset of users, who estimate the beamformers by feeding the model with their
channel data. The DL randomly selects different set of model parameters during
training, thereby further reducing the transmission overhead compared to
conventional FL. Numerical experiments show that the proposed framework
exhibits higher spectral efficiency than the state-of-the-art SPIM-MIMO methods
and mmWave-MIMO, which relies on the strongest propagation path. Furthermore,
the proposed FL approach provides at least 10 times lower transmission overhead

on the suitable modeling of debris dynamics for a simple (but accurate enough)
assessment of damages. For different reasons including computational
performance and Big Data management issues, we focus our research on Eulerian
debris flow modeling. Rather than using complex multiphase debris models, we
rather use an empirical transportation and deposition model that takes into
account the interaction with the main water flow, friction/contact with the
ground but also debris interaction. In particular, for debris interaction, we
have used ideas coming from vehicular traffic flow modeling. We introduce a
velocity regularization term similar to the so-called ``anticipation term'' in
traffic flow modeling that takes into account the local flow between
neighboring debris and makes the problem mathematically well-posed. It prevents
from the generation of ``Dirac measures of debris'' at shock waves. As a
result, the model is able to capture emerging phenomenons like debris
aggregation and accumulations, and possibly to react on the main flow by
creating hills of debris and make the main stream deviate. We also discuss the
way to derive quantities of interest (QoI), especially ``damage functions''
from the debris density and momentum fields. We believe that this original
unexplored debris approach can lead to a valuable analysis of tsunami flooding
damage assessment with Physics-based damage functions. Numerical experiments
show the nice behaviour of the numerical solvers, including the solution of

transportable and envisioned space-based optical clocks. We proved earlier that
the 1.14um inner-shell magnetic dipole transition in neutral thulium possesses
very low blackbody radiation shift compared to other neutrals. Here we
demonstrate operation of a bi-colour thulium optical clock with extraordinary
low sensitivity to the Zeeman shift due to a simultaneous interrogation of two
clock transitions and data processing. Our experiment shows suppression of the
quadratic Zeeman shift by at least three orders of magnitude. The effect of
tensor lattice Stark shift can be also reduced to below 10-18 in fractional
frequency units. All these features make thulium optical clock almost free from
hard-to-control systematic shifts. Together with convenient cooling and
trapping laser wavelengths, it provides great perspectives for thulium lattice
clock as a high-performance transportable system.

that compete for the small buffer space in data-center switches. Such
applications require a short flow completion time (FCT) to perform their jobs
effectively. However, TCP is oblivious to the composite nature of application
data and artificially inflates the FCT of such flows by several orders of
magnitude. This is due to TCP's Internet-centric design that fixes the
retransmission timeout (RTO) to be at least hundreds of milliseconds. To better
understand this problem, in this paper, we use empirical measurements in a
small testbed to study, at a microscopic level, the effects of various types of
packet losses on TCP's performance. In particular, we single out packet losses
that impact the tail end of small flows, as well as bursty losses, that span a
significant fraction of the small congestion window of TCP flows in
data-centers, to show a non-negligible effect on the FCT. Based on this, we
propose the so-called, timely-retransmitted ACKs (or T-RACKs), a simple loss
recovery mechanism to conceal the drawbacks of the long RTO even in the
presence of heavy packet losses. Interestingly enough, T-RACKS achieves this
transparently to TCP itself as it does not require any change to TCP in the
tenant's virtual machine (VM). T-RACKs can be implemented as a software shim
layer in the hypervisor between the VMs and server's NIC or in hardware as a
networking function in a SmartNIC. Simulation and real testbed results show
that T-RACKs achieves remarkable performance improvements.

Cell stiffness is one of the fundamental mechanical properties of the cell and

prestress, and cytoskeleton structure. Herein, we propose a novel holographic
single-cell stiffness measurement technique that can obtain the stiffness
distribution over a cell membrane at high resolution and in real-time. The
proposed imaging method coupled with acoustic signals allows us to assess the
cell stiffness distribution with a low error margin and label-free manner. We
demonstrate the proposed technique on HCT116 (Human Colorectal Carcinoma) cells
and CTC-mimicked HCT116 cells by induction with transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-\b{eta}). Validation studies of the proposed approach were carried out on
certified polystyrene microbeads with known stiffness levels. Its performance
was evaluated in comparison with the AFM results obtained for the relevant
cells. When the experimental results were examined, the proposed methodology
shows utmost performance over average cell stiffness values for HCT116, and
CTC-mimicked HCT116 cells were found as 1.08 kPa, and 0.88 kPa, respectively.
The results confirm that CTC-mimicked HCT116 cells lose their adhesion ability
to enter the vascular circulation and metastasize. They also exhibit a softer
stiffness profile compared to adherent forms of the cancer cells. Hence, the
proposed technique is a significant, reliable, and faster alternative for
in-vitro cell stiffness characterization tools. It can be utilized for various
applications where single-cell analysis is required, such as disease modeling,

smallest number of monochromatic combinatorial rectangles needed to cover the
$1$-entries of $A$. In 1988, de Caen, Gregory, and Pullman asked if the Boolean
rank of the Kronecker product $C_n \otimes C_n$ is strictly smaller than the
square of $R_\mathbb{B}(C_n)$, where $C_n$ is the $n \times n$ matrix with
zeros on the diagonal and ones everywhere else (Carib. Conf. Comb. & Comp.,
1988). A positive answer was given by Watts for $n=4$ (Linear Alg. and its
Appl., 2001). A result of Karchmer, Kushilevitz, and Nisan, motivated by
direct-sum questions in non-deterministic communication complexity, implies
that the Boolean rank of $C_n \otimes C_n$ grows linearly in that of $C_n$
(SIAM J. Disc. Math., 1995), and thus $R_\mathbb{B}(C_n \otimes C_n) <
R_\mathbb{B}(C_n)^2$ for every sufficiently large $n$. Their proof relies on a
probabilistic argument.
  In this work, we present a general method for proving upper bounds on the
Boolean rank of Kronecker products of $0,1$-matrices. We use it to
affirmatively settle the question of de Caen et al. for all integers $n \geq
7$. We further provide an explicit construction of a cover of $C_n \otimes
C_n$, whose number of rectangles nearly matches the optimal asymptotic bound.
Our method for proving upper bounds on the Boolean rank of Kronecker products
might find applications in different settings as well. We express its potential
applicability by extending it to the wider framework of spanoids, recently
introduced by Dvir, Gopi, Gu, and Wigderson (SIAM J. Comput., 2020).

hierarchies depend on the decomposition of field representations under the

vicinity of symmetric points, for the four smallest finite modular groups,

  International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2021)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern programming follows the continuous integration (CI) and continuous
deployment (CD) approach rather than the traditional waterfall model. Even the
development of modern programming languages uses the CI/CD approach to swiftly
provide new language features and to adapt to new development environments.
Unlike in the conventional approach, in the modern CI/CD approach, a language
specification is no more the oracle of the language semantics because both the
specification and its implementations can co-evolve. In this setting, both the
specification and implementations may have bugs, and guaranteeing their
correctness is non-trivial.
  In this paper, we propose a novel N+1-version differential testing to resolve
the problem. Unlike the traditional differential testing, our approach consists
of three steps: 1) to automatically synthesize programs guided by the syntax
and semantics from a given language specification, 2) to generate conformance
tests by injecting assertions to the synthesized programs to check their final
program states, 3) to detect bugs in the specification and implementations via
executing the conformance tests on multiple implementations, and 4) to localize
bugs on the specification using statistical information. We actualize our
approach for the JavaScript programming language via JEST, which performs
N+1-version differential testing for modern JavaScript engines and ECMAScript,
the language specification describing the syntax and semantics of JavaScript in
a natural language. We evaluated JEST with four JavaScript engines that support
all modern JavaScript language features and the latest version of ECMAScript
(ES11, 2020). JEST automatically synthesized 1,700 programs that covered 97.78%
of syntax and 87.70% of semantics from ES11. Using the assertion-injection, it
detected 44 engine bugs in four engines and 27 specification bugs in ES11.

deformations, such as translations, rotations and dilations as uniform vectors,
called multivectors. In this work, we demonstrate the merits of multivector
usage with a novel, integrated rigged character simulation framework based on
CGA. In such a framework, and for the first time, one may perform real-time
cuts and tears as well as drill holes on a rigged 3D model. These operations
can be performed before and/or after model animation, while maintaining
deformation topology. Moreover, our framework permits generation of
intermediate keyframes on-the-fly based on user input, apart from the frames
provided in the model data. We are motivated to use CGA as it is the
lowest-dimension extension of dual-quaternion algebra that amends the
shortcomings of the majority of existing animation and deformation techniques.
Specifically, we no longer need to maintain objects of multiple algebras and
constantly transmute between them, such as matrices, quaternions and
dual-quaternions, and we can effortlessly apply dilations. Using such an
all-in-one geometric framework allows for better maintenance and optimization
and enables easier interpolation and application of all native deformations.
Furthermore, we present these three novel algorithms in a single CGA
representation which enables cutting, tearing and drilling of the input rigged
model, where the output model can be further re-deformed in interactive frame
rates. These close to real-time cut,tear and drill algorithms can enable a new
suite of applications, especially under the scope of a medical VR simulation.

understood with considerations of nonlocal and quantum effects, which pose a
hurdle to conceptualize the physics with a picture of eigenmodes. Here we first
propose a generalized Lorentz model to describe general nonlocal media under
linear mean-field approximation and formulate source-free Maxwell's equations
as a linear eigenvalue problem to define the quasinormal modes. Then we
introduce an orthonormalization scheme for the modes and establish a canonical
quasinormal mode framework for general nonlocal media. Explicit formalisms for
metals described by quantum hydrodynamic model and polar dielectrics with
nonlocal response are exemplified. The framework enables for the first time
direct modal analysis of mode transition in the quantum tunneling regime and
provides physical insights beyond usual far-field spectroscopic analysis.
Applied to nonlocal polar dielectrics, the framework also unveils the important
roles of longitudinal phonon polaritons in optical response.

intense interest as a model for the dynamics inside living cells and

individual particles was added to the free energy of the system in the form of
the potential energy of an active particle, trapped by a harmonic potential
that describes the effective confinement by the surrounding medium. This
active-RFOT model was shown to successfully account for the dependence of the
structural relaxation time in the active glass, extracted from simulations, as
a function of the activity parameters: the magnitude of the active force
($f_0$) and its persistence time ($\tau_p$). However, significant deviations
were found in the limit of large activity (large $f_0$ and/or $\tau_p$). Here
we extend the active-RFOT model to high activity using an activity-dependent
harmonic confining potential, which we solve self-consistently. The extended
model predicts qualitative changes in the high activity regime, which agree
with the results of simulations in both three-dimensional and two-dimensional
models of active glass.

systems. One potential answer is reputation, whereby agents trade the immediate
cost of cooperation for the future benefits of having a good reputation. Game
theoretical models have shown that specific social norms can make cooperation
stable, but how agents can independently learn to establish effective
reputation mechanisms on their own is less understood. We use a simple model of
reinforcement learning to show that reputation mechanisms generate two
coordination problems: agents need to learn how to coordinate on the meaning of
existing reputations and collectively agree on a social norm to assign
reputations to others based on their behavior. These coordination problems
exhibit multiple equilibria, some of which effectively establish cooperation.
When we train agents with a standard Q-learning algorithm in an environment
with the presence of reputation mechanisms, convergence to undesirable
equilibria is widespread. We propose two mechanisms to alleviate this: (i)
seeding a proportion of the system with fixed agents that steer others towards
good equilibria; and (ii), intrinsic rewards based on the idea of
introspection, i.e., augmenting agents' rewards by an amount proportionate to
the performance of their own strategy against themselves. A combination of
these simple mechanisms is successful in stabilizing cooperation, even in a
fully decentralized version of the problem where agents learn to use and assign
reputations simultaneously. We show how our results relate to the literature in
Evolutionary Game Theory, and discuss implications for artificial, human and
hybrid systems, where reputations can be used as a way to establish trust and
cooperation.

robots such that they eventually reach a configuration where each node has at
most one non-Byzantine robot on it.
  Previous work solved this problem for rings and tolerated up to $n-1$
Byzantine robots. In this paper, we investigate the problem on more general

robots and works for a more general class of graphs.
  We then develop an algorithm that works for any graph but tolerates a lesser
number of Byzantine robots.
  We subsequently turn our focus to the strength of the Byzantine robots.
Previous work considers only ``weak"" Byzantine robots that cannot fake their
IDs. We develop an algorithm that solves the problem when Byzantine robots are
not weak and can fake IDs.
  Finally, we study the situation where the number of the robots is not $n$ but
some $k$. We show that in such a scenario, the number of Byzantine robots that
can be tolerated is severely restricted. Specifically, we show that it is
impossible to deterministically solve Byzantine dispersion when $\lceil k/n

intricate interaction scenarios. This paper presents a probabilistically
reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of
multi-vehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We
treated the merging task's sequential decision as a dynamic, stochastic process
and then integrated the internal states into an HMM-GMR model, a probabilistic
combination of an extended Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and hidden Markov
models (HMM). We also developed a variant expectation-maximum (EM) algorithm to
estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world data set.
Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can
semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This
finding provides a basis to develop an efficient model-based decision-making
algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment.

$N$ complex numbers into the amplitude of a superposed $n=\lceil

implementing this subroutine would need at least $\mathcal O(N)$ constant
weight operations. However, the proof assumes that only $n$ qubits are used,
whereas the circuit depth could be reduced by extending the space and allowing
ancillary qubits. Here we investigate this space-time tradeoff in quantum state

O(n^2)$ circuit depth to encode any $N$ complex numbers using only single-,
two-qubit gates and local measurements with ancillary qubits. Different
variances of the algorithm are proposed with different space and runtime. In
particular, we present a scheme with $\mathcal O(N^2)$ ancillary qubits,
$\mathcal O(n^2)$ circuit depth, and $\mathcal O(n^2)$ average runtime, which
exponentially improves the conventional bound. While the algorithm requires
more ancillary qubits, it consists of quantum circuit blocks that only
simultaneously act on a constant number of qubits and at most $\mathcal O(n)$

studied for stochastic and bilinear systems. Our proposed approach relies on
identifying the dominant subspaces based on the reachability Gramian of a
system. Once the desired subspace is computed, the reduced order model is then
obtained by a Galerkin projection. We prove that, in the stochastic case, this
approach either preserves mean square asymptotic stability or leads to reduced
models whose minimal realization is mean square asymptotically stable. This
stability preservation guarantees the existence of the reduced system
reachability Gramian which is the basis for the full state error bounds that we
derive. This error bound depends on the neglected eigenvalues of the
reachability Gramian and hence shows that these values are a good indicator for
the expected error in the dimension reduction procedure. Subsequently, we
establish the stability preservation result and the error bound for a full
state approximation to bilinear systems in a similar manner. These latter
results are based on a recently proved link between stochastic and bilinear
systems. We conclude the paper by numerical experiments using a benchmark
problem. We compare this approach with balanced truncation and show that it
performs well in reproducing the full state of the system. \end{abstract}

shrinking nucleation volumes. Spatial control of the domain wall nucleation

observations of the gradient, this functionality is of limited use due to the
prohibitive computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(N^3 D^3)$ in data points $N$ and
dimension $D$. The dilemma of gradient observations is that a single one of
them comes at the same cost as $D$ independent function evaluations, so the
latter are often preferred. Careful scrutiny reveals, however, that derivative
observations give rise to highly structured kernel Gram matrices for very
general classes of kernels (inter alia, stationary kernels). We show that in
the low-data regime $N<D$, the Gram matrix can be decomposed in a manner that
reduces the cost of inference to $\mathcal{O}(N^2D + (N^2)^3)$ (i.e., linear in
the number of dimensions) and, in special cases, to $\mathcal{O}(N^2D + N^3)$.
This reduction in complexity opens up new use-cases for inference with
gradients especially in the high-dimensional regime, where the
information-to-cost ratio of gradient observations significantly increases. We
demonstrate this potential in a variety of tasks relevant for machine learning,

especially in the case of Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE).
Using realistic distributions for the merger rate as a function of redshift as
well as for component masses in binary neutron star and binary black hole
coalescences, we map out how often signal overlaps of various types will occur
in an ET-CE network over the course of a year. We find that a binary neutron
star signal will typically have tens of overlapping binary black hole and
binary neutron star signals. Moreover, it will happen up to tens of thousands
of times per year that two signals will have their end times within seconds of
each other. In order to understand to what extent this would lead to
measurement biases with current parameter estimation methodology, we perform
injection studies with overlapping signals from binary black hole and/or binary

overlap, and the kinds of overlapping signals, we find that in most scenarios
the intrinsic parameters can be recovered with negligible bias. However, biases
do occur for a short binary black hole or a quieter binary neutron star signal
overlapping with a long and louder binary neutron star event when the merger
times are sufficiently close. Hence our studies show where improvements are

through the transition region and then is collected and ultimately condenses in
the corona. A field-line-based TRACL method and a block-based TRACB method are
introduced and compared in block grid-adaptive 2D MHD simulations. Both methods
yield similar results and are shown to satisfactorily correct the
underestimated chromospheric evaporation, which comes from a poor spatial

scalar field with the action's values along the trajectories in the phase
space. The different behaviour of the trajectories around important phase space
objects like unstable periodic orbits, their stable and unstable manifolds, and
KAM islands generate characteristic patterns on the scalar field constructed
with the action. Using these different patterns is possible to identify the
skeleton of the phase space and understand the dynamics. Also, we present a
simple argument based on the conservation of the energy and the behaviour of
the trajectories to understand the values of their actions. In order to show
how this tool reveals the phase space structures and its effectiveness, we
compare the scalar field constructed with the actions with Poincare maps for
the same set of initial conditions in the phase space of an open Hamiltonian
system with 2 degrees of freedom.

mechanical and physical properties of matters. In this paper, disclinations and
dislocations are firstly introduced into the valley-polarized elastic phononic
plate. Deformation of the lattice yields the interface expressing as the
topologically protected wave guiding, due to the valley-polarized phase
transition of phononic crystals (PnCs) across the interface. Then,
disclinations are introduced into the Wannier-type elastic phononic plate. The
deformation of the lattice yielded by disclinations produces a pentagonal core

localized around the boundaries of the pentagonal cores with and without the
hollow regions. The topological interface state and the topological bound state
immunize against the finite sizes and the moderate disturbances of plates,
essentially differing from the trivial defect states. The discovery of
topological defect states unveils a new horizon in topological mechanics and

contrast to the Euclidean case, it is challenging to compute the normalization

applications, such as the space of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices

from theoretical physics, we will discuss how to approximate the partition

better as the dimension of the underlying symmetric space (more precisely, its
rank) gets larger. We will give formulas for leading order terms in the case of
SPD matrices and related spaces. Furthermore, we will characterize the large
$N$ limit of the Siegel domain through a singular integral equation arising as
a saddle-point equation.

important computational challenges derived from the combinatorial explosion
caused by the downward closure property of complexes. Drawing upon ideas from
itemset mining and similarity search, we design a memory-aware algorithm,

simplicial complex. STruD adapts its behavior to the amount of available memory
by storing intermediate data in a compact way. We then devise a variant that
computes directly the n simplices of maximum trussness. By applying STruD to
several datasets, we prove its scalability, and provide an analysis of their

thermal evolution of non-magnetized and non-rotating spherically-symmetric
isolated and accreting neutron stars under different hypothesis concerning
proton $S$-wave superfluidity.
  These equations of state have been obtained in the following way: the slope
of the symmetry energy is in agreement with experimental data; the coupling
constants of $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$-hyperons are determined from experimental
hypernuclear data; uncertainties in the nucleon-$\Sigma$ interaction potential
are accounted for; current constraints on the lower bound of the maximum
neutron star mass are satisfied.
  Within the considered set of equations of state, the presence of hyperons is
essential for the description of the cooling/heating curves.
  One of the conclusions we reach is that the criterion of best agreement with
observational data leads to different equations of states and proton $S$-wave
superfluidity gaps when applied separately for isolated neutron stars and
accreting neutron stars in quiescence.
  This means that at least in one situation the traditional simulation
framework that we employ is not complete and/or the equations of state are
inappropriate.
  Another result is that, considering equations of state which do not allow for
nucleonic dUrca or allow for it only in very massive NS, the low luminosity of
SAX J1808 requires a repulsive $\Sigma$-hyperon potential in symmetric nuclear
matter in the range $U_\Sigma^{(N)}\approx 10-30$ MeV. This range of values for

interplanetary space. Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge
of the CME properties in the inner heliosphere remains constrained by the
scarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore, most CMEs
are observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to
complement the sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of
the linear force-free spheromak CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial
evolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context for observational
studies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution by
placing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain.
To directly compare observational and modelling results, we characterise the
interplanetary CME signatures between 0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series,
exploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse real in situ data.
Results show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME
values is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME
expands as a consequence of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the
expansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate at larger distances. The early
rapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size in our
simulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak
geometry used. The magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME
during propagation, while ageing is most probably not a substantial source of
magnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that is
significantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA
provides a consistent description of the radial evolution of solar wind and
CMEs; nevertheless, improvements are required to better reproduce the CME
radial extension.

distribution of all degree counts. In particular, we give an explicit
expression for the asymptotic covariance. This expression is rather complex, so
we compute it numerically for various parameter choices. We also use numerical
simulations to argue that the convergence is quite fast. The proof relies on
the careful construction of an appropriate martingale.

is to leverage and synthesize distilled knowledge from similar tasks as well as
from valuable experiences accumulated from the past to facilitate the learning
of new problems. Doing so, TL techniques can reduce the dependence on labeled

different wireless environments. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
survey on applications of TL in wireless networks. Particularly, we first
provide an overview of TL including formal definitions, classification, and
various types of TL techniques. We then discuss diverse TL approaches proposed
to address emerging issues in wireless networks. The issues include spectrum

employ matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering methods. Recent
methods using graph convolutional networks (e.g., LightGCN) achieve
state-of-the-art performance. They learn both user and item embedding. One
major drawback of most existing methods is that they are not inductive; they do
not generalize for users and items unseen during training. Besides, existing
network models are quite complex, difficult to train and scale. Motivated by
LightGCN, we propose a graph convolutional network modeling approach for
collaborative filtering CF-GCN. We solely learn user embedding and derive item
embedding using light variant CF-LGCN-U performing neighborhood aggregation,
making it scalable due to reduced model complexity. CF-LGCN-U models naturally
possess the inductive capability for new items, and we propose a simple
solution to generalize for new users. We show how the proposed models are
related to LightGCN. As a by-product, we suggest a simple solution to make
LightGCN inductive. We perform comprehensive experiments on several benchmark

Experimental results show that similar or better generalization performance is
achievable than the state of the art methods in both transductive and inductive

of property testing in signed graphs, where every edge has either a positive or
a negative sign. We show that there exist sublinear algorithms for testing
three key properties of signed graphs: balance (or 2-clusterability),
clusterability and signed triangle freeness. We consider both the dense graph
model, where we can query the (signed) adjacency matrix of a signed graph, and
the bounded-degree model, where we can query for the neighbors of a node and
the sign of the connecting edge. Our algorithms use a variety of tools from
graph property testing, as well as reductions from one setting to the other.
Our main technical contribution is a sublinear algorithm for testing
clusterability in the bounded-degree model. This contrasts with the property of
k-clusterability which is not testable with a sublinear number of queries. The
tester builds on the seminal work of Goldreich and Ron for testing

performance in speech recognition. However, because the decoder predicts text
tokens (such as characters or words) in an autoregressive manner, it is
difficult for an AED model to predict all tokens in parallel. This makes the
inference speed relatively slow. We believe that because the encoder already
captures the whole speech utterance, which has the token-level relationship
implicitly, we can predict a token without explicitly autoregressive language
modeling. When the prediction of a token does not rely on other tokens, the
parallel prediction of all tokens in the sequence is realizable. Based on this
idea, we propose a non-autoregressive speech recognition model called LASO
(Listen Attentively, and Spell Once). The model consists of an encoder, a
decoder, and a position dependent summarizer (PDS). The three modules are based
on basic attention blocks. The encoder extracts high-level representations from
the speech. The PDS uses positional encodings corresponding to tokens to
convert the acoustic representations into token-level representations. The
decoder further captures token-level relationships with the self-attention
mechanism. At last, the probability distribution on the vocabulary is computed
for each token position. Therefore, speech recognition is re-formulated as a
position-wise classification problem. Further, we propose a cross-modal
transfer learning method to refine semantics from a large-scale pre-trained
language model BERT for improving the performance.

contacts between the target object and his/her fingers without seeing the

neuroscience. Most of the existing 3D recognition models were developed based
on dense 3D data. Nonetheless, in many real-life use cases, where robots are
used to collect 3D data by haptic exploration, only a limited number of 3D
points could be collected. In this study, we thus focus on solving the

of a target object with limited interactions between the robot and the object.
A novel reinforcement learning based framework is proposed, where the haptic
exploration procedure (the agent iteratively predicts the next position for the
robot to explore) is optimized simultaneously with the objective 3D recognition
with actively collected 3D points. As the model is rewarded only when the 3D

in both its geometry and dynamics. Here we report the unusual decrease of the
reflection fraction in MAXI J1820+070, which is the ratio of the coronal
intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity reaching the observer,
as the corona is observed to contrast during the decay phase. We postulate a
jet-like corona model, in which the corona can be understood as a standing
shock where the material flowing through. In this dynamical scenario, the
decrease of the reflection fraction is a signature of the corona's bulk
velocity. Our findings suggest that as the corona is observed to get closer to
the black hole, the coronal material might be outflowing faster.

task-specific measurement, which can be used to select images that are more
amenable to a given target task, such as image classification or segmentation.
We propose to train simultaneously two neural networks for image selection and
a target task using reinforcement learning. A controller network learns an
image selection policy by maximising an accumulated reward based on the target
task performance on the controller-selected validation set, whilst the target
task predictor is optimised using the training set. The trained controller is
therefore able to reject those images that lead to poor accuracy in the target
task. In this work, we show that the controller-predicted image quality can be
significantly different from the task-specific image quality labels that are
manually defined by humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to
learn effective image quality assessment without using a ``clean'' validation
set, thereby avoiding the requirement for human labelling of images with
respect to their amenability for the task. Using $6712$, labelled and
segmented, clinical ultrasound images from $259$ patients, experimental results
on holdout data show that the proposed image quality assessment achieved a mean
classification accuracy of $0.94\pm0.01$ and a mean segmentation Dice of
$0.89\pm0.02$, by discarding $5\%$ and $15\%$ of the acquired images,
respectively. The significantly improved performance was observed for both
tested tasks, compared with the respective $0.90\pm0.01$ and $0.82\pm0.02$ from

labor, where fourteen near-term ovine fetuses subjected to umbilical cord
occlusions (UCO) were instrumented to permit regular intermittent measurements
of metabolites, pH, and continuous recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) and
systemic arterial blood pressure (to identify CVD) during UCO. ECG-derived FHR
was digitized at the sampling rate of 1000 Hz and resampled to 4Hz, as used in
clinical routine. We focused on four FHR variability features which are tunable
to temporal scales of FHR dynamics, robustly computable from FHR sampled at
$4$Hz and within short-time sliding windows, hence permitting a time-dependent,
or local, analysis of FHR which helps dealing with signal noise. Results show
the sensitivity of the proposed features for early detection of CVD,
correlation to metabolites and pH, useful for early acidosis detection and the
importance of coarse time scales (2.5 to 8 seconds) which are not disturbed by
the low FHR sampling rate. Further, we introduce the performance of an
individualized self-referencing metric of the distance to healthy state, based
on a combination of the four features. We demonstrate that this novel metric,
applied to clinically available FHR temporal dynamics alone, accurately
predicts the time occurrence of CVD which heralds a clinically significant
degradation of the fetal health reserve to tolerate the trial of labor.

field equations with matter. The type we consider possesses no event horizon,
instead, there is a deep gravitational well with a very strong redshift factor.
Observationally, dark stars can be identified with black holes. Inside dark
stars, Planck density of matter is reached, Planck cores are formed, where the
equations are modified by quantum gravity. In the paper, several models of dark
stars with Planck cores are considered, resulting in the following hypothesis
on the composition of dark matter. The galaxies are flooded with low-energetic
radiation from the dark stars. The particle type can be photons and gravitons
from the Standard Model, can also be a new type of massless particles. The
model estimations show that the extremely large redshift factor $z\sim10^{49}$
and the emission wavelength $\lambda_0\sim10^{14}$m can be reached. The
particles are not registered directly in the existing dark matter experiments.
They come in a density sufficient to explain the observable rotation curves.
The emission has a geometric dependence of density on radius $\rho\sim r^{-2}$,
producing flat rotation curves. The distribution of sources also describes the
deviations from the flat shape. The model provides a good fit of experimental
rotation curves. Outbreaks caused by a fall of an external object on a dark
star lead to emission wavelength shifted towards smaller values. The model
estimations give the outbreak wavelength $\lambda\sim1$m compatible with fast
radio bursts. The paper raises several principal questions. White holes with
Planck core appear to be stable. Galactic rotation curves in the considered
setup do not depend on the matter type. Inside the galaxy, dark matter can be
of hot radial type. At cosmological distances, it can behave like the cold
uniform type.

the dynamical complexity of common infectious diseases driven by seasonally
varying contact rates. Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown
that, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious
diseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by
chaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact,
the existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature
as a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model. However,
in the context of epidemiology, chaos is often regarded as an undesirable
phenomenon associated with the unpredictability of infectious diseases. As a
consequence, the problem of converting chaotic motions into regular motions
becomes particularly relevant. In this article, we consider the phase control
technique applied to the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model to suppress
chaos. Interestingly, this method of controlling chaos takes on a clear meaning
as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy. Numerical
simulations show that the phase difference between the two periodic forces -
contact rate and vaccination - plays a very important role in controlling
chaos.

intrinsically four-dimensional, the field of numerical general relativity
focuses on the reformulation of these equations as a 3 + 1-dimensional Cauchy
problem, in which Cauchy initial data is specified on a three-dimensional
spatial hypersurface, and then evolved forwards in time. The Wolfram model
offers an inherently discrete formulation of the Einstein field equations as an
a priori Cauchy problem, in which Cauchy initial data is specified on a single
spatial hypergraph, and then evolved by means of hypergraph substitution rules,
with the resulting causal network corresponding to the conformal structure of
spacetime. This article introduces a new numerical general relativity code
based upon the conformal and covariant Z4 (CCZ4) formulation with
constraint-violation damping, with the option to reduce to the standard BSSN
formalism if desired, with Cauchy data defined over hypergraphs; the code
incorporates an unstructured generalization of the adaptive mesh refinement
technique proposed by Berger and Colella, in which the topology of the
hypergraph is refined or coarsened based upon local conformal curvature terms.
We validate this code numerically against a variety of standard spacetimes,
including Schwarzschild black holes, Kerr black holes, maximally extended
Schwarzschild black holes, and binary black hole mergers (both rotating and
non-rotating), and explicitly illustrate the relationship between the discrete
hypergraph topology and the continuous Riemannian geometry that is being
approximated. Finally, we compare the results produced by this code to the
results obtained by means of pure Wolfram model evolution (without the
underlying PDE system), using a hypergraph substitution rule that provably
satisfies the Einstein field equations in the continuum limit.

role of explanations around and investigate how they can contribute to
enhancing the quality of the generated recommendations themselves. We devise a
human-in-the-loop framework, called ELIXIR, where user feedback on explanations
is leveraged for pairwise learning of user preferences. ELIXIR leverages
feedback on pairs of recommendations and explanations to learn user-specific
latent preference vectors, overcoming sparseness by label propagation with
item-similarity-based neighborhoods. Our framework is instantiated using
generalized graph recommendation via Random Walk with Restart. Insightful
experiments with a real user study show significant improvements in movie and
book recommendations over item-level feedback.

compliance, the regression method enforces the balance of linear and angular
momentum in the linear elastic strain field reconstruction. By using a Gaussian
Process (GP), the presented method can yield a spatial estimate of the
uncertainty of the reconstructed strain field. Furthermore, constraints on
spatial smoothness can be optimised with respect to measurements through
hyperparameter estimation. These three features address weaknesses discussed
for previously existing scanning-3DXRD reconstruction methods and, thus, offers
a more robust strain field estimation. The method is twofold validated; firstly
by reconstruction from synthetic diffraction data and, secondly, by
reconstruction of previously studied tin (Sn) grain embedded in a
polycrystalline specimen. Comparison against reconstructions achieved by a
recently proposed algebraic inversion technique is also presented. It is found
that the GP regression consistently produces reconstructions with lower root
mean squared errors, mean absolute errors and maximum absolute errors across

Car-to-Car communication. As there have already been research projects which
evaluate the possibilities of one of those communication paths, few research
projects have evaluated how those paths could complement each other. The
structure of the Car2X Systems Network will be based on the Internet, in which
different and independent participants are working equally together over
standardized interfaces and protocols. However, the Car2X Systems Network needs
some special solutions, as the concepts of the Internet are not entirely
applicable to the requirements of the ITS world. Especially the strict security
and privacy considerations of ITS environments are not or only insufficiently
addressed in current state-of-the-art internet services. Furthermore, network
requirements like Quality of Service needs also to be considered. Thus, the

measurements taken from production drilling often provide useful information
that allows initially inaccurate surfaces created using sparse exploration data
to be revised and subsequently improved. Recently, a Bayesian warping technique
has been proposed to reshape modeled surfaces using geochemical and spatial
constraints imposed by newly acquired blasthole data. This paper focuses on
incorporating machine learning into this warping framework to make the
likelihood computation generalizable. The technique works by adjusting the
position of vertices on the surface to maximize the integrity of modeled
geological boundaries with respect to sparse geochemical observations. Its
foundation is laid by a Bayesian derivation in which the geological domain
likelihood given the chemistry, p(g|c), plays a similar role to p(y(c)|g). This
observation allows a manually calibrated process centered around the latter to
be automated since ML techniques may be used to estimate the former in a
data-driven way. Machine learning performance is evaluated for gradient
boosting, neural network, random forest and other classifiers in a binary and
multi-class context using precision and recall rates. Once ML likelihood
estimators are integrated in the surface warping framework, surface shaping
performance is evaluated using unseen data by examining the categorical
distribution of test samples located above and below the warped surface.
Large-scale validation experiments are performed to assess the overall efficacy
of ML assisted surface warping as a fully integrated component within an ore
grade estimation system where the posterior mean is obtained via Gaussian
Process inference with a Matern 3/2 kernel.

cross section is proposed. Based on this electric potential, the electric field
and the strain-like electrical variable are defined for the beam, where the
strain-like electrical variable is work-conjugated to the electric
displacement. The electromechanically coupled strain energy for the beam is
derived consistently from continuum electromechanics, which leads to the direct
application of the material models in the continuum to the beam model. The
electromechanically coupled problem in beam dynamics is first spatially
semidiscretized by 1D finite elements and then solved via variational time
integration. By applying different electrical boundary conditions, different
deformations of the beam are obtained in the numerical examples, including
contraction, shear, bending and torsion. The damping effect induced by the
viscosity as well as the total energy of the beam are evaluated. The
deformations of the electromechanically coupled beam model are compared with

observed. However, less degrees of freedom are required to resolve the complex

This involved developing an archetype PHC simulation, which was then adapted to
represent two other PHC configurations, differing in numbers of resources and
types of services provided, encountered during PHC visits. A model representing
a benchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational
guidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times
closer to international estimates (higher than observed), was also developed.
Simulation outcomes for the three observed configurations indicate negligible
patient waiting times and low resource utilisation values at observed patient
demand estimates. However, simulation outcomes for the benchmark configuration
indicated significantly higher resource utilisation. Simulation experiments to
evaluate the effect of potential changes in operational patterns on reducing
the utilisation of stressed resources for the benchmark case were performed.
Our analysis also motivated the development of simple analytical approximations
