  Application","Published: AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Microservices are becoming the defacto design choice for software
architecture. It involves partitioning the software components into finer
modules such that the development can happen independently. It also provides
natural benefits when deployed on the cloud since resources can be allocated
dynamically to necessary components based on demand. Therefore, enterprises as
part of their journey to cloud, are increasingly looking to refactor their
monolith application into one or more candidate microservices; wherein each
service contains a group of software entities (e.g., classes) that are
responsible for a common functionality. Graphs are a natural choice to
represent a software system. Each software entity can be represented as nodes
and its dependencies with other entities as links. Therefore, this problem of
refactoring can be viewed as a graph based clustering task. In this work, we
propose a novel method to adapt the recent advancements in graph neural
networks in the context of code to better understand the software and apply
them in the clustering task. In that process, we also identify the outliers in
the graph which can be directly mapped to top refactor candidates in the
software. Our solution is able to improve state-of-the-art performance compared
to works from both software engineering and existing graph representation based
techniques.

  Communications and Networks",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent development of deep learning methods provides a new approach to
optimize the belief propagation (BP) decoding of linear codes. However, the
limitation of existing works is that the scale of neural networks increases
rapidly with the codelength, thus they can only support short to moderate
codelengths. From the point view of practicality, we propose a high-performance
neural min-sum (MS) decoding method that makes full use of the lifting
structure of protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. By this means,
the size of the parameter array of each layer in the neural decoder only equals
the number of edge-types for arbitrary codelengths. In particular, for
protograph LDPC codes, the proposed neural MS decoder is constructed in a
special way such that identical parameters are shared by a bundle of edges
derived from the same edge-type. To reduce the complexity and overcome the
vanishing gradient problem in training the proposed neural MS decoder, an
iteration-by-iteration (i.e., layer-by-layer in neural networks) greedy
training method is proposed. With this, the proposed neural MS decoder tends to
be optimized with faster convergence, which is aligned with the early
termination mechanism widely used in practice. To further enhance the
generalization ability of the proposed neural MS decoder, a codelength/rate
compatible training method is proposed, which randomly selects samples from a
set of codes lifted from the same base code. As a theoretical performance
evaluation tool, a trajectory-based extrinsic information transfer (T-EXIT)
chart is developed for various decoders. Both T-EXIT and simulation results
show that the optimized MS decoding can provide faster convergence and up to
1dB gain compared with the plain MS decoding and its variants with only
slightly increased complexity. In addition, it can even outperform the
sum-product algorithm for some short codes.

systems displaying non-vanishing currents. From the response function, we can
extrapolate generalized versions of the Mesoscopic Virial equation and the

MAML algorithm's generalization to an unseen task and show that the resulting

tunable parameters exist, our protocol can tune the performance for harnessing
the quantum criticality over arbitrarily large sensing intervals. For the
single-parameter sensing, our protocol optimizes a control field such that an
Ising probe is tuned to always operate around its criticality. This
significantly enhances the performance of the probe even when the interval of

the latest data from experiment and evaluation. We use the network to simulate
the late-time phase of the rapid neutron capture (r) process. In this epoch,
the bulk of nuclear reactions, such as radiative capture, have ceased and
nuclear decays are the dominant transmutation channels. We find that the decay
from short-lived to long-lived species naturally leads to an isochronic
evolution in which nuclei with similar half-lives are populated at the same
time. We consider random perturbations along each isobaric chain to initial
solar-like r-process compositions to demonstrate the isochronic nature of the
late-time phase of the r-process. Our analysis shows that detailed knowledge of
the final isotopic composition allows for the prediction of late-time evolution
with a high degree of confidence despite uncertainties that exist in
astrophysical conditions and the nuclear physics properties of the most
neutron-rich nuclei. We provide the time-dependent nuclear composition in the

dynamics, or neurodynamics (ND), is strongly stochastic, chaotic, and instanton
(neuroavalanche)-dominated. It is also partly scale-invariant which has been
loosely associated with critical phenomena. It has been recently demonstrated
that the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) offers a theoretical
framework that can explain all of the above ND features. In the STS, all
stochastic models possess a topological supersymmetry (TS), and the
""criticality"" of ND and similar stochastic processes is associated with
noise-induced, spontaneous breakdown of this TS (due to instanton condensation
near the border with ordinary chaos in which TS is broken by
non-integrability). Here, we propose a new approach that may be useful for the
construction of low-energy effective theories of ND. Its centerpiece is a
coarse-graining procedure of neural networks based on simplicial complexes and
the concept of the ""enveloping lattice."" It represents a neural network as a
continuous, high-dimensional base space whose rich topology reflects that of
the original network. The reduced one-instanton state space is determined by
the de Rham cohomology classes of this base space, and the effective ND
dynamics can be recognized as interactions of the instantons in the spirit of
the Segal-Atiyah formalism.

systematic applications of Boolean valued models of set theory to analysis.
Later, his methods were further developed by his followers, leading to solving
several open problems in analysis and algebra. Using the methods of Boolean
valued analysis, he further stepped forward to construct set theory based on
quantum logic, as the first step to construct ""quantum mathematics"", a
mathematics based on quantum logic. While it is known that the distributive law
does not apply to quantum logic, and the equality axiom turns out not to hold
in quantum set theory, he showed that the real numbers in quantum set theory
are in one-to-one correspondence with the self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert
space, or equivalently the physical quantities of the corresponding quantum
system. As quantum logic is intrinsic and empirical, the results of the quantum
set theory can be experimentally verified by quantum mechanics. In this paper,
we analyze Takeuti's mathematical world view underlying his program from two
perspectives: set theoretical foundations of modern mathematics and extending
the notion of sets to multi-valued logic. We outlook the present status of his
program, and envisage the further development of the program, by which we would
be able to take a huge step forward toward unraveling the mysteries of quantum
mechanics that have persisted for many years.

applications in extreme-wavelength imaging where conventional refractive lenses

smallest width of the outermost zone. In order to improve the achievable
resolution, significant efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of very
small zone width with ultrahigh placement accuracy. Here, we report the use of
a diffractometer setup for bypassing the resolution limit of zone plate optics.
In our prototype, we mounted the sample on two rotation stages and used a
low-resolution binary zone plate to relay the sample plane to the detector. We
then performed both in-plane and out-of-plane sample rotations and captured the
corresponding raw images. The captured images were processed using a Fourier
ptychographic procedure for resolution improvement. The final achievable
resolution of the reported setup is not determined by the smallest width
structures of the employed binary zone plate; instead, it is determined by the
maximum angle of the out-of-plane rotation. In our experiment, we demonstrated
8-fold resolution improvement using both a resolution target and a titanium
dioxide sample. The reported approach may be able to bypass the fabrication
challenge of diffractive elements and open up new avenues for microscopy with

factors suppressing the electron - phonon coupling. The efective mass in the

features are embedded in the proposed architecture to enable autonomy: (i) a
system identification algorithm from our prior work that periodically re-learns
building dynamics and unmeasured internal heat loads from data without
requiring re-tuning by experts. The estimated model is guaranteed to be stable
and has desirable physical properties irrespective of the data; (ii) an MPC
planner with a convex approximation of the original nonconvex problem. The
planner uses a descent and convergent method, with the underlying optimization
problem being feasible and convex. A year long simulation with a realistic
plant shows that both of the features of the proposed architecture - periodic
model and disturbance update and convexification of the planning problem - are
essential to get the performance improvement over a commonly used baseline
controller. Without these features, though MPC can outperform the baseline
controller in certain situations, the benefits may not be substantial enough to
warrant the investment in MPC.

The latter result indicates that the acoustic wave has been amplified by the

generated subharmonics are proportional to the (the order number of the
approximation) powers of the acoustic Reynolds number (and hence the Reynolds
number of the flow). If the kinetic energy gained from momentum amplification
is greater than the energy loss due to the acoustic attenuation, which means,
the Reynolds number exceeds its critical value, a chain-reaction of the

dimensioning or evaluating their prediction error. This has led to an
increasing interest in the overlapping area between neural networks and more
traditional statistical methods, which can help overcome those problems. In
this article, a mathematical framework relating neural networks and polynomial
regression is explored by building an explicit expression for the coefficients
of a polynomial regression from the weights of a given neural network, using a
Taylor expansion approach. This is achieved for single hidden layer neural
networks in regression problems. The validity of the proposed method depends on
different factors like the distribution of the synaptic potentials or the
chosen activation function. The performance of this method is empirically
tested via simulation of synthetic data generated from polynomials to train
neural networks with different structures and hyperparameters, showing that
almost identical predictions can be obtained when certain conditions are met.
Lastly, when learning from polynomial generated data, the proposed method
produces polynomials that approximate correctly the data locally.

reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, it suffers from well-known problems
such as under- and overestimation bias of the value, which may adversely affect
the policy learning. To resolve this issue, we propose a MFRL framework that is
augmented with the components of model-based RL. Specifically, we propose to
estimate not only the $Q$-values but also both the transition and the reward
with a shared network. We further utilize the estimated reward from the model
estimators for $Q$-learning, which promotes interaction between the estimators.
We show that the proposed scheme, called Model-augmented $Q$-learning (MQL),
obtains a policy-invariant solution which is identical to the solution obtained
by learning with true reward. Finally, we also provide a trick to prioritize
past experiences in the replay buffer by utilizing model-estimation errors. We
experimentally validate MQL built upon state-of-the-art off-policy MFRL
methods, and show that MQL largely improves their performance and convergence.
The proposed scheme is simple to implement and does not require additional
training cost.

Most
speaker recognition systems are built upon two stages, the first stage extracts
low dimensional correlation embeddings from speech, and the second performs the
classification task. The robustness of a speaker recognition system mainly
depends on the extraction process of speech embeddings, which are primarily
pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. As the embedding systems are pre-trained,
the performance of speaker recognition models greatly depends on domain
adaptation policy, which may reduce if trained using inadequate data. This
paper introduces a speaker recognition strategy dealing with unlabeled data,
which generates clusterable embedding vectors from small fixed-size speech
frames. The unsupervised training strategy involves an assumption that a small
speech segment should include a single speaker. Depending on such a belief, a
pairwise constraint is constructed with noise augmentation policies, used to
train AutoEmbedder architecture that generates speaker embeddings. Without
relying on domain adaption policy, the process unsupervisely produces
clusterable speaker embeddings, termed unsupervised vectors (u-vectors). The
evaluation is concluded in two popular speaker recognition datasets for English
language, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech. Also, a Bengali dataset is included to
illustrate the diversity of the domain shifts for speaker recognition systems.
Finally, we conclude that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory
performance using pairwise architectures.

popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political
campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it
was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning,
there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for
harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many
such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific
(minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such `fear
speech' messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline
violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech
across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We
curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We
observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols
to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We
build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art
NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to
spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to
detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a
novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among
the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume
and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research
questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research
community has been traditionally involved in.

Accepted by ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abe460",,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate self-gravitating equilibria of halos constituted by dark
matter (DM) non-minimally coupled to gravity. In particular, we consider a
theoretically motivated non-minimal coupling which may arise when the
averaging/coherence length $L$ associated to the fluid description of the DM
collective behavior is comparable to the local curvature scale. In the
Newtonian limit, such a non-minimal coupling amounts to a modification of the
Poisson equation by a term $L^2\,\nabla^2\rho$ proportional to the Laplacian of
the DM density $\rho$ itself. We further adopt a general power-law equation of
state $p\propto \rho^{\Gamma}\, r^\alpha$ relating the DM dynamical pressure
$p$ to density $\rho$ and radius $r$, as expected by phase-space density
stratification during the gravitational assembly of halos in a cosmological
context. We confirm previous findings that, in absence of the non-minimal
coupling, the resulting density $\rho(r)$ features a steep central cusp and an
overall shape mirroring the outcomes of $N-$body simulations in the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, as described by the classic NFW or Einasto profiles.
Most importantly, we find that the non-minimal coupling causes the density
distribution to develop an inner core and a shape closely following, out to
several core scale radii, the Burkert profile. In fact, we highlight that the
resulting mass distributions can fit, with an accuracy comparable to the
Burkert's one, the co-added rotation curves of dwarf, DM-dominated galaxies.
Finally, we show that non-minimally coupled DM halos are consistent with the
observed scaling relation between the core radius $r_0$ and core density
$\rho_0$, in terms of an universal core surface density $\rho_0\times r_0$
among different galaxies.

1 induce a change in the differentiation status or process in T cells?.
Methods. We will consider two stochastic Markov chain models, one which will
describe the T-helper cell differentiation process, and another one describing
that process of infection of the T-helper cell by the virus; in these Markov
chains, we will consider a set of states $\{X_t \}$ comprised of those proteins
involved in each of the processes and their interactions (either
differentiation or infection of the cell), such that we will obtain two
stochastic transition matrices ($A,B$), one for each process; afterwards, the
computation of their eigenvalues shall be performed, in which, should the
eigenvalue $\lambda_i=1$ exist, the computation for the equilibrium
distribution $\pi^n$ will be obtained for each of the matrices, which will
inform us on the trends of interactions amongst the proteins in the long-term.
Results. The stochastic processes considered possess an equilibrium
distribution, when reaching their equilibrium distribution, there exists an
increase in their informational entropy, and their log-rank distributions can
be modeled as discrete beta generalized distributions (DGBD). Discussion. The
equilibrium distributions of both process can be regarded as states in which
the cell is well-differentiated, ergo there exists an induction of a novel
HIV-dependent differentiated state in the T-cell; these processes due to their
DGBD distribution can be considered complex processes; due to the increasing
entropy, the equilibrium states are stable ones. Conclusion. The HIV virus can
promote a novel differentiated state in the T-cell, which can give account for
clinical features seen in patients; this model, notwithstanding does not give
account of YES/NO logical switches involved in the regulatory networks.

one hand, in off-lattice populations spatial reciprocity may work more
efficiently than for a lattice-based system. On the other hand, competing
strategies may separate from each other in the continuous space concept, which
gives a chance for cooperators to survive even at relatively high temptation

The main purpose of this work is to provide a method to derive
tabulated observational constraints on the halo mass function (HMF) by studying
the magnification bias effect on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies. Under
the assumption of universality, we parametrize the HMF according to two
traditional models, namely the Sheth and Tormen (ST) and Tinker fits and assess
their performance in explaining the measured data within the {\Lambda} cold
dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. We also study the potential influence of the
halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in this analysis and discuss two
important aspects regarding the HMF parametrization. Methods. We measure the
cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with
redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$ and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies
with redshifts in the range $1.2<z<4.0$ and carry out an MCMC algorithm to
check this observable against its mathematical prediction within the halo model
formalism. Results. If all HMF parameters are assumed to be positive, the ST
fit only seems to fully explain the measurements by forcing the mean number of
satellite galaxies in a halo to increase substantially from its prior mean
value. The Tinker fit, on the other hand, provides a robust description of the
data without relevant changes in the HOD parameters, but with some dependence
on the prior range of two of its parameters. When the normalization condition
for the HMF is dropped and we allow negative values of the $p_1$ parameter in
the ST fit, all the involved parameters are better determined, unlike the
previous models, thus deriving the most general HMF constraints. While all
cases are in agreement with the traditional fits within the uncertainties, the
last one hints at a slightly higher number of halos at intermediate and high
masses, raising the important point of the allowed parameter range.

post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. The problem
is formulated within the Mie diffraction theory. We solve Maxwell's equations
for the EM wave propagating in the background of a static gravitational field

Using a wave-theoretical approach and the eikonal approximation, we find an
exact closed form solution for the Debye potentials and determine the EM field
at an image plane in the strong interference region of the lens. The resulting
EM field is characterized by a new diffraction integral. We study this solution

deflection angle with the individual contributions due to each of the
multipoles. Treating the Sun as an extended, axisymmetric, rotating body, we
show that each zonal harmonics causes light to diffract into an area whose
boundary is a caustic of a particular shape. The appearance of the caustics
modifies the point-spread function (PSF) of the lens, thus affecting its
optical properties. The new wave-theoretical solution allows the study

function and an optimization algorithm to compute the optimal behavior for that
goal. This approach is intended to provide value for a principal: the user on

to a partial specification of the principal's goals. We consider the cost of
this incompleteness by analyzing a model of a principal and an agent in a
resource constrained world where the $L$ attributes of the state correspond to
different sources of utility for the principal. We assume that the reward

necessary and sufficient conditions under which indefinitely optimizing for any
incomplete proxy objective leads to arbitrarily low overall utility; and 3) we
show how modifying the setup to allow reward functions that reference the full

By computing timescales of various processes associated with thermal
relaxation, namely, radiation, diffusion, and gas-dust collision, we show that
the thermal relaxation in protoplanetary disks' surface layers
($Z/R\gtrsim0.1$) and outer disks ($R\gtrsim100$ au) is limited by infrequent
gas-dust collisions. The use of isothermal equation of state or rapid cooling,
common in protoplanetary disk simulations, is therefore not justified. Using
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the collision-limited
slow thermal relaxation provides favorable conditions for buoyancy resonances
to develop. Buoyancy resonances produce predominantly vertical motions, whose
magnitude at the $^{12}$CO emission surface is of order of $100~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$
for Jovian-mass planets, sufficiently large to detect using molecular line
observations with ALMA. We generate synthetic observations and describe
characteristic features of buoyancy resonances in Keplerian-subtracted moment

non-Keplerian motions driven by buoyancy resonances can be distinguished from
those driven by other origins. We argue that observations of multiple lines

the target of the embedding is the homogeneous, but not isotropic, Bianchi I
model. The diffeomorphism-invariant conditions imposing homogeneity and
isotropy in the full theory reduce to conditions imposing isotropy on an
already homogeneous Bianchi I spacetime. The reduced conditions are invariant
under the residual diffeomorphisms still allowed after gauge fixing the Bianchi
I model. We show that there is a unique embedding of the quantum isotropic

respect to the actions of such residual diffeomorphisms, and (b) intertwines
both the (signed) volume operator and at least one directional Hubble rate.
That embedding also intertwines all other operators of interest in the

approaches for image restoration. The regularization functional in the model
carries prior knowledge about the image to be restored. The prior knowledge, in
particular for natural images, are the first-order (i.e. variance in luminance)
and second-order (i.e. contrast and texture) information. In this paper, we
propose a model for image restoration, using a multilevel non-stationary tight

numerical experiments show that the model is effective and efficient as

each alternative of a random experiment whenever there is no reason to prefer
one over the other. The Maximum Entropy Principle (MaxEnt) generalizes PIR to
the case where statistical information like expectations are given. It is known
that both principles result in paradoxical probability updates for joint
distributions of cause and effect. This is because constraints on the
conditional P(effect|cause) result in changes of P(cause) that assign higher
probability to those values of the cause that offer more options for the
effect, suggesting ""intentional behaviour"". Earlier work therefore suggested
sequentially maximizing (conditional) entropy according to the causal order,
but without further justification apart from plausibility on toy examples. We
justify causal modifications of PIR and MaxEnt by separating constraints into
restrictions for the cause and restrictions for the mechanism that generates
the effect from the cause. We further sketch why Causal PIR also entails
""Information Geometric Causal Inference"". We briefly discuss problems of
generalizing the causal version of MaxEnt to arbitrary causal DAGs.

differentiate through the whole inner-loop optimization path for every
outer-loop training step, which may lead to both computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we generalize MAML to allow meta-learning
to be defined in function spaces, and propose the first meta-learning paradigm
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) induced by the meta-model's
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Within this paradigm, we introduce two
meta-learning algorithms in the RKHS, which no longer need a sub-optimal
iterative inner-loop adaptation as in the MAML framework. We achieve this goal
by 1) replacing the adaptation with a fast-adaptive regularizer in the RKHS;
and 2) solving the adaptation analytically based on the NTK theory. Extensive
experimental studies demonstrate advantages of our paradigm in both efficiency
and quality of solutions compared to related meta-learning algorithms. Another
interesting feature of our proposed methods is that they are demonstrated to be
more robust to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution adaptation than
popular baselines, as demonstrated in our experiments.

specific site in the body, we developed a mathematical model for the transport
of drug nanocarriers (nanoparticles) in the bloodstream under the influence of
an external magnetic field. Under the assumption of long (compared to the
radius) blood vessels the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced, to a simpler
model consistently with lubrication theory. Under these assumptions, analytical
results are compared for Newtonian, power-law, Carreau and Ellis fluids, and
these clearly demonstrate the importance of shear thinning effects when
modelling blood flow. Incorporating nanoparticles and a magnetic field to the
model we develop a numerical scheme and study the particle motion for different
field strengths. We demonstrate the importance of the non-Newtonian behaviour:
for the flow regimes investigated in this work, consistent with those in blood
micro vessels, we find that the field strength needed to absorb a certain
amount of particles in a non-Newtonian fluid has to be larger than the one
needed in a Newtonian fluid. Specifically, for one case examined, a two times
larger magnetic force had to be applied in the Ellis fluid than in the
Newtonian fluid for the same number of particles to be absorbed through the
vessel wall. Consequently, models based on a Newtonian fluid can drastically
overestimate the effect of a magnetic field. Finally, we evaluate the particle
concentration at the vessel wall and compute the evolution of the particle flux
through the wall for different permeability values, as that is important when
assessing the efficacy of drug delivery applications. The insights from our
work bring us a step closer to successfully transferring magnetic nanoparticle
drug delivery to the clinic.

signatures. Due to the coupling between the source signatures and the
subsurface model, small errors in the former can translate into large errors in
the latter. When direct methods are used to solve the forward problem,
classical frequency-domain FWI efficiently processes multiple sources for
source signature and wavefield estimations once a single Lower-Upper (LU)
decomposition of the wave-equation operator has been performed. However, this
efficient FWI formulation is based on the exact solution of the wave equation
and hence is highly sensitive to the inaccuracy of the velocity model due to
the cycle skipping pathology. Recent extended-space FWI variants tackle this
sensitivity issue through a relaxation of the wave equation combined with data
assimilation, allowing the wavefields to closely match the data from the first
inversion iteration. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by minimizing
the wave-equation violations. When the wavefields and the source signatures are
jointly estimated with this approach, the extended wave equation operator
becomes source dependent, hence making direct methods ineffective. In this
paper, we propose a simple method to bypass this issue and estimate source
signatures efficiently during extended FWI. The proposed method replaces each
source with a blended source during each data-assimilated wavefield
reconstruction to make the extended wave equation operator source independent.
Besides computational efficiency, the additional degrees of freedom introduced
by spatially distributing the sources allows for a better signature estimation
at the physical location when the velocity model is rough. Numerical tests on
the Marmousi II and 2004 BP salt synthetic models confirm the efficiency and
the robustness of the proposed method.

measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe

countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise
systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain
effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries,
particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by
an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities.
The economic infrastructure of the country, often concentrated in a few cities,
forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces
strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we
develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19
testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease
transmission. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and
demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and
city-specific social-distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity
of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution,
we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to
show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while
reducing the need for social-distancing measures, thus returning life to a

safe and fast as possible. The idea behind the project is that a robot with a
soft gripper grasps the drone in midair. The human operator navigates the
robotic arm with the ML-based gesture recognition interface. The 3-finger robot
hand with soft fingers is equipped with touch sensors, making it possible to
achieve safe drone catching and avoid inadvertent damage to the drone's
propellers and motors. Additionally, the soft hand is featured with a unique
color-based force estimation technology based on a computer vision (CV) system.
Moreover, the visual color-changing system makes it easier for the human
operator to interpret the applied forces.
  Without any additional programming, the operator has full real-time control
of the robot's motion and task execution by wearing a mocap glove with gesture
recognition, which was developed and applied for the high-level control of
DroneTrap. The experimental results revealed that the developed color-based
force estimation can be applied for rigid object capturing with high precision
(95.3\%). The proposed technology can potentially revolutionize the landing and
deployment of drones for parcel delivery on uneven ground, structure
maintenance and inspection, risque operations, and etc.

applications in modern machine learning problems. Although recent studies have
characterized the convergence rate for several such popular algorithms, it is
still unclear how much further these convergence rates can be improved. In this
paper, we address this fundamental question from two perspectives. First, we
provide the first-known lower complexity bounds of
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_x}\mu_y})$ and $\widetilde
\Omega\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\min\{\frac{1}{\mu_y},\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon^{3}}}\}\big)$

named AccBiO, for which we provide the first-known complexity bounds without
the gradient boundedness assumption (which was made in existing analyses) under
the two aforementioned geometries. We also provide significantly tighter upper
bounds than the existing complexity when the bounded gradient assumption does
hold. We show that AccBiO achieves the optimal results (i.e., the upper and
lower bounds match up to logarithmic factors) when the inner-level problem
takes a quadratic form with a constant-level condition number. Interestingly,
our lower bounds under both geometries are larger than the corresponding
optimal complexities of minimax optimization, establishing that bilevel
optimization is provably more challenging than minimax optimization.

global warming potential vapor compression cooling. Two key bottlenecks to
adoption are the need for bulky/expensive actuators to provide sufficient
uniaxial stress and inadequate elastocaloric material fatigue life. This paper
defines the physics that govern performance of axisymmetric flexural bending
for use as an emerging low-force and low-fatigue elastocaloric heating and
cooling mechanism and further demonstrates a continuous rotary-driven cooling
prototype using polycrcrystalline Ni50.7Ti48.9. Elastocaloric material
performance is determined using infrared thermography during uniaxial-tension
and four-point bending thermomechanical testing. A systematic study reveals the
effects of strain rate (from 0.001 to 0.025 s-1), maximum strain (from 2 to
8%), and strain mode on the temperature evolution, mechanical response, and
coefficient of performance. Four-point bending experiments demonstrate a
temperature reduction up to 11.3{\deg}C, material coefficients of performance
between 2.31 and 21.71, and a 6.09- to 7.75-fold reduction in required
actuation force compared to uniaxial tension. The absence of L\""uders bands and
reduced mechanical dissipation during flexure represent reduced microstructure
degradation and improved fatigue life. The rotary-based elastocaloric cooling
prototype is shown to provide similar thermomechanical performance with the
added benefit of discrete hot and cold zones, continuous cooling, inexpensive

for compact, long lifetime, and inexpensive elastocaloric cooling.

tested several antenna types, array configurations and calibration techniques,
and pioneered analysis methods for the reconstruction of the most important

observables such as the position of the shower maximum. In addition to a review
and update of previously published results, we also present new results based
on end-to-end simulations including all known instrumental properties. For
this, we applied the detector response to radio signals simulated with the
CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, and analyzed them in the same way as measured
data. Thus, we were able to study the detector performance more accurately than
before, including some previously inaccessible features such as the impact of
noise on the interferometric cross-correlation beam. These results led to
several improvements, which are documented in this paper and can provide useful

weighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal
normalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is
optimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a
screening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to
differentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The
method was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies
obtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,
207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of

that inherit the attractive properties of GPs and are also applicable to mixed
data which have both quantitative and qualitative inputs. The core idea behind
LMGPs is to learn a continuous, low-dimensional latent space or manifold which
encodes all qualitative inputs. To learn this manifold, we first assign a
unique prior vector representation to each combination of qualitative inputs.
We then use a low-rank linear map to project these priors on a manifold that
characterizes the posterior representations. As the posteriors are
quantitative, they can be directly used in any standard correlation function
such as the Gaussian or Matern. Hence, the optimal map and the corresponding
manifold, along with other hyperparameters of the correlation function, can be
systematically learned via maximum likelihood estimation. Through a wide range
of analytic and real-world examples, we demonstrate the advantages of LMGPs
over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and versatility. In
particular, we show that LMGPs can handle variable-length inputs, have an
explainable neural network interpretation, and provide insights into how
qualitative inputs affect the response or interact with each other. We also
employ LMGPs in Bayesian optimization and illustrate that they can discover
optimal compound compositions more efficiently than conventional methods that
convert compositions to qualitative variables via manual featurization.

covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR) and imperfect compliance of a binary

(2018,2019), CAR refers to randomization schemes that first stratify according
to baseline covariates and then assign treatment status so as to achieve
""balance"" within each stratum. In contrast to these papers, however, we allow
participants of the RCT to endogenously decide to comply or not with the
assigned treatment status.
  We study the properties of an estimator of the LATE derived from a ""fully

all indicators for all strata and their interaction with the treatment
decision, with the latter instrumented with the treatment assignment. We show
that the proposed LATE estimator is asymptotically normal, and we characterize
its asymptotic variance in terms of primitives of the problem. We provide
consistent estimators of the standard errors and asymptotically exact
hypothesis tests. In the special case when the target proportion of units
assigned to each treatment does not vary across strata, we can also consider
two other estimators of the LATE, including the one based on the ""strata fixed

indicators for all strata and the treatment decision, with the latter
instrumented with the treatment assignment.
  Our characterization of the asymptotic variance of the LATE estimators allows
us to understand the influence of the parameters of the RCT. We use this to
propose strategies to minimize their asymptotic variance in a hypothetical RCT

aims to address some of those challenges by utilizing a novel large-scale
dataset of artwork images annotated with concepts from the Iconclass

processed into clean textual description to create a dataset suitable for
training a deep neural network model on the image captioning task. Motivated by
the state-of-the-art results achieved in generating captions for natural

using the artwork image dataset. Quantitative evaluation of the results is
performed using standard image captioning metrics. The quality of the generated

employing the model on a new collection of paintings and performing an analysis
of the relation between commonly generated captions and the artistic genre. The

microlenses lead to interference patterns in the signal that may leave
observable signatures. In this work, we present an extensive study of these
wave effects in the LIGO/Virgo frequency band ($10$-$10^4$ Hz) due to the
presence of the microlens population in galaxy-scale lenses for the first time.
We consider a wide range of strong lensing (macro) magnifications and the
corresponding surface microlens densities found in lensing galaxies and use
them to generate realisations of the amplification factor. The methodologies
for simulating amplification curves for both types of images (minima and saddle
points) are also discussed. We then study how microlensing is broadly affected
by the parameters like macro-magnifications, stellar densities, the initial
mass function (IMF), types of images, and microlens distribution around the
source. In general, with increasing macro-magnification values, the effects of
microlensing become increasingly significant regardless of other parameters.
Mismatch analysis between the lensed and the unlensed GW waveforms from
chirping binaries suggests that, while inferring the source parameters,
microlensing can not be neglected for macro-magnification $\gtrsim 15$.
Furthermore, for extremely high macro-magnifications $\gtrsim 100$, the
mismatch can even exceed $5\%$, which can result in both a missed detection
and, consequently, a missed lensed signal.

recognized as more robust approaches for data clustering than single clustering
algorithms. We propose the use of determinantal point processes or DPP for the
random restart of clustering algorithms based on initial sets of center points,
such as k-medoids or k-means. The relation between DPP and kernel-based methods
makes DPPs suitable to describe and quantify similarity between objects. DPPs
favor diversity of the center points within subsets. So, subsets with more
similar points have less chances of being generated than subsets with very
distinct points. The current and most popular sampling technique is sampling
center points uniformly at random. We show through extensive simulations that,
contrary to DPP, this technique fails both to ensure diversity, and to obtain a
good coverage of all data facets. These two properties of DPP are key to make
DPPs achieve good performance with small ensembles. Simulations with artificial
datasets and applications to real datasets show that determinantal consensus
clustering outperform classical algorithms such as k-medoids and k-means
consensus clusterings which are based on uniform random sampling of center

This has opened up avenues to integrate neuro-feedback into hearing aids
whereby the device can infer user's attention and enhance the attended speaker.
Commonly used algorithms to infer the auditory attention are based on linear
systems theory where the speech cues such as envelopes are mapped on to the EEG
signals. Here, we present a joint convolutional neural network (CNN) - long

fiber communications. The encoder of PS expends the number of bit slots and
controls the probability distribution of channel input symbols. Not only
studies focused on PS but also most works on optical fiber communications have
assumed source uniformity (i.e. equal probability of marks and spaces) so far.
On the other hand, the source information is in general nonuniform, unless
bit-scrambling or other source coding techniques to balance the bit probability
is performed. Interestingly, one can exploit the source nonuniformity to reduce
the entropy of the channel input symbols with the PS encoder, which leads to
smaller required signal-to-noise ratio at a given input logic rate. This
benefit is equivalent to a combination of data compression and PS, and thus we
call this technique compressed shaping. In this work, we explain its
theoretical background in detail, and verify the concept by both numerical
simulation and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of such a
system. In particular, we find that compressed shaping can reduce power
consumption in forward error correction decoding by up to 90% in nonuniform

collection from its grammar-compressed representation. Our technique exploits
the string repetitions captured by the grammar to boost the computation of the

we use per input symbol. We rely on a new grammar recently proposed at DCC'21
whose nonterminals serve as building blocks for inducing the eBWT. A relevant
application for this idea is the construction of self-indexes for analyzing
sequencing reads -- massive and repetitive string collections of raw genomic
data. Self-indexes have become increasingly popular in Bioinformatics as they
can encode more information in less space. Our efficient eBWT construction
opens the door to perform accurate bioinformatic analyses on more massive
sequence datasets, which are not tractable with current eBWT construction

  Metal Anode",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lithium metal has been an attractive candidate as a next generation anode
material. Despite its popularity, stability issues of lithium in the liquid
electrolyte and the formation of lithium whiskers have kept it from practical
use. Three-dimensional (3D) current collectors have been proposed as an
effective method to mitigate whiskers growth. Although extensive research
efforts have been done, the effects of three key parameters of the 3D current
collectors, namely the surface area, the tortuosity factor, and the surface
chemistry, on the performance of lithium metal batteries remain elusive.
Herein, we quantitatively studied the role of these three parameters by
synthesizing four types of porous copper networks with different sizes of
well-structured micro-channels. X-ray microscale computed tomography (micro-CT)
allowed us to assess the surface area, the pore size and the tortuosity factor
of the porous copper materials. A metallic Zn coating was also applied to study
the influence of surface chemistry on the performance of the 3D current
collectors. The effects of these parameters on the performance were studied in
detail through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Titration Gas
Chromatography (TGC). Stochastic simulations further allowed us to interpret
the role of the tortuosity factor in lithiation. By understanding these
effects, the optimal range of the key parameters is found for the porous copper
anodes and their performance is predicted. Using these parameters to inform the
design of porous copper anodes for Li deposition, Coulombic efficiencies (CE)
of up to 99.56% are achieved, thus paving the way for the design of effective
3D current collector systems.

important research area. The effectiveness of the direction of arrival greatly
determines the performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems.
The multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which is the most
canonical and widely used subspace-based method, has a moderate estimation
performance of DOA. However, in hybrid massive MIMO systems, the received
signals at the antennas are not sent to the receiver directly, and spatial
covariance matrix, which is essential in MUSIC algorithm, is thus unavailable.
Therefore, the spatial covariance matrix reconstruction is required for the
application of MUSIC in hybrid massive MIMO systems. In this article, we
present a quantum algorithm for MUSIC-based DOA estimation in hybrid massive
MIMO systems. Compared with the best-known classical algorithm, our quantum
algorithm can achieve an exponential speedup on some parameters and a
polynomial speedup on others under some mild conditions. In our scheme, we
first present the quantum subroutine for the beam sweeping based spatial
covariance matrix reconstruction, where we implement a quantum singular vector
transition process to avoid extending the steering vectors matrix into the
Hermitian form. Second, a variational quantum density matrix eigensolver
(VQDME) is proposed for obtaining signal and noise subspaces, where we design a
novel objective function in the form of the trace of density matrices product.
Finally, a quantum labeling operation is proposed for the direction of arrival
estimation of the signal.

iteration follows from the convergence of the Browder type sequence. Our
results follow from proof-theoretic techniques (proof mining). From an analysis
of theorems due to T. Suzuki, we extract a transformation of rates for the
original Browder type and Halpern iterations into rates for the corresponding
viscosity versions. We show that these transformations can be applied to
earlier quantitative studies of these iterations. From an analysis of a theorem
due to H.-K. Xu, N. Altwaijry and S. Chebbi, we obtain similar results.
Finally, in uniformly convex Banach spaces we study a strong notion of
accretive operator due to Brezis and Sibony and extract an uniform modulus of
uniqueness for the property of being a zero point. In this context, we show
that it is possible to obtain Cauchy rates for the Browder type and the Halpern
iterations (and hence also for their viscosity versions).

geometric surfaces, almost no research has been conducted on the evaluation of
texture-mapped 3D models. In this context, we present a new subjective study to
evaluate the perceptual quality of textured meshes, based on a paired
comparison protocol. We introduce both texture and geometry distortions on a
set of 5 reference models to produce a database of 136 distorted models,
evaluated using two rendering protocols. Based on analysis of the results, we
propose two new metrics for visual quality assessment of textured mesh, as
optimized linear combinations of accurate geometry and texture quality
measurements. These proposed perceptual metrics outperform their counterparts

unseen classes from limited support data with labels. A common practice for
this task is to train a model on the base set first and then transfer to novel
classes through fine-tuning (Here fine-tuning procedure is defined as
transferring knowledge from base to novel data, i.e. learning to transfer in
few-shot scenario.) or meta-learning. However, as the base classes have no
overlap to the novel set, simply transferring whole knowledge from base data is
not an optimal solution since some knowledge in the base model may be biased or
even harmful to the novel class. In this paper, we propose to transfer partial
knowledge by freezing or fine-tuning particular layer(s) in the base model.
Specifically, layers will be imposed different learning rates if they are
chosen to be fine-tuned, to control the extent of preserved transferability. To
determine which layers to be recast and what values of learning rates for them,
we introduce an evolutionary search based method that is efficient to
simultaneously locate the target layers and determine their individual learning
rates. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB and mini-ImageNet to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on both meta-learning and non-meta based frameworks. Furthermore,
we extend our method to the conventional pre-training + fine-tuning paradigm

similarity to human understanding and reasoning. Many works achieve
disentanglement upon information bottlenecks (IB). Despite their elegant
mathematical foundations, the IB branch usually exhibits lower performance. In
order to provide an insight into the problem, we develop an annealing test to
calculate the information freezing point (IFP), which is a transition state to
freeze information into the latent variables. We also explore these clues or
inductive biases for separating the entangled factors according to the
differences in the IFP distributions. We found the existing approaches suffer
from the information diffusion problem, according to which the increased
information diffuses in all latent variables.
  Based on this insight, we propose a novel disentanglement framework, termed
the distilling entangled factor (DEFT), to address the information diffusion
problem by scaling backward information. DEFT applies a multistage training
strategy, including multigroup encoders with different learning rates and
piecewise disentanglement pressure, to disentangle the factors stage by stage.
We evaluate DEFT on three variants of dSprite and SmallNORB, which show
low-variance and high-level disentanglement scores. Furthermore, the experiment
under the correlative factors shows incapable of TC-based approaches. DEFT also

$\phi_{2;\pi}(x,\mu)$ by improving the traditional light-cone harmonic

calculate its moments $\langle\xi^n\rangle_{2;\pi}|_\mu$ in the framework of
QCD background field theory sum rule (BFTSR) up to $10^{\rm th}$ order.
Considering the fact that the sum rule of the $0^{\rm th}$ moment
$\langle\xi^0\rangle_{2;\pi}|_\mu$ cannot be normalized, we suggest a more
reasonable sum rule formula for $\langle\xi^n\rangle_{2;\pi}|_\mu$. Then, we
obtain the values of $\langle\xi^n\rangle_{2;\pi}|_{\mu_0}$ with
$n=(2,4,6,8,10)$ at the initial scale $\mu_0 = 1~{\rm GeV}$. The first two
moments are: $\langle \xi^2\rangle_{2;\pi}|_{\mu_0} = 0.271 \pm 0.013$,
$\langle\xi^4\rangle_{2;\pi}|_{\mu_0} = 0.138 \pm 0.010$; and the corresponding

$\langle\xi^n\rangle_{2;\pi}|_{\mu}$, we obtained the appropriate model
parameters by using the least square method. The resultant behavior for twist-2
pion DA is more closely to the AdS/QCD and lattice result, but is narrower than
that by Dyson-Schwinger equation. Furthermore, we calculate the pion-photon
transition form factors (TFF) and $B\to\pi$ TFF within light-cone sum rule

$f(\bm x, \bm w)$ exceeds a given threshold $h$, which is known as the
\emph{probability threshold robustness} (PTR) measure in the literature on
robust optimization. However, this robustness measure cannot be correctly
evaluated when the distribution $P$ is unknown. In this study, we addressed
this problem by considering the \textit{distributionally robust PTR} (DRPTR)

a reliable set $H$, which is defined as a region in which the DRPTR measure

We show that the proposed method has theoretical guarantees on convergence and

by disparate experimental handling, known as handling effects. Various data
normalization methods were developed to alleviate the adverse impact of
handling effects in the setting of differential expression analysis. However,
little research has been done to evaluate their performance in the setting of
survival outcome prediction, an important analysis goal for transcriptomics
data in biomedical research. Leveraging a unique pair of datasets for the same
set of tumor samples-one with handling effects and the other without, we
developed a benchmarking tool for conducting such an evaluation in microRNA
microarrays. We applied this tool to evaluate the performance of three popular
normalization methods-quantile normalization, median normalization, and
variance stabilizing normalization-in survival prediction using various
approaches for model building and designs for sample assignment. We showed that
handling effects can have a strong impact on survival prediction, and that
quantile normalization, a most popular method in current practice, tends to
underperform median normalization and variance stabilizing normalization. We
demonstrated with a small example the reason for quantile normalization's poor
performance in this setting. Our finding highlights the importance of putting
normalization evaluation in the context of the downstream analysis setting and
the potential of improving the development of survival predictors by applying
median normalization. We make available our benchmarking tool for performing
such evaluation on additional normalization methods in connection with
prediction modeling approaches.

regarding the nature of the phase transitions of the three investigated models.
Moreover, when the temperature dependence of the studied universal quantities
is considered, a substantial difference between the two models possessing
second order phase transitions and the remaining model is observed. Remarkably,
by using the associated data from both the models that may have continuous
transitions, good data collapses are obtained for a number of the considered
universal quantities. The findings presented here not only provide numerical
evidence to support the results established in the literature regarding the
nature of the phase transitions of these $JQ_3$ models, but also can be
employed as certain promising criterions to distinguish second order phase
transitions from first order ones for the exotic criticalities of the $JQ$-type

HL-LHC tracking detector upgrades. It is produced in two different pixel
flavours: one with a continuous deep n-type implant, and one with a segmented
n-type implant to ensure fast charge collection. The pixel matrix consists of
$16\times128$ detection channels measuring $300 \times 30$ microns. Each
detection channel is segmented into eight sub-pixels to reduce the amount of
digital circuity while maintaining a small collection electrode pitch. This
paper presents the characterisation results of the CLICTD sendor in a particle
beam. The different pixel flavours are compared in detail by using the
simultaneous time-over-threshold and time-of-arrival measurement
functionalities. Most notably, a time resolution down to $(5.8 \pm 0.1)$ ns and
a spatial resolution down to $(4.6 \pm 0.2)$ microns are measured. The hit
detection efficiency is found to be well above 99.7% for thresholds of the

LightSpeech, which leverages neural architecture search~(NAS) to automatically
design more lightweight and efficient models based on FastSpeech. We first
profile the components of current FastSpeech model and carefully design a novel
search space containing various lightweight and potentially effective

color critical graph $H$ with $\chi(H)=k+1$, there exists an $n_0(H)$ such that
the Tur\'an graph $T_{n,k}$ is the only extremal graph with respect to
$ex(n,H)$ provided $n \geq n_0(H)$. Nikiforov's pioneer work on spectral graph
theory implies that the color critical edge theorem also holds if $ex(n,H)$ is
replaced by the maximum spectral radius and $n_0(H)$ is an exponential function
of $|H|$. We want to know which color critical graphs $H$ satisfy that $n_0(H)$
is a linear function of $|H|$. Previous graphs include complete graphs and odd
cycles. In this paper, we find two new classes of graphs: books and theta
graphs. Namely, we prove that every graph on $n$ vertices with
$\rho(G)>\rho(T_{n,2})$ contains a book of size greater than $\frac{n}{6.5}$.
This can be seen as a spectral version of a 1962 conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, which
states that every graph on $n$ vertices with $e(G)>e(T_{n,2})$ contains a book
of size greater than $\frac{n}{6}$. In addition, our result on theta graphs
implies that if $G$ is a graph of order $n$ with $\rho(G)>\rho(T_{n,2})$, then
$G$ contains a cycle of length $t$ for every $t\leq \frac{n}{7}$. This is
related to an open question by Nikiforov which asks to determine the maximum
$c$ such that every graph $G$ of large enough order $n$ with
$\rho(G)>\rho(T_{n,2})$ contains a cycle of length $t$ for every $t\leq cn$.

turns out that, the form of the trial VAP wave function with spin $J$ can be
simplified by adopting just one projected state rather than previously adopting
all $(2J+1)$ angular momentum projected states for each selected reference
state, $|\Phi\rangle$. The present calculations show that such simplification
still minimizes the angular momentum projected energy up to a very good
approximation. In this simplified VAP scheme, one can obtain almost equivalent
VAP wave functions starting from different sets of the projected basis states.
This clearly shows that a nuclear state can not be identified with a single
intrinsic state, while in the traditional nuclear collective models, an

depth maps has recently gained great popularity. In this paper, we propose
Complementary Attention and Adaptive Integration Network (CAAI-Net), a novel
RGB-D saliency detection model that integrates complementary attention based
feature concentration and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion into a unified
framework for accurate saliency detection. Specifically, we propose a
context-aware complementary attention (CCA) module, which consists of a feature
interaction component, a complementary attention component, and a
global-context component. The CCA module first utilizes the feature interaction
component to extract rich local context features. The resulting features are
then fed into the complementary attention component, which employs the
complementary attention generated from adjacent levels to guide the attention
at the current layer so that the mutual background disturbances are suppressed
and the network focuses more on the areas with salient objects. Finally, we
utilize a specially-designed adaptive feature integration (AFI) module, which
sufficiently considers the low-quality issue of depth maps, to aggregate the
RGB and depth features in an adaptive manner. Extensive experiments on six
challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAAI-Net is an effective
saliency detection model and outperforms nine state-of-the-art models in terms
of four widely-used metrics. In addition, extensive ablation studies confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed CCA and AFI modules.

heliographic latitudes and emphasise its location in the declining phase of
Solar Cycle -12 in the 1620s. His observations were probably conducted using a

  After a disaster, locating and extracting victims quickly is critical because
mortality rises rapidly after the first two days. To assist search and rescue
teams and improve response times, teams of camera-equipped aerial robots can
engage in tasks such as mapping buildings and locating victims.
  These sensing tasks encapsulate difficult (NP-Hard) problems. One way to
simplify planning for these tasks is to focus on maximizing sensing performance
over a short time horizon. Specifically, consider the problem of how to select
motions for a team of robots to maximize a notion of sensing quality (the
sensing objective) over the near future, say by maximizing the amount of
unknown space in a map that robots will observe over the next several seconds.
By repeating this process regularly, the team can react quickly to new
observations as they work to complete the sensing task. In technical terms,
this planning and control process forms an example of receding-horizon control.
Fortunately, common sensing objectives benefit from well-known monotonicity
properties (e.g. submodularity), and greedy algorithms can exploit these
monotonicity properties to solve the receding-horizon optimization problems
that we study near-optimally.
  However, greedy algorithms typically force robots to make decisions
sequentially so that planning time grows with the number of robots. Further,
recent works that investigate sequential greedy planning, have demonstrated
that reducing the number of sequential steps while retaining suboptimality
guarantees can be hard or impossible.
  We demonstrate that halting growth in planning time is sometimes possible. To
do so, we introduce novel greedy algorithms involving fixed numbers of
sequential steps.

independent tools and automatic pipelines for annotation of eukaryotic genomes,
which are associated with existing achievements in annotating prokaryotic ones.
The main body consists of two distinguished parts, the first one is devoted to
instructions for annotating genomes of non-model eukaryotes, and the second
block is about recent versions of automatic pipelines that require minimal

Herein, we collected larger quantities of data to further improve model
performance. Moreover, the issues of noisy labels and sound overlapping were
explored. Methods: HF_Lung_V1 was expanded to HF_Lung_V2 with a 1.45x increase
in the number of audio files. Convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated
recurrent unit network models were trained separately using the HF_Lung_V1
(V1_Train) and HF_Lung_V2 (V2_Train) training sets and then tested using the
HF_Lung_V1 (V1_Test) and HF_Lung_V2 (V2_Test) test sets, respectively. Segment
and event detection performance was evaluated using the F1 scores. Label
quality was assessed. Moreover, the overlap ratios between inhalation,
exhalation, CAS, and DAS labels were computed. Results: The model trained using
V2_Train exhibited improved F1 scores in inhalation, exhalation, and CAS
detection on both V1_Test and V2_Test but not in DAS detection. Poor CAS
detection was attributed to the quality of CAS labels. DAS detection was
strongly influenced by the overlapping of DAS labels with inhalation and
exhalation labels. Conclusion: Collecting greater quantities of lung sound data
is vital for developing more accurate lung sound analysis models. To build real
ground-truth labels, the labels must be reworked; this process is ongoing.
Furthermore, a method for addressing the sound overlapping problem in DAS
detection must be formulated.

current epidemic platforms use a Proof-of-Stake system to select peer samples.
However such a system limits the openness of the system as only nodes with

the consensus algorithm and the cryptocurrency built upon it. In this paper, we
propose a radically different security design for the peer sampling service,

a new algorithm, $\scriptstyle{BASALT}$, that implements our design using a
stubborn chaotic search to counter attackers' attempts at becoming
over-represented. We show in theory and using Monte Carlo simulations that
$\scriptstyle{BASALT}$ provides samples which are extremely close to the
optimal distribution even in adversarial scenarios such as tentative Eclipse

the so-called Casas- Ibarra parameters on CP and flavor violating observables.
The renormalization group effects induce CP and flavor violating elements of
the SUSY breaking scalar mass squared matrices, which may result in sizable
leptonic CP and flavor violating signals. Assuming seesaw formula for the
active neutrino masses, the renormalization group effects have been often
thought to be negligible as the right-handed neutrino masses become small. With
the most general form of the neutrino Yukawa matrix, i.e., taking into account

failure of the BSM. One may use a large amplitude ($\alpha$) for the coherent
state to minimize the failure probability, but the qubit then becomes more
vulnerable to dephasing by photon loss. We propose a hardware-efficient
concatenated BSM (CBSM) scheme with modified parity encoding using coherent
states with reasonably small amplitudes ($|\alpha| \lessapprox 2$), which
simultaneously suppresses both failures and dephasing in the BSM procedure. We
numerically show that the CBSM scheme achieves a success probability
arbitrarily close to unity for appropriate values of $\alpha$ and sufficiently
low photon loss rates (e.g., $\lessapprox 5\%$). Furthermore, we verify that
the quantum repeater scheme exploiting the CBSM scheme for quantum error
correction enables one to carry out efficient long-range quantum communication
over 1000 km. We show that the performance is comparable to those of other
up-to-date methods or even outperforms them for some cases. Finally, we present
methods to prepare logical qubits under modified parity encoding and implement
elementary logical operations, which consist of several physical-level
ingredients such as generation of Schr\""odinger's cat state and elementary

scattering (RIXS) magnetic spectra of La2CuO4, Sr2CuO2Cl2 and CaCuO2 reveal a
rich set of properties of the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic square lattice of
cuprates. The leading single-magnon peak energy dispersion is in excellent
agreement with the corresponding inelastic neutron scattering measurements.
However, the RIXS data unveil an asymmetric lineshape possibly due to odd
higher order terms. Moreover, a sharp bimagnon feature emerges from the
continuum at (1/2,0), coincident in energy with the bimagnon peak detected in
optical spectroscopy. These findings show that the inherently complex spin
spectra of cuprates, an exquisite manifestation of quantum magnetism, can be
effectively explored by exploiting the richness of RIXS cross sections.

VeeAlign, a Deep Learning based model that uses a novel dual-attention

able to exploit both syntactic and semantic information encoded in ontologies,
it is also, by design, flexible and scalable to different domains with minimal

this new approach, the basis matrix is constructed in three different ways,
using a tensor structure and exploiting that certain problems have low-rank

understanding a user's behavior but were rarely considered. To aggregate all
relevant visits from user trajectory and recall the most plausible candidates
from weighted representations, here we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention
Network (STAN) for location recommendation. STAN explicitly exploits relative
spatiotemporal information of all the check-ins with self-attention layers
along the trajectory. This improvement allows a point-to-point interaction
between non-adjacent locations and non-consecutive check-ins with explicit
spatiotemporal effect. STAN uses a bi-layer attention architecture that firstly
aggregates spatiotemporal correlation within user trajectory and then recalls
the target with consideration of personalized item frequency (PIF). By

detection of individual charged heavy molecular ions. In our simulations, we
model the laser-cooled Ca + ions as two-level atoms, confined thanks to a set
of constant and time oscillating electrical fields. A singly-charged molecular
ion with a mass of 10 6 amu is propelled through the ion cloud. The induced
change in the fluorescence rate of the lather is used as the detection signal.
We show that this signal is due to a significant temperature variation
triggered by the Coulombian repulsion and amplified by the radio-frequency
heating induced by the trap itself. We identify the optimum initial energy for
the molecular ion to be detected and furthermore, we characterize the
performance of the detector for a large range of confinement voltages.

easily generate too large non-Gaussanities and so it is hard to realize
successful quasi-single field inflation without introducing a mechanism to
suppress quantum gravity corrections. Also we generalize the analysis to the

captured by the inflaton effective theory. Requiring perturbative unitarity of

generated by direct numerical simulation, marching the unsteady incompressible
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to a steady state, or using selective
frequency damping to obtain stationary linearly unstable flows. Unstable
three-dimensional linear global modes of swept wings have been identified for
the first time using spectral-element time-stepping solvers. The effect of the
wing geometry and flow parameters on these modes has been examined in detail.
An increase of the angle of attack was found to destabilize the flow, while an
increase of the sweep angle had the opposite effect. On unswept wings,
TriGlobal analysis revealed that the most unstable global mode peaks in the
midspan region of the wake; the peak of the mode structure moves towards the
tip as sweep is increased. Data-driven analysis was then employed to study the
effects of wing geometry and flow conditions on the nonlinear wake. On unswept
wings, the dominant mode at low angles of attack is a Kelvin-Helmholtz-like
instability, qualitatively analogous with global modes of infinite-span wings
under same conditions. At higher angles of attack and moderate sweep angles,
the dominant mode is a structure denominated the interaction mode. At high
sweep angles, this mode evolves into elongated streamwise vortices on higher
aspect ratio wings, while on shorter wings it becomes indistinguishable from
tip-vortex instability.

UMa-type dwarf nova ASASSN-18aan. We observed the 2018 superoutburst with 2.3
mag brightening and found the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$) to be 0.149454(3)
d, or 3.59 hr. This is longward of the period gap, establishing ASASSN-18aan as
one of a small number of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The
estimated mass ratio, ($q=M_2/M_1 = 0.278(1)$), is almost identical to the
upper limit of tidal instability by the 3:1 resonance. From eclipses, we found
that the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst may reach the 3:1
resonance radius, suggesting that the superoutburst of ASASSN-18aan results
from the tidal instability. Considering the case of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae, we suggest that the tidal dissipation at the tidal
truncation radius is enough to induce SU UMa-like behavior in relatively
high-$q$ systems such as SU UMa-type dwarf novae, but that this is no longer
effective in low-$q$ systems such as WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The unusual
nature of the system extends to the secondary star, for which we find a
spectral type of G9, much earlier than typical for the orbital period, and a
secondary mass $M_2$ of around 0.18 M$_{\odot}$, smaller than expected for the
orbital period and the secondary's spectral type. We also see indications of
enhanced sodium abundance in the secondary's spectrum. Anomalously hot
secondaries are seen in a modest number of other CVs and related objects. These
systems evidently underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of
mass transfer. In the case of ASASSN-18aan, this apparently resulted in a mass
ratio lower than typically found at the system's $P_{\rm orb}$, which may
account for the occurrence of a superoutburst at this relatively long period.

However, analyzing all of these transitions within a single theoretical

data has been addressed by searching for single-spacecraft small-scale
signatures. A recent hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability has pointed out clear kinetic features which uniquely characterize
the vortex during both the nonlinear and turbulent stage of the instability. We
compare the simulation results with \textit{in situ} observations of
Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices by the Magnetospheric MultiScale satellites. We find
good agreement between simulation and observations. In particular, the edges of
the vortex are associated with strong current sheets, while the center is
characterized by a low value for the magnitude of the total current density and
strong deviation of the ion distribution function from a Maxwellian
distribution. We also find a significant temperature anisotropy parallel to the
magnetic field inside the vortex region and strong agyrotropies near the edges.
We suggest that these kinetic features can be useful for the identification of
Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in \textit{in situ} data.

human accuracy in prediction and detection tasks in a variety of domains,

to the full realization of ML's potential in medical prognoses is technology
acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress
in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer
from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a

limited by two key factors: the machine's horizon of prediction that extends
beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to
incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML

understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human
cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a
distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this

different protected categories by intersecting gender with religion, sexuality,

more stereotypical for women than for men, especially for intersections; (ii)
Intersectional interactions are highly relevant for occupational associations,
which we quantify by fitting 262 logistic models; (iii) For most occupations,
GPT-2 reflects the skewed gender and ethnicity distribution found in US Labor

chemical evolution. We test these models by a comparison with observations and
with detailed Magneticum high resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.
Galaxy star formation rates, stellar masses, gas masses, ages, interstellar
medium and stellar metallicities are compared. It is found that these simple
lookback models capture many of the crucial aspects of galaxy evolution
reasonably well. Their key assumption of a redshift dependent power law
relationship between galaxy interstellar medium gas mass and stellar mass is in
agreement with the outcome of the complex Magneticum simulations. Star
formation rates decline towards lower redshift not because galaxies are running
out of gas, but because the fraction of the cold ISM gas, which is capable of
producing stars, becomes significantly smaller. Gas accretion rates in both
model approaches are of the same order of magnitude. Metallicity in the
Magneticum simulations increases with the ratio of stellar mass to gas mass as
predicted by the lookback models. The mass metallicity relationships agree and
the star formation rate dependence of these relationships is also reproduced.
We conclude that these simple models provide a powerful tool for constraining
and interpreting more complex models based on cosmological simulations and for
population synthesis studies analyzing integrated spectra of stellar
populations.

  Element Method","26 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since its introduction, the Virtual Element Method (VEM) was shown to be able
to deal with a large variety of polygons, while achieving good convergence
rates. The regularity assumptions proposed in the VEM literature to guarantee
the convergence on a theoretical basis are therefore quite general. They have
been deduced in analogy to the similar conditions developed in the Finite
Element Methods (FEMs) analysis. In this work, we experimentally show that the
VEM still converges with almost optimal rates and low errors in the L2 and H1
norms even if we significantly break the regularity assumptions that are used
in the literature. These results suggest that the regularity assumptions
proposed so far might be overestimated. We also exhibit examples on which the
VEM sub-optimally converges or diverges. Finally, we introduce a mesh quality
indicator that experimentally correlates the entity of the violation of the
regularity assumptions and the performance of the VEM solution, thus predicting
if a dataset is potentially critical for VEM.

challenging task. In order to tackle this problem, recently the imaging-based
methods have grabbed the attention of many researchers. These methods either
extract the features (e.g. using SIFT, or SOSNet) and map the descriptive ones
to the camera position and rotation information, or deploy an end-to-end system
that directly estimates this information out of RGB images, similar to PoseNet.
While the former methods suffer from heavy computational burden during the test
process, the latter suffers from lack of accuracy and robustness against
environmental changes and object movements. However, end-to-end systems are
quite fast during the test and inference and are pretty qualified for
real-world applications, even though their training phase could be longer than
the former ones. In this paper, a novel multi-modal end-to-end system for
large-scale indoor positioning has been proposed, namely APS (Alpha Positioning
System), which integrates a Pix2Pix GAN network to reconstruct the point cloud
pair of the input query image, with a deep CNN network in order to robustly
estimate the position and rotation information of the camera. For this
integration, the existing datasets have the shortcoming of paired RGB/point
cloud images for indoor environments. Therefore, we created a new dataset to
handle this situation. By implementing the proposed APS system, we could
achieve a highly accurate camera positioning with a precision level of less
than a centimeter.

  Communications Security, November 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data is the key factor to drive the development of machine learning (ML)
during the past decade. However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data,
is often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data,
self-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced.
The objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a
training sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their
representation space, while different views derived from different samples more
distant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative
representations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML
tasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to
various privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on
models trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative
representations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy
risks as well.
  In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning
through the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our
experimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are
less vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to
attribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to
the fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the
latter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples
expressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving
contrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training.
Empirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference
risks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and
model utility.

system capable of integrating such sources into a single heterogeneous graph,
leveraging Information Extraction (IE) techniques; users can then query the
graph by means of keywords, and explore query results and their neighborhood

unsupervised settings based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs), where during
training only clean data is used to train a generative model for speech, which
at test time is combined with a noise model, e.g. nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF), whose parameters are learned without supervision.
Consequently, the proposed model is agnostic to the noise type. When visual
data are clean, audio-visual VAE-based architectures usually outperform the
audio-only counterpart. The opposite happens when the visual data are corrupted
by clutter, e.g. the speaker not facing the camera. In this paper, we propose
to find the optimal combination of these two architectures through time. More
precisely, we introduce the use of a latent sequential variable with Markovian
dependencies to switch between different VAE architectures through time in an
unsupervised manner: leading to switching variational auto-encoder (SwVAE). We
propose a variational factorization to approximate the computationally
intractable posterior distribution. We also derive the corresponding
variational expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters of
the model and enhance the speech signal. Our experiments demonstrate the
promising performance of SwVAE.

RTSCV's effectiveness, using 7 benchmark tabular and computer vision datasets,

characteristic zero. We establish the structure of holonomic recurrence
equation, i.e. linear and homogeneous recurrence equations having polynomial

$mfoldHyper$, that extends van Hoeij's algorithm (1998) which computes a basis
of the subspace of hypergeometric $(m=1)$ term solutions of holonomic

  We generalize the concept of hypergeometric type power series introduced by
Koepf (1992), by considering linear combinations of Laurent-Puiseux series
whose coefficients are $m$-fold hypergeometric terms. Thus thanks to
$mfoldHyper$, we deduce a complete procedure to compute these power series;
indeed, it turns out that every linear combination of power series with
$m$-fold hypergeometric term coefficients, for finitely many values of $m$, is

  On the other hand, we investigate an algorithm to represent power series of
non-holonomic functions. The algorithm follows the same steps of Koepf's
algorithm, but instead of seeking holonomic differential equations, quadratic
differential equations are computed and the Cauchy product rule is used to
deduce recurrence equations for the power series coefficients. This algorithm
defines a normal function that yields together with enough initial values
normal forms for many power series of non-holonomic functions. Therefore,
non-trivial identities are automatically proved using this approach.

through enlarging the effective diffusive area, and inhibits anion transport by
electrostatic repulsion. Different areas of charged exterior surfaces have been
considered to mimic membranes with different porosities in practical
applications. Through adjusting the width of the charged ring region on the
surfaceL, electric power in single nanopores increases from 0.3 to 3.4 pW with
a plateau at the width of ~200 nm. The power density increases from 4200 to
4900 W/m2 and then decreases monotonously that reaches the commercial benchmark
at the charged width of ~480 nm. While, energy conversion efficiency can be

Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply
replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the
degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper,
we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in
deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping
and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We
evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet, DVS Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, and
show that SEW ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in
both accuracy and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher
performance by simply adding more layers, providing a simple method to train
deep SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training
deep SNNs with more than 100 layers becomes possible. Our codes are available

optimization is computationally prohibitive for the high-dimensional data, we
adopt a variational approximation, namely the variational information
bottleneck (VIB), to build a tractable upper bound. To reduce the communication
overhead, we leverage a sparsity-inducing distribution as the variational prior
for the VIB framework to sparsify the encoded feature vector. Furthermore,
considering dynamic channel conditions in practical communication systems, we
propose a variable-length feature encoding scheme based on dynamic neural
networks to adaptively adjust the activated dimensions of the encoded feature

possibility that the Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS), called Ingenuity, flying at
Mars as part of the Mars2020 Perseverance mission, will also become charged due
to grain-rotor triboelectric interactions. Given the low Martian atmospheric
pressure of ~ 5 Torr, the tribocharge on the blade could become intense enough
to stimulate gas breakdown near the surface of the rotorcraft. We modeled the
grain-blade interaction as a line of current that forms along the blade edge in
the region where grain-blade contacts are the greatest. This current then
spreads throughout the entire connected quasi-conductive regions of the
rotorcraft. Charge builds up on the craft and the dissipative pathway to remove
charge is back into the atmosphere. We find that for blade tribocharging
currents that form in an ambient atmospheric dust load, system current balance
and charge dissipation can be accomplished via the nominal atmospheric
conductive currents. However, at takeoff and landing, the rotorcraft could be
in a rotor-created particulate cloud, leading to local atmospheric electrical
breakdown near the rotorcraft. We especially note that the atmospheric currents
in the breakdown are not large enough to create any hazard to Ingenuity itself,

polaritons' confinement. Shrinking the polaritons' mode volume increases the
interactions mediated by their excitonic part, and thereby the
density-dependent blueshift of the polariton to a higher energy is enhanced.
Previously, polariton lasing has been demonstrated in micropillars with
diameters larger than three microns, in grating based cavities, fiber cavities

with one micron diameter operating in a single transverse mode that can be
optimally coupled to a singlemode fiber. We geometrically decouple the
excitation with an angle from the collection. From the number of collected
photons we calculate the number of polaritons and observe a blueshift large
enough to qualify our device for novel schemes of quantum light generation such
as the unconventional photon blockade. To that end, we also apply angled
excitation to polaritonic molecules and show site-selective excitation and

interactions may be direct (a contact between two nodes at some time instant),
or indirect, through sequences of contacts called temporal paths (journeys).
Deciding whether an entity can reach another through a journey is useful for
various applications in communication networks and epidemiology, among other
fields. In this paper, we present a data structure which maintains temporal
reachability information under the addition of new contacts (i.e., triplets
$(u,v,t)$ indicating that node $u$ and node $v$ interacted at time $t$). In
contrast to previous works, the contacts can be inserted in arbitrary order --
in particular, non-chronologically -- which corresponds to systems where the
information is collected a posteriori (e.g. when trying to reconstruct
contamination chains among people). The main component of our data structure is
a generalization of transitive closure called timed transitive closure (TTC),
which allows us to maintain reachability information relative to all nested
time intervals, without storing all these intervals, nor the journeys
themselves. TTCs are of independent interest and we study a number of their
general properties. Let $n$ be the number of nodes and $\tau$ be the number of
timestamps in the lifetime of the temporal graph. Our data structure answers
reachability queries regarding the existence of a journey from a given node to
another within given time interval in time $O(\log\tau)$; it has an amortized
insertion time of $O(n^2\log\tau)$; and it can reconstruct a valid journey that
witnesses reachability in time $O(k\log\tau)$, where $k<n$ is the maximum
number of edges of this journey. Finally, the space complexity of our
reachability data structure is $O(n^2\tau)$, which remains within the
worst-case size of the temporal graph itself.

occur at shocks via diffusive shock acceleration, and in turbulent flows via

distinct vertices in $ T $ is $ \sum_{t\in T}\lambda(t, T-t) $ where $\lambda $

sector of apple production, causing severe economical losses to producers.
Thus, we developed DSSApple, a picture-based decision support system able to
help users in the diagnosis of apple diseases. Specifically, this paper
addresses the problem of sequentially optimizing for the best diagnosis,
leveraging past interactions with the system and their contextual information
(i.e. the evidence provided by the users). The problem of learning an online
model while optimizing for its outcome is commonly addressed in the literature
through a stochastic active learning paradigm - i.e. Contextual Multi-Armed
Bandit (CMAB). This methodology interactively updates the decision model
considering the success of each past interaction with respect to the context
provided in each round. However, this information is very often partial and
inadequate to handle such complex decision making problems. On the other hand,
human decisions implicitly include unobserved factors (referred in the
literature as unobserved confounders) that significantly contribute to the
human's final decision. In this paper, we take advantage of the information
embedded in the observed human decisions to marginalize confounding factors and
improve the capability of the CMAB model to identify the correct diagnosis.
Specifically, we propose a Counterfactual Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit, a
model based on the causal concept of counterfactual. The proposed model is
validated with offline experiments based on data collected through a large user
study on the application. The results prove that our model is able to
outperform both traditional CMAB algorithms and observed user decisions, in
real-world tasks of predicting the correct apple disease.

complex power systems that facilitates root-cause tracing without requiring
disclosure of the full details of the internal control structure of apparatus
connected to the system. The grey-box enables participation analysis in
impedance models, which is popular in power electronics and increasingly
accepted in power systems for stability analysis. The Impedance participation
factor is proposed and defined in terms of the residue of the whole-system
admittance matrix. It is proved that, the so defined impedance participation
factor equals the sensitivity of the whole-system eigenvalue with respect to
apparatus impedance. The classic state participation factor is related to the
impedance participation factor via a chain-rule. Based on the chain-rule, a
three-layer grey-box approach, with three degrees of transparency, is proposed
for root-cause tracing to different depths, i.e. apparatus, states, and
parameters, according to the available information. The association of
impedance participation factor with eigenvalue sensitivity points to the
re-tuning that would stabilize the system. The impedance participation factor
can be measured in the field or calculated from the black-box impedance spectra

two different mechanisms - one that involves the charm Yukawa coupling and the
other that involves direct Higgs coupling to gluons. The interference of the
two contributions requires a helicity flip and, therefore, cannot be computed
with massless charm quarks. In this paper, we consider QCD corrections to the
interference contribution starting from charm-gluon collisions with massive
charm quarks and taking the massless limit, $m_c \to 0$. The behavior of QCD
cross sections in that limit differs from expectations based on the canonical
QCD factorization. This implies that QCD corrections to the interference term
necessarily involve logarithms of the ratio $M_H/m_c$ whose resummation is
currently unknown. Although the explicit next-to-leading order QCD computation
does confirm the presence of up to two powers of $\ln(M_H/m_c)$ in the
interference contribution, their overall impact on the magnitude of QCD

However, a big
progress has been achieved in recent years due to the good quality data
provided by current and recent cosmic-rays observatories. The cosmic ray flux
decreases very fast with energy in such a way that for energies $\gtrsim
10^{15}$ eV, the study of these very energetic particles is performed by using
ground based detectors. These detectors are able to detect the atmospheric air
showers generated by the cosmic rays as a consequence of their interactions
with the molecules of the Earth's atmosphere. One of the most important
observables that can help to understand the origin of the cosmic rays is the
composition profile as a function of primary energy. Since the primary particle
cannot be observed directly, its chemical composition has to be inferred from
parameters of the showers that are very sensitive to the primary mass. The two
parameters more sensitive to the composition of the primary are the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum and the muon content of the showers. Past and
current cosmic-rays observatories have been using muon counters with the main
purpose of measuring the muon content of the showers. Motivated by this fact,
in this work we study in detail the estimation of the number of muons that hit
a muon counter, which is limited by the number of segments of the counters and
by the pile-up effect. We consider as study cases muon counters with
segmentation corresponding to the underground muon detectors of the Pierre
Auger Observatory that are currently taking data, and the one corresponding to
the muon counters of the AGASA Observatory, which stopped taking data in 2004.

expensive, and often burdensome on patients. More importantly, clinical trials
face uncertain outcomes due to issues with efficacy, safety, or problems with
patient recruitment. If we were better at predicting the results of clinical
trials, we could avoid having to run trials that will inevitably fail more
resources could be devoted to trials that are likely to succeed. In this paper,
we propose Hierarchical INteraction Network (HINT) for more general, clinical
trial outcome predictions for all diseases based on a comprehensive and diverse
set of web data including molecule information of the drugs, target disease
information, trial protocol and biomedical knowledge. HINT first encode these
multi-modal data into latent embeddings, where an imputation module is designed
to handle missing data. Next, these embeddings will be fed into the knowledge
embedding module to generate knowledge embeddings that are pretrained using
external knowledge on pharmaco-kinetic properties and trial risk from the web.
Then the interaction graph module will connect all the embedding via domain
knowledge to fully capture various trial components and their complex relations
as well as their influences on trial outcomes. Finally, HINT learns a dynamic
attentive graph neural network to predict trial outcome. Comprehensive
experimental results show that HINT achieves strong predictive performance,
obtaining 0.772, 0.607, 0.623, 0.703 on PR-AUC for Phase I, II, III, and
indication outcome prediction, respectively. It also consistently outperforms
the best baseline method by up to 12.4\% on PR-AUC.

repeating FRBs may provide useful information about their nature due to their
redetectability. The two most famous repeating sources are FRBs 121102 and
180916, with a period of 157 days and 16.35 days, respectively. Previous
studies suggest that the periodicity of FRBs is likely associated with neutron
star (NS) binary systems. Here we introduce a new model which proposes that
periodic repeating FRBs are due to the interaction of a NS with its planet in a
highly elliptical orbit. The periastron of the planet is very close to the NS
so that it would be partially disrupted by tidal force every time it passes
through the periastron. Fragments generated in the process could interact with
the compact star through the Alfv\'{e}n wing mechanism and produce FRBs. The
model can naturally explain the repeatability of FRBs with a period ranging
from a few days to several hundred days, but it generally requires that the
eccentricity of the planet's orbit should be large enough. Taking FRBs 121102
and 180916 as examples, it is shown that the main features of the observed
repeating behaviors can be satisfactorily accounted for.

presence of intensity pulsations that vary as a function of time. Known as
quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), these variations in flux appear to include
periodic components and characteristic time-scales. Here, we analyse a GOES
M3.7 class flare exhibiting pronounced QPPs across a broad band of wavelengths
using imaging and time-series analysis. We identify QPPs in the timeseries of
X-ray, low frequency radio and EUV wavelengths using wavelet analysis, and
localise the region of the flare site from which the QPPs originate via X-ray
and EUV imaging. It was found that the pulsations within the 171 \.A, 1600 \.A,
soft X-ray (SXR), and hard X-ray (HXR) light curves yielded similar periods of
$\sim$122 s, $\sim$131s, $\sim$123 s, and $\sim$137 s, respectively, indicating
a common progenitor. The low frequency radio emission at 2.5 MHz contained a
longer period of $\sim$231 s. Imaging analysis indicates that the location of
the X-ray and EUV pulsations originates from a HXR footpoint linked to a system
of nearby open magnetic field lines. Our results suggest that intermittent
particle acceleration, likely due to 'bursty' magnetic reconnection, is
responsible for the QPPs. The precipitating electrons accelerated towards the
chromosphere produce the X-ray and EUV pulsations, while the escaping electrons
result in low frequency radio pulses in the form of type III radio bursts. The
modulation of the reconnection process, resulting in episodic particle
acceleration, explains the presence of these QPPs across the entire spatial
range of flaring emission.

  Small Data regime",,,,,"physics.comp-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The data-based discovery of effective, coarse-grained (CG) models of
high-dimensional dynamical systems presents a unique challenge in computational
physics and particularly in the context of multiscale problems. The present
paper offers a probabilistic perspective that simultaneously identifies
predictive, lower-dimensional coarse-grained (CG) variables as well as their
dynamics. We make use of the expressive ability of deep neural networks in
order to represent the right-hand side of the CG evolution law. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how domain knowledge that is very often available in the form of
physical constraints (e.g. conservation laws) can be incorporated with the
novel concept of virtual observables. Such constraints, apart from leading to
physically realistic predictions, can significantly reduce the requisite amount
of training data which enables reducing the amount of required, computationally
expensive multiscale simulations (Small Data regime). The proposed state-space
model is trained using probabilistic inference tools and, in contrast to
several other techniques, does not require the prescription of a fine-to-coarse
(restriction) projection nor time-derivatives of the state variables. The
formulation adopted is capable of quantifying the predictive uncertainty as
well as of reconstructing the evolution of the full, fine-scale system which
allows to select the quantities of interest a posteriori. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed framework in a high-dimensional system of moving
particles.

learning models frequently necessitate the use of powerful cloud-based
infrastructure for their training. Binary neural networks are known to be
promising candidates for on-device inference due to their extreme compute and
memory savings over higher-precision alternatives. However, their existing
training methods require the concurrent storage of high-precision activations
for all layers, generally making learning on memory-constrained devices
infeasible. In this article, we demonstrate that the backward propagation
operations needed for binary neural network training are strongly robust to
quantization, thereby making on-the-edge learning with modern models a
practical proposition. We introduce a low-cost binary neural network training
strategy exhibiting sizable memory footprint reductions while inducing little
to no accuracy loss vs Courbariaux & Bengio's standard approach. These
decreases are primarily enabled through the retention of activations
exclusively in binary format. Against the latter algorithm, our drop-in
replacement sees memory requirement reductions of 3--5$\times$, while reaching
similar test accuracy in comparable time, across a range of small-scale models
trained to classify popular datasets. We also demonstrate from-scratch ImageNet
training of binarized ResNet-18, achieving a 3.78$\times$ memory reduction. Our
work is open-source, and includes the Raspberry Pi-targeted prototype we used
to verify our modeled memory decreases and capture the associated energy drops.
Such savings will allow for unnecessary cloud offloading to be avoided,
reducing latency, increasing energy efficiency, and safeguarding end-user
privacy.

in many research areas, including applied statistics, behavioral, social, and

rating scales have progressively been adopted to overcome some of the
limitations of standard rating scales, including their inability to disentangle
decision uncertainty from individual responses. The aim of this article is to
provide a novel fuzzy scaling procedure which uses Item Response Theory trees

In so doing, fuzziness of rating data is modeled using the overall rater's
pattern of responses instead of being computed using a single-item based
approach. This offers a consistent system for interpreting fuzziness in terms
of individual-based decision uncertainty. A simulation study and two empirical
applications are adopted to assess the characteristics of the proposed model

introducing neutrino self-interactions via a simple Majoron-like coupling. The
scalar is slightly heavier than $1~{\rm MeV}$ and allowed to be fully

entropy transfer via $\phi \to \nu\overline{\nu}$ reactions compensates the

desirable to also learn as much as possible from the failing tests in the

necessary to revoke them. In practice, the problem of secure certificate
revocation has not yet been solved, and today no revocation procedure (similar
to Certificate Transparency w.r.t. certificate issuance) has been adopted to
provide transparent and immutable history of all revocations. Instead, the
status of most certificates can only be checked with Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) and/or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). In this paper, we
present the first longitudinal characterization of the revocation statuses
delivered by CRLs and OCSP servers from the time of certificate expiration to
status disappearance. The analysis captures the status history of over 1
million revoked certificates, including 773K certificates mass-revoked by Let's
Encrypt. Our characterization provides a new perspective on the Internet's
revocation rates, quantifies how short-lived the revocation statuses are,
highlights differences in revocation practices within and between different
CAs, and captures biases and oddities in the handling of revoked certificates.
Combined, the findings motivate the development and adoption of a revocation
transparency standard.

significantly increases the space and time scales associated with interparticle
correlations. The physical mechanism responsible is a channeling effect whereby
particles are confined to move along narrow cylinders with a width
characterized by the gyroradius and a length characterized by the collision
mean free path. The predominant interaction is $180^\circ$ collisions at the
ends of the collision cylinders, resulting in a long-range correlation parallel
to the magnetic field. Its influence is demonstrated via the dependence of the
velocity autocorrelation functions and self-diffusion coefficients on the
domain size and run time in simulations of the one-component plasma. A very
large number of particles, and therefore domain size, must be used to resolve
the long-range correlations, suggesting that the number of charged particles in
the collection must increase in order to constitute a plasma. Correspondingly,
this effect significantly delays the time it takes to reach a diffusive regime,
in which the mean square displacement of particles increases linearly in time.
This result presents challenges for connecting measurements in non-neutral and
ultracold neutral plasma experiments, as well as molecular dynamics
simulations, with fluid transport properties due to their finite size.

Current WF attacks based on deep learning classifiers have successfully

  We propose Dolos, a system that modifies user network traffic in real time to
successfully evade WF attacks. Dolos injects dummy packets into traffic traces
by computing input-agnostic adversarial patches that disrupt deep learning
classifiers used in WF attacks. Patches are then applied to alter and protect
user traffic in real time. Importantly, these patches are parameterized by a
user-side secret, ensuring that attackers cannot use adversarial training to
defeat Dolos. We experimentally demonstrate that Dolos provides 94+% protection
against state-of-the-art WF attacks under a variety of settings. Against prior
defenses, Dolos outperforms in terms of higher protection performance and lower
information leakage and bandwidth overhead. Finally, we show that Dolos is
robust against a variety of adaptive countermeasures to detect or disrupt the

a cross-subject EEG classification framework with a generative adversarial

adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator to obtain
high-quality data for augmentation. A particular module in the discriminator
was employed to maintain the spatial features of the EEG signals and increase
the difference between different categories, with two losses for further
enhancement. Through adaptive training with sufficient augmentation data, our
cross-subject classification accuracy yielded a significant improvement of
15.85% than leave-one subject-out (LOO) test and 8.57% than just adapting 100

the varying geographical environments have posed challenges for scalable

label is scarce. The framework adopts the result of single-object instance
segmentation from the orthodox Mask R-CNN. Further, it classifies the rural
buildings into new and old ones based on a dynamic grayscale threshold inferred
from the result of a two-object instance segmentation task where training data
is scarce. We found that the framework can extract more buildings and achieve a
much higher mean Average Precision (mAP) than the orthodox Mask R-CNN model. We
tested the novel framework's performance with increasing training data and
found that it converged even when the training samples were limited. This
framework's main contribution is to allow scalable segmentation by using
significantly fewer training samples than traditional machine learning
practices. That makes mapping China's new and old rural buildings viable.

important roles in wide variety of applications, from nondestructive test to
medical diagnosis. Current AMMW imaging systems have a high spatial resolution
and can realize three-dimensional (3D) imaging. However, conventional AMMW
imaging systems based on the synthetic aperture require either time-consume
acquisition or reconstruction. The AMMW imaging systems based on real-aperture
are able to real-time imaging but they need a large aperture and a complex
two-dimensional (2D) scan structure to get 3D images. Besides, most AMMW
imaging systems need the targets keep still and hold a special posture while
screening, limiting the throughput. Here, by using beam control techniques and
fast post-processing algorithms, we demonstrate the AMMW 3D scan real-time
imaging mechanism with a line antenna array, which can realize 3D real-time
imaging by a simple one-dimensional (1D) linear moving, simultaneously, with a
satisfactory throughput (over 2000 people per-hour, 10 times than the
commercial AMMW imaging systems) and a low system cost. First, the original
spherical beam lines generated by the linear antenna array are modulated to fan
beam lines via a bi-convex cylindrical lens. Then the holographic imaging
algorithm is used to primarily focus the echo data of the imaged object.
Finally, the defocus blur is corrected rapidly to get high resolution images by
deconvolution. Since our method does not need targets to keep still, has a low
system cost, can achieve 3D real-time imaging with a satisfactory throughput
simultaneously, this work has the potential to serve as a foundation for future
short-range AMMW imaging systems, which can be used in a variety of fields such
as security inspection, medical diagnosis, etc.

However, pre-pandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results

the studies' recognized limitations have not been quantitatively and
statistically analyzed, leading to confusion regarding the effectiveness of
masks. Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and
CDC initially not recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show
that when the adherence to mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the
empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all
studies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were
under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the
studies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically
significant effect. We also provide a framework for understanding the effect of
masks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The
framework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides
super-linearly compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and
infected individual wearing a mask. This work shows (1) that both theoretical
and empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting against respiratory
infections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations
regarding the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken
into account when designing empirical studies and interpreting their results.

engine: 1) expansion mode and 2) deep-net mode. In expansion mode, the
resolution of the network is doubled by increasing the number of inputs for a
given chip area, reducing IR drop by 22%. In deep-net mode, inference speed
per-10-bit convolution is improved by 29\% by simultaneously using one
TiO2/TiO2-x layer for read processes, and the other for write processes. We
experimentally verify both modes on our $10\times10\times2$ array.

  sciences",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The Hybrid Technology Hub and many other research centers work in
cross-functional teams whose workflow is not necessarily linear and where in
many cases technology advances are done through parallel work. The lack of
proper tools and platforms for a collaborative environment can create time lags
in coordination and limited sharing of research findings. To solve this, we
have developed a simple, user-friendly platform built for academic and
scientific research collaboration. To ensure FAIRness compliance, the platform
consists of a metadata quality control based on blockchain technologies. The
data is stored separately in a distributed object storage that functions as a
cloud. The platform also implements a version control system; it provides a
history track of the project along with the possibility of reviewing the
project's development. This platform aims to be a standardized tool within the
Hybrid Technology Hub to ease collaboration, speed research workflow and
improve research quality.

for Algerian Arabic newspapers comments. The developed approach has to enhance
an existing approach by the enrichment of the available corpus and the
inclusion of the annotation step by following the Model Annotate Train Test
Evaluate Revise (MATTER) approach. A corpus is created by collecting comments
from web sites of three well know Algerian newspapers. Three classifiers,
support vector machines, na{\""i}ve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors, were used
for classification of comments into positive and negative classes. To identify
the influence of the stemming in the obtained results, the classification was
tested with and without stemming. Obtained results show that stemming does not
enhance considerably the classification due to the nature of Algerian comments
tied to Algerian Arabic Dialect. The promising results constitute a motivation
for us to improve our approach especially in dealing with non Arabic sentences,
especially Dialectal and French ones.

dependent radiation patterns. We place binary hypothesis tests on theoretical
models of such radiation patterns to screen cylindrically symmetric sources
(like explosions) from non-symmetric sources (like non-vertical dip-slip, or
non-VDS faults). These models for data include sources with several unknown
parameters, contaminated by Gaussian noise and embedded in a layered
half-space. The generalized maximum likelihood ratio tests that we derive from
these data models produce screening statistics and decision rules that depend
on measured, noisy ground motion at discrete sensor locations. We explicitly
quantify how the screening power of these statistics increase with the size of
any dip-slip and strike-slip components of the source, relative to noise
(faulting signal strength), and how they vary with network geometry. As
applications of our theory, we apply these tests to (1) find optimal sensor
locations that maximize the probability of screening non-circular radiation
patterns, and (2) invert for the largest non-VDS faulting signal that could be
mistakenly attributed to an explosion with damage, at a particular attribution
probability. Lastly, we quantify how certain errors that are sourced by opening
cracks increase screening rate errors. While such theoretical solutions are
ideal and require future validation, they remain important in underground
explosion monitoring scenarios because they provide fundamental physical limits
on the discrimination power of tests that screen explosive from non-VDS
faulting sources.

form upper bound on the capacity of binary deletion channel. The first upper
bound is based on computing the capacity of an auxiliary channel and we show
how the capacity of auxiliary channel is the upper bound of the binary deletion
channel. Our main idea for the second bound is based on computing the mutual
information between the sent bits and the received bits in binary deletion
channel. We approximate the exact mutual information and we give a close form
expression. All bounds utilize first-order Markov process for the channel
input. The second proposed upper bound improves the best upper bound [6,11] up
to 0.1.
