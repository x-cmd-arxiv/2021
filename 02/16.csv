very recently which, informally speaking, extends the DPLL method by branching
on integer linear inequalities instead of single variables. The techniques
known so far to prove size and depth lower bounds for Stabbing Planes are
generalizations of those used for the Cutting Planes proof system established
via communication complexity arguments. As such they work for the lifted
version of combinatorial statements. Rank lower bounds for Cutting Planes are
also obtained by geometric arguments called protection lemmas.
  In this work we introduce two new geometric approaches to prove size/depth
lower bounds in Stabbing Planes working for any formula: (1) the antichain
method, relying on Sperner's Theorem and (2) the covering method which uses
results on essential coverings of the boolean cube by linear polynomials, which
in turn relies on Alon's combinatorial Nullenstellensatz.
  We demonstrate their use on classes of combinatorial principles such as the
Pigeonhole principle, the Tseitin contradictions and the Linear Ordering
Principle. By the first method we prove almost linear size lower bounds and
optimal logarithmic depth lower bounds for the Pigeonhole principle and
analogous lower bounds for the Tseitin contradictions over the complete graph
and for the Linear Ordering Principle. By the covering method we obtain a
superlinear size lower bound and a logarithmic depth lower bound for Stabbing
Planes proof of Tseitin contradictions over a grid graph.

  Normalization","Accepted at ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL) strives to enable
collaborative training of deep models on the network edge without centrally
aggregating raw data and hence improving data privacy. In most cases, the
assumption of independent and identically distributed samples across local
clients does not hold for federated learning setups. Under this setting, neural
network training performance may vary significantly according to the data
distribution and even hurt training convergence. Most of the previous work has
focused on a difference in the distribution of labels or client shifts. Unlike
those settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different
scanners/sensors in medical imaging, different scenery distribution in
autonomous driving (highway vs. city), where local clients store examples with
different distributions compared to other clients, which we denote as feature
shift non-iid. In this work, we propose an effective method that uses local
batch normalization to alleviate the feature shift before averaging models. The
resulting scheme, called FedBN, outperforms both classical FedAvg, as well as
the state-of-the-art for non-iid data (FedProx) on our extensive experiments.
These empirical results are supported by a convergence analysis that shows in a
simplified setting that FedBN has a faster convergence rate than FedAvg. Code

synchronously and the probability for one cell to be $0$ or $1$ at time $t$
depends only on the value of the same cell and that of its neighbors at time
$t-1$. These very simple models show a very rich behavior strongly depending on
the choice of the two Elementary Cellular Automata that are randomly mixed
together and on the parameter which governs probabilistically the mixture. In
particular, we study the existence of phase transition for the whole set of
possible DECA obtained by mixing the null rule which associates $0$ to any
possible local configuration, with any of the other $255$ elementary rule. We
approach the problem analytically via a Mean Field approximation and via the
use of a rigorous approach based on the application of the Dobrushin Criterion.
The distinguishing trait of our result is the possibility to describe the
behavior of the whole set of considered DECA without exploiting the local
properties of the individual models. The results that we find are coherent with
numerical studies already published in the scientific literature and also with

first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL.} First, we propose a
rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the
investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. Then,
we compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our
findings show that, depending on the configuration, FL can emit up to two order
of magnitude more carbon than centralized machine learning. However, in certain
settings, it can be comparable to centralized learning due to the reduced
energy consumption of embedded devices. We performed extensive experiments
across different types of datasets, settings and various deep learning models

challenges and trends in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including
algorithms efficiency, hardware capabilities, and stronger industry

in a detailed study of the time-reversal symmetric two-band model. The
nonlinear conductivity is decomposed as a sum of contributions related with
different regions of the First Brillouin Zone, defined by single or multiphoton
resonances. All contributions are written in terms of the same integrals, which
contain all information specific to the particular model under study. In this
way, ready-to-use formulas are provided that reduce the often tedious
calculations of the second and third order optical conductivity to the
evaluation of a small set of similar integrals. In the scenario where charge
carriers are present prior to optical excitation, Fermi surface contributions
must also be considered and are shown to have an universal frequency
dependence, tunable by doping. General characteristics are made evident in this
type of resonance-based analysis: the existence of step functions that
determine the chemical potential dependence of electron-hole symmetric
insulators; the determination of the imaginary part by Hilbert transforms,
simpler than those of the nonlinear Kramers-Kr\""{o}nig relations; the absence
of Drude peaks in the diagonal elements of the second order conductivity, among

aqueous reactions in the early solar system. A number of CM chondrites also
experienced short-lived, post-hydration thermal metamorphism at temperatures of
200C to over 750C. The exact conditions of thermal metamorphism and the
relationship between the unheated and heated CM chondrites are not well
constrained but are crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of
hydrous asteroids. Here we have used position-sensitive-detector X-ray
diffraction (PSD-XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission
infrared (IR) spectroscopy to characterise the mineralogy and water contents of
14 heated CM and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites. We show that heated CM
chondrites underwent the same degree of aqueous alteration as the unheated CMs,
however upon thermal metamorphism their mineralogy initially (300 to 500C)
changed from hydrated phyllosilicates to a dehydrated amorphous phyllosilicate
phase. At higher temperatures (over 500C) we observe recrystallisation of
olivine and Fe-sulphides and the formation of metal. Thermal metamorphism also
caused the water contents of heated CM chondrites to decrease from 13 wt
percent to 3 wt percent and a subsequent reduction in the intensity of the 3
micron feature in IR spectra. We estimate that the heated CM chondrites have
lost 15 to 65 percent of the water they contained at the end of aqueous
alteration. If impacts were the main cause of metamorphism, this is consistent
with shock pressures of 20 to 50 GPa. However, not all heated CM chondrites
retain shock features suggesting that some were instead heated by solar
radiation. Evidence from the Hayabusa2 and ORSIRS-REx missions suggest that
dehydrated materials may be common on the surfaces of primitive asteroids and

Hence, it is vital to capture these category information trends at scale, with
high precision and recall. In this paper, we focus on a specific use-case where
a single category drives each transaction. We propose a cost-effective
transaction classification approach based on semi-supervision and knowledge
distillation frameworks. The approach identifies the category of a transaction
using free text input given by the customer. We use weak labelling and notice
that the performance gains are similar to that of using human-annotated

RoBERTa performs the best for the categorization tasks. Further, using an

and better performance over unadapted ALBERT. This framework, with ALBERT as a

closure terms are parametrized in terms of the spatial neighborhood of the
resolved quantities but also their history. The data-driven scheme is
complemented with a physical constrain expressing the energy conservation
property of the nonlinear advection terms. We show that the adoption of this
physical constrain not only increases the accuracy of the closure scheme but
also improves the stability properties of the formulated coarse-scale model. We
demonstrate the presented scheme in fluid flows consisting of an incompressible
two-dimensional turbulent jet. Specifically, we first develop one-dimensional
coarse-scale models describing the spatial profile of the jet. We then proceed
to the computation of turbulent closures appropriate for two-dimensional
coarse-scale models. Training data are obtained through high-fidelity direct
numerical simulations (DNS). We also showcase how the developed scheme captures
the coarse-scale features of the concentration fields associated with inertial
tracers, such as bubbles and particles, carried by the flow but not following
the flow. We thoroughly examine the generalizability properties of the trained
closure models for different Reynolds numbers, as well as, radically different
jet profiles from the ones used in the training phase. We also examine the
robustness of the derived closures with respect to the grid size. Overall the
adoption of the constraint results in an average improvement of 26% for
one-dimensional closures and 29% for two-dimensional closures, being notably

accuracy by comparing the predicted classes of unassociated sources in 3FGL

find that in the two-class case it is important to correct for the presence of
OTHER sources among the unassociated ones in order to realistically estimate
the number of pulsars and AGNs. We find that the three-class classification,
despite different types of sources in the OTHER class, has a similar
performance as the two-class classification in terms of reliability diagrams
and, at the same time, it does not require adjustment due to presence of the
OTHER sources among the unassociated sources. We show an example of the use of
the probabilistic catalogs for population studies, which include associated and
unassociated sources.

light wavelength, it will sample the full beam profile during excitation with
profound consequences on optical excitations. Using nanooligomers as model
nanosystems, we show that structured light excites optical transitions that are
forbidden for linearly polarized or unpolarized light. Such dipole forbidden
modes have longer lifetimes and narrower resonances than dipole allowed
transitions. We derive symmetry-adapted eigenmodes for nanooligomers containing
up to six monomers. Our study includes tables with selection rules for
cylindrical vector beams, for beams with orbital angular momentum, and for
field retardation along the propagation direction. We discuss multi-photon
processes of nonlinear optics in addition to one-photon absorption. Structured
light will unlock a broad range of excitations in nanooligomers and other
nanostructures that are currently inaccessible to optical studies.

sequential decision making which combines the standard MDP formulation with
causal structures over state transition and reward functions. Many contemporary
and emerging application areas such as digital healthcare and digital marketing
can benefit from modeling with C-MDPs due to the causal mechanisms underlying
the relationship between interventions and states/rewards. We propose the
causal upper confidence bound value iteration (C-UCBVI) algorithm that exploits
the causal structure in C-MDPs and improves the performance of standard
reinforcement learning algorithms that do not take causal knowledge into
account. We prove that C-UCBVI satisfies an $\tilde{O}(HS\sqrt{ZT})$ regret
bound, where $T$ is the the total time steps, $H$ is the episodic horizon, and
$S$ is the cardinality of the state space. Notably, our regret bound does not
scale with the size of actions/interventions ($A$), but only scales with a
causal graph dependent quantity $Z$ which can be exponentially smaller than
$A$. By extending C-UCBVI to the factored MDP setting, we propose the causal
factored UCBVI (CF-UCBVI) algorithm, which further reduces the regret
exponentially in terms of $S$. Furthermore, we show that RL algorithms for
linear MDP problems can also be incorporated in C-MDPs. We empirically show the
benefit of our causal approaches in various settings to validate our algorithms

  Fellowship of Communication and Sensing","26 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless communication at the terahertz (THz) frequency bands (0.1-10THz) is
viewed as one of the cornerstones of tomorrow's 6G wireless systems. Owing to
the large amount of available bandwidth, THz frequencies can potentially
provide wireless capacity performance gains and enable high-resolution sensing.
However, operating a wireless system at the THz-band is limited by a highly
uncertain channel. Effectively, these channel limitations lead to unreliable
intermittent links as a result of a short communication range, and a high
susceptibility to blockage and molecular absorption. Consequently, such
impediments could disrupt the THz band's promise of high-rate communications
and high-resolution sensing capabilities. In this context, this paper
panoramically examines the steps needed to efficiently deploy and operate
next-generation THz wireless systems that will synergistically support a
fellowship of communication and sensing services. For this purpose, we first
set the stage by describing the fundamentals of the THz frequency band. Based
on these fundamentals, we characterize seven unique defining features of THz
wireless systems: 1) Quasi-opticality of the band, 2) THz-tailored wireless
architectures, 3) Synergy with lower frequency bands, 4) Joint sensing and
communication systems, 5) PHY-layer procedures, 6) Spectrum access techniques,
and 7) Real-time network optimization. These seven defining features allow us
to shed light on how to re-engineer wireless systems as we know them today so
as to make them ready to support THz bands. Furthermore, these features
highlight how THz systems turn every communication challenge into a sensing
opportunity. Ultimately, the goal of this article is to chart a forward-looking
roadmap that exposes the necessary solutions and milestones for enabling THz
frequencies to realize their potential as a game changer for next-generation
wireless systems.

superconductivity. Although it is often difficult to completely achieve the
aforementioned goal, the existence of superconducting nodes, one of the few
important experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity, plays a
vital role in exploring the possibility of unconventional superconductivity.
The interplay between superconducting nodes and topology has been actively
investigated, and intensive research in the past decade has revealed various
intriguing nodes out of the scope of the pioneering work to classify
superconducting order parameters based on the point groups. However, a
systematic and unified description of superconducting nodes for arbitrary
symmetry settings is still elusive. In this paper, we develop a systematic
framework to comprehensively classify superconducting nodes pinned to any line
in momentum space. While most previous studies have been based on the homotopy
theory, our theory is on the basis of the symmetry-based analysis of band
topology, which enables systematic diagnoses of nodes in all nonmagnetic and
magnetic space groups. Furthermore, our framework can readily provide a highly
effective scheme to detect nodes in a given superconductor by using density
functional theory and assuming symmetry properties of Cooper pairs (called
pairing symmetries), which can reduce candidates of pairing symmetries. We
substantiate the power of our method through the time-reversal broken and
noncentrosymmetric superconductor CaPtAs. Our work establishes a unified theory
for understanding superconducting nodes and facilitates determining
superconducting gaps in materials combined with experimental observations.

aligned, with the stellar equator parallel to the disk plane. When observations
reveal a misalignment between stellar rotation and the orbital motion of a
planet, the usual interpretation is that the initial alignment was upset by
gravitational perturbations that took place after planet formation. Most of the
previously known misalignments involve isolated hot Jupiters, for which
planet-planet scattering or secular effects from a wider-orbiting planet are
the leading explanations. In theory, star/disk misalignments can result from
turbulence during star formation or the gravitational torque of a wide-orbiting
companion star, but no definite examples of this scenario are known. An ideal
example would combine a coplanar system of multiple planets -- ruling out
planet-planet scattering or other disruptive post-formation events -- with a
backward-rotating star, a condition that is easier to obtain from a primordial
misalignment than from post-formation perturbations. There are two previously
known examples of a misaligned star in a coplanar multi-planet system, but in
neither case has a suitable companion star been identified, nor is the stellar
rotation known to be retrograde. Here, we show that the star K2-290 A is tilted
by $124\pm 6$ degrees compared to the orbits of both of its known planets, and
has a wide-orbiting stellar companion that is capable of having tilted the
protoplanetary disk. The system provides the clearest demonstration that stars
and protoplanetary disks can become grossly misaligned due to the gravitational
torque from a neighbouring star.

signals that are not explained by known physics. In this paper, we aim to
search for new signals that appear as deviations from known Standard Model
physics in high-dimensional particle physics data. To do this, we determine
whether there is any statistically significant difference between the
distribution of Standard Model background samples and the distribution of the
experimental observations, which are a mixture of the background and a
potential new signal. Traditionally, one also assumes access to a sample from a
model for the hypothesized signal distribution. Here we instead investigate a
model-independent method that does not make any assumptions about the signal
and uses a semi-supervised classifier to detect the presence of the signal in
the experimental data. We construct three test statistics using the classifier:
an estimated likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, a test based on the area
under the ROC curve (AUC), and a test based on the misclassification error
(MCE). Additionally, we propose a method for estimating the signal strength
parameter and explore active subspace methods to interpret the proposed
semi-supervised classifier in order to understand the properties of the
detected signal. We also propose a Score test statistic that can be used in the
model-dependent setting. We investigate the performance of the methods on a
simulated data set related to the search for the Higgs boson at the Large

power competitive with the classical supervised methods for a well-specified
signal, but much higher power for an unexpected signal which might be entirely

be quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when
designing learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use
various testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning
literature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern
gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant
impact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in
many instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less
catastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We
empirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying
catastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning
systems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the
metric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to
change the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic
forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in
supervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics
concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the
very least-be measured with pairwise interference.

Assigning optimal priority values to tasks is critical to allow the tasks to
complete their executions while maximizing safety margins from their specified
deadlines. This enables real-time systems to tolerate unexpected overheads in
task executions and still meet their deadlines. In practice, priority
assignments result from an interactive process between the development and
testing teams. In this article, we propose an automated method that aims to
identify the best possible priority assignments in real-time systems,
accounting for multiple objectives regarding safety margins and engineering
constraints. Our approach is based on a multi-objective, competitive
coevolutionary algorithm mimicking the interactive priority assignment process
between the development and testing teams. We evaluate our approach by applying
it to six industrial systems from different domains and several synthetic
systems. The results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms both
our baselines, i.e., random search and sequential search, and solutions defined
by practitioners.Our approach scales to complex industrial systems as an
offline analysis method that attempts to find near-optimal solutions within
acceptable time, i.e., less than 16 hours.

computation has structural parallels to replica wormholes, relies crucially on
ensemble averaging at each epoch, and reveals the interplay between the
multiple time-scales in the problem. Working with the ensemble averaged $state$

""paradox"". Our system provides a concrete example in which the ensemble
underlying the semi-classical Page curve is an ergodic proxy for a time
average, and not an explicit average over many theories. The questions we
address here are logically independent of the existence of horizons, so we
expect that semi-classical gravity should also be viewed in a similar light.

can be understood as the entanglement between the two subsystems being weak.
From this point of view, we may say that if it is not possible to transform a
state $\omega$ via sufficiently local automorphisms (in a sense that we will
make precise) into a state satisfying the split property, then the state
$\omega$ has a long-range entanglement. It is well known that in 1D, gapped
ground states have the split property with respect to cutting the system into
left and right half-chains. In 2D, however, the split property fails to hold
for interesting models such as Kitaev's toric code. In fact, we will show that
this failure is the reason that anyons can exist in that model.
  There is a folklore saying that the existence of anyons, like in the toric
code model, implies long-range entanglement of the state. In this paper, we
prove this folklore in an infinite dimensional setting. More precisely, we show
that long-range entanglement, in a way that we will define precisely, is a
necessary condition to have non-trivial superselection sectors. Anyons in
particular give rise to such non-trivial sectors. States with the split
property for cones, on the other hand, do not admit non-trivial sectors.
  A key technical ingredient of our proof is that under suitable assumptions on
locality, the automorphisms generated by local interactions can be
'approximately factorized': they can be written as the tensor product of
automorphisms localized in a cone and its complement respectively, followed by
an automorphism acting near the 'boundary' of $\Lambda$, and conjugation with a
unitary. This result may be of independent interest. This technique also allows
us to prove that the approximate split property, a weaker version of the split
property that is satisfied in e.g. the toric code, is stable under applying
such automorphisms.

amount of contamination $O(\log T)$. This amount of contamination is also
necessary, as we prove that there exists an $O(\log T)$ regret bandit
algorithm, specifically the classical UCB, that requires $\Omega(\log T)$
amount of contamination to suffer regret $\Omega(T)$. To combat such attacks,
our second main contribution is to propose verification based mechanisms, which
use limited verification to access a limited number of uncontaminated rewards.
In particular, for the case of unlimited verifications, we show that with
$O(\log T)$ expected number of verifications, a simple modified version of the
ETC type bandit algorithm can restore the order optimal $O(\log T)$ regret
irrespective of the amount of contamination used by the attacker. We also
provide a UCB-like verification scheme, called Secure-UCB, that also enjoys
full recovery from any attacks, also with $O(\log T)$ expected number of

we prove that for any order-optimal bandit algorithm, this number of

regret. On the other hand, when the number of verifications is bounded above by
a budget $B$, we propose a novel algorithm, Secure-BARBAR, which provably
achieves $O(\min\{C,T/\sqrt{B} \})$ regret with high probability against weak

glass or ceramic in these architectured materials lack inelastic deformation
capabilities and thus rely on the soft interface material that bonds together
these building blocks to achieve large deformation and high toughness. Here, we
demonstrate the concept of achieving large inelastic deformation and high
energy dissipation in soft materials by embedding microstructured thermoplastic
fibers with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths in a widely used elastomer.
The microstructured fibers are fabricated by harnessing the fluid-mechanical
instability of a molten polycarbonate (PC) thread on a commercial 3D printer.
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resin is infiltrated around the fibers, creating a
soft composite after curing. The failure mechanism and damage tolerance of the
composite are analyzed through fracture tests. The high energy dissipation is
found to be related to the multiple fracture events of both the sacrificial
bonds and elastomer matrix. Combining the microstructured fibers and straight
fibers in the elastomer composite results in a ~ 17 times increase in stiffness
and a ~ 7 times increase in total energy to failure compared to the neat
elastomer. Our findings in applying the sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths

that constructs a path of distributions annealing between a tractable reference

improve mixing in the target. The performance of PT depends on how quickly a
sample from the reference distribution makes its way to the target, which in
turn depends on the particular path of annealing distributions. However, past
work on PT has used only simple paths constructed from convex combinations of
the reference and target log-densities. This paper begins by demonstrating that
this path performs poorly in the setting where the reference and target are
nearly mutually singular. To address this issue, we expand the framework of PT
to general families of paths, formulate the choice of path as an optimization
problem that admits tractable gradient estimates, and propose a flexible new
family of spline interpolation paths for use in practice. Theoretical and
empirical results both demonstrate that our proposed methodology breaks

has been investigated for almost four decades, but only a few works have
explored the dynamics of binary systems of quark stars. This is partly due to
the numerical challenges that need to be faced when modelling the large
discontinuities at the surface of these stars. We here present a novel
technique in which the EOS of a quark star is suitably rescaled to produce a
smooth change of the specific enthalpy across a very thin crust. The
introduction of the crust has been carefully tested by considering the
oscillation properties of isolated quark stars, showing that the response of
the simulated quark stars matches accurately the perturbative predictions.
Using this technique, we have carried out the first fully general-relativistic
simulations of the merger of quark-star binaries finding several important
differences between quark-star binaries and hadronic-star binaries with the
same mass and comparable tidal deformability. In particular, we find that
dynamical mass loss is significantly suppressed in quark-star binaries. In
addition, quark-star binaries have merger and post-merger frequencies that obey
the same quasi-universal relations derived from hadron stars if expressed in
terms of the tidal deformability, but not when expressed in terms of the
average stellar compactness. Hence, it may be difficult to distinguish the two
classes of stars if no information on the stellar radius is available. Finally,
differences are found in the distributions in velocity and entropy of the
ejected matter, for which quark-stars have much smaller tails. Whether these
differences in the ejected matter will leave an imprint in the electromagnetic
counterpart and nucleosynthetic yields remains unclear, calling for the
construction of an accurate model for the evaporation of the ejected quarks

Conventionally, model compression and physical storage are decoupled, as
digital storage media with error-correcting codes (ECCs) provide robust
error-free storage. However, this decoupled approach is inefficient as it
ignores the overparameterization present in most NNs and forces the memory
device to allocate the same amount of resources to every bit of information
regardless of its importance. In this work, we investigate analog memory
devices as an alternative to digital media -- one that naturally provides a way
to add more protection for significant bits unlike its counterpart, but is
noisy and may compromise the stored model's performance if used naively. We
develop a variety of robust coding strategies for NN weight storage on analog

memory resource allocation. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
models trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets for existing

our method reduces the memory footprint by up to one order of magnitude,

such as foldings or flexural fields is studied by including in the Dirac
equation pseudoelectromagnetic fields. General foldings are thus studied by
showing that uniaxial deformations can be considered pseudomagnetic fields in
the Coulomb gauge norm. This allows to give an expression for the Fermi (zero)
energy modes wavefunctions. For random deformations, contact is made with
previous works on the quantum Hall effect under random magnetic fields, showing
that the density of states has a power law behavior and that the zero energy
modes wavefunctions are multifractal. This hints at an unusual electron
velocity distribution. Also, it is shown that a strong Aharonov-Bohm
pseudo-effect is produced. For more general non-uniaxial general flexural
strain, it is not possible to use the Coulomb gauge. The results presented here
helps to tailor-made graphene uniaxial deformations to achieve specific
wavefunctions.

information on points of interest. Augmented Reality (AR) enables mobile users
to utilize text labels, in order to provide a composite view associated with
additional information in a real-world environment. Nonetheless, displaying all
labels for points of interest on a mobile device will lead to unwanted overlaps
between information, and thus a context-responsive strategy to properly arrange
labels is expected. The technique should remove overlaps, show the right
level-of-detail, and maintain label coherence. This is necessary as the viewing
angle in an AR system may change rapidly due to users' behaviors. Coherence
plays an essential role in retaining user experience and knowledge, as well as
avoiding motion sickness. In this paper, we develop an approach that
systematically manages label visibility and levels-of-detail, as well as
eliminates unexpected incoherent movement. We introduce three label management
strategies, including (1) occlusion management, (2) level-of-detail management,
and (3) coherence management by balancing the usage of the mobile phone screen.
A greedy approach is developed for fast occlusion handling in AR. A
level-of-detail scheme is adopted to arrange various types of labels. A 3D
scene manipulation is then built to simultaneously suppress the incoherent
behaviors induced by viewing angle changes. Finally, we present the feasibility
and applicability of our approach through one synthetic and two real-world

where $\lambda$ is the second-largest eigenvalue in absolute value. Since
random $d$-regular graphs are expanders with high probability, this gives an

  We then prove that no that algorithm with sub-constant error given probe

$\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log(n))$ per query in expectation, obtaining a nearly

  We then show that for families of graphs with additional group theoretic

We have shown that this generalized LC solution has unusual geodesic

circular geodesics are the same of the GR theory, no matter the values of

restricted to an interval of $\sigma$ different from those predicted by the GR

velocity and acceleration of the test particles are Besides, for

X-ray images taken at different poses. To date, various techniques have been
proposed to achieve promising results, such as canonical correlation analysis
based methods, etc. In the meanwhile, it is critical for decision-makers to be
able to understand the prediction results from these methods. For example,
given the diagnostic result that a model provided based on the X-ray images of
a patient at different poses, the doctor needs to know why the model made such
a prediction. However, state-of-the-art techniques usually suffer from the
inability to utilize the complementary information of each view and to explain

information and the complementary information in an adversarial setting and
provide robust interpretations behind the prediction to the end-users via the
co-attention mechanism. In particular, it uses a novel cross reconstruction

(GLG) distribution. The MNB model for correlated count data leads to an MNB
regression model that inherits the features of a hierarchical model to
accommodate the intraclass correlation and the occurrence of overdispersion
simultaneously. The asymptotic consistency of the dispersion parameter
estimator depends on the asymmetry of the GLG distribution. Inferential
procedures for the MNB regression model are simple, although it can provide
inconsistent estimates of the asymptotic variance when the correlation
structure is misspecified. We propose the randomized quantile residual for
checking the adequacy of the multivariate model, and derive global and local
influence measures from the multivariate model to assess influential subjects.
Finally, two applications are presented in the data analysis section. The code
for installing the MNB package and the code used in the two examples is
exhibited in the Appendix.

Particularly, deep metric learning utilizes neural networks to learn such a
mapping. Most approaches rely on losses that only take the relations between
pairs or triplets of samples into account, which either belong to the same
class or two different classes. However, these methods do not explore the
embedding space in its entirety. To this end, we propose an approach based on
message passing networks that takes all the relations in a mini-batch into
account. We refine embedding vectors by exchanging messages among all samples
in a given batch allowing the training process to be aware of its overall
structure. Since not all samples are equally important to predict a decision
boundary, we use an attention mechanism during message passing to allow samples
to weigh the importance of each neighbor accordingly. We achieve

computer vision problems. Standard convolutional architectures consist of
stacked layers of operations that progressively downscale the image. Aliasing
is a well-known side-effect of downsampling that may take place: it causes
high-frequency components of the original signal to become indistinguishable
from its low-frequency components. While downsampling takes place in the
max-pooling layers or in the strided-convolutions in these models, there is no
explicit mechanism that prevents aliasing from taking place in these layers.
Due to the impressive performance of these models, it is natural to suspect
that they, somehow, implicitly deal with this distortion. The question we aim
to answer in this paper is simply: ""how and to what extent do CNNs counteract
aliasing?"" We explore the question by means of two examples: In the first, we
assess the CNNs capability of distinguishing oscillations at the input, showing
that the redundancies in the intermediate channels play an important role in
succeeding at the task; In the second, we show that an image classifier CNN
while, in principle, capable of implementing anti-aliasing filters, does not

and attribute. We address the problem of forecasting rare events in a
prototypical example, Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Approximately once
every other winter, the boreal stratospheric polar vortex rapidly breaks down,
shifting midlatitude surface weather patterns for months. We focus on two key
quantities of interest: the probability of an SSW occurring, and the expected
lead time if it does occur, as functions of initial condition. These
\emph{optimal forecasts} concretely measure the event's progress. Direct
numerical simulation can estimate them in principle, but is prohibitively
expensive in practice: each rare event requires a long integration to observe,
and the cost of each integration grows with model complexity. We describe an
alternative approach using integrations that are \emph{short} compared to the
timescale of the warming event. We compute the probability and lead time
efficiently by solving equations involving the transition operator, which
encodes all information about the dynamics. We relate these optimal forecasts
to a small number of interpretable physical variables, suggesting optimal
measurements for forecasting. We illustrate the methodology on a prototype SSW
model developed by Holton and Mass (1976) and modified by stochastic forcing.
While highly idealized, this model captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of
SSWs and exhibits the key forecasting challenge: the dramatic separation in
timescales between a single event and the return time between successive
events. Our methodology is designed to fully exploit high-dimensional data from
models and observations, and has the potential to identify detailed predictors
of many complex rare events in meteorology.

the holographic dual of the area of a marginally trapped surface as well as a
similar holographic dual for the outermost extremal surface. We find that the
simple wedge is dual to a particular coarse-grained CFT state, obtained via
averaging over all possible Python's lunches. An efficient quantum circuit
converts this coarse-grained state into a ""simple state"" that is

experiencing a renaissance due to recent advances in nano-fabrication and the
realization of quantum dots as candidates for quantum computing. In this work,
we combine atomistic electronic structure calculations with quantum master
equation methods to study the transport of electrons and holes through strongly
confined quantum dots coupled to two leads with a voltage bias. We find that a
competition between the energy spacing between the two lowest quasiparticle
energy levels and the strength of the exchange interaction determines the spin
states of the lowest two quasiparticle energy levels. Specifically, the low
density of electron states results in a spin singlet being the lowest energy
two-electron state whereas, in contrast, the high density of states and
significant exchange interaction results in a spin triplet being the lowest
energy two-hole state. The exchange interaction is also responsible for spin
blockades in transport properties, which could persist up to temperatures as
high as 77K for strongly confined colloidal quantum dots from our calculations.
Lastly, we relate these findings to the preparation and manipulation of singlet
and triplet spin qubit states in quantum dots using voltage biases.

little dust, a low metallicity and a high ionisation state. The ionising
sources are young hot stars that power strong emission-lines in the optical and
high ionisation lines in the UV. The LAEs exhibit clumpy UV morphologies and
have outflowing kinematics with blue-shifted SiII absorption, a broad [OIII]
component and a red-skewed Ly$\alpha$ line. Typically 30 % of the Ly$\alpha$
photons escape, of which one quarter on the blue side of the systemic velocity.
A fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons escapes directly at the systemic suggesting
clear channels enabling a $\approx10$ % escape of ionising photons, consistent
with an inference based on MgII. A combination of a low effective HI column
density, a low dust content and young star-burst determine whether a star
forming galaxy is observed as a LAE. The first is possibly related to outflows

problem: adding a tiny carefully-crafted perturbation to the legitimate input
data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high
confidence level. In this paper, we study the universality of adversarial
examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples
involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of matter, we
show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can fool a set of
different quantum classifiers. We prove that for a set of $k$ classifiers with
each receiving input data of $n$ qubits, an $O(\frac{\ln k} {2^n})$ increase of
the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a moderate universal adversarial
risk. In addition, for a given quantum classifier we show that there exist
universal adversarial perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate

these questions by studying the link between X-ray, nuclear ultra-fast outflows
(UFOs) and extended ionised outflows, for the first time in two quasars close
to the peak of AGN activity ($z\sim2$), where AGN feedback is expected to be
more effective. As targets, we selected two multiple-lensed quasars at
$z\sim1.5$, HS 0810+2554 and SDSS J1353+1138, known to host UFOs and observed
with the near-IR integral field spectrometer SINFONI at the VLT. We performed a
kinematical analysis of the [O III]$\lambda$5007 optical emission line, in
order to trace the presence of ionised outflows. We detected spatially resolved
ionised outflows in both galaxies, extended more than 8 kpc and moving up to
$v>2000$ km/s. We derived mass outflow rates of $\sim$12 M$_{sun}$/yr and
$\sim$2 M$_{sun}$/yr for HS 0810+2554 and SDSS J1353+1138. Comparing with the
co-hosted UFO energetics, the ionised outflow energetics in HS 0810+2554 is
broadly consistent with a momentum-driven regime of wind propagation, while in
SDSS J1353+1138 it differs by a factor of $\sim$100 from theoretical
predictions, requiring either a massive molecular outflow or a high variability
of the AGN activity to account for such a discrepancy. By additionally
considering our results with those from the small sample of well-studied
objects (all local but one), with both UFO and extended
(ionised/atomic/molecular) outflow detections, we found that in 10 out of 12
galaxies the large-scale outflow energetics is consistent with the theoretical
predictions of either a momentum- or an energy-driven scenario. This suggests
that such models explain relatively well the acceleration mechanism of
AGN-driven winds on large scales.

its wide companion. However, previous works that used WBs to constrain the IFMR
suffered from large uncertainties in the initial masses because their MS
primaries are difficult to age-date with good precision. Our selection of WBs
with slightly evolved primaries avoids this problem by restricting to a region
of parameter space where isochrone ages are significantly easier to determine
with precision. The WDs of two of our originally selected binaries were found
to be close double degenerates, and are not used in the IFMR analysis. We
obtained more precise constraints than existing ones in the mass range 1-2
M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a previously poorly constrained region of the
IFMR. Having introduced the use of turnoff/subgiant-WD binaries, the study of
the IFMR is not limited anymore by the precision in initial mass, but now the
pressure is on final mass, i.e., the mass of the WD today. Looking at the full
dataset, our results would suggest a relatively large dispersion in the IFMR at
low initial masses. More precise determinations of the mass of the WD

reminiscent of the magnetic force in electrodynamics. The constant strength of
the force is the only free parameter. Since bottom-up structure formation
creates cosmological structures whose internal velocity dispersions increase in
time, this model may mimic the temporal evolution of the effect from a
cosmological constant. It is shown that models with force linearly proportional
to internal velocites, or models proportional to velocity to power three or
more cannot mimic the accelerated expansion induced by a cosmological constant.
However, models proportional to velocity squared are still consistent with the
temporal evolution of a Universe with a cosmological model.

previously reported $Spitzer$/IRAC and X-ray sources within their positional
uncertainties. We also detected an envelope with a diameter of $\sim$6800 au
(P.A.=75$^\circ$) in the C$^{18}$O ($J$=2-1) emission. Moreover, a bipolar
outflow was detected in the CO ($J$=2-1) emission for the first time. The
outflow elongates roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the envelope
detected in the C$^{18}$O ($J$=2-1) emission. Compact high-velocity CO gas in
the (red-shifted) velocity range of 22-30 km s$^{-1}$, presumably tracing a
jet, was detected near the 1.3 mm continuum peak. A compact and faint
red-shifted SiO emission was marginally detected on the CO outflow lobe. The
physical quantities of the outflow in MMS 3 are relatively smaller than those
in other sources in the OMC-3 region. The centrally condensed object associated
with the near-infrared and X-ray sources, the flattened envelope, and the faint

$\sim$10$^3$ yr.

modern gravitational-wave astronomy. Extracting multiple quasinormal mode
frequencies from the ringdown signal allows the remnant black hole to be
studied in unprecedented detail. Previous studies on numerical relativity
simulations of aligned-spin binaries have found that it is possible to start
the ringdown analysis much earlier than previously thought if overtones (and
possibly mirror modes) are included. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio
in the ringdown making identification of subdominant modes easier. In this
paper we study, for the first time, black hole binaries with misaligned spins
and find a much greater variation in the performance of ringdown fits than in
the aligned-spin case. The inclusion of mirror modes and higher harmonics,
along with overtones, improves the reliability of ringdown fits with an early
start time; however, there remain cases with poor performing fits. While using
overtones in conjunction with an early ringdown start time is an enticing
possibility, it is necessary to proceed with caution. We also consider for the
first time the use of numerical relativity surrogate models in this type of
quasinormal mode study and address important questions of accuracy in the
underlying numerical waveforms used for the fit.

surviving companions of historical extragalactic SN by combining archival
photographic plates and Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We demonstrate this
technique for Supernova 1972E, the nearest known SN Ia in over 125 years. Some
models of Type Ia supernovae describe a white dwarf with a non-degenerate
companion that donates enough mass to trigger thermonuclear detonation.
Hydrodynamic simulations and stellar evolution models show that these donor
stars survive the explosion, and show increased luminosity for at least a
thousand years. Thus, late-time observations of the exact location of a
supernova after its ejecta have faded can constrain the presence of a surviving
donor star and progenitor models. We find the explosion site of SN 1972E by
analyzing 17 digitized photographic plates taken with the European Southern
Observatory 1m Schmidt and 1 plate taken with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory 1.5m telescope from 1972-1974. Using the \textit{Gaia} eDR3 catalog
to determine Supernova 1972E's equatorial coordinates yields: $\alpha$ = 13$^h$

sparse changes due to infrequent activities of appliances and electric vehicles

Accordingly, meaningful regularization terms are introduced to cast a convex
load recovery problem, which will be further simplified to reduce the
computational complexity. The load recovery solutions can be utilized to
identify the EV charging events at each load node and to infer the total

solve the least-squares problem with a convex regularization. However, the
convex regularizer is either too loose to force sparsity or lead to biased
estimation. In this paper, the sparse channel reconstruction is solved by
minimizing the least-squares objective with a nonconvex regularizer, which can
exactly express the sparsity constraint and avoid introducing serious bias in
the solution. A novel algorithm is proposed for solving the resulting nonconvex

  The students come from two populations, which are identical in talent (i.e.
the type distribution is the same), but differ in their access to resources:
the higher resourced population can at their option take the exam multiple
times, whereas the lower resourced population can only take the exam once. We

superior outcomes in equilibrium, both from the perspective of the college (the

such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for
networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised
network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without
external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the
local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI
for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node
classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI
merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information
between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal
(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).
Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges
with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various
relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning
node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more
specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic
and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we
propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision
signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node
embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering
and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.

covering the rise throughout the hard state, the bright hard and
hard-intermediate states, and the transition to the soft-intermediate state.
Aims: We address the issue of constraining the geometry of the innermost
accretion flow and its evolution throughout an outburst. Methods: We employed
two independent X-ray spectral-timing methods applied to the NICER data of MAXI
J1820+070. We first identified and tracked the evolution of a characteristic
frequency of soft X-ray reverberation lags. Then, we studied the spectral
evolution of the quasi-thermal component responsible for the observed thermal
reverberation lags. Results: The frequency of thermal reverberation lags
steadily increases throughout most of the outburst, implying that the relative
distance between the X-ray source and the disc decreases as the source softens.
However, near transition this evolution breaks, showing a sudden increase
(decrease) of lag amplitude (frequency). The temperature of the quasi-thermal
component in covariance spectra consistently increases throughout all the
analysed observations. Conclusions: The behaviour of thermal reverberation lags
near transition might be related to the relativistic plasma ejections detected
at radio wavelengths, suggesting a causal connection between the two phenomena.
Throughout most of the hard and hard-intermediate states the disc is consistent
with being truncated (with an inner radius $R_{\rm in}>\sim 10 R_{\rm g}$),
reaching close to the innermost stable circular orbit only near transition.

so far. Some of them have attracted interest because of their potential
long-term habitability; such a possibility is currently vigorously debated in
the literature. I show that post-Keplerian (pK) orbit precessions may impact
the habitability of a fictitious telluric planet orbiting an oblate late-type M
dwarf of spectral class M9V with $M_\star=0.08\,M_\odot$ at
$a=0.02\,\mathrm{au}$, corresponding to an orbital period $P_\mathrm{b}\simeq
4\,\mathrm{d}$, inducing long-term variations of the planetary obliquity
$\varepsilon$ which, under certain circumstances, may not be deemed as
negligible from the point of view of life's sustainability. I resume the
analytical orbit-averaged equations of the pK precessions, both classical and
general relativistic, of the unit vectors
$\boldsymbol{\hat{S}},\,\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$ of both the planet's spin and
orbital angular momenta $\boldsymbol S,\,\boldsymbol{L}$ entering
$\varepsilon$, and numerically integrate them by producing time series of the
pK changes $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ of the obliquity. For rapidly rotating M
dwarfs with rotational periods of the order of $P_\star \simeq
0.1-1\,\mathrm{d}$, the planet's obliquity $\varepsilon$ can undergo classical
pK large variations $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ up to tens of degrees over
timescales $\Delta t \simeq 20-200\,\mathrm{kyr}$, depending on the mutual
orientations of the star's spin ${\boldsymbol J}_\star$, of $\boldsymbol S$,
and of $\boldsymbol L$. Instead, $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ are $\lesssim
1-1.5^\circ$ for the planet b of the Teegarden's Star. In certain
circumstances, the M dwarf's oblateness $J_2^\star$ should be considered as one
of the key dynamical features to be taken into account in compiling budgets of
the long-term habitability of rocky planets around fast spinning late M dwarfs.

granular flows with remarkable success. For subaquatic granular flows, drag
between grains and the pore fluid is substantially higher and the physical
behaviour is more complex. High drag forces constrain the rearrangement of
grains and dilatancy, leading to a considerable build-up of pore pressure. Its
transient and dynamic description is the key to modelling subaquatic granular
flows but out of the scope of incompressible models. In this work, we advance
from the incompressible $\mu(I)$-rheology to the compressible
$\mu(J)$-$\phi(J)$-rheology to account for pore pressure, dilatancy, and the
scaling laws under subaquatic conditions. The model is supplemented with
critical state theory to yield the correct properties in the quasi-static
limit. The pore fluid is described by an additional set of conservation
equations and the interaction with grains is described by a drag model. This
new implementation enables us to include most of the physical processes
relevant for submerged granular flows in a highly transparent manner. Both, the
incompressible and compressible rheologies are implemented into OpenFOAM and
various simulations at low and high Stokes numbers are conducted with both
frameworks. We found a good agreement of the $\mu(J)$-$\phi(J)$-rheology with
low Stokes number experiments, that incompressible models fail to describe. The
combination of granular rheology, pore pressure, and drag model leads to
complex phenomena such as apparent cohesion, remoulding, hydroplaning, and
turbidity currents. The simulations give remarkable insights into these
phenomena and increase our understanding of subaquatic mass transports.

several promising data-driven approaches to forecasting of chaotic dynamical

approaches that combine machine learning with a knowledge-based model, where a
machine-learning technique is used to correct the imperfections in the
knowledge-based model. Such imperfections may be due to incomplete
understanding and/or limited resolution of the physical processes in the
underlying dynamical system, e.g., the atmosphere or the ocean. Previously
proposed data-driven forecasting approaches tend to require, for training,
measurements of all the variables that are intended to be forecast. We describe
a way to relax this assumption by combining data assimilation with machine
learning. We demonstrate this technique using the Ensemble Transform Kalman

in machine learning. Existing work provides limited analysis or it depends on
local theories, such as fixed-point analysis. In contrast, we propose to
analyze trained neural networks using an operator theoretic approach which is
rooted in Koopman theory, the Koopman Analysis of Neural Networks (KANN). Key
to our method is the Koopman operator, which is a linear object that globally
represents the dominant behavior of the network dynamics. The linearity of the
Koopman operator facilitates analysis via its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Our
method reveals that the latter eigendecomposition holds semantic information
related to the neural network inner workings. For instance, the eigenvectors
highlight positive and negative n-grams in the sentiments analysis task;
similarly, the eigenvectors capture the salient features of healthy heart beat
signals in the ECG classification problem.

  Relaxation of Sorting","12 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms are usually evaluated using Information
Retrieval metrics like Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) or Mean
Average Precision. As these metrics rely on sorting predicted items' scores
(and thus, on items' ranks), their derivatives are either undefined or zero
everywhere. This makes them unsuitable for gradient-based optimisation, which
is the usual method of learning appropriate scoring functions. Commonly used
LTR loss functions are only loosely related to the evaluation metrics, causing
a mismatch between the optimisation objective and the evaluation criterion. In
this paper, we address this mismatch by proposing NeuralNDCG, a novel
differentiable approximation to NDCG. Since NDCG relies on the
non-differentiable sorting operator, we obtain NeuralNDCG by relaxing that
operator using NeuralSort, a differentiable approximation of sorting. As a
result, we obtain a new ranking loss function which is an arbitrarily accurate
approximation to the evaluation metric, thus closing the gap between the
training and the evaluation of LTR models. We introduce two variants of the
proposed loss function. Finally, the empirical evaluation shows that our
proposed method outperforms previous work aimed at direct optimisation of NDCG
and is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

finite number $N$ of three-level atoms, showing that some precursors
(fidelity-susceptibility, level population, etc.) of MSQPTs appear in all
permutation symmetry sectors. Using coherent (quasi-classical) states of $U(3)$
as variational states, we compute the lowest-energy density for each sector
$\mu$ in the thermodynamic $N\to\infty$ limit. Extending the control parameter
space by $\mu$, the phase diagram exhibits four distinct quantum phases in the
$\lambda$-$\mu$ plane that coexist at a quadruple point. The ground state of
the whole system belongs to the fully symmetric sector $\mu=1$ and shows a
four-fold degeneracy, due to the spontaneous breakdown of the parity symmetry

with fewer than one observation per class, developing practical algorithms for

the number of classes in the data. In addition, we propose the Hierarchical

on deterministic allocations. Deviating from this trend, we study the fairness
notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which
serves as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post
envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. iEF is a
natural generalization of envy-freeness to random allocations in the sense that
a deterministic envy-free allocation is iEF (when viewed as a degenerate
lottery). It is also certainly meaningful as it allows for a richer solution
space, which includes solutions that are provably better than envy-freeness
according to several criteria. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness
notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though
several of our results apply to general fair division problems, we are
particularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items
where allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents.
Envy-freeness can be trivially decided and (when it can be achieved, it)
implies full efficiency in this setting. Although computing iEF allocations in
matching allocation instances is considerably more challenging, we show how to
compute them in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency
objectives. Our algorithms use the ellipsoid method for linear programming and
efficient solutions to a novel variant of the bipartite matching problem as a
separation oracle. We also study the extension of interim envy-freeness notion
when payments to or from the agents are allowed. We present a series of results
on two optimization problems, including a generalization of the classical rent
division problem to random allocations using interim envy-freeness as the
solution concept.

time is very large. In some cases, this stability is a consequence of the
topology of the symmetry group of the underlying theory. The main focus of the
present work is, given a putative vortex, to determine if it is non abelian or
not by analysis of its physical effects. The example considered here is the
simplest one namely, a $SU(2)$ gauge model whose internal orientational space
is described by $S^2$. Axion and gravitational emission are mainly considered.
It is found that the non abelian property is basically reflected in a deviation
of gravitational loop factor $\gamma_l$ found in
\cite{vachaspati}-\cite{burden}. The axion emission instead, is not very
sensitive to non abelianity, at least for this simple model. Another important
discrepancy is that no point of the vortex reaches the speed of light when
orientational modes are excited. In addition, the total power corresponding to
each of these channels is compared, thus adapting the results of
\cite{davis}-\cite{peloso} to the non abelian context. The excitations
considered here are simple generalizations of rotating or spike string ansatz
known in the literature \cite{ruso1}-\cite{kruczenski}. It is suggested
however, that for certain type of semi-local strings whose internal moduli
space is non compact, deviations due to non abelianity may be more pronounced.

corneal endothelial function, for example after Descemet's membrane endothelial
keratoplasty (DMEK). Automated delineation of the corneal interfaces in
anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can be challenging for
corneas that are irregularly shaped due to pathology, or as a consequence of
surgery, leading to incorrect thickness measurements. In this research, deep
learning is used to automatically delineate the corneal interfaces and measure
corneal thickness with high accuracy in post-DMEK AS-OCT B-scans. Three
different deep learning strategies were developed based on 960 B-scans from 50
patients. On an independent test set of 320 B-scans, corneal thickness could be
measured with an error of 13.98 to 15.50 micrometer for the central 9 mm range,
which is less than 3% of the average corneal thickness. The accurate thickness
measurements were used to construct detailed pachymetry maps. Moreover,
follow-up scans could be registered based on anatomical landmarks to obtain
differential pachymetry maps. These maps may enable a more comprehensive
understanding of the restoration of the endothelial function after DMEK, where
thickness often varies throughout different regions of the cornea, and
subsequently contribute to a standardized postoperative regime.

and attempts to provide a complete picture in the form of \textbf{True
Open-World Learning}. We accomplish this by proposing a comprehensive
generalize-able open-world learning protocol capable of evaluating various
components of open-world learning in an operational setting. We argue that in
true open-world learning, the underlying feature representation should be
learned in a self-supervised manner. Under this self-supervised feature
representation, we introduce the problem of detecting unknowns as samples
belonging to Out-of-Label space. We differentiate between Out-of-Label space
detection and the conventional Out-of-Distribution detection depending upon
whether the unknowns being detected belong to the native-world (same as feature
representation) or a new-world, respectively. Our unifying open-world learning
framework combines three individual research dimensions, which typically have
been explored independently, i.e., Incremental Learning, Out-of-Distribution
detection and Open-World Learning. Starting from a self-supervised feature
space, an open-world learner has the ability to adapt and specialize its
feature space to the classes in each incremental phase and hence perform better
without incurring any significant overhead, as demonstrated by our experimental
results. The incremental learning component of our pipeline provides the new
state-of-the-art on established ImageNet-100 protocol. We also demonstrate the
adaptability of our approach by showing how it can work as a plug-in with any

articles served by either misinformative or trustworthy web domains and
leverage a tensor decomposition based semi-supervised classification technique.
The proposed approach i.e., VizFake is insensitive to a number of image
transformations such as converting the image to grayscale, vectorizing the
image and losing some parts of the screenshots. VizFake leverages a very small
amount of known labels, mirroring realistic and practical scenarios, where
labels (especially for known misinformative articles), are scarce and quickly
become dated. The F1 score of VizFake on a dataset of 50k screenshots of news
articles spanning more than 500 domains is roughly 85% using only 5% of ground
truth labels. Furthermore, tensor representations of VizFake, obtained in an
unsupervised manner, allow for exploratory analysis of the data that provides
valuable insights into the problem. Finally, we compare VizFake with deep
transfer learning, since it is a very popular black-box approach for image
classification and also well-known text text-based methods. VizFake achieves
competitive accuracy with deep transfer learning models while being two orders

  Analysis of Calibration in Binary Classification","Appearing at ICML 2021",,,,"cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern machine learning models with high accuracy are often miscalibrated --
the predicted top probability does not reflect the actual accuracy, and tends
to be over-confident. It is commonly believed that such over-confidence is
mainly due to over-parametrization, in particular when the model is large
enough to memorize the training data and maximize the confidence.
  In this paper, we show theoretically that over-parametrization is not the
only reason for over-confidence. We prove that logistic regression is
inherently over-confident, in the realizable, under-parametrized setting where
the data is generated from the logistic model, and the sample size is much
larger than the number of parameters. Further, this over-confidence happens for
general well-specified binary classification problems as long as the activation
is symmetric and concave on the positive part. Perhaps surprisingly, we also
show that over-confidence is not always the case -- there exists another
activation function (and a suitable loss function) under which the learned
classifier is under-confident at some probability values. Overall, our theory
provides a precise characterization of calibration in realizable binary
classification, which we verify on simulations and real data experiments.

hypergraphs, the edges are defined by a set of nodes i.e., hyperedges to
demonstrate the higher order relationships between the data. However, there is
no explicit higher-order generalization for nodes themselves. In this work, we
introduce a novel generalization of graphs i.e., K-Nearest Hyperplanes graph
(KNH) where the nodes are defined by higher order Euclidean subspaces for
multi-view modeling of the nodes. In fact, in KNH, nodes are hyperplanes or
more precisely m-flats instead of datapoints. We experimentally evaluate the
KNH graph on two multi-aspect datasets for misinformation detection. The
experimental results suggest that multi-view modeling of articles using KNH

main contributions. First, we quantify the potential savings that image
manipulation, such as dimension resizing, quality compression, and transcoding,
enables at large scale: 300 landing and 880 internal pages. Next, we design and
build Browselite, an entirely client-side tool that achieves such data savings

propose GP-Tree, a novel method for multi-class classification with Gaussian
processes and DKL. We develop a tree-based hierarchical model in which each
internal node of the tree fits a GP to the data using the P\'olya Gamma
augmentation scheme. As a result, our method scales well with both the number

disclosure is difficult and error-prone, as features extracted via technical
analysis by existing metrics are poor predictors for exploit development.
Moreover, exploitability assessments suffer from a class bias because ""not
exploitable"" labels could be inaccurate. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a new metric, called Expected Exploitability (EE), which reflects, over
time, the likelihood that functional exploits will be developed. Key to our
solution is a time-varying view of exploitability, a departure from existing
metrics. This allows us to learn EE using data-driven techniques from artifacts
published after disclosure, such as technical write-ups and proof-of-concept
exploits, for which we design novel feature sets. This view also allows us to
investigate the effect of the label biases on the classifiers. We characterize
the noise-generating process for exploit prediction, showing that our problem
is subject to the most challenging type of label noise, and propose techniques
to learn EE in the presence of noise. On a dataset of 103,137 vulnerabilities,
we show that EE increases precision from 49% to 86% over existing metrics,
including two state-of-the-art exploit classifiers, while its precision
substantially improves over time. We also highlight the practical utility of EE
for predicting imminent exploits and prioritizing critical vulnerabilities. We
develop EE into an online platform which is publicly available at

this paper, we propose to change the forward rule of a ResNet by adding a

they can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing ResNet block. We
show that Momentum ResNets can be interpreted in the infinitesimal step size

characterize how adding momentum progressively increases the representation
capabilities of Momentum ResNets. Our analysis reveals that Momentum ResNets
can learn any linear mapping up to a multiplicative factor, while ResNets
cannot. In a learning to optimize setting, where convergence to a fixed point
is required, we show theoretically and empirically that our method succeeds

of node pairs, which is usually balanced, is available over which to predict
the presence of links. However, in practice, there is no test set: the
ground-truth is not known, so the number of possible pairs to predict over is
quadratic in the number of nodes in the graph. Moreover, because graphs are
sparse, most of these possible pairs will not be links. Thus, link prediction
methods, which often rely on proximity-preserving embeddings or heuristic
notions of node similarity, face a vast search space, with many pairs that are
in close proximity, but that should not be linked. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce LinkWaldo, a framework for choosing from this quadratic,
massively-skewed search space of node pairs, a concise set of candidate pairs
that, in addition to being in close proximity, also structurally resemble the
observed edges. This allows it to ignore some high-proximity but
low-resemblance pairs, and also identify high-resemblance, lower-proximity
pairs. Our framework is built on a model that theoretically combines Stochastic
Block Models (SBMs) with node proximity models. The block structure of the SBM
maps out where in the search space new links are expected to fall, and the
proximity identifies the most plausible links within these blocks, using
locality sensitive hashing to avoid expensive exhaustive search. LinkWaldo can
use any node representation learning or heuristic definition of proximity, and
can generate candidate pairs for any link prediction method, allowing the
representation power of current and future methods to be realized for link
prediction in practice. We evaluate LinkWaldo on 13 networks across multiple
domains, and show that on average it returns candidate sets containing 7-33%
more missing and future links than both embedding-based and heuristic
baselines' sets.

beta-decay of r-process nuclei is the heat and ionization source, we solve the
ionization and thermal balance of the ejecta under non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium. The atomic data including energy levels, radiative transition
rates, collision strengths, and recombination rate coefficients, are obtained
by using atomic structure codes, GRASP2K and HULLAC. We find that both
permitted and forbidden lines roughly equally contribute to the cooling rate of
Nd II and Nd III at the nebular temperatures. We show that the kinetic
temperature and ionization degree increase with time in the early stage of the
nebular phase while these quantities become approximately independent of time
after the thermalization break of the heating rate because the processes
relevant to the ionization and thermalization balance are attributed to
two-body collision between electrons and ions at later times. As a result, in
spite of the rapid decline of the luminosity, the shape of the emergent
spectrum does not change significantly with time after the break. We show that
the emission-line nebular spectrum of the pure Nd ejecta consists of a broad
structure from $0.5\,\mu m$ to $20\,\mu m$ with two distinct peaks around

highly successful. With most of these algorithms, inter-observer variation is
an acknowledged problem, leading to sub-optimal results. This problem is even
more significant in post-operative clinical target volume (post-op CTV)
segmentation due to the absence of macroscopic visual tumor in the image. This
study, using post-op CTV segmentation as the test bed, tries to determine if
physician styles are consistent and learnable, if there is an impact of
physician styles on treatment outcome and toxicity; and how to explicitly deal
with physician styles in DL algorithms to facilitate its clinical acceptance. A
classifier is trained to identify which physician has contoured the CTV from
just the contour and corresponding CT scan, to determine if physician styles
are consistent and learnable. Next, we evaluate if adapting automatic
segmentation to physician styles would be clinically feasible based on a lack
of difference between outcomes. For modeling different physician styles of CTV
segmentation, a concept called physician style-aware (PSA) segmentation is
proposed which is an encoder-multidecoder network trained with perceptual loss.
With the proposed physician style-aware network (PSA-Net), Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) accuracy increases on an average of 3.4% for all physicians
from a general model that is not style adapted. We show that stylistic
contouring variations also exist between institutions that follow the same
segmentation guidelines and show the effectiveness of the proposed method in
adapting to new institutional styles. We observed an accuracy improvement of 5%
in terms of DSC when adapting to the style of a separate institution.

optical/near-infrared spectral energy distribution and a relatively bright
emission at 24 micron, and show remarkably diverse properties. CO emission from
each of the three galaxies is detected in deep NOEMA observations, allowing us
to derive molecular gas fractions Mgas/Mstar of 13-23%. We also reconstruct the
star formation histories by fitting models to the observed photometry and
optical spectroscopy, finding evidence for recent rejuvenation in one object,
slow quenching in another, and rapid quenching in the third system. To better
constrain the quenching mechanism we explore the depletion times for our sample
and other similar samples at z~0.7 from the literature. We find that the
depletion times are highly dependent on the method adopted to measure the star
formation rate: using the UV+IR luminosity we obtain depletion times about 6
times shorter than those derived using dust-corrected [OII] emission. When
adopting the star formation rates from spectral fitting, which are arguably
more robust, we find that recently quenched galaxies and star-forming galaxies
have similar depletion times, while older quiescent systems have longer
depletion times. These results offer new, important constraints for physical
models of galaxy quenching.

constrain the mass-loss prescriptions for red supergiants by using the rise
time and peak luminosity distribution of Type II supernovae in radio. We take
the de Jager and van Loon mass-loss rates for red supergiants, calculate the

predicts a relatively narrow range for the rise time and peak luminosity. We
conclude that the mass-loss prescriptions of red supergiants should have strong

(GLT), where the acquired sensor data are coded in the original captured form
without pre-processing. Specifically, we directly map raw sensed color data to
the SAIs, resulting in sparsely distributed color pixels on 2D grids, and
perform demosaicking at the receiver after decoding. To exploit spatial
correlation among the sparse pixels, we propose a novel intra-prediction
scheme, where the prediction kernel is determined according to the local
gradient estimated from already coded neighboring pixel blocks. We then connect
the pixels by forming a graph, modeling the prediction residuals statistically

discussions in science and practice about the sustainability of blockchain and
distributed ledger technology in general. However, blockchain technology is far
from homogeneous - not only with regard to its applications, which now go far
beyond cryptocurrencies and have reached businesses and the public sector, but
also with regard to its technical characteristics and, in particular, its power
consumption. This paper summarizes the status quo of the power consumption of
various implementations of blockchain technology, with special emphasis on the
recent 'Bitcoin Halving' and so-called 'zk-rollups'. We argue that although
Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains do indeed consume a lot of power,
alternative blockchain solutions with significantly lower power consumption are
already available today, and new promising concepts are being tested that could
further reduce in particular the power consumption of large blockchain networks
in the near future. From this we conclude that although the criticism of
Bitcoin's power consumption is legitimate, it should not be used to derive an
energy problem of blockchain technology in general. In many cases in which
processes can be digitised or improved with the help of more energy-efficient
blockchain variants, one can even expect net energy savings.

due to the large amount of computational resources required to achieve robust
recognition. An inherent property of real-world videos is the high correlation
of information across frames which can translate into redundancy in either
temporal or spatial feature maps of the models, or both. The type of redundant
features depends on the dynamics and type of events in the video: static videos
have more temporal redundancy while videos focusing on objects tend to have
more channel redundancy. Here we present a redundancy reduction framework,
termed VA-RED$^2$, which is input-dependent. Specifically, our VA-RED$^2$
framework uses an input-dependent policy to decide how many features need to be
computed for temporal and channel dimensions. To keep the capacity of the
original model, after fully computing the necessary features, we reconstruct
the remaining redundant features from those using cheap linear operations. We
learn the adaptive policy jointly with the network weights in a differentiable
way with a shared-weight mechanism, making it highly efficient. Extensive
experiments on multiple video datasets and different visual tasks show that our
framework achieves $20\% - 40\%$ reduction in computation (FLOPs) when compared
to state-of-the-art methods without any performance loss. Project page:

within a large network is modeled as a diffusion-jump stochastic process whose
jump takes place once the voltage reaches a threshold. In this work, the main
goal is to establish the convergence relationship between the regularized
process and the original one where in the regularized process, the jump
mechanism is replaced by a Poisson dynamic, and jump intensity within the
classically forbidden domain goes to infinity as the regularization parameter
vanishes. On the macroscopic level, the Fokker-Planck equation for the process
with random discharges (i.e. Poisson jumps) are defined on the whole space,
while the equation for the limit process is on the half space. However, with
the iteration scheme, the difficulty due to the domain differences has been
greatly mitigated and the convergence for the stochastic process and the firing
rates can be established. Moreover, we find a polynomial-order convergence for
the distribution by a re-normalization argument in probability theory. Finally,
by numerical experiments, we quantitatively explore the rate and the asymptotic
behavior of the convergence for both linear and nonlinear models.

(HJs) around solar-type stars is correlated with stellar clustering. We study a
new scenario for HJ formation, called ""Flyby Induced High-e Migration"", that
may help explain this correlation. In this scenario, stellar flybys excite the
eccentricity and inclination of an outer companion (giant planet, brown dwarf,
or low-mass star) at large distance (10-300 au), which then triggers high-e
migration of an inner cold Jupiter (at a few astronomical units) through the
combined effects of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) eccentricity oscillation and
tidal dissipation. Using semianalytical calculations of the effective ZLK
inclination window, together with numerical simulations of stellar flybys, we
obtain the analytic estimate for the HJ occurrence rate in this formation
scenario. We find that this ""flyby induced high-e migration"" could account for
a significant fraction of the observed HJ population, although the result
depends on several uncertain parameters, including the density and lifetime of
birth stellar clusters, and the occurrence rate of the ""cold Jupiter + outer

impose limitations on the kind of supported orientational order. These
limitations manifest as compatibility conditions that relate the quantities
describing the director field to the geometry of the embedding space. For
example, in two dimensions (2D) the splay and bend fields suffice to determine
a director uniquely (up to rigid motions) and must comply with one relation
linear in the Gaussian curvature of the embedding manifold. In 3D there are
additional local fields describing the director, i.e. fields available to a
local observer residing within the material, and a number of distinct ways to
yield geometric frustration. So far it was unknown how many such local fields
are required to uniquely describe a 3D director field, nor what are the
compatibility relations they must satisfy. In this work, we address these
questions directly. We employ the method of moving frames to show that a
director field is fully determined by five local fields. These fields are shown
to be related to each other and to the curvature of the embedding space through
six differential relations. As an application of our method, we characterize
all uniform distortion director fields, i.e., directors for which all the local
characterizing fields are constant in space, in manifolds of constant
curvature. The classification of such phases has been recently provided for
directors in Euclidean space, where the textures correspond to foliations of
space by parallel congruent helices. For non-vanishing curvature, we show that

products for customers, plays a vital role in attracting customers' attention
as well as improving user experience. A simple and effective way is to extract
keywords directly from the knowledge-base of products, i.e., attributes or
title, as the recommendation reason. However, generating recommendation reason
from product knowledge doesn't naturally respond to users' interests.
Fortunately, on some E-commerce websites, there exists more and more
user-generated content (user-content for short), i.e., product
question-answering (QA) discussions, which reflect user-cared aspects.
Therefore, in this paper, we consider generating the recommendation reason by
taking into account not only the product attributes but also the
customer-generated product QA discussions. In reality, adequate user-content is
only possible for the most popular commodities, whereas large sums of long-tail
products or new products cannot gather a sufficient number of user-content. To
tackle this problem, we propose a user-inspired multi-source posterior
transformer (MSPT), which induces the model reflecting the users' interests
with a posterior multiple QA discussions module, and generating recommendation
reasons containing the product attributes as well as the user-cared aspects.
Experimental results show that our model is superior to traditional generative
models. Additionally, the analysis also shows that our model can focus more on
the user-cared aspects than baselines.

the density map consists of a series of blurry Gaussian blobs, 2) severe

describe the persons' locations without overlapping in dense regions. Based on
the FIDT maps, a Local-Maxima-Detection-Strategy (LMDS) is derived to

yield high fidelity posterior approximations while maintaining computational
efficiency and scalability. We tackle this challenge by introducing a novel
variational structured approximation inspired by the Bayesian interpretation of
Dropout regularization. Concretely, we focus on the inflexibility of the
factorized structure in Dropout posterior and then propose an improved method
called Variational Structured Dropout (VSD). VSD employs an orthogonal
transformation to learn a structured representation on the variational Gaussian
noise with plausible complexity, and consequently induces statistical
dependencies in the approximate posterior. Theoretically, VSD successfully
addresses the pathologies of previous Variational Dropout methods and thus
offers a standard Bayesian justification. We further show that VSD induces an
adaptive regularization term with several desirable properties which contribute
to better generalization. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of VSD over state-of-the-art
variational methods on predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and
out-of-distribution detection.

variant is differentially private stochastic bandits. Previously, Sajed and
Sheffet (2019) devised the DP Successive Elimination (DP-SE) algorithm that
achieves the optimal $ O \biggl(\sum\limits_{1\le j \le K: \Delta_j >0} \frac{
\log T}{ \Delta_j} + \frac{ K\log T}{\epsilon} \biggr)$ problem-dependent
regret bound, where $K$ is the number of arms, $\Delta_j$ is the mean reward
gap of arm $j$, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\epsilon$ is the required privacy
parameter. However, like other elimination style algorithms, it is not an
anytime algorithm. Until now, it was not known whether UCB-based algorithms
could achieve this optimal regret bound. We present an anytime, UCB-based
algorithm that achieves optimality. Our experiments show that the UCB-based
algorithm is competitive with DP-SE. The second variant is the full information
version of private stochastic online learning. Specifically, for the problems
of decision-theoretic online learning with stochastic rewards, we present the
first algorithm that achieves an $ O \left( \frac{ \log K}{ \Delta_{\min}} +
\frac{ \log K}{\epsilon} \right)$ regret bound, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the
minimum mean reward gap. The key idea behind our good theoretical guarantees in
both settings is the forgetfulness, i.e., decisions are made based on a certain
amount of newly obtained observations instead of all the observations obtained
from the very beginning.

hand, large-context E2E-ASR models, which take into account long-range

utterances such as discourses and conversations. However, the transformer
architecture, which has recently achieved state-of-the-art ASR performance
among utterance-level ASR systems, has not yet been introduced into the
large-context ASR systems. We can expect that the transformer architecture can
be leveraged for effectively capturing not only input speech contexts but also
long-range sequential contexts beyond utterance boundaries. Therefore, this
paper proposes a hierarchical transformer-based large-context E2E-ASR model
that combines the transformer architecture with hierarchical encoder-decoder
based large-context modeling. In addition, in order to enable the proposed
model to use long-range sequential contexts, we also propose a large-context
knowledge distillation that distills the knowledge from a pre-trained
large-context language model in the training phase. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and proposed training method on Japanese

waveguides with a combination of intrinsic quadratic
(second-harmonic-generating) and cubic nonlinearities. Solutions for discrete
embedded solitons (DESs) are constructed by means of two analytical
approximations, adjusted, severally, for broad and narrow DESs, and in a
systematic form with the help of numerical calculations. DESs of several types,
including ones with identical and opposite signs of their fundamental-frequency

narrow DESs, the analytical approximation produces very accurate results, in
comparison with the numerical findings. In this case, the DES branch extends
from the propagation band into a semi-infinite gap as a family of regular
discrete solitons. The study of stability of DESs demonstrates that, in
addition to ones featuring the well-known property of semi-stability, there are
linearly stable DESs which are genuinely robust modes.

slew-and-stabilize maneuvers. Employing a constellation of agile satellites,
coordinated by an autonomous and responsive scheduler, can significantly
increase overall response rate, revisit time and global coverage for the
mission. In this paper, we use recent advances in sequential convex programming
based trajectory optimization to enable rapid-target acquisition, pointing and
tracking capabilities for a scheduler-based constellation. We present two
problem formulations. The Minimum-Time Slew Optimal Control Problem determines
the minimum time, required energy, and optimal trajectory to slew between any
two orientations given nonlinear quaternion kinematics, gyrostat and actuator
dynamics, and state/input constraints. By gridding the space of 3D rotations
and efficiently solving this problem on the grid, we produce lookup tables or
parametric fits off-line that can then be used on-line by a scheduler to
compute accurate estimates of minimum-time and maneuver energy for real-time
constellation scheduling. The Minimum-Effort Multi-Target Pointing Optimal
Control Problem is used on-line by each satellite to produce continuous
attitude-state and control-input trajectories that realize a given schedule
while minimizing attitude error and control effort. The optimal trajectory may
then be achieved by a low-level tracking controller. We demonstrate our
approach with an example of a reference satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit

~5E33 erg/s in quiescence (0.3-10 keV; at 10 kpc). Such a marked and rapid
decrease in the flux was also registered at UV and optical wavelengths. In
outburst, the source showed considerable aperiodic variability in the X-rays on
timescales as short as a few seconds. The spectrum of the source in the energy
range 0.3-20 keV was well described by a thermal, blackbody-like, component
plus a non-thermal, power law-like, component and it softened considerably as
the source returned to quiescence. The spectrum of the optical counterpart in
quiescence showed broad emission features associated mainly with ionised carbon
and oxygen, superposed on a blue continuum. No evidence for bright continuum
radio emission was found in quiescence. We discuss possible scenarios for the
nature of this source, and show that the observed phenomenology points to a
transient ultra-compact X-ray binary system.

  Markets",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zonal pricing is a well-suited mechanism to incentivize grid-supporting
behavior of profit-maximizing producers and consumers operating on a
large-scale power system. In zonal electricity markets, local system operators
create individual price zones, which provide appropriate price signals
depending on local grid conditions such as an excess or shortage of electrical
energy in certain regions. In this paper, a real-time zonal pricing controller
for AC power networks is presented that ensures frequency and voltage stability
as well as Pareto efficiency of the resulting closed-loop equilibria. Based on
a dynamic network model that takes line losses and power exchange with adjacent
price zones into account, distributed continuous-time control laws are derived
which require only neighbor-to-neighbor communication. Application to a
real-time congestion management strategy illustrates how spatially and
temporally differentiated prices enable grid-supportive operation of the
participants without interventions by a superordinate control authority.
Effectiveness of different zonal pricing concepts compared to an isolated grid
operation is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE-57 bus system.

planetary ($q\ll1$) microlensing is valid if $|1-s|\gg q^{1/3}$ (where $q$ is
the mass ratio and $s$ is the projected separation in the unit of the Einstein
ring radius of the primary). The condition is also consistent with the
requirement that the binary separation is far from those in the resonant binary
regime resulting in a single six-cusp caustic. Given that the linear
approximation of the caustic is invariant under $s\leftrightarrow s^{-1}$, the
close/wide binary degeneracy observed under the same condition may be
understood via the linear approximation of the central caustic. Finally it is
argued that the local degeneracies of lensing features associated with caustic

diffeomorphic metric mapping or LDDMM, in short - has inspired numerous
techniques for comparing, deforming, averaging and analyzing shapes or images.
Grounded in flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid
dynamics, LDDMM algorithms solve the flow equation in the space of plausible
deformations, i.e. diffeomorphisms. In this work, we make use of deep residual
neural networks to solve the non-stationary ODE (flow equation) based on a
Euler's discretization scheme. The central idea is to represent time-dependent
velocity fields as fully connected ReLU neural networks (building blocks) and
derive optimal weights by minimizing a regularized loss function. Computing
minimizing paths between deformations, thus between shapes, turns to find
optimal network parameters by back-propagating over the intermediate building
blocks. Geometrically, at each time step, ResNet-LDDMM searches for an optimal
partition of the space into multiple polytopes, and then computes optimal
velocity vectors as affine transformations on each of these polytopes. As a
result, different parts of the shape, even if they are close (such as two
fingers of a hand), can be made to belong to different polytopes, and therefore
be moved in different directions without costing too much energy. Importantly,
we show how diffeomorphic transformations, or more precisely bilipshitz
transformations, are predicted by our algorithm. We illustrate these ideas on
diverse registration problems of 3D shapes under complex topology-preserving
transformations. We thus provide essential foundations for more advanced shape
variability analysis under a novel joint geometric-neural networks

of the proposal is a source splitting mechanism that creates source-specific
intermediate representations inside the network. This allows our model to give
source-specific posteriors as the output unlike the traditional multi-label
classification approach. Existing deep learning methods perform a frame level
prediction, whereas our approach performs an utterance level prediction by
incorporating temporal selection and averaging inside the network to avoid
post-processing. We also experiment with various loss functions and show that a
variant of earth mover distance (EMD) is very effective in classifying DOA at a
very high resolution by modeling inter-class relationships. In addition to
using the prediction error as a metric for evaluating our localization model,
we also establish its potency as a frontend with automatic speech recognition
(ASR) as the downstream task. We convert the estimated DOAs into a feature
suitable for ASR and pass it as an additional input feature to a strong
multi-channel and multi-talker speech recognition baseline. This added input
feature drastically improves the ASR performance and gives a word error rate
(WER) of 6.3% on the evaluation data of our simulated noisy two speaker
mixtures, while the baseline which doesn't use explicit localization input has
a WER of 11.5%. We also perform ASR evaluation on real recordings with the

layers of lead-halide octahedra stacked between organic ligand barriers. The
combination of their dielectric confinement and ionic sublattice results in
excitonic excitations with substantial binding energies that are strongly
coupled to the surrounding soft, polar lattice. However, the ligand environment
in layered perovskites can significantly alter their optical properties due to
the complex dynamic disorder of soft perovskite lattice. Here, we observe the
dynamic disorder through phonon dephasing lifetimes initiated by ultrafast
photoexcitation employing high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman
spectroscopy of a variety of ligand substitutions. We demonstrate that
vibrational relaxation in layered perovskite formed from flexible alkyl-amines
as organic barriers is fast and relatively independent of the lattice
temperature. Relaxation in aromatic amine based layered perovskite is slower,
though still fast relative to pure inorganic lead bromide lattices, with a rate
that is temperature dependent. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explain
the fast rates of relaxation by quantifying the large anharmonic coupling of
the optical modes with the ligand layers and rationalize the temperature
independence due to their amorphous packing. This work provides a molecular and
time-domain depiction of the relaxation of nascent optical excitations and
opens opportunities to understand how they couple to the complex layered
perovskite lattice, elucidating design principles for optoelectronic devices.

novel explicit communication method for providing driving intentions of an

interaction, e.g., an encountering scene. However, the eHMI may not guarantee
that the pedestrians will fully recognize the intention of the AV. In this
paper, we propose that the instruction of the eHMI's rationale can help
pedestrians correctly understand the driving intentions and predict the
behavior of the AV, and thus their subjective feelings (i.e., dangerous
feeling, trust in the AV, and feeling of relief) and decision-making are also
improved. The results of an interaction experiment in a road-crossing scene
indicate that the participants were more difficult to be aware of the situation

further, the participants' subjective feelings and hesitation in
decision-making also deteriorated significantly. When the eHMI was used in the
AV, the situational awareness, subjective feelings and decision-making of the
participants regarding the AV w/ eHMI were improved. After the instruction, it
was easier for the participants to understand the driving intention and predict

trying to bridge the gap between a collapsing prestellar core and a developed
disk. The goal of the present work is to revisit the assemblage of the
protoplanetary disk (PPD), by performing 3D MHD simulations with ambipolar
diffusion and full radiative transfer. We follow the global evolution of the
PPD from the prestellar core collapse for 100 kyr, with resolution of one AU.
The formed disk is more realistic and is in agreement with recent observations
of disks around class-0 young stellar objects. The mass flux arriving onto the
disk and the radial mass accretion rate within the disk are measured and
compared to analytical self-similar models. The surface mass flux is very
centrally peaked, implying that most of the mass falling onto the star does not
transit through the mid-plane of the disk. The disk mid-plane is almost dead to
turbulence, whereas upper layers and the disk outer edge are very turbulent.
The snow-line is significantly further away than in a passive disk. We
developed a zoomed rerun technique to quickly obtain a reasonable disk that is
highly stratified, weakly magnetized inside, and strongly magnetized outside.
During the class-0 phase of PPD formation, the interaction between the disk and
the infalling envelope is important and ought not be neglected. Accretion onto
the star is found to mostly depend on dynamics of the collapsing envelope,
rather than the detailed disk structure.

over-the-air computing, a common subset of k-coordinates of the gradient

then transmitted simultaneously over k sub-carriers, each experiencing

chaotic, in the sense of Li-Yorke and positive topological entropy.

coexistence of stable Nash equilibria and chaos in the same game. We also
observe the simultaneous creation of a chaotic attractor as another chaotic
attractor gets destroyed. Lastly, although FoReL dynamics can be strange and
non-equilibrating, we prove that the time average still converges to an exact

In this work, we formulate BLOs from an optimistic bi-level viewpoint and
establish a new gradient-based algorithmic framework, named Bi-level Descent
Aggregation (BDA), to partially address the above issues. Specifically, BDA
provides a modularized structure to hierarchically aggregate both the upper-

Theoretically, we establish a general convergence analysis template and derive
a new proof recipe to investigate the essential theoretical properties of
gradient-based BLO methods. Furthermore, this work systematically explores the
convergence behavior of BDA in different optimization scenarios, i.e.,
considering various solution qualities (i.e., global/local/stationary solution)

Trakhinin [84] by Nash-Moser iteration. In this paper, we give a new proof of
the local well-posedness by the combination of classical energy method and
hyperbolic approach and also establish the incompressible limit. We apply the
tangential smoothing method to define the approximation system. The key
observation is that the structure of the wave equation of pressure together
with Christodoulou-Lindblad elliptic estimates reduces the energy estimates to
the control of tangentially-differentiated wave equations in spite of a
potential loss of derivative in the source term. We first establish the
nonlinear energy estimate without loss of regularity for the free-boundary
compressible elastodynamic system. The energy estimate is also uniform in sound
speed which yields the incompressible limit. It is worth emphasizing that our
method is completely applicable to compressible Euler equations. Our
observation also shows that it is not necessary to include the full time
derivatives in boundary energy and analyze higher order wave equations as in
the previous works of compressible Euler equations (cf. Lindblad-Luo [59] and
Luo [61]) even if we require the energy is uniform in sound speed. Moreover,
the enhanced regularity for compressible Euler equations obtained in [59,61]
can still be recovered for a slightly compressible elastic medium by further
delicate analysis which is completely different from Euler equations.

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have improved the

We construct a new steady, axisymmetric GRMHD jet model to obtain approximate
solutions of black hole (BH) magnetospheres, and examine the matter density
distribution of jets. By assuming fixed poloidal magnetic field shapes that
mimic force-free analytic solutions and GRMHD simulation results and assuming
constant poloidal velocity at the separation surface, which divides the inflow

the separation surface and analytically solve the distributions of matter
velocity and density along the field lines. We find that the densities at the
separation surface in our parabolic field models roughly follow $\propto
r_{ss}^{-2}$ in the far zone from the BH, where $r_{ss}$ is the radius of the
separation surface. When the BH spin is larger or the velocity at the
separation surface is smaller, the density at the separation surface becomes
concentrated more near the jet edge. Our semi-analytic model, combined with

potential lemma that is a widely used technique in the analysis of algorithms

linear bandit setting where a decision-maker sequentially chooses among a set

cumulative expected reward over a decision-making horizon. The elliptical
potential lemma is a key tool for quantifying uncertainty in estimating
parameters of the reward function, but it requires the noise and the prior
distributions to be Gaussian. Our general elliptical potential lemma relaxes
this Gaussian requirement which is a highly non-trivial extension for a number
of reasons; unlike the Gaussian case, there is no closed-form solution for the
covariance matrix of the posterior distribution, the covariance matrix is not a
deterministic function of the actions, and the covariance matrix is not
decreasing with respect to the semidefinite inequality. While this result is of
broad interest, we showcase an application of it to prove an improved Bayesian
regret bound for the well-known Thompson sampling algorithm in stochastic
linear bandits with changing action sets where prior and noise distributions

we show that neutrino-antineutrino oscillations combined with Majorana-type CP

the supernovae explosion. This effect is more prominent for the normal neutrino
mass ordering. The detection of supernovae neutrino fluxes in the future

in this manuscript is to develop methodology that will reduce the efforts in
model selection. This is achieved by utilizing an existing model selection
criterion in an innovative way that reduces the number of model fitting
exercises substantially. In this manuscript, we have shown that one model can
be obtained from the other by choosing a suitable continuous transformation of
the parameters. This idea builds an interconnection between many equations
which are scattered in the literature. We also get several new growth

idea of interval specific rate parameter (ISRP) proposed by Bhowmick et al

of the parameters of simpler models indicates the nature of variation in
parameters with time, thus, enable the experimenter to extrapolate the
inference to more complex models. Our proposed methodology significantly
reduces the efforts involved in model fitting exercises. The proposed idea is

hold promise to replace conventional refractive optics, such as lenses, due to
their high performance and compactness. However, designing large field-of-view
(FOV) metalenses, which are of particular importance when imaging relatively
big objects at short distances, remains one of the most critical challenges.
Recently, metalenses implementing a quadratic phase profile have been put
forward to solve this problem with a single element, but despite their
theoretical ability to provide $180^\circ\,$FOV, imaging over very large FOV
has not been demonstrated yet. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of
the imaging properties of quadratic metalenses and, in particular, show that
due to their intrinsic barrel distortion or fish-eye effect, there is a
fundamental trade-off between the FOV achievable in a given imaging
configuration and the optical resolution of the metalens and/or the detector
resolution. To illustrate how to harness the full potential of quadratic
metalenses, we apply these considerations to the fingerprint detection problem,
and demonstrate experimentally the full imaging of a $5\,$mm fingerprint with
features of the order of $100\,\mu$m, with a metalens ten times smaller in size
and located at a distance of only $2.5\,$mm away from the object. This
constitutes the most compact system reported so far for the fingerprint

accuracy to numerical solutions. A one-dimensional disordered discrete
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation and a post-Newtonian Hamiltonian system of
spinning compact binaries are taken as our two examples. We demonstrate
numerically that the proposed algorithm exhibits good long-term performance in
the preservation of energy, if roundoff errors are neglected. This result is
independent of time steps, initial orbital eccentricities, and regular and
chaotic orbital dynamical behavior. In particular, the application of
appropriately large time steps to the new algorithm is helpful in reducing
time-consuming and roundoff errors. This new method, combined with fast
Lyapunov indicators, is well suited related to chaos in the two example
problems. It is found that chaos in the former system is mainly responsible for
one of the parameters. In the latter problem, a combination of small initial
separations and high initial eccentricities can easily induce chaos.

adaptivity to the time-varying structure of real-world networks. In general,
there is a tremendous gap between static and dynamic graph settings for the
lazy simple random walk: Although $O(n^3)$ cover time was shown for any static
graphs of $n$ vertices, there is an edge-changing dynamic graph with an
exponential hitting time. On the other hand, previous works indicate that the
random walk on a dynamic graph with a time-homogeneous stationary distribution
behaves almost identically to that on a static graph.
  In this paper, we strengthen this insight by obtaining general and improved
bounds. Specifically, we consider a random walk according to a sequence
$(P_t)_{t\geq 1}$ of irreducible and reversible transition matrices such that
all $P_t$ have the same stationary distribution. We bound the mixing, hitting,
and cover times in terms of the hitting and relaxation times of the random walk
according to the worst fixed $P_t$. Moreover, we obtain the first bounds of the
hitting and cover times of multiple random walks and the coalescing time on
dynamic graphs. These bounds can be seen as an extension of the well-known
bounds of random walks on static graphs. Our results generalize the previous
upper bounds for specific random walks on dynamic graphs, e.g., lazy simple
random walks and $d_{\max}$-lazy walks, and give improved and tight upper
bounds in various cases. As an interesting consequence of our generalization,
we obtain tight bounds for the lazy Metropolis walk [Nonaka, Ono, Sadakane, and
Yamashita, TCS10] on any dynamic graph: $O(n^2)$ mixing time, $O(n^2)$ hitting
time, and $O(n^2\log n)$ cover time. Additionally, our coalescing time bound
implies the consensus time bound of the pull voting on a dynamic graph.

more tissue and bone details as a more informative input. Then, an end-to-end
dual-domain network is adopted to successively process the sinogram and its

based on pretraining and transfer learning is proposed to address this issue,
and an improved end-to-end deep learning model is developed to address the
specific challenges of ASR in the ATC domain. An unsupervised pretraining
strategy is first proposed to learn speech representations from unlabeled
samples for a certain dataset. Specifically, a masking strategy is applied to
improve the diversity of the sample without losing their general patterns.
Subsequently, transfer learning is applied to fine-tune a pretrained or other
optimized baseline models to finally achieves the supervised ASR task. By
virtue of the common terminology used in the ATC domain, the transfer learning
task can be regarded as a sub-domain adaption task, in which the transferred
model is optimized using a joint corpus consisting of baseline samples and new
transcribed samples from the target dataset. This joint corpus construction
strategy enriches the size and diversity of the training samples, which is
important for addressing the issue of the small transcribed corpus. In
addition, speed perturbation is applied to augment the new transcribed samples
to further improve the quality of the speech corpus. Three real ATC datasets
are used to validate the proposed ASR model and training strategies. The
experimental results demonstrate that the ASR performance is significantly
improved on all three datasets, with an absolute character error rate only
one-third of that achieved through the supervised training. The applicability
of the proposed strategies to other ASR approaches is also validated.

an axisymmetric geometric reconstruction of each individual stent. The third
step minimizes the rotation of each stent around its main axis. Finally, the
last step virtually deploys each stent within a deployment box extracted from
the preoperative CT scan. A proof of concept is performed on a patient. The
accuracy is compatible with the clinical threshold of 3 mm: the average

quantization associated with the $\varphi ^4_3$-model. Our starting point is a
suitable approximation $\mu_{M,N}$ of the measure $\mu$ we intend to construct.
$\mu_{M,N}$ is parametrized by an $M$-dependent space cut-off function $\rho_M:

function $\psi_N: \widehat{\mathbb R}^3 \cong {\mathbb R}^3 \rightarrow

counterterms). The corresponding family of stochastic quantization equations
yields solutions $(X_t^{M,N}, t\geq 0)$ that have $\mu_{M,N}$ as an invariant
probability measure. By a combination of probabilistic and functional analytic
methods for singular stochastic differential equations on negative-indices
weighted Besov spaces (with rotation invariant weights) we prove the tightness
of the family of continuous processes $(X_t^{M,N},t \geq 0)_{M,N}$. Limit
points in the sense of convergence in law exist, when both $M$ and $N$ diverge

various techniques, accurately identifying changes is still a great challenge,
especially in the high resolution or heterogeneous situations, due to the
difficulties in effectively modeling the features from ground objects with
different patterns. In this paper, a novel CD method based on the graph
convolutional network (GCN) and multiscale object-based technique is proposed
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous images. First, the object-wise high
level features are obtained through a pre-trained U-net and the multiscale
segmentations. Treating each parcel as a node, the graph representations can be
formed and then, fed into the proposed multiscale graph convolutional network
with each channel corresponding to one scale. The multiscale GCN propagates the
label information from a small number of labeled nodes to the other ones which
are unlabeled. Further, to comprehensively incorporate the information from the
output channels of multiscale GCN, a fusion strategy is designed using the
father-child relationships between scales. Extensive Experiments on optical,
SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR data sets demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms some state-of the-art methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Besides, the Influences of some factors are also

However, we still lack a comprehensive observational view of their infrared

statistical study of IR variability of the 23 optical TDEs discovered between
2009 and 2018 utilizing the full public dataset of Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer. The detection of variability is performed on the difference images,
yielding out 11 objects with significant (>$3\sigma$) variability in at least
one band while dust emission can be only fitted in 8 objects. Their peak dust
luminosity is around $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg/s, corresponding to a dust
covering factor $f_c\sim0.01$ at scale of sub-parsec. The only exception is the
disputed source ASASSN-15lh, which shows an ultra-high dust luminosity
($\sim10^{43.5}$ erg/s) and make its nature even elusive. Other non-detected
objects show even lower $f_c$, which could be one more order of magnitude
lower. The derived $f_c$ is generally much smaller than those of dusty tori in
active galactic nuclei (AGNs), suggesting either a dearth of dust or a
geometrically thin and flat disk in the vicinity of SMBHs. Our results also
indicate that the optical TDE sample (post-starburst galaxies overrepresented)
is seriously biased to events with little dust at sub-pc scale while TDEs in
dusty star-forming systems could be more efficiently unveiled by IR echoes.

of showing either an original video or an altered video where the appearance of
the person in the original video is modified to appear more White. We measure
credibility as the percent of participant responses who believed the speaker
was telling the truth. We found that changing the race of a person in a static

development of accurate tracking policies while obviating the need to
periodically solve beam-optimization problems. However, its applicability is
still arguable when training-test gaps exist in terms of environmental
parameters that affect the node dynamics. From this skeptical point of view,
the contribution of this study is twofold. First, by considering an example
scenario, we confirm that the training-test gap adversely affects the
beam-tracking performance. More specifically, we consider nodes placed on
overhead messenger wires, where the node dynamics are affected by several
environmental parameters, e.g, the wire mass and tension. Although these are
particular scenarios, they yield insight into the validation of the
training-test gap problems. Second, we demonstrate the feasibility of
\textit{zero-shot adaptation} as a solution, where a learning agent adapts to
environmental parameters unseen during training. This is achieved by leveraging
a robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) technique, where such
training-and-test gaps are regarded as disturbances by adversaries that are
jointly trained with a legitimate beam-tracking agent. Numerical evaluations
demonstrate that the beam-tracking policy learned via RARL can be applied to a
wide range of environmental parameters without severely degrading the received
power.

schemes for uncoded Storage Constrained Private Information Retrieval (SC-PIR)
systems. In the SC-PIR system, a user aims to retrieve one out of $K$ files
from $N$ servers while revealing nothing about its identity to any individual
server, in which the $K$ files are stored at the $N$ servers in an uncoded form
and each server can store up to $\mu K$ equivalent files, where $\mu$ is the
normalized storage capacity of each server. We first prove that there exists a
capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme for a given storage design if and only if all
the packets are stored exactly at $M\triangleq \mu N$ servers for $\mu$ such
that $M=\mu N\in\{2,3,\ldots,N\}$. Then, the optimal sub-packetization for
capacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes is characterized as the solution to an
optimization problem, which is typically hard to solve because of involving
indicator functions. Moreover, a new notion of array called Storage Design
Array (SDA) is introduced for the SC-PIR system. With any given SDA, an
associated capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme is constructed. Next, the SC-PIR
schemes that have equal-size packets are investigated. Furthermore, the optimal
equal-size sub-packetization among all capacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes
characterized by Woolsey et al. is proved to be $\frac{N(M-1)}{\gcd(N,M)}$.
Finally, by allowing unequal size of packets, a greedy SDA construction is
proposed, where the sub-packetization of the associated SC-PIR scheme is upper
bounded by $\frac{N(M-1)}{\gcd(N,M)}$. Among all capacity-achieving linear
SC-PIR schemes, the sub-packetization is optimal when $\min\{M,N-M\}|N$ or
$M=N$, and within a multiplicative gap $\frac{\min\{M,N-M\}}{\gcd(N,M)}$ of the
optimal one otherwise. In particular, for the case $N=d\cdot M\pm1$ where
$d\geq 2$, another SDA is constructed to obtain lower sub-packetization.

partially oxidized surfaces, with the latter as evidenced by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, have high activity. The calculated overall
performance of the (001) and (111) surfaces with robust topological surface
states (TSSs) is better than that of the lowly symmetric (211) surface with
fragile or without TSSs, which is further supported by their measured weak
antilocalization strength. The high HER activity of SnTe (001) and (111) is
attributed to the enhanced charge transfer between H atoms and TSSs. We also
address the effect of possible surface facets and the contrast of the HER
activity of the available active sites among the three samples. Our study
demonstrates that the TSSs and mirror symmetry of TCIs expedite their HER
activity.

differentiable pooling operation that combines ideas from bilinear pooling for
fine-grained recognition and from feature learning for discriminative
localization. CAP uses self-attention with a dictionary of learnable weights to
pool from the most relevant feature regions. Through CAP, EgoACO learns to
decode object and scene context descriptors from video frame features. For
temporal modeling in EgoACO, we design a recurrent version of class activation
pooling termed Long Short-Term Attention (LSTA). LSTA extends convolutional
gated LSTM with built-in spatial attention and a re-designed output gate.
Action, object and context descriptors are fused by a multi-head prediction
that accounts for the inter-dependencies between noun-verb-action structured
labels in egocentric video datasets. EgoACO features built-in visual
explanations, helping learning and interpretation. Results on the two largest
egocentric action recognition datasets currently available, EPIC-KITCHENS and

to their chemical versatility combined with a significant number of potential
applications. Of particular interest are two-dimensional COFs, where the
organic building units are linked by covalent bonds within a plane. Most
properties of these COFs are determined by the relative arrangement of
neighboring layers. These are typically found to be laterally displaced, which,
for example, reduces the electronic coupling between the layers. In the present
contribution, we use dispersion-corrected density-functional theory to
elucidate the origin of that displacement, showing that the common notion that
the displacement is a consequence of electrostatic repulsions of polar building
blocks can be misleading. For the representative case of COF-1, we find that
electrostatic and van der Waals interactions would, actually, favor a cofacial
arrangement of the layers and that Pauli repulsion is the crucial factor
causing the serrated AA stacking. A more in-depth analysis of the electrostatic
contribution reveals that the ""classical"" Coulomb repulsion between the
boroxine building blocks of COF-1 suggested by chemical intuition does exist,
but is overcompensated by attractive effects due to charge-penetration in the
phenylene units. The situation becomes more involved when additionally allowing
the interlayer distance to relax for each displacement, as then the different
distance-dependences of the various types of interactions come into play. The
overall behavior calculated for COF-1 is recovered for several additional COFs
with differently sized pi-systems and topologies, implying that the presented

novel cost function is defined to explicitly minimize the amount of
perturbation applied to the input image while enforcing the perceptual
similarity between the adversarial and input images. For this purpose, the cost
function is regularized by the well-known total variation and bounded range
terms to meet the natural appearance of the adversarial image. We evaluate the

to solve the problem of denoising electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The
architecture makes use of fractional calculus to calculate the gradients during
the backpropagation process, as a result of which a new hyper-parameter in the
form of fractional order ($\alpha$) has been introduced which can be tuned to
get the best denoising performance. Additionally, to avoid substantial use of
memory resources, the model makes use of orthogonal features in the form of
Tchebichef moments as input. The orthogonal features have been used in
achieving compression at the input stage. Considering the growing use of low
energy devices, compression of neural networks becomes imperative. Here, the
auto-encoder's weights are compressed using the randomized singular value
decomposition (RSVD) algorithm during training while evaluation is performed
using various compression ratios. The experimental results show that the
proposed fractionally compressed architecture provides improved denoising
results on the standard datasets when compared with the existing methods.

formation of stable states with pronounced modulations of cross section. Such
configurations, observed in a number of experiments, are excited at wavelengths
that are below the critical value for the development of classical Rayleigh

corresponds to the appearance of roughening transition on the

transition is possible only on certain facets of metals with a given crystal
structure, the short-wavelength modulations of one-dimensional systems, as
shown in our work, can be realized (i) with the proper orientation of the
nanowire/slab axis providing spontaneous appearance of roughening transition on
its lateral surface, (ii) by the method of activating the surface diffusion of
atoms by external impact (irradiation with an electron beam or contact with a

heating of the nanowire. The results obtained for the cases of BCC and FCC

certificate. A natural question to ask is, for a fixed model class (such as
neural networks) and a dataset of size $n$, what is the smallest achievable
Lipschitz constant among all models that fit the dataset? Recently, (Bubeck et
al., 2020) conjectured that when using two-layer networks with $k$ neurons to
fit a generic dataset, the smallest Lipschitz constant is
$\Omega(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}})$. This implies that one would require one neuron
per data point to robustly fit the data. In this work we derive a lower bound
on the Lipschitz constant for any arbitrary model class with bounded Rademacher
complexity. Our result coincides with that conjectured in (Bubeck et al., 2020)
for two-layer networks under the assumption of bounded weights. However, due to
our result's generality, we also derive bounds for multi-layer neural networks,
discovering that one requires $\log n$ constant-sized layers to robustly fit
the data. Thus, our work establishes a law of robustness for weight bounded
neural networks and provides formal evidence on the necessity of
over-parametrization in deep learning.

monitoring and adjustment of the battery operating conditions. Hence, it is
crucial to implement fast and accurate algorithms for State of Health (SoH)
monitoring on the Battery Management System. The task is challenging due to the
complexity and multitude of the factors contributing to the battery
degradation, especially because the different degradation processes occur at
various timescales and their interactions play an important role. Data-driven
methods bypass this issue by approximating the complex processes with
statistical or machine learning models. This paper proposes a data-driven
approach which is understudied in the context of battery degradation, despite
its simplicity and ease of computation: the Multivariable Fractional Polynomial
(MFP) regression. Models are trained from historical data of one exhausted cell
and used to predict the SoH of other cells. The data are characterised by
varying loads simulating dynamic operating conditions. Two hypothetical
scenarios are considered: one assumes that a recent capacity measurement is
known, the other is based only on the nominal capacity. It was shown that the
degradation behaviour of the batteries under examination is influenced by their
historical data, as supported by the low prediction errors achieved (root mean
squared errors from 1.2% to 7.22% when considering data up to the battery End
of Life). Moreover, we offer a multi-factor perspective where the degree of
impact of each different factor is analysed. Finally, we compare with a Long
Short-Term Memory Neural Network and other works from the literature on the
same dataset. We conclude that the MFP regression is effective and competitive
with contemporary works, and provides several additional advantages e.g. in
terms of interpretability, generalisability, and implementability.

reconstruct the largest modes better than only using 21-cm data, with the
spectroscopic sample performing significantly better than the photometric
sample despite much lower number density. We demonstrate the synergies between
surveys by showing that the primordial initial density field is reconstructed
better with the combination of surveys than using either of them individually.
Methodologically, we also explore the importance of smoothing the density field

scenario under consideration has a secondary small-cell network that shares the

interference from the secondary transmitter common to all primary

performance degrades in the same manner as other ML techniques such as support

Representation learning on heterogeneous networks is not only a popular but a
pragmatic research field. The main challenge comes from the heterogeneity --
the diverse types of nodes and edges. Besides, for a given node in a HIN, the
significance of a neighborhood node depends not only on the structural distance
but semantics. How to effectively capture both structural and semantic
relations is another challenge. The current state-of-the-art methods are based
on the algorithm of meta-path and therefore have a serious disadvantage -- the
performance depends on the arbitrary choosing of meta-path(s). However, the
selection of meta-path(s) is experience-based and time-consuming. In this work,
we propose a novel meta-path-free representation learning on heterogeneous
networks, namely Heterogeneous graph Convolutional Networks (HCN). The proposed
method fuses the heterogeneity and develops a $k$-strata algorithm ($k$ is an
integer) to capture the $k$-hop structural and semantic information in
heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
to break out of the confinement of meta-paths for representation learning on
heterogeneous networks. We carry out extensive experiments on three real-world
heterogeneous networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in a

UV+optical light curves and low resolution spectroscopy spanning from $-13.8$
to $+108$~d from the maximum light in $B$-band. The photometric analysis
indicates that SN 2017hpa is a normal type Ia with $\Delta m_{B}(15) =
0.98\pm0.16$ mag and $M_{B}=-19.45\pm0.15$ mag at a distance modulus of $\mu =
34.08\pm0.09$ mag. The $(uvw1-uvv)$ colour evolution shows that SN 2017hpa
falls in the NUV-blue group. The $(B-V)$ colour at maximum is bluer in
comparison to normal type Ia supernovae. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the
Si II 6355 absorption feature evolves rapidly with a velocity gradient,
$\dot{v}=128\pm 7$ km s$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$. The pre-maximum phase spectra show
prominent C II 6580 {\AA} absorption feature. The C II 6580 {\AA} line velocity
measured from the observed spectra is lower than the velocity of Si II 6355
{\AA}, which could be due to a line of sight effect. The synthetic spectral
fits to the pre-maximum spectra using syn++ indicate the presence of a high
velocity component in the Si II absorption, in addition to a photospheric
component. Fitting the observed spectrum with the spectral synthesis code
TARDIS, the mass of unburned C in the ejecta is estimated to be $\sim
0.019$~$M_{\odot}$. The peak bolometric luminosity is $L^{bol}_{peak} =
1.43\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The radiation diffusion model fit to the
bolometric light curve indicates $0.61\pm0.02$ $M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni is
synthesized in the explosion.

attention in many fields, such as influenza prediction in public health.
However, the variable influenza seasonality, occasional pandemics, and domain
knowledge pose great challenges to construct an appropriate graph, which could
impair the strength of the current popular graph-based algorithms to perform
data analysis. In this study, we develop a novel method, Dynamic Virtual Graph
Significance Networks (DVGSN), which can supervisedly and dynamically learn
from similar ""infection situations"" in historical timepoints. Representation
learning on the dynamic virtual graph can tackle the varied seasonality and
pandemics, and therefore improve the performance. The extensive experiments on
real-world influenza data demonstrate that DVGSN significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to supervisedly learn a dynamic virtual graph for time-series
prediction tasks. Moreover, the proposed method needs less domain knowledge to
build a graph in advance and has rich interpretability, which makes the method
more acceptable in the fields of public health, life sciences, and so on.

Janssen effect in order to explore directly the local pressure dependence of
Granular Orifice Flow (GOF) systematically. We find that as Janssen effect is
removed, the flow rate Q changes linearly with the external pressure. The slope
{\alpha} of the linear change decays exponentially with the ratio of the silo
size and the size of the orifice {\Phi}/D, which suggests the existence of a
characteristic ratio {\lambda} (~2.4). When {\Phi}/D > {\lambda}, {\alpha}
gradually decays to zero, and the effect of external pressure on the GOF
becomes negligible, where the Beverloo law retrieves. Our results show that
Janssen effect is not a determining factor of the constant rate of GOF,
although it may contribute to shield the top load. The key parameter in GOF is
{\Phi}/D. In small {\Phi}/D, the flow rate of GOF can be directly adjusted by
the external pressure via our suspended-wall setup, which may be useful to the
transportation of granules in microgravity environment where the gravity-driven
Beverloo law is disabled.

(DNNs). Recently, researchers proposed different types of structural pruning
intending to reduce also the computation complexity. In this work, we first
suggest a new measure called mask-diversity which correlates with the expected
accuracy of the different types of structural pruning. We focus on the recently
suggested N:M fine-grained block sparsity mask, in which for each block of M
weights, we have at least N zeros. While N:M fine-grained block sparsity allows
acceleration in actual modern hardware, it can be used only to accelerate the
inference phase. In order to allow for similar accelerations in the training
phase, we suggest a novel transposable fine-grained sparsity mask, where the
same mask can be used for both forward and backward passes. Our transposable
mask guarantees that both the weight matrix and its transpose follow the same
sparsity pattern; thus, the matrix multiplication required for passing the
error backward can also be accelerated. We formulate the problem of finding the
optimal transposable-mask as a minimum-cost flow problem. Additionally, to
speed up the minimum-cost flow computation, we also introduce a fast
linear-time approximation that can be used when the masks dynamically change
during training. Our experiments suggest a 2x speed-up in the matrix
multiplications with no accuracy degradation over vision and language models.
Finally, to solve the problem of switching between different structure
constraints, we suggest a method to convert a pre-trained model with
unstructured sparsity to an N:M fine-grained block sparsity model with little
to no training. A reference implementation can be found at

gas. Such activity is expected to drive the secular evolution of the nucleus
and generate super winds, while the intense radiation fields and extreme gas
and cosmic ray densities present may act to modify the outcome of star
formation with respect to more quiescent galactic regions. The centre of the
Milky Way is the only example of this phenomenon where, by virtue of its
proximity, individual stars may be resolved. Previous studies have revealed
that it hosts a rich population of massive stars; these are located within
three clusters, with an additional contingent dispersed throughout the Central
Molecular Zone (CMZ). We employed VLT+KMOS to obtain homogeneous, high S/N
spectroscopy of the later cohort for classification and quantitative analysis.
Including previously identified examples, we found a total of 83 isolated
massive stars within the Galactic Centre, which are biased towards objects
supporting powerful stellar winds and/or extensive circumstellar envelopes. No
further stellar clusters, or their tidally stripped remnants, were identified,
although an apparent stellar overdensity was found to be coincident with the
Sgr B1 star forming region. The cohort of isolated massive stars within the CMZ
is comparable in size to that of the known clusters but, due to observational
biases, is likely highly incomplete at this time. Combining both populations
yields over 320 spectroscopically classified stars that are expected to undergo
core collapse within the next 20Myr. Given that this is presumably an
underestimate of the true number, the population of massive stars associated
with the CMZ appears unprecedented amongst star formation complexes within the
Milky Way, and one might anticipate that they play a substantial role in the
energetics and evolution of the nuclear region.

the model captures the one of a realistic data set learned with kernel
regression and classification, with out-of-the-box feature maps such as random

features learned by training multi-layer neural networks. We discuss both the

By performing General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we

several unresolved challenges: 1) the high-level abstraction of programming
styles in HLS sometimes conceals optimization opportunities; 2) existing HLS
tools do not provide flexible trade-off (Pareto) solutions among different
objectives and constraints; 3) the actual quality of the resulting RTL designs
is hard to predict. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end
framework, namelyIronMan. The primary goal is to enable a flexible and
automated design space exploration (DSE), to provide either optimal solutions
under user-specified constraints, or various trade-offs among different
objectives (such as different types of resources, area, and latency). Such DSE
either requires tedious manual efforts or is not achievable to attain these
goals through existing HLS tools. There are three components in IronMan: 1)
GPP, a highly accurate graph-neural-network-based performance and resource
predictor; 2) RLMD, a reinforcement-learning-based multi-objective DSE engine
that explores the optimal resource allocation strategy, to provide Pareto
solutions between different objectives; 3) CT, a code transformer to assist
RLMD and GPP, which extracts the data flow graph from original HLS C/C++ and
automatically generates synthesizable code with HLS directives. The
experimental results show that: 1) GPP achieves high prediction accuracy,
reducing prediction errors of HLS tools by 10.9x in resource utilization and
5.7x in timing; 2) RLMD obtains optimal or Pareto solutions that outperform the
genetic algorithm and simulated annealing by 12.7% and 12.9%, respectively; 3)
IronMan is able to find optimized solutions perfectly matching various DSP
constraints, with 2.54x fewer DSPs and up to 6x shorter latency than those of
HLS tools while being up to 400x faster than the heuristic algorithms and HLS
tools.

from the documents in an utterance-by-utterance manner. The main issue with
utterance-level sequential labeling is the difficulty of collecting labeled
conversational documents, as manual annotations are very costly. To deal with
this issue, we propose large-context conversational representation learning
(LC-CRL), a self-supervised learning method specialized for conversational
documents. A self-supervised learning task in LC-CRL involves the estimation of
an utterance using all the surrounding utterances based on large-context
language modeling. In this way, LC-CRL enables us to effectively utilize
unlabeled conversational documents and thereby enhances the utterance-level
sequential labeling. The results of experiments on scene segmentation tasks
using contact center conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

of two operators generated by one and the expression $-y''(x)+q(x)y(x-a)$ and
the boundary conditions $y^{(\nu)}(0)=y^{(j)}(\pi)=0,$ $j=0,1,$ uniquely
determine the complex-valued square-integrable potential $q(x)$ vanishing on
$(0,a)$ as soon as $a\in[\pi/2,\pi).$ For $a<\pi/2,$ the main equation of the
corresponding inverse problem is nonlinear, and it actually became the basic
question of the inverse spectral theory for Sturm-Liouville operators with
constant delay whether the uniqueness holds also in this nonlinear case. A few
years ago, a positive answer was obtained for $a\in[2\pi/5,\pi/2).$ Recently,
the authors gave, however, a negative answer for $a\in[\pi/3,2\pi/5)$ by
constructing infinite families of iso-bispectral potentials. Meanwhile, the
question remained open for the most difficult nonlinear case $a\in(0,\pi/3),$
allowing the parameter $a$ to approach the classical situation $a=0,$ in which
the uniqueness is well known. In the present paper, we address this gap and
give a negative answer in this remarkable case by constructing appropriate

reversals. We show that the occurrence of a magnetization reversal transition
depends on the relative strength and sign of two interactions between

We also conclude that the presence of a smooth spin reorientation transition
between the so-called $\Gamma_4$ and the $\Gamma_2$ phases through a coexisting
region, and the temperature range in which it occurs, depends on subtle balance
of metal--metal (superexchange and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya) and metal--rare-earth

outbursts caused by intermittent and powerful events of magnetospheric
accretion. These objects are not yet well investigated and are quite difficult
to characterize. Several parameters, such as plasma stream velocities,
characteristic densities, and temperatures, can be retrieved from present
observations. As of yet, however, there is no information about the magnetic
field values and the exact underlying accretion scenario is also under
discussion.
  Methods. We use laboratory plasmas, created by a high power laser impacting a
solid target or by a plasma gun injector, and make these plasmas propagate
perpendicularly to a strong external magnetic field. The propagating plasmas
are found to be well scaled to the presently inferred parameters of EXor-type
accretion event, thus allowing us to study the behaviour of such episodic
accretion processes in scaled conditions.
  Results. We propose a scenario of additional matter accretion in the
equatorial plane, which claims to explain the increased accretion rates of the
EXor objects, supported by the experimental demonstration of effective plasma
propagation across the magnetic field. In particular, our laboratory
investigation allows us to determine that the field strength in the accretion
stream of EXor objects, in a position intermediate between the truncation
radius and the stellar surface, should be of the order of 100 gauss. This, in
turn, suggests a field strength of a few kilogausses on the stellar surface,
which is similar to values inferred from observations of classical T Tauri
stars.

  https://openreview.net/forum?id=1EVb8XRBDNr",,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Current value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods optimize
individual Q values to guide individuals' behaviours via centralized training
with decentralized execution (CTDE). However, such expected, i.e.,
risk-neutral, Q value is not sufficient even with CTDE due to the randomness of
rewards and the uncertainty in environments, which causes the failure of these
methods to train coordinating agents in complex environments. To address these
issues, we propose RMIX, a novel cooperative MARL method with the Conditional
Value at Risk (CVaR) measure over the learned distributions of individuals' Q
values. Specifically, we first learn the return distributions of individuals to
analytically calculate CVaR for decentralized execution. Then, to handle the
temporal nature of the stochastic outcomes during executions, we propose a
dynamic risk level predictor for risk level tuning. Finally, we optimize the
CVaR policies with CVaR values used to estimate the target in TD error during
centralized training and the CVaR values are used as auxiliary local rewards to
update the local distribution via Quantile Regression loss. Empirically, we
show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
challenging StarCraft II tasks, demonstrating enhanced coordination and
improved sample efficiency.

facilitating users' search for an apartment or a house. Yet it remains
challenging to accurately appraise a property's value. Prior works have
primarily studied real estate valuation based on hedonic price models that take
structured data into account while accompanying unstructured data is typically
ignored. In this study, we investigate to what extent an automated visual
analysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance
hedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning
approach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price
data. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent
price models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of
an apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9174 real
estate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available
data. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant
explanatory power regarding rent prices - even after controlling for structural
and locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans
results in an up to 10.56% lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further
find that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance
for older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute
to the existing research body by establishing the link between the visual
design of floor plans and real estate prices. Moreover, our approach has
important implications for online real estate platforms, which can use our
findings to enhance user experience in their real estate listings.

filtrations, extending the theory for filtrations of $m$-primary ideals to
arbitrary (not necessarily Noetherian) filtrations. The mixed multiplicities of
$r$ filtrations on an analytically unramified local ring $R$ come from the
coefficients of a suitable homogeneous polynomial in $r$ variables of degree
equal to the dimension of the ring, analogously to the classical case of the
mixed multiplicities of $m$-primary ideals in a local ring. We prove that the
Minkowski inequalities hold for arbitrary filtrations. The characterization of
equality in the Minkowski inequality for m-primary ideals in a local ring by
Teissier, Rees and Sharp and Katz does not extend to arbitrary filtrations, but
we show that they are true in a large and important subcategory of filtrations.
We define divisorial and bounded filtrations. The filtration of powers of a
fixed ideal is a bounded filtration, as is a divisorial filtration. We show
that in an excellent local domain, the characterization of equality in the
Minkowski equality is characterized by the condition that the integral closures
of suitable Rees like algebras are the same, strictly generalizing the theorem
of Teissier, Rees and Sharp and Katz. We also prove that a theorem of Rees
characterizing the inclusion of ideals with the same multiplicity generalizes
to bounded filtrations in excellent local domains. We give a number of other
applications, extending classical theorems for ideals.

predicted in the 1930s - plays an essential role in comb formation in quantum
cascade lasers (QCLs). We develop a self-consistent theoretical model that
considers all aspects of comb formation: bandstructure, electron transport, and
cavity dynamics. It reveals that Bloch gain gives rise to a giant Kerr
nonlinearity and serves as the physical origin of the linewidth enhancement
factor in QCLs. Using a master equation approach, we explain how frequency
modulated combs can be produced in Fabry-P\'{e}rot QCLs over the entire bias
range. In ring resonators, Bloch gain triggers phase turbulence and the
formation of soliton-like patterns.

this paper, we take an initial attempt, and demonstrate that the DMV has the
JND, termed as the DMV-JND. We then propose a JND model for the image
classification task in the DMV. It has been discovered that the DMV can
tolerate distorted images with average PSNR of only 9.56dB (the lower the
better), by generating JND via unsupervised learning with the proposed
DMV-JND-NET. In particular, a semantic-guided redundancy assessment strategy is
designed to restrain the magnitude and spatial distribution of the DMV-JND.
Experimental results on image classification demonstrate that we successfully
find the JND for deep machine vision. Our DMV-JND facilitates a possible
direction for DMV-oriented image and video compression, watermarking, quality
assessment, deep neural network security, and so on.

this paper, and performance is quantified by the regret, defined with respect
to the Bayes optimal log-loss. We discuss two known methods. The first is one
vs. all (OVA), for which we prove that the multiclass regret is upper bounded
by the sum of binary regrets of the constituent classifiers. The second is
hierarchical classification, based on a binary tree. For this method we prove
that the multiclass regret is exactly a weighted sum of constituent binary
regrets where the weighing is determined by the tree structure.
  We also introduce a leverage-hierarchical classification method, which
potentially yields smaller log-loss and regret. The advantages of these
classification methods are demonstrated by simulation on both synthetic and
real-life datasets.

the underlying mechanism by which ATP regulates phase separation by combining

in dilute FUS solutions, resulting from the ATP-concentration--dependent

partially filling the container is often the subject of a homework problem in
the first graduate fluids class. In that problem, surface tension is neglected,
the interface shape is parabolic and the contact angle boundary condition is
not satisfied in general. When surface tension is accounted for, the shapes
exhibit much richer dependencies as a function of rotation velocity. We analyze
steady interface shapes in rotating right-circular cylindrical containers under
rigid body rotation in zero gravity. We pay especial attention to shapes near
criticality, in which the interface, or part thereof, becomes straight and
parallel to the axis of rotation at certain specific rotational speeds. We
examine geometries where the container is axially infinite and derive
properties of their solutions. We then examine in detail two special cases of
menisci in a cylindrical container: a meniscus spanning the cross section; and
a meniscus forming a bubble. In each case we develop exact solutions for the
respective axial lengths as infinite series in powers of appropriate rotation
parameters; and we find the respective asymptotic behaviors as the shapes
approach their critical configuration. Finally we apply the method of
asymptotic approximants to yield analytical expressions for the axial lengths
of menisci over the whole range of rotation speeds. In this application, the
analytical solution is employed to examine errors introduced by the assumption
that the interface is a right circular cylinder; this assumption is key to the
spinning bubble method used to measure surface tension.

distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set
up under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent,
queuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with
time-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper.
Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for
exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also
significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar
level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a
sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's
occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose
a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a
balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate
the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess
the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is
possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as
the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.

COVID-10 spreading. However, there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via
differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to predict the actual impact on
virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement
effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to
understand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models
capable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should
be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the
possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in
relation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection.
This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the
COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios. The model
uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers
parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus
(based on a virus spread risk model) and population mobility patterns. The
model is calibrated with real data and reproduces the impact that different
mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination
of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would
have been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on
a-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in
place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic. The proposed model could
give useful suggestions for decision-makers to tackle pandemics and virus
spreading at a strategic level.

provide new means to connect with others. While recent research demonstrates
the expressive potential for biosignals, the value of sharing these personal

Significant Otter, an Apple Watch/iPhone app that enables romantic partners to
share and respond to each other's biosignals in the form of animated otter
avatars. In a one-month study with 20 couples, participants used Significant
Otter with biosignals sensing OFF and ON. We found that while sensing OFF
enabled couples to keep in touch, sensing ON enabled easier and more authentic
communication that fostered social connection. However, the addition of
biosignals introduced concerns about autonomy and agency over the messages they
sent. We discuss design implications and future directions for communication
systems that recommend messages based on biosignals.

cancer tumors concerning the following goals:
  a) To maximize the effect of radiation on the tumor, restricting the effect
produced to the organs at risk (healing approach).
  b) To minimize the effect of radiation on the organs at risk, while
maintaining enough effect of radiation on the tumor (palliative approach).
  We will assume the linear-quadratic model to characterize the radiation
effect and consider the stationary case (that is, without taking into account
the timing of doses and the tumor growth between them).
  The main novelty with respect to previous works concerns the presence of
minimum and maximum dose fractions, to achieve the minimum effect and to avoid
undesirable side effects, respectively.
  We have characterized in which situations is more convenient the
hypofractionated protocol (deliver few fractions with high dose per fraction)
and in which ones the hyperfractionated regimen (deliver a large number of
lower doses of radiation) is the optimal strategy.
  In all cases, analytical solutions to the problem are obtained in terms of
the data. In addition, the calculations to implement these solutions are
elementary and can be carried out using a pocket calculator.

models to advance the understanding of brain disorders in neuroimaging studies.
To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques
typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level
importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing
some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the
neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the
alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image

given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are
trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased

the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We
applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset

baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian
determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns

dex) between the blueberry sources and their associated LSBs. Moreover, the
radial metallicity gradients in our blueberries are also different than their
respective LSBs - suggesting that these had significantly different metallicity
histories. The likelihood of survival of these blueberries as TDGs is analyzed
based on their structural and kinematic properties. Our analysis shows that
although the two blueberries are stable against internal motions, they would
not have survived against the tidal force of the host galaxy. Based on the
velocity difference between the host LSBs and the blueberries, it appears that
they are compact, starburst systems in their advanced stage of merger with

intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to
trade a good for which they hold private valuations. Despite the simplicity of
this problem, a classical result by Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) affirms
the impossibility of designing a mechanism which is simultaneously efficient,
incentive compatible, individually rational, and budget balanced. This
impossibility result fostered an intense investigation of meaningful trade-offs
between these desired properties. Much work has focused on approximately
efficient fixed-price mechanisms, i.e., Blumrosen and Dobzinski (2014; 2016),
Colini-Baldeschi et al. (2016), which have been shown to fully characterize
strong budget balanced and ex-post individually rational direct revelation
mechanisms. All these results, however, either assume some knowledge on the
priors of the seller/buyer valuations, or a black box access to some samples of
the distributions, as in D{\""u}tting et al. (2021). In this paper, we cast for
the first time the bilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework
over rounds of seller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on the
private seller/buyer valuations. Our main contribution is a complete
characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms with
different models of feedback and private valuations, using as benchmark the
best fixed price in hindsight. More precisely, we prove the following bounds on
the regret:
  $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback (i.e., direct
revelation mechanisms);
  $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ for realistic feedback (i.e.,
posted-price mechanisms) and independent seller/buyer valuations with bounded
densities;
  $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and seller/buyer valuations with
bounded densities;
  $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer

  $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for the adversarial setting.

and the Spectral Boundary Integral method (SBIM) to model nonlinear problems in
unbounded domains. The flexibility of FEM is used to model the complex,
heterogeneous, and nonlinear part -- such as the dynamic rupture along a fault
with near fault plasticity -- and the high accuracy and computational
efficiency of SBIM is used to simulate the exterior half spaces perfectly
truncating all incident waves. The exact truncation allows us to greatly reduce
the domain of spatial discretization compared to a traditional FEM approach,
leading to considerable savings in computational cost and memory requirements.
The coupling of FEM and SBIM is achieved by the exchange of traction and
displacement boundary conditions at the computationally defined boundary. The
method is suited to implementation on massively parallel computers. We validate
the developed method by means of a benchmark problem. Three more complex
examples with a low velocity fault zone, low velocity off-fault inclusion, and
interaction of multiple faults, respectively, demonstrate the capability of the
hybrid scheme in solving problems of very large sizes. Finally, we discuss

questions by presenting VIPER and BOA. VIPER compares trade-off spaces induced
by different approximation frameworks by visualizing performance improvements

use VIPER and BOA to compare and combine three different approximation

precision, one that skips loop iterations, and one that manipulates existing

find VIPER's visualizations provide a quicker and more convenient way to

liquid to vapor)? This question remains fundamentally unresolved. In the
modeling of heat transfer problems with no phase change, the temperature and
heat flux continuity conditions lead to the interface temperature. However, in
problems with phase change, the heat flux condition is used to determine the
amount of mass changing phase. This makes the interface temperature
indeterminate unless an additional condition is imposed. A common approach in
the modeling of boiling is to assume that the interface attains the saturation
temperature according some measure of pressure at the interface. This
assumption is usually applied even under highly non-equilibrium scenarios where
significant temperature gradients and mass transport occur across the
interface. In this work, an ab-initio thermodynamic principle is introduced
based on the entropy production at the interface that fully specifies the
associated temperature under non-equilibrium scenarios. Physically, the
thermodynamic principle provides a theoretical limit on the space of possible
phase change rates that can occur by associating the mass flux with a
corresponding interfacial entropy production rate; a stronger statement is made
that a system with sufficient degrees of freedom selects the maximum entropy
production, giving the observed phase change rate and associated interface
properties. This entropic principle captures experimental and computational
values of the interface temperature that can deviate by over $50\%$ from the
assumed saturation values. It also accounts for temperature jumps
(discontinuities) at the interface whose difference can exceed 15 degrees
Celcius. This thermodynamic principle is found to appropriately complete the
phase change problem.

public works and required to ensure well-timed infrastructure delivery to their
communities. We investigate whether monitoring the activity of local procuring
authorities during the execution phase of the works they manage may expedite
the infrastructure delivery process. Focussing on an Italian regional law which
imposes monitoring by the regional government on ""strategic"" works carried out
by local buyers, we draw causal claims using a regression-discontinuity
approach, made unusual by the presence of multiple assignment variables.
Estimation is performed through discrete-time survival analysis techniques.
Results show that monitoring does expedite infrastructure delivery.

solar heating alone by several hundred degrees. Enough energy is deposited at
auroral regions to heat the entire thermosphere, but models predict that
equatorward distribution is inhibited by strong Coriolis forces and ion drag. A
better understanding of auroral energy deposition and circulation are critical
to solving this so-called energy crisis. Stellar occultations observed by the
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument during the Cassini Grand Finale
were designed to map the thermosphere from pole to pole. We analyze these
observations, together with earlier observations from 2016 and 2017, to create
a two-dimensional map of densities and temperatures in Saturns thermosphere as
a function of latitude and depth. The observed temperatures at auroral
latitudes are cooler and peak at higher altitudes and lower latitudes than
predicted by models, leading to a shallower meridional pressure gradient. Under
modified geostrophy, we infer slower westward zonal winds that extend to lower
latitudes than predicted, supporting equatorward flow from approximately 70 to
30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres. We also show evidence of atmospheric
waves in the data that can contribute to equatorward redistribution of energy
through zonal drag.

problems is presented. The boundary integral equation method relates the slip
and the shear stress at an interface between two half-planes. It involves
evaluating a space-time convolution of the shear stress or the slip at the
interface. In the spectral formulation, the convolution with respect to the
spatial coordinate is performed in the spectral domain. This leads to greater
numerical efficiency. Prior work on the spectral formulation of the boundary
integral equation method has performed the elastodynamic convolution of the
slip at the interface. In the present work, the convolution is performed of the
shear stress at the interface. The spectral formulation is developed both for
an interface between identical solids and for a bi-material interface. It is
validated by numerically calculating the response of the interface to harmonic
and to impulsive disturbances and comparing with known analytical solutions. To
illustrate use of the method, dynamic slip rupture propagation with a
slip-weakening friction law is simulated.

published towards the end of 2020 by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, we have
built up a simple Bayesian model, in which the main quantity of interest plays
the role of {\em vaccine efficacy} (`$\epsilon$'). The resulting Bayesian
Network is processed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in JAGS
interfaced to R via rjags. As outcome, we get several probability density
functions (pdf's) of $\epsilon$, each conditioned on the data provided by the
three pharma companies. The result is rather stable against large variations of
the number of people participating in the trials and it is `somehow' in good
agreement with the results provided by the companies, in the sense that their
values correspond to the most probable value (`mode') of the pdf's resulting
from MCMC, thus reassuring us about the validity of our simple model. However
we maintain that the number to be reported as `vaccine efficacy' should be the
mean of the distribution, rather than the mode, as it was already very clear to
Laplace about 250 years ago (its `rule of succession' follows from the simplest
problem of the kind). This is particularly important in the case in which the
number of successes equals the numbers of trials, as it happens with the
efficacy against `severe forms' of infection, claimed by Moderna to be 100%.
The implication of the various uncertainties on the predicted number of
vaccinated infectees is also shown, using both MCMC and approximated formulae.

(FCC) alloys to exploit their hardening capacity and thereby improve mechanical
properties. These fine-scale particles are typically fully coherent with matrix
with the same atomic configuration disregarding chemical species, which makes
them challenging to be characterized. Spatial distribution maps (SDMs) are used
to probe local order by interrogating the three-dimensional (3D) distribution
of atoms within reconstructed atom probe tomography (APT) data. However, it is
almost impossible to manually analyse the complete point cloud ($>10$ million)
in search for the partial crystallographic information retained within the
data. Here, we proposed an intelligent L12-ordered structure recognition method
based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The SDMs of a simulated
L12-ordered structure and the FCC matrix were firstly generated. These
simulated images combined with a small amount of experimental data were used to
train a CNN-based L12-ordered structure recognition model. Finally, the
approach was successfully applied to reveal the 3D distribution of L12-type
$\delta^\prime$-Al3(LiMg) nanoparticles with an average radius of 2.54 nm in a
FCC Al-Li-Mg system. The minimum radius of detectable nanodomain is even down
to 5 \r{A}. The proposed CNN-APT method is promising to be extended to
recognize other nanoscale ordered structures and even more-challenging
short-range ordered phenomena in the near future.

metasurfaces which are invariant in one-dimension is presented. The stacked
metasurface will generate collimated beams at desired angles in each band upon
reflection. The conductor-backed stacked metasurface consists of two
metasurfaces (a patterned metallic cladding supported by a dielectric spacer)
stacked one upon the other. The stacked metasurface is designed in three
phases. First the patterned metallic cladding of each metasurface is
homogenized and modeled as an inhomogeneous impedance sheet. An Electric Field
Integral Equation (EFIE) is written to model the mutual coupling between the
homogenized elements within each metasurface, and from metasurface to
metasurface. The EFIE is transformed into matrix equations by the method of
moments. The nonlinear matrix equations are solved at both bands iteratively
resulting in dual band complex-valued impedance sheets. In the second phase,
optimization is applied to transform these complex-valued impedance sheets into
purely reactive sheets suitable for printed circuit board fabrication by
introducing surface waves. In the third phase, the metallic claddings of each
metasurface are patterned for full-wave simulation of the dual band stacked
metasurface. Using this approach, two dual band stacked metasurfaces are
designed

problem in many areas such as iris detection, autonomous navigation, and
industrial robotics operations. There are two common approaches to fitting
geometric shapes to data: the geometric (iterative) approach and algebraic
(non-iterative) approach. The geometric approach is a nonlinear iterative
method that minimizes the sum of the squares of Euclidean distances of the
observed points to the ellipses and regarded as the most accurate method, but
it needs a good initial guess to improve the convergence rate. The algebraic
approach is based on minimizing the algebraic distances with some constraints
imposed on parametric space. Each algebraic method depends on the imposed
constraint, and it can be solved with the aid of the generalized eigenvalue
problem. Only a few methods in literature were developed to solve the problem
of concentric ellipses. Here we study the statistical properties of existing
methods by firstly establishing a general mathematical and statistical
framework for this problem. Using rigorous perturbation analysis, we derive the
variances and biasedness of each method under the small-sigma model. We also
develop new estimators, which can be used as reliable initial guesses for other
iterative methods. Then we compare the performance of each method according to
their theoretical accuracy. Not only do our methods described here outperform
other existing non-iterative methods, they are also quite robust against large
noise. These methods and their practical performances are assessed by a series
of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data.

Function (SIVF) as an alternative to the traditional Voigt function for the
HITRAN-based applications [Quine & Abrarov, JQSRT 2013]. It was shown that
application of the SIVF enables us to reduce spectral resolution without loss
of accuracy in computation of the spectral radiance. As a further development,
in this study we present more efficient SIVF approximations derived by using a
new sampling method based on incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function
[Abrarov & Quine, Appl. Math. Comput. 2015]. Since the SIVF mathematically
represents the mean value integral of the Voigt function, this method accounts
for area under the curve of the Voigt function. Consequently, the total band
radiance, defined as the integrated spectral radiance within a given spectral
region, can also retain its accuracy even at low spectral resolution. Our
numerical results demonstrate that application of the SIVF may be promising for
more rapid line-by-line computation in atmospheric models utilizing the HITRAN
molecular spectroscopic database. Such an approach may be particularly
efficient to implement a retrieval algorithm for the greenhouse gases from the
NIR space data collected by Earth-orbiting micro-spectrometers like Argus 1000
for their operation in a real-time mode. The real-time mode operation of the
micro-spectrometers can be advantageous for instant decision making during
flight for more efficient data collection from space.
