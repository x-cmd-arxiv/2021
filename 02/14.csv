of providing better user experience. Recommender systems (RS) for online games
face unique challenges since they must fulfill players' distinct desires, at
different user levels, based on their action sequences of various action types.
Although many sequential RS already exist, they are mainly single-sequence,
single-task, and single-user-level. In this paper, we introduce a new
sequential recommendation model for multiple sequences, multiple tasks, and
multiple user levels (abbreviated as M$^3$Rec) in Tencent Games platform, which
can fully utilize complex data in online games. We leverage Graph Neural
Network and multi-task learning to design M$^3$Rec in order to model the
complex information in the heterogeneous sequential recommendation scenario of
Tencent Games. We verify the effectiveness of M$^3$Rec on three online games of
Tencent Games platform, in both offline and online evaluations. The results
show that M$^3$Rec successfully addresses the challenges of recommendation in
online games, and it generates superior recommendations compared with
state-of-the-art sequential recommendation approaches.

that such a $(WRS)_4$ satisfying $F(R)$-gravity field equations represents a
perfect fluid with vanishing vorticity. Some energy conditions are studied
under the current setting to constrain the functional form of $F(R)$. We
examine a couple of popular toy models in $F(R)$-gravity, $F(R)=e^{\alpha R}$
where $\alpha$ is constant and $F(R)=R-\beta \tanh(R)$, $\beta$ is a constant.
We also find that the equation of state parameter (EoS) in both models supports
the universe's accelerating behavior, i.e., $\omega=-1$. According to the
recently suggested observations of accelerated expansion, both cases define
that the null, weak, and dominant energy conditions justify their requirements
while the strong energy conditions violate them.

soap films and bubbles. Until now, scientific studies of soap films generated
at a controlled velocity and without any feeding from the top, studied films of
a few square centimeters. The present work aims to present a new setup to
generate and characterize giant soap films (2~m $\times$ 0.7~m). Our setup is
enclosed in a humidity-controlled box of 2.2~m high, 1~m long and 0.75~m large.
Soap films are entrained by a fishing line withdrawn out of a bubbling solution
at various velocities. We measure the maximum height of the generated soap
films, as well as their lifetime, thanks to an automatic detection. This is
allowed by light-sensitive resistors collecting the light reflected on the soap
films and ensures robust statistical measurements. In the meantime, thickness
measurements are performed with a UV-VIS-spectrometer, allowing us to map the
soap films thickness over time.

as the power of human recognition into machine vision and engineering systems.
One of such principles is visual attention, a smart human concept which focuses
processing on a part of a scene. In this contribution, we utilize attention to
improve the automatic detection of defect patterns for wafers within the domain
of semiconductor manufacturing. Previous works in the domain have often
utilized classical machine learning approaches such as KNNs, SVMs, or MLPs,
while a few have already used modern approaches like deep neural networks
(DNNs). However, one problem in the domain is that the faults are often very
small and have to be detected within a larger size of the chip or even the
wafer. Therefore, small structures in the size of pixels have to be detected in
a vast amount of image data. One interesting principle of the human brain for
solving this problem is visual attention. Hence, we employ here a biologically
plausible model of visual attention for automatic visual inspection. We propose
a hybrid system of visual attention and a deep neural network. As demonstrated,
our system achieves among other decisive advantages an improvement in accuracy
from 81% to 92%, and an increase in accuracy for detecting faults from 67% to
88%. Hence, the error rates are reduced from 19% to 8%, and notably from 33% to
12% for detecting a fault in a chip. These results show that attention can
greatly improve the performance of visual inspection systems. Furthermore, we
conduct a broad evaluation, identifying specific advantages of the biological
attention model in this application, and benchmarks standard deep learning
approaches as an alternative with and without attention.

collectively using the historical trajectories across all agents, prior to
learning a policy. We do so by positing that the transition dynamics across
agents can be represented as a latent function of latent factors associated
with agents, states, and actions; subsequently, we theoretically establish that
this function is well-approximated by a ""low-rank"" decomposition of separable
agent, state, and action latent functions. This representation suggests a
simple, regularized neural network architecture to effectively learn the
transition dynamics per agent, even with scarce, offline data. We perform
extensive experiments across several benchmark environments and RL methods. The
consistent improvement of our approach, measured in terms of both state
dynamics prediction and eventual reward, confirms the efficacy of our framework
in leveraging limited historical data to simultaneously learn personalized

between the complexity class BQP and the Polynomial Hierarchy. Our first result
is a classical algorithm for the forrelation problem which has runtime

related to the variational energy achieved by the Quantum Approximate

theory to the world of stratified homotopy theory. To obtain a well-established
framework to work in, we prove a series of results on two model categories of
simplicial sets and topological spaces, both equipped with a notion of
filtration, introduced by Sylvain Douteau in his PHD thesis. In particular, we
show that there is a fully faithful embedding of homotopy categories from the
(finite) filtered simplicial into the filtered topological setting. We also use
these results to characterize the morphisms in the topological filtered
homotopy category between filtered spaces that are triangulable and stratified
in some very general sense as stratified homotopy classes of stratum preserving
maps. Then, moving on to simple homotopy theory, we propose a class of
combinatorial elementary expansions for filtered simplicial sets that
generalize both the classical ones as well as a class of stratified expansions
suggested by Banagl et al. We show that they fulfill a series of axioms,
suggested by Eckmann and Siebenmann for the construction of simple homotopy
theory. In doing so, we obtain a combinatorially defined Whitehead group and
torsion for filtered simplicial sets (and hence also for triangulable
stratified spaces). We then begin a detailed investigation of their formal
properties, proving for example that a Mayer-Vietoris formula holds. Next, we
apply our results on stratified homotopy theory to obtain a more topological
description of the Whitehead group and to generalize the Whitehead torsion to
arbitrary stratum preserving maps of triangulated filtered spaces. Finally, we
prove that our simple homotopy theory is a generalization of the classical one,
in the sense that it agrees with the latter when one considers trivially
filtered simplicial sets as CW-complexes.

taken at the level of the action and equations of motion, without imposing any
geometric constraints by hand. This relies on the fact that terms that diverge
in the limit and that come from the Vielbein in the Einstein-Hilbert term and
from the kinetic term of the Kalb-Ramond two-form field cancel against each
other. This cancelling of divergences is the target space analogue of a similar
cancellation that takes place at the level of the string sigma model between
the Vielbein in the kinetic term and the Kalb-Ramond field in the Wess-Zumino
term. The limit of the equations of motion leads to one equation more than the
limit of the action, due to the emergence of a local target space scale
invariance in the limit. Some of the equations of motion can be solved by scale
invariant geometric constraints. These constraints define a so-called
Dilatation invariant String Newton-Cartan geometry.

morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in
confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells,
called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must
execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion
molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time
compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this
idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1
transitions, which we call the ""T1 delay time"". We study how variations in T1
delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of
tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based
timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show
that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale
collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two.
We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent
extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1
delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and
rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a
more elastic-like -- and less fluid-like -- tissue response. Our work suggests
that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen
global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.

design analysis, testing, and validation. In this paper, we consider the
problem of inferring models from communication traces of system-on-chip~(SoC)
designs. The traces capture communications among different blocks of a SoC
design in terms of messages exchanged. The extracted models characterize the
system-level communication protocols governing how blocks exchange messages,
and coordinate with each other to realize various system functions. In this
paper, the above problem is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem,
which is then fed to a SMT solver. The solutions returned by the SMT solver are
used to extract the models that accept the input traces. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the proposed approach with traces collected from a
transaction-level simulation model of a multicore SoC design and traces of a
more detailed multicore SoC design developed in GEM5 environment.

correctly using security APIs is usually challenging for developers who lack

APIs; such misuses can introduce vulnerabilities into software, void security
protections, and present security exploits to hackers. To eliminate such
API-related vulnerabilities, this paper presents SEADER -- our new approach
that detects and repairs security API misuses. Given an exemplar, insecure code
snippet, and its secure counterpart, SEADER compares the snippets and conducts
data dependence analysis to infer the security API misuse templates and
corresponding fixing operations. Based on the inferred information, given a
program, SEADER performs inter-procedural static analysis to search for any
security API misuse and to propose customized fixing suggestions for those
vulnerabilities.
  To evaluate SEADER, we applied it to 25 <insecure, secure> code pairs, and
SEADER successfully inferred 18 unique API misuse templates and related fixes.
With these vulnerability repair patterns, we further applied SEADER to 10
open-source projects that contain in total 32 known vulnerabilities. Our
experiment shows that SEADER detected vulnerabilities with 100% precision, 84%
recall, and 91% accuracy. Additionally, we applied SEADER to 100 Apache
open-source projects and detected 988 vulnerabilities; SEADER always customized
repair suggestions correctly. Based on SEADER's outputs, we filed 60 pull
requests. Up till now, developers of 18 projects have offered positive
feedbacks on SEADER's suggestions. Our results indicate that SEADER can
effectively help developers detect and fix security API misuses. Whereas prior
work either detects API misuses or suggests simple fixes, SEADER is the first
tool to do both for nontrivial vulnerability repairs.

regularisation methods for training neural networks, where one injects additive
or multiplicative Gaussian noise to the network activations at every iteration
of the optimisation algorithm, which is typically chosen as stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). In this paper we focus on the so-called `implicit effect' of
GNIs, which is the effect of the injected noise on the dynamics of SGD. We show
that this effect induces an asymmetric heavy-tailed noise on SGD gradient
updates. In order to model this modified dynamics, we first develop a
Langevin-like stochastic differential equation that is driven by a general
family of asymmetric heavy-tailed noise. Using this model we then formally
prove that GNIs induce an `implicit bias', which varies depending on the
heaviness of the tails and the level of asymmetry. Our empirical results
confirm that different types of neural networks trained with GNIs are
well-modelled by the proposed dynamics and that the implicit effect of these
injections induces a bias that degrades the performance of networks.

introduces an estimator that admits weak, uncorrelated, or mean-independent
instruments that are non-independent of endogenous covariates. Relative to
conventional instrumental variable methods, the proposed estimator weakens the
relevance condition considerably without imposing a stronger exclusion
restriction. Identification mainly rests on (1) a weak conditional median
exclusion restriction imposed on pairwise differences in disturbances and (2)
non-independence between covariates and instruments. Under mild conditions, the
estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Monte Carlo experiments
showcase an excellent performance of the estimator, and two empirical examples

Lorentz factor of the reconnection generated beam, $\omega \sim \gamma_b^2 (

polarization properties: presence of narrow emission bands in the spectrum
favors linear polarization, while broadband emission can have arbitrary
polarization. (iv) The mechanism is robust to the momentum spread of the
particle in the beam. We also discuss a model of wigglers as non-linear

theorem for the degenerate Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise,

Kolmogorov operator. Hypocoercivity for the Langevin dynamics with constant
diffusion matrix was proven previously by Dolbeault, Mouhot and Schmeiser in
the corresponding Fokker-Planck framework, and made rigorous in the Kolmogorov
backwards setting by Grothaus and Stilgenbauer. We extend these results to
weakly differentiable diffusion coefficient matrices, introducing
multiplicative noise for the corresponding stochastic differential equation.
The rate of convergence is explicitly computed depending on the choice of these

solution to the abstract Cauchy problem, we first prove essential
self-adjointness of non-degenerate elliptic Dirichlet operators on Hilbert

Krylov and R\""ockner. We apply operator perturbation theory to obtain essential
m-dissipativity of the Kolmogorov operator, extending the m-dissipativity
results from Conrad and Grothaus. We emphasize that the chosen Kolmogorov
approach is natural, as the theory of generalized Dirichlet forms implies a
stochastic representation of the Langevin semigroup as the transition kernel of
a diffusion process which provides a martingale solution to the Langevin
equation with multiplicative noise. Moreover, we show that even a weak solution
is obtained this way.

approaches have dominated the field for many decades. This set of problems is
often tackled by partitioning the data into K clusters where the number of

lines over the years, it is well established that as the number of clusters or
dimensions increase, current approaches dwell in local minima resulting in
suboptimal solutions. In this work, we propose a new set of distance threshold
methods called Theta-based Algorithms (ThetA). Via experimental comparisons and
complexity analyses we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing
approaches in: a) clustering accuracy and b) time complexity. Additionally, we
show that for a large class of problems, learning the optimal threshold is
straightforward in comparison to learning K. Moreover, we show how ThetA can
infer the sparsity of datasets in higher dimensions.

sufficient condition for a static BH to be shadow-degenerate with Schwarzschild
is that the dominant photonsphere of both has the same impact parameter, when
corrected for the (potentially) different redshift of comparable observers in
the different spacetimes. Such shadow-degenerate geometries are classified into
two classes. The first shadow-equivalent class contains metrics whose constant
(areal) radius hypersurfaces are isometric to those of the Schwarzschild
geometry, which is illustrated by the Simpson and Visser (SV) metric. The
second shadow-degenerate class contains spacetimes with different redshift
profiles and an explicit family of metrics within this class is presented. In
the stationary, axi-symmetric case, we determine a sufficient condition for the
metric to be shadow degenerate with Kerr for far-away observers. Again we
provide two classes of examples. The first class contains metrics whose
constant (Boyer-Lindquist-like) radius hypersurfaces are isometric to those of
the Kerr geometry, which is illustrated by a rotating generalization of the SV
metric, obtained by a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. The second class of
examples pertains BHs that fail to have the standard north-south $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry, but nonetheless remain shadow degenerate with Kerr. The latter
provides a sharp illustration that the shadow is not a probe of the horizon
geometry. These examples illustrate that nonisometric BH spacetimes can cast
the same shadow, albeit the lensing is generically different.

a simple but powerful self-attention mechanism optimized for lane detection
called the Expanded Self Attention (ESA) module. Inspired by the simple

lane along the vertical and horizontal directions in an image. The prediction
of the confidence enables estimating occluded locations by extracting global
contextual information. ESA module can be easily implemented and applied to any
encoder-decoder-based model without increasing the inference time. The
performance of our method is evaluated on three popular lane detection
benchmarks (TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K). We achieve state-of-the-art

applications. To initialize, control, and read-out their quantum states, an
efficient optical interface for addressing defects with photons is required.
However, conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy with high refractive
index crystals has limited photon collection efficiency and spatial resolution.
Here, we demonstrate high resolution, high contrast imaging for defects qubits
using microsphere-assisted confocal microscopy. A microsphere provides an
excellent optical interface for point defects with a magnified virtual image
that improves spatial resolution up to ~${\lambda}$/5 as well as an optical
signal-to-noise ratio by four times. These features enable individual optical
addressing of single photons and single spins of spatially-unresolved defects
in conventional confocal microscopy with improved signal contrast. The combined
optical tweezers show the possibility of positioning or scanning the
microspheres for deterministic coupling and wide-field imaging of defects. The
approach does not require any complicated fabrication and additional optical
system but uses simple micro-optics off-the-shelf. From these distinctive
advantages of the microspheres, our approach can provide an efficient way for
imaging and addressing closely-spaced defects with higher resolution and
sensitivity.

subjects exhibiting strong positive symptoms (e.g.hallucinations and

schizophrenia subjects with strong positive symptoms and who are markedly ill
pose complex coordination patterns in facial and speech gestures than what is
observed in healthy subjects. This observation is in contrast to what previous
studies have shown in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), where subjects with MDD
show a simpler coordination pattern with respect to healthy controls or
subjects in remission. This difference is not surprising given MDD is
necessarily accompanied by Psychomotor slowing (i.e.,negative symptoms) which
affects speech, ideation and motility. With respect to speech, psychomotor
slowing results in slowed speech with more and longer pauses than what occurs
in speech from the same speaker when they are in remission and from a healthy
subject. Time delay embedded correlation analysis has been used to quantify the
differences in coordination patterns of speech articulation. The current study
is based on 17 Facial Action Units (FAUs) extracted from video data and 6 Vocal
Tract Variables (TVs) obtained from simultaneously recorded audio data. The TVs
are extracted using a speech inversion system based on articulatory phonology
that maps the acoustic signal to vocal tract variables. The high-level time

train a stacking ensemble classifier fusing audio and video modalities. The

coarse-grained in relational modeling, failing to (1) identify user-item
relation at a fine-grained level of intents, and (2) exploit relation
dependencies to preserve the semantics of long-range connectivity.
  In this study, we explore intents behind a user-item interaction by using
auxiliary item knowledge, and propose a new model, Knowledge Graph-based Intent
Network (KGIN). Technically, we model each intent as an attentive combination
of KG relations, encouraging the independence of different intents for better
model capability and interpretability. Furthermore, we devise a new information
aggregation scheme for GNN, which recursively integrates the relation sequences
of long-range connectivity (i.e., relational paths). This scheme allows us to
distill useful information about user intents and encode them into the
representations of users and items. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets show that, KGIN achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art methods like KGAT, KGNN-LS, and CKAN. Further analyses show
that KGIN offers interpretable explanations for predictions by identifying
influential intents and relational paths. The implementations are available at

Kewley \& Ellison published the coefficients of third-order polynomials that
can be used to convert between different strong line metallicity calibrations

improved polynomial coefficients. Second, we include in the calibration suite
five additional metallicity diagnostics that have been proposed in the last

random forest algorithm is non-parametric and therefore more flexible than
polynomial conversions, due to its ability to capture non-linear behaviour in

polynomial conversions, but has the significant advantage that a single model

automating the selection of an effective IS distribution with a transformation

distributions. The proposed sampler is the first to attain asymptotically
optimal variance reduction across a spectrum of multivariate distributions
despite being oblivious to the underlying structure. The large deviations
principle additionally results in new distribution tail asymptotics capable of
yielding operational insights. The applicability is illustrated by considering

providing clues to the system geometry and interaction between the black hole
accretion disk and the donor star wind. We measure a binary orbital period of
32.7921$\pm$0.0003 hr, in agreement with previous studies, and perform
phase-resolved spectroscopy using the X-ray data. The X-ray light curve reveals
a deep eclipse, consistent with inclination angles of $i=60-75^{\circ}$, and a
pre-eclipse excess consistent with an accretion stream impacting the disk edge.
We further measure radial velocity variations for several prominent FUV
spectral lines, most notably He II $\lambda$1640 and C IV $\lambda$1550. We
find that the He II emission lines systematically lag the expected Wolf-Rayet
star orbital motion by a phase difference $\Delta \phi\sim0.3$, while C IV
$\lambda$1550 matches the phase of the anticipated radial velocity curve of the
Wolf-Rayet donor. We assume the C IV $\lambda$1550 emission line follows a
sinusoidal radial velocity curve (semi-amplitude = 250 km s$^{-1}$) and infer a
BH mass of 17$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$. Our observations are consistent with the
presence of a wind-Roche lobe overflow accretion disk, where an accretion
stream forms from gravitationally focused wind material and impacts the edge of
the black hole accretion disk.

cavity at a lower frequency. while as the frequency increases, the intense
acoustic structure moves close to upstream and overlap with the hydrodynamic

achieves the largest energy amplification. However, it substantially reduces by
moving the forcing location from the leading-edge to the front wall of the

effective at compressing neural networks, but can lead to unacceptable accuracy
loss when applied to large models. In this paper, we propose the notion of
doping -- addition of an extremely sparse matrix to a structured matrix. Doping
facilitates additional degrees of freedom for a small number of parameters,
allowing them to independently diverge from the fixed structure. To train LSTMs
with doped structured matrices, we introduce the additional parameter matrix
while slowly annealing its sparsity level. However, we find that performance
degrades as we slowly sparsify the doping matrix, due to co-matrix adaptation
(CMA) between the structured and the sparse matrices. We address this over
dependence on the sparse matrix using a co-matrix dropout regularization (CMR)
scheme. We provide empirical evidence to show that doping, CMA and CMR are
concepts generally applicable to multiple structured matrices (Kronecker
Product, LMF, Hybrid Matrix Decomposition). Additionally, results with doped
kronecker product matrices demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy at large
compression factors (10 - 25x) across 4 natural language processing
applications with minor loss in accuracy. Doped KP compression technique
outperforms previous state-of-the art compression results by achieving 1.3 -
2.4x higher compression factor at a similar accuracy, while also beating strong
alternatives like pruning and low-rank methods by a large margin (8% or more).
Additionally, we show that doped KP can be deployed on commodity hardware using
the current software stack and achieve 2.5 - 5.5x inference run-time speed-up
over baseline.

is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of
convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN
architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based
generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly
a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and
low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid
self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale
up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training
recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training
instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified
normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves
highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using
convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art
inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2.

on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual
examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we
dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their

consider intermittent status updating through non-preemptive sensing/computing
(S/C) and transmission (Tx) operations, each costing a single energy recharge
of the node, through an erasure channel with (a) perfect channel feedback and
(b) no channel feedback. The S/C time for each update is independent with a

justify this correspondence in several ways:
  - QA pooling with respect to the two most well-studied scoring rules
(quadratic and logarithmic) corresponds to the two most well-studied forecast
aggregation methods (linear and logarithmic).
  - Given a scoring rule s used for payment, a forecaster agent who
sub-contracts several experts, paying them in proportion to their weights, is
best off aggregating the experts' reports using QA pooling with respect to s,
meaning this strategy maximizes its worst-case profit (over the possible
outcomes).
  - The score of an aggregator who uses QA pooling is concave in the experts'
weights. As a consequence, online gradient descent can be used to learn
appropriate expert weights from repeated experiments with low regret.
  - The class of all QA pooling methods is characterized by a natural set of

transport coefficients in the medium is seen to be sensitive to the strength of
the anisotropy for both collisional and radiative processes. In addition, the
collisional and radiative energy loss of the heavy quark in the anisotropic hot
QCD medium have been analyzed. The effects of anisotropy on the drag and
diffusion coefficients are observed to have a visible impact on the nuclear
suppression factor both at the RHIC and LHC.

As a first application, the model is applied to branching ratios between
fission and capture in the decay modes of excited fissile nuclei. The ratios
are compared with the Bohr-Wheeler transition-state theory to explore its
domain of validity. The Bohr-Wheeler theory assumes that the rates are
insensitive to the final-state scission dynamics; the insensitivity is rather
easily achieved in the CI parameterizations. The CI modeling is also capable of
reproducing the branching ratios of the transition-state hypothesis which is
one of the key ingredients in the present-day theory of induced fission.

(LF) images from hybrid lenses, including a high-resolution camera surrounded
by multiple low-resolution cameras. The performance of existing methods is
still limited, as they produce either blurry results on plain textured areas or
distortions around depth discontinuous boundaries. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel end-to-end learning-based approach, which can comprehensively
utilize the specific characteristics of the input from two complementary and
parallel perspectives. Specifically, one module regresses a spatially
consistent intermediate estimation by learning a deep multidimensional and
cross-domain feature representation, while the other module warps another
intermediate estimation, which maintains the high-frequency textures, by
propagating the information of the high-resolution view. We finally leverage
the advantages of the two intermediate estimations adaptively via the learned
attention maps, leading to the final high-resolution LF image with satisfactory
results on both plain textured areas and depth discontinuous boundaries.
Besides, to promote the effectiveness of our method trained with simulated
hybrid data on real hybrid data captured by a hybrid LF imaging system, we
carefully design the network architecture and the training strategy. Extensive
experiments on both real and simulated hybrid data demonstrate the significant
superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first end-to-end deep learning method for LF
reconstruction from a real hybrid input. We believe our framework could
potentially decrease the cost of high-resolution LF data acquisition and
benefit LF data storage and transmission.

learner to better recognize structural patterns in space and time. We leverage
the whole volume of STSS and let our model learn to extract an effective motion

inserted into neural architectures and trained end-to-end without additional

effectively captures long-term interaction and fast motion in the video,
leading to robust action recognition. Our experimental analysis demonstrates
its superiority over previous methods for motion modeling as well as its
complementarity to spatio-temporal features from direct convolution. On the
standard action recognition benchmarks, Something-Something-V1 & V2, Diving-48,

With the existence of vocabulary gap between user language of queries and
seller language of products, measuring semantic relevance is necessary and
neural networks are engaged to address this task. However, semantic relevance
is different from click-through rate prediction in that no direct training
signal is available. Most previous attempts learn relevance models from user
click-through data that are cheap and abundant. Unfortunately, click behavior
is noisy and misleading, which is affected by not only relevance but also
factors including price, image and attractive titles. Therefore, it is
challenging but valuable to learn relevance models from click-through data. In
this paper, we propose a new relevance learning framework that concentrates on
how to train a relevance model from the weak supervision of click-through data.
Different from previous efforts that treat samples as either relevant or
irrelevant, we construct more fine-grained samples for training. We propose a
novel way to consider samples of different relevance confidence, and come up
with a new training objective to learn a robust relevance model with desirable
score distribution. The proposed model is evaluated on offline annotated data

exterior solution is assumed as Schwarzschild metric and is joined with the
interior metric obtained across the boundary of the star. These matching of the
metrices along with the condition of the vanishing radial pressure at the
boundary lead us to determine the model parameters. The physical acceptability
of the solutions has verified by making use of the current estimated data
available from the pulsar 4U1608-52. Thereafter, assuming anisotropy due to
tidal effects we calculate the Love numbers from our model and compare the

surface layer turbulence that induces non-Gaussian temperature statistics,
while such signature is not observed for velocity signals. Although approaches
based on probability density functions have been used so far, those are not
able to explain to what extent the signals' temporal structure impacts the
statistical characteristics of the velocity and temperature fluctuations. To
tackle this issue, a visibility network analysis is carried out on a
field-experimental dataset from a convective atmospheric surface layer flow.
Through surrogate data and network-based measures, we demonstrate that the
temperature intermittency is related to strong non-linear dependencies in the
temperature signals. Conversely, a competition between linear and non-linear
effects tends to inhibit the temperature-like intermittency behaviour in
streamwise and vertical velocities. Based on present findings, new research
avenues are likely to be opened up in studying large-scale intermittency in
convective turbulence.

discussed in fields ranging from statistical and mathematical physics to
climate, finance and ecology. Herein, we study Extreme Value Statistics (EVS)

to its ubiquitous and enriching applications in physics, chemistry, queuing
theory, search processes and computer science. We present a detailed analysis
for the finite and large time statistics of extremals (maximum and arg-maximum
i.e., the time when the maximum is reached) of the spatial displacement in such
system. In particular, we derive an exact renewal formula that relates the
joint distribution of maximum and arg-maximum of the reset process to the
statistical measures of the underlying process. Benchmarking our results for
the maximum of a reset-trajectory that pertain to the Gumbel class for large
sample size, we show that the arg-maximum density attains to a uniform
distribution regardless of the underlying process at a large observation time.
This emerges as a manifestation of the renewal property of the resetting
mechanism. The results are augmented with a wide spectrum of Markov and
non-Markov stochastic processes under resetting namely simple diffusion,
diffusion with drift, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and random acceleration
process in one dimension. Rigorous results are presented for the first two
set-ups while the latter two are supported with heuristic and numerical

with a check-node complexity the same as binary BP. As every message is a
scalar, the message normalization can be naturally applied to improve the
performance. Another observation is that the message-update schedule affects
the BP decoding performance against short cycles. We show that running BP with
message normalization according to a serial schedule (or other schedules) may
significantly improve the decoding performance and error-floor in computer
simulation.

electroweak monopole and a magnetic dumbbell (""meson"") made up of a
monopole-antimonopole pair connected by a $Z$-magnetic flux tube. The monopole
is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the weak $SU(2)_L$ gauge
symmetry by the induced vacuum expectation value of a heavy scalar $SU(2)_L$
triplet with zero weak hypercharge contained in the adjoint Higgs 24-plet. This
monopole carries a Coulomb magnetic charge of $(3/4) (2\pi/e)$ as well as
$Z$-magnetic charge, where $2\pi/e$ denotes the unit Dirac magnetic charge. Its
total magnetic charge is $\sqrt{3/8}(4\pi/e)$, which is in agreement with the
Dirac quantization condition. The monopole weighs about 700 GeV, but because of
the attached $Z$-magnetic tube it exists, together with the antimonopole, in a
magnetic dumbbell configuration whose mass is expected to lie in the TeV range.
The presence of these topological structures in $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ and in
their supersymmetric extensions provides an exciting new avenue for testing
these theories in high-energy colliders.

subset of the training data, making it more data-efficient. For this purpose,
the training of the teacher model is modified to include self-regulation
wherein a sample in the training set is used for updating model parameters in
the backward pass either if it is misclassified or the model is not confident
enough in its prediction. This modification restricts the participation of
samples, unlike the conventional training method. The number of times a sample
participates in the self-regulated training process is a measure of its
significance towards the model's knowledge. The significance values are used to
weigh the losses incurred on the corresponding samples in the distillation
process. This method is named significance-based distillation. Two other
methods are proposed for comparison where the student model learns by
distillation and incorporating self-regulation as the teacher model, either
utilizing the significance information computed during the teacher's training
or not. These methods are named hybrid and regulated distillations,
respectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods
achieve similar performance as other state-of-the-art methods for knowledge
distillation while utilizing a significantly less number of samples.

goal of analyzing the relationship between the eigenspectrum problem for violin

distribution and vice versa. Finally, we analyze how to modify the violin shape
to keep its response constant as its material properties vary. This is an
original technique in musical acoustics, where artificial intelligence is not
widely used yet. It allows us to both compute the vibrational behavior of an
instrument from its geometry and optimize its shape for a given response.

classification of 2HDM scalar potentials that exhibit an exact Higgs alignment
(where the tree-level couplings of one neutral scalar coincide with those of
the Standard Model Higgs boson), due to a residual symmetry that is unbroken in
the vacuum. One surprising aspect of the ERPS4 is the possibility that the
scalar sector is CP-conserving despite the presence of a complex parameter of
the scalar potential whose complex phase cannot be removed by separate
rephasings of the two scalar doublet fields. The significance of the ERPS4
regime for custodial symmetry is also discussed, and the cases where a
custodial symmetric 2HDM scalar potential preserves an exact Higgs alignment

Also, in order to reduce the shared key discovery computing and communication

proposed as a solution in recent years. In this study, a ${\mu}$-PBIBD
combinatorial design is introduced and constructed and the mapping of such
design as a key pre-distribution scheme in the resource-constrained IoT network
is explained. Through using such key pre-distribution scheme, more keys are
obtained for communication between two devices in the IoT network. This means
that there will be a maximum of q + 2 keys between the two devices in the
network, where q is the prime power, that is, instead of having a common key
for a direct secure connection, the two devices can have q + 2 common keys in
their key chain. Accordingly, we would increase the resilience of the key

candidate generation models are based on CTR estimation, which do not consider
user's satisfaction with the clicked item. Items with low quality but
attractive title (i.e., click baits) may be recommended to the user, which
worsens the user experience. One solution to this problem is to model the click
and the reading duration simultaneously under the multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. There are two challenges in the modeling. The first one is how to
deal with the zero duration of the negative samples, which does not necessarily
indicate dislikes. The second one is how to perform multi-task learning in the
candidate generation model with double tower structure that can only model one
single task. In this paper, we propose an distillation based multi-task
learning (DMTL) approach to tackle these two challenges. We model duration by
considering its dependency of click in the MTL, and then transfer the knowledge
learned from the MTL teacher model to the student candidate generation model by
distillation. Experiments conducted on dataset gathered from traffic logs of
Tencent Kandian's recommender system show that the proposed approach
outperforms the competitors significantly in modeling duration, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed candidate generation model.

these collected AVs to provide on-demand ride services without any drivers. We
call such a mobility market with AV renting options the ""AV crowdsourcing

can capture the customers' mode choices and AV owners' rental decisions with
the presence of traffic congestion. Then, we explore different scenarios that
either maximize the crowdsourcing platform's profit or maximize social welfare.
Gradient-based optimization algorithms are designed for solving the problems.
The results obtained by numerical examples reveal the welfare enhancement and
the strong profitability of the AV crowdsourcing service. However, when the
crowdsourcing scale is small, the crowdsourcing platform might not be

craft of payoff-relevant environmental signals solely can influence the
behaviors of intelligent agents. The agents' strategic interactions are
captured by an incomplete-information Markov game, in which each agent first
selects one environmental signal from multiple signal sources as additional
payoff-relevant information and then takes an action. There is a rational
information designer (designer) who possesses one signal source and aims to
control the equilibrium behaviors of the agents by designing the information
structure of her signals sent to the agents. An obedient principle is
established which states that it is without loss of generality to focus on the
direct information design when the information design incentivizes each agent
to select the signal sent by the designer, such that the design process avoids
the predictions of the agents' strategic selection behaviors. We then introduce
the design protocol given a goal of the designer referred to as obedient
implementability (OIL) and characterize the OIL in a class of obedient perfect
Bayesian Markov Nash equilibria (O-PBME). A new framework for information
design is proposed based on an approach of maximizing the optimal slack
variables. Finally, we formulate the designer's goal selection problem and
characterize it in terms of information design by establishing a relationship
between the O-PBME and the Bayesian Markov correlated equilibria, in which we
build upon the revelation principle in classic information design in economics.
The proposed approach can be applied to elicit desired behaviors of multi-agent
systems in competing as well as cooperating settings and be extended to
heterogeneous stochastic games in the complete- and the incomplete-information
environments.

small resource-efficient convolutional neural networks from their dense

still suffer from one or more limitations, that include 1) the need for
training the dense model from scratch with pruning-related parameters embedded
in the architecture, 2) requiring model-specific hyperparameter settings, 3)
inability to include budget-related constraint in the training process, and 4)
instability under scenarios of extreme pruning. In this paper, we present
ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs continuous Heaviside
function and a novel crispness loss to identify a highly sparse network out of
an existing dense network. Our choice of continuous Heaviside function is
inspired by the field of design optimization, where the material distribution
task is posed as a continuous optimization problem, but only discrete values (0
or 1) are practically feasible and expected as final outcomes. Our approach's
flexible design facilitates its use with different choices of budget
constraints while maintaining stability for very low target budgets.
Experimental results show that ChipNet outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by remarkable margins of up to 16.1% in terms of accuracy.
Further, we show that the masks obtained with ChipNet are transferable across
datasets. For certain cases, it was observed that masks transferred from a
model trained on feature-rich teacher dataset provide better performance on the
student dataset than those obtained by directly pruning on the student data

approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf{124}, 072001 (2020)] by including the
$\Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\eta_cp$ as explicitly in addition to the $J/\psi
p$, as required by unitarity and heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Since
inelastic parameters are very badly constrained by the current data, three
schemes are considered: (a) scheme I with pure contact interactions and without
the $\Lambda_c\bar D^{(*)}$ interactions, (b) scheme II, where the one-pion
exchange is added to scheme I, and (c) scheme III, where the $\Lambda_c \bar
D^{(*)}$ are included in addition. It is shown that to obtain cutoff
independent results, OPE in the multichannel system is to be supplemented with
$S$-$D$ mixing contact terms. We demonstrate that the experimental data for the
$J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution are consistent with the interpretation
of the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)/P_c(4457)$ as $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ and $\Sigma_c
\bar{D}^{*}$ hadronic molecules, respectively, and that the data show clear
evidence for a new narrow $P_c(4380)$, as a $\Sigma_c^*\bar D$ molecule, which
should exist as a consequence of HQSS. While two equally good solutions are
found in scheme I, only one of these solutions with the quantum numbers of the
$P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ being $J^P=3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$, respectively,
survives the requirement of regulator independence once the OPE is included.

demonstrate that those related to the $P_c(4440)$ and the $P_c(4457)$ in the

  Physics",,,,"hep-ph physics.plasm-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we present a phenomenological study of the complete analytical
solution to the bound eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Yukawa potential
obtained previously using the hidden supersymmetry of the system and a
systematic expansion of the Yukawa potential in terms of $\delta=a_{0}/D$,
where $a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius and $D$ is the screening length. The
eigenvalues, $\epsilon_{nl}(\delta)$, are given in the form of Taylor series in
$\delta$ which can be systematically calculated to the desired order
$\delta^{k}$. Coulomb $l$-degeneracy is broken by the screening effects and,
for a given $n$, $\epsilon_{nl}(\delta)$ is larger for higher values of $l$
which causes the crossing of levels for $n\ge4$. The convergence radius of the
Taylor series can be enlarged up to the critical values using the Pad\'e
approximants technique which allows us to calculate the eigenvalues with high
precision in the whole rage of values of $\delta$ where bound states exist, and
to reach a precise determination of the critical screening lengths,
$\delta_{nl}$. Eigenstates have a form similar to the solutions of the Coulomb
potential, with the associated Laguerre polynomials replaced by new polynomials
of order $\delta^{k}$ with $r$-dependent coefficients which, in turn, are
polynomials in $r$. In general we find sizable deviations from the Coulomb
radial probabilities only for screening lengths close to their critical values.
We use these solutions to find the squared absolute value at the origin of the
wave function for $l=0$, and their derivatives for $l=1$, for the lowest
states, as functions of $\delta$, which enter the phenomenology of dark matter
bound states in dark gauge theories with a light dark mediator.

previously reported by Ribe [Physical Review E 68, 036305 (2003)], by
investigating shear thickening (dilatant) and shear thinning (pseudoplastic)
effects on the development of folding instabilities in non-Newtonian viscous
sheets of which viscosity is given by a power-law constitutive equation. Such
instabilities are trigged by compression stresses acting on viscous sheets that
leave a channel at a very small initial velocity, fall, and then hit a solid
surface or a fluid substrate. Our study is conducted through a mixed approach
combining direct numerical simulations, energy budget analyses, scaling laws,
and experiments. The numerical results are based on an adaptive variational
multi-scale method for multiphase flows, while Carpobol gel sheets are
considered for the conducted experiments. Two folding regimes are observed: (1)
the viscous regime; and (2) the gravitational one. Interestingly, only the
latter is affected by shear thinning/thickening manifestations within the
material. In short, when gravity is balanced by viscous forces along the
non-Newtonian viscous sheet, both the folding amplitude and the folding
frequency are given by a power-law function of the sheet slenderness, the
Galileo number (the ratio of the gravitational stress to the viscous one), and
the flow behaviour index. Highly shear thickening materials develop large
amplitude (and low frequency) instabilities, which, in contrast, tend to be
suppressed by shear thinning effects, and eventually cease. Lastly,
nonNewtonian effects on folding onset/cessation are also carefully explored. As
a result, non-Newtonian folding onset and cessation criteria are presented.

that the point-null hypothesis is known to be false from the outset. We examine
the consequences of approximating the sharp point-null hypothesis by a hazy
`peri-null' hypothesis instantiated as a narrow prior distribution centered on
the point of interest. The peri-null Bayes factor then equals the point-null
Bayes factor multiplied by a correction term which is itself a Bayes factor.
For moderate sample sizes, the correction term is relatively inconsequential;
however, for large sample sizes the correction term becomes influential and
causes the peri-null Bayes factor to be inconsistent and approach a limit that
depends on the ratio of prior ordinates evaluated at the maximum likelihood
estimate. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the peri-null Bayes factor
and briefly discuss suggestions on how to construct peri-null Bayes factor
hypothesis tests that are also consistent.

rate, but most importantly by the efficient completion of the task in hand,
e.g., controlling remotely a robot, automating a production line or
collaboratively sensing through a drone swarm. In parallel, it is projected
that by 2023, half of the worldwide network connections will be among machines
rather than humans. In this context, it is crucial to establish a new paradigm
for designing communications strategies for multi-agent cyber-physical systems.
This is a daunting task, since it requires a combination of principles from
information, communication, control theories and computer science in order to
formalize a general framework for task-oriented communication design. In this

integration of the Kuramoto model on graphs is studied. For this purpose, the
notion of order parameters is revisited for the classical Kuramoto model
describing all-to-all interactions of a set of oscillators. First numerical
experiments confirm that the precomputation of certain sums significantly
reduces the computational cost for the evaluation of the right-hand side and
hence enables the simulation of high-dimensional systems. In order to design
numerical integration methods that are favourable in the context of related
dynamical systems on network graphs, the concept of localised order parameters
is proposed. In addition, the detection of communities for a complex graph and
the transformation of the underlying adjacency matrix to block structure is an
essential component for further improvement. It is demonstrated that for a
submatrix comprising relatively few coefficients equal to zero, the
precomputation of sums is advantageous, whereas straightforward summation is
appropriate in the complementary case. Concluding theoretical considerations
and numerical comparisons show that the strategy of combining effective
community detection algorithms with the localisation of order parameters
potentially reduces the computation time by several orders of magnitude.

applied to approximate solution maps (e.g., potential-ground state map of
Schr\""odinger equation). In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization
error without spending more time in generating training samples. However, to
reduce the generalization error, the regression network needs to be fit on a
large number of training samples (e.g., a collection of potential-ground state
pairs). The training samples can be produced by running numerical solvers,
which takes much time in many applications. In this paper, we aim to reduce the
generalization error without spending more time in generating training samples.
Inspired by few-shot learning techniques, we develop the Multi-Level
Fine-Tuning algorithm by introducing levels of training: we first train the
regression network on samples generated at the coarsest grid and then
successively fine-tune the network on samples generated at finer grids. Within
the same amount of time, numerical solvers generate more samples on coarse
grids than on fine grids. We demonstrate a significant reduction of
generalization error in numerical experiments on challenging problems with
oscillations, discontinuities, or rough coefficients. Further analysis can be
conducted in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime and we provide practical
estimators to the generalization error. The number of training samples at
different levels can be optimized for the smallest estimated generalization
error under the constraint of budget for training data. The optimized
distribution of budget over levels provides practical guidance with theoretical
insight as in the celebrated Multi-Level Monte Carlo algorithm.

introduced many (weaker) learning models: the PAC model of learning states
(Proceedings of Royal Society A'07), shadow tomography (STOC'18) for learning
""shadows"" of a state, a model that also requires learners to be differentially
private (STOC'19) and the online model of learning states (NeurIPS'18). In
these models it was shown that an unknown state can be learned ""approximately""

these models? In this paper we prove a sequence of (information-theoretic)
implications from differentially-private PAC learning, to communication
complexity, to online learning and then to quantum stability.

Key to our results is our generic quantum online learner, Robust Standard

show information-theoretic implications between DP learning quantum states in
the PAC model, learnability of quantum states in the one-way communication

as wave attenuation or amplification along opposite directions for all pass
bands. The effects of positive and negative proportional feedback, as well as
local and non-local actuation are investigated. Overall, switching the sign of
the feedback effort inverts the amplification direction, while increasing the
degree of non-locality produces splitting of the pass bands into multiple bands

digital precoder at baseband. In this paper, the max-min fair problem is
considered to design a low-complexity hybrid precoder for multi-group
multicasting systems in mmWave channels. The problem is non-trivial due to two
main reasons: the original max-min problem for multi-group multicasting for a
fully-digital precoder is non-convex, and the analog precoder places constant
modules constraint which restricts the feasible set of the precoders in the
design problem. Therefore, we consider a low complexity hybrid precoder design
to tackle and benefit from the mmWave channel structure. Each analog beamformer

computation over computer simulators, they require a selection of inputs along

Thus, it is important to select inputs judiciously for the full computer
simulation to construct an accurate emulator. Space-filling designs are
efficient when the general response surface of the outcome is unknown, and thus
they are a popular choice when selecting simulator inputs for building an
emulator. In this tutorial we discuss how to construct these space filling
designs, perform the subsequent fitting of the Gaussian process surrogates, and
briefly indicate their potential applications to astronomy research.

  Over-parameterized Linear Regression",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A fundamental principle of learning theory is that there is a trade-off
between the complexity of a prediction rule and its ability to generalize.
Modern machine learning models do not obey this paradigm: They produce an
accurate prediction even with a perfect fit to the training set. We investigate
over-parameterized linear regression models focusing on the minimum norm
solution: This is the solution with the minimal norm that attains a perfect fit
to the training set. We utilize the recently proposed predictive normalized
maximum likelihood (pNML) learner which is the min-max regret solution for the
distribution-free setting. We derive an upper bound of this min-max regret
which is associated with the prediction uncertainty. We show that if the test
sample lies mostly in a subspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated with
the large eigenvalues of the empirical correlation matrix of the training data,
the model generalizes despite its over-parameterized nature. We demonstrate the
use of the pNML regret as a point-wise learnability measure on synthetic data
and successfully observe the double-decent phenomenon of the over-parameterized
models on UCI datasets.

processes with uncertainties arising in the operations research, behavioral
sciences, and many other application areas. A large class of the problems from
these domains is characterized by the necessity to deal with several distinct
groups of populations, which are usually labeled as ""active"" and ""passive"".
Motivated by important applications of queueing networks and neuroscience, the
main focus of the present work is on the analysis of reflecting stochastic
dynamics of such mixed populations. We develop a general mathematical modeling
framework to describe the reflecting stochastic dynamics for active-passive
populations. The analysis of this model is carried out via a combination of
low- and high-delity results obtained from the solution of the underlying
coupled system of SDEs and from the simulations with a
statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kinetic Monte
Carlo procedure. We provide details of the queueing theory and neuronal models
and discuss a relationship between reflecting SDEs and a model of queueing
theory via a limit theorem. Furthermore, we present several representative
numerical examples, and discuss an intrinsic interconnection between active and
passive particles in the underlying stochastic process. Finally, possible
extensions of the proposed methodology have been highlighted.

agents seeks to agree on a set of hypotheses that best describes a sequence of

propose a belief update rule where agents share compressed (either sparse or
quantized) beliefs with an arbitrary positive compression rate. Our algorithm
leverages a unified communication rule that enables agents to access
wide-ranging compression operators as black-box modules. We prove the almost
sure asymptotic exponential convergence of beliefs around the set of optimal
hypotheses. Additionally, we show a non-asymptotic, explicit, and linear
concentration rate in probability of the beliefs on the optimal hypothesis set.
We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the communication benefits of
our method. The simulation results show that the number of transmitted bits can

  Imaging",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian framework to infer directed
connections between compartments, and has been used to describe the
interactions between underlying neural populations based on functional
neuroimaging data. DCM is typically analyzed with the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. However, because the inversion of a large-scale continuous
system is difficult when noisy observations are present, DCM by EM is typically
limited to a small number of compartments ($<10$). Another drawback with the
current method is its complexity; when the forward model changes, the posterior
mean changes, and we need to re-derive the algorithm for optimization. In this
project, we propose the Multiple-Shooting Adjoint (MSA) method to address these
limitations. MSA uses the multiple-shooting method for parameter estimation in
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under noisy observations, and is
suitable for large-scale systems such as whole-brain analysis in functional MRI
(fMRI). Furthermore, MSA uses the adjoint method for accurate gradient
estimation in the ODE; since the adjoint method is generic, MSA is a generic
method for both linear and non-linear systems, and does not require
re-derivation of the algorithm as in EM. We validate MSA in extensive
experiments: 1) in toy examples with both linear and non-linear models, we show
that MSA achieves better accuracy in parameter value estimation than EM;
furthermore, MSA can be successfully applied to large systems with up to 100
compartments; and 2) using real fMRI data, we apply MSA to the estimation of
the whole-brain effective connectome and show improved classification of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) vs. control compared to using the functional
connectome. The package is provided

formal concept analysis to such structures we further call confluences. The
primary motivation for investigating these structures is that it allows to
reduce a lattice to a part whose elements are connected, as in some graph,
still preserving a useful characterization of closure operators. Our
investigation also considers how reducing one of the lattice involved in a
Galois connection affects the structure of the closure operators ranges. When
extending this way formal concept analysis we will focus on the intensional
space, i.e. in reducing the pattern language, while recent investigations
rather explored the reduction of the extensional space to connected elements.

then the resulting data-driven models are not only faster than equation-based
models but are easier to train than neural networks such as the long short-term

than the latter. When trained on geophysical observational data, for example,
the weekly averaged global sea-surface temperature, considerable gains are also
observed by the proposed technique in comparison to classical partial
differential equation-based models in terms of forecast computational cost and
accuracy. When trained on publicly available re-analysis data for the daily

over classical baselines such as climatology and persistence-based forecast
