individual is revolutionizing the real time information. The liberty to express
your thoughts without passing through any credibility check is leading to
dissemination of fake content in the ecosystem. It can have disastrous effects
on both individuals and society as a whole. The amplification of fake news is
becoming rampant in India too. Debunked information often gets republished with
a replacement description, claiming it to depict some different incidence. To
curb such fabricated stories, it is necessary to investigate such deduplicates
and false claims made in public. The majority of studies on automatic
fact-checking and fake news detection is restricted to English only. But for a
country like India where only 10% of the literate population speak English,
role of regional languages in spreading falsity cannot be undermined. In this
paper, we introduce FactDRIL: the first large scale multilingual Fact-checking
Dataset for Regional Indian Languages. We collect an exhaustive dataset across
7 months covering 11 low-resource languages. Our propose dataset consists of
9,058 samples belonging to English, 5,155 samples to Hindi and remaining 8,222
samples are distributed across various regional languages, i.e. Bangla,
Marathi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Oriya, Assamese, Punjabi, Urdu, Sinhala and
Burmese. We also present the detailed characterization of three M's
(multi-lingual, multi-media, multi-domain) in the FactDRIL accompanied with the
complete list of other varied attributes making it a unique dataset to study.
Lastly, we present some potential use cases of the dataset. We expect this
dataset will be a valuable resource and serve as a starting point to fight
proliferation of fake news in low resource languages.

the network is large. The DeGroot dynamics, however, is highly non-robust and
the presence of a single `bot' that does not adhere to the updating rule, can

$\varepsilon$-DeGroot dynamics approximates the standard DeGroot dynamics and

It is usually assumed
that the same non-thermal electrons are responsible for the IR-optical-UV
emission (via synchrotron) and the gamma-ray emission (via inverse Compton).
Hence, the light curves in the two bands should be correlated. Orphan gamma-ray
flares (i.e., lacking a luminous low-frequency counterpart) challenge our
theoretical understanding of blazars. By means of large-scale two-dimensional
radiative particle-in-cell simulations, we show that orphan gamma-ray flares
may be a self-consistent by-product of particle energization in turbulent
magnetically-dominated pair plasmas. The energized particles produce the
gamma-ray flare by inverse Compton scattering an external radiation field,
while the synchrotron luminosity is heavily suppressed since the particles are
accelerated nearly along the direction of the local magnetic field. The ratio
of inverse Compton to synchrotron luminosity is sensitive to the initial
strength of turbulent fluctuations (a larger degree of turbulent fluctuations
weakens the anisotropy of the energized particles, thus increasing the
synchrotron luminosity). Our results show that the anisotropy of the
non-thermal particle population is key to modeling the blazar emission.

explained. Complex interaction networks are often coarse-grain models of vast
modular networks, where tightly connected subgraphs are agglomerated into nodes
for simplicity of representation and feasibility of analysis. The emergence of
hierarchy in growing complex networks may stem from one particular property of
these ignored subgraphs: their graph conductance. Being a quantification of the
main bottleneck of flow on the subgraph, all such subgraphs will then have a
specific structural limitation associated with this scalar value. This supports
the consideration of heterogeneous degree restrictions on a randomly growing

\textit{rich-get-richer} scheme. Such node degree restrictions are drawn from
various probability distributions, and it is shown that restriction generally
leads to increased measures of hierarchy, while altering the tail of the degree

to work at the communication bus emulating eventual faults of the communicating
subsystems in the messages exchanged. Using an Arduino board for the FEM and NI
LabView environment it is possible to program the mechanism to inject different

different faults as service and timing faults. The FEM interface with the
tester is designed in LabView environment. Control and observation facilities

centralized learning (CL) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a

federated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning
scheme, in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to
the PS for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge.
Thus, FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and
applicable to the wireless communication scenarios, wherein the data are
generated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in
FL-based training for physical layer design problems. Compared to CL, the
effectiveness of FL is presented in terms of communication overhead with a

nonmonotonic reasoning. It has been playing a major role in AI for decades,
now. Informally, a set of formulas is the support for a given claim if it is
consistent, subset-minimal, and implies the claim. In such a case, the pair of
the support and the claim together is called an argument. In this paper, we
study the propositional variants of the following three computational tasks
studied in argumentation: ARG (exists a support for a given claim with respect
to a given set of formulas), ARG-Check (is a given set a support for a given
claim), and ARG-Rel (similarly as ARG plus requiring an additionally given
formula to be contained in the support). ARG-Check is complete for the
complexity class DP, and the other two problems are known to be complete for
the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (Parson et al., J. Log. Comput.,
2003) and, accordingly, are highly intractable. Analyzing the reason for this
intractability, we perform a two-dimensional classification: first, we consider
all possible propositional fragments of the problem within Schaefer's framework
(STOC 1978), and then study different parameterizations for each of the
fragment. We identify a list of reasonable structural parameters (size of the
claim, support, knowledge-base) that are connected to the aforementioned
decision problems. Eventually, we thoroughly draw a fine border of
parameterized intractability for each of the problems showing where the
problems are fixed-parameter tractable and when this exactly stops.
Surprisingly, several cases are of very high intractability (paraNP and
beyond).

the total concentration of background charged impurities is $N = 10^{19}$

Drude theory fit fails. We argue that this is the metal-insulator transition
(MIT) in spite of the very large Bohr radius of hydrogen-like donor state $a_B
\simeq 700$ nm with which the Mott criterion of MIT for a weakly compensated
semiconductor, $na_B^3 \simeq 0.02$, predicts $10^{5}$ times smaller $n_c$. We
try to explain this discrepancy in the framework of the theory of the
percolation MIT in a strongly compensated semiconductor with the same
$N=10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the second part of this paper, we develop the
percolation MIT theory for films of strongly compensated semiconductors. We
apply this theory to doped STO films with thickness $d \leq 130$ nm and
calculate the critical MIT concentration $n_c(d)$. We find that, for doped STO
films on insulating STO bulk crystals, $n_c(d)$ grows with decreasing $d$.
Remarkably, STO films in a low dielectric constant environment have the same
$n_c(d)$. This happens due to the Rytova-Keldysh modification of a charge
impurity potential which allows a larger number of the film charged impurities
to contribute to the random potential.

for a scalable quantum computing implementation. However, with increasing

Traditional measurement techniques, relying on complete or near-complete
exploration via two-parameter scans (images) of the device response, quickly
become impractical with increasing numbers of gates. Here we propose to
circumvent this challenge by introducing a measurement technique relying on
one-dimensional projections of the device response in the multidimensional
parameter space. Dubbed the ``ray-based classification (RBC) framework,'' we
use this machine learning approach to implement a classifier for QD states,
enabling automated recognition of qubit-relevant parameter regimes. We show
that RBC surpasses the 82 % accuracy benchmark from the experimental
implementation of image-based classification techniques from prior work while
reducing the number of measurement points needed by up to 70 %. The reduction
in measurement cost is a significant gain for time-intensive QD measurements
and is a step forward toward the scalability of these devices. We also discuss
how the RBC-based optimizer, which tunes the device to a multiqubit regime,
performs when tuning in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional parameter
spaces defined by plunger and barrier gates that control the QDs.This work
provides experimental validation of both efficient state identification and
optimization with machine learning techniques for non-traditional measurements

transverse expansion, we use three different numerical methods to analyze the
emergence of attractor solutions in an ideal gas of massless particles
exhibiting constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta / s$. The
fluid energy density is initialized using a Gaussian profile in the transverse
plane, while the ratio $\chi = \mathcal{P}_L / \mathcal{P}_T$ between the
longitudinal and transverse pressures is set at initial time $\tau_0$ to a
constant value $\chi_0$ throughout the system employing the
Romatschke-Strickland distribution. We introduce the hydrodynamization time
$\delta \tau_H = (\tau_H - \tau_0)/ \tau_0$ based on the time $\tau_H$ when the
standard deviation $\sigma(\chi)$ of a family of solutions with different
$\chi_0$ reaches a minimum value at the point of maximum convergence of the
solutions. In the $0+1{\rm D}$ setup, $\delta \tau_H$ exhibits scale
invariance, being a function only of $(\eta / s) / (\tau_0 T_0)$. With
transverse expansion, we find a similar $\delta \tau_H$ computed with respect
to the local initial temperature, $T_0(r)$. We highlight the transition between
the regimes where the longitudinal and transverse expansions dominate. We find
that the hydrodynamization time required for the attractor solution to be
reached increases with the distance from the origin, as expected based on the
properties of the $0+1{\rm D}$ system defined by the local initial conditions.
We argue that hydrodynamization is predominantly the effect of the longitudinal

while collaboratively using multiple clients and a server. Two natural
challenges that FL algorithms face are heterogeneity in data across clients and
collaboration of clients with {\em diverse resources}. In this work, we
introduce a \textit{quantized} and \textit{personalized} FL algorithm QuPeL
that facilitates collective training with heterogeneous clients while
respecting resource diversity. For personalization, we allow clients to learn
\textit{compressed personalized models} with different quantization parameters
depending on their resources. Towards this, first we propose an algorithm for
learning quantized models through a relaxed optimization problem, where
quantization values are also optimized over. When each client participating in
the (federated) learning process has different requirements of the quantized
model (both in value and precision), we formulate a quantized personalization
framework by introducing a penalty term for local client objectives against a
globally trained model to encourage collaboration. We develop an alternating
proximal gradient update for solving this quantized personalization problem,
and we analyze its convergence properties. Numerically, we show that optimizing
over the quantization levels increases the performance and we validate that
QuPeL outperforms both FedAvg and local training of clients in a heterogeneous
setting.

run-and-tumble particle and a target site that switches intermittently between
visible and invisible phases. The two-state dynamics of the target is
independent of the motion of the particle, which can be absorbed by the target
only in its visible phase. We obtain the mean first hitting time when the
motion takes place in a finite domain with reflecting boundaries. Considering
the turning rate of the particle as a tuning parameter, we find that ballistic
motion represents the best strategy to minimize the mean first hitting time.
However, the relative fluctuations of the first hitting time are large and
exhibit non-monotonous behaviours with respect to the turning rate or the
target transition rates. Paradoxically, these fluctuations can be the largest
for targets that are visible most of the time, and not for those that are
mostly invisible or rapidly transiting between the two states. On the infinite
line, the classical asymptotic behaviour $\propto t^{-3/2}$ of the first
hitting time distribution is typically preceded, due to target intermittency,
by an intermediate scaling regime varying as $t^{-1/2}$. The extent of this
transient regime becomes very long when the target is most of the time
invisible, especially at low turning rates. In both finite and infinite
geometries, we draw analogies with partial absorption problems.

are the Nambu-Goldstone boson modes of QCD. Unravelling their partonic
structure and the interplay between emergent and Higgs-boson mass mechanisms is
a common goal of three interdependent approaches -- continuum QCD
phenomenology, lattice-regularised QCD, and the global analysis of parton

Experimentally, the foreseen electron-ion collider will enable a revolution in
our ability to study pion and kaon structure, accessed by scattering from the
""meson cloud"" of the proton through the Sullivan process. With the goal of
enabling a suite of measurements that can address these questions, we examine
key reactions to identify the critical detector system requirements needed to
map tagged pion and kaon cross sections over a wide range of kinematics. The
excellent prospects for extracting pion structure function and form factor data
are shown, and similar prospects for kaon structure are discussed in the

the temperature behavior of scaled shear viscosity $\eta/T^3$ and scaled

the minima of both $\eta/T^3$ and $\sigma_{el}/T$ shifting toward higher

significantly enhanced with a large $\xi$ for the temperature below the

big data applications, especially when they are running on inefficient
human-readable formats, such as JSON or CSV. Parsing, validating, integrity
checking and data structure maintenance are all computationally expensive steps
in loading these formats. Regardless of these costs, many records may be
filtered later during query evaluation due to highly selective predicates --
resulting in wasted computation. Meanwhile, the computing power of client ends

clients on prefiltering to accelerate data loading and enable data skipping for

client cooperation with the server to enable efficient partial loading and data
skipping for a given workload. We proposed an efficient algorithm that would
select a near-optimal predicate set to push down within a given budget.
Moreover, CIAO will address the trade-off between client cost and server
savings by setting different budgets for different clients. We implemented CIAO
and evaluated its performance on three real-world datasets. Our experimental
results show that the system substantially accelerates data loading by up to
21x and query execution by up to 23x and improves end-to-end performance by up

arises in many practical data management tasks. Unfortunately, this method is

Uncertainty Annotated Databases (UA-DBs), which combine an under- and
over-approximation of certain answers. UA-DBs combine the reliability of
certain answers based on incomplete K-relations with the performance of
classical deterministic database systems. However, UA-DBs only support a
limited class of queries and do not support attribute-level uncertainty which
can lead to inaccurate under-approximations of certain answers. In this paper,
we introduce attribute-annotated uncertain databases (AU-DBs) which extend the
UA-DB model with attribute-level annotations that record bounds on the values
of an attribute across all possible worlds. This enables more precise
approximations of incomplete databases. Furthermore, we extend UA-DBs to encode
an compact over-approximation of possible answers which is necessary to support
non-monotone queries including aggregation and set difference. We prove that
query processing over AU-DBs preserves the bounds of certain and possible
answers and investigate algorithms for compacting intermediate results to
retain efficiency. Through an compact encoding of possible answers, our
approach also provides a solid foundation for handling missing data. Using
optimizations that trade accuracy for performance, our approach scales to
complex queries and large datasets, and produces accurate results. Furthermore,
it significantly outperforms alternative methods for uncertain data management.

terms of prediction performance, especially in genomics. Iterative Random
Forests (iRF) use a tree ensemble from iteratively modified RF to obtain
predictive and stable non-linear or Boolean interactions of features. They have
shown great promise for Boolean biological interaction discovery that is
central to advancing functional genomics and precision medicine. However,
theoretical studies into how tree-based methods discover Boolean feature
interactions are missing. Inspired by the thresholding behavior in many
biological processes, we first introduce a novel discontinuous nonlinear
regression model, called the Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model. Specifically,
the LSS model assumes that the regression function is a linear combination of
piecewise constant Boolean interaction terms. Given an RF tree ensemble, we
define a quantity called Depth-Weighted Prevalence (DWP) for a set of signed
features S. Intuitively speaking, DWP(S) measures how frequently features in S
appear together in an RF tree ensemble. We prove that, with high probability,
DWP(S) attains a universal upper bound that does not involve any model
coefficients, if and only if S corresponds to a union of Boolean interactions
under the LSS model. Consequentially, we show that a theoretically tractable
version of the iRF procedure, called LSSFind, yields consistent interaction
discovery under the LSS model as the sample size goes to infinity. Finally,
simulation results show that LSSFind recovers the interactions under the LSS

translates to designing linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize
the system throughput and manage QoS constraints. In this paper, we argue that
this basic design task in 5G and beyond systems must be extended such that
beamforming design and user scheduling are managed jointly. Specifically, we
propose a fully decentralized joint beamforming design and user scheduling
algorithm that manages QoS. A novel feature of this scheme is its ability to
reduce the initial rate requirements in case of infeasibility. By means of

test that typically requires prolonged data collection and is only revealed in
an in-depth analysis. These features are often particularly exposed in hybrid
systems, such as interfaces between light and atomic ensembles. Certification
of entanglement from images acquired with single-photon camera can mitigate
this issue by exploiting multiplexed photon generation. Here we demonstrate
this feature in a quantum memory (QM) operating in a real-time feedback mode.
Through spatially-multimode spin-wave storage the QM enables operation of the
real-time ghost imaging (GI) protocol. By properly preparing the spatial phase
of light emitted by the atoms we enable observation of Bell-type nonlocality
from a single image acquired in the far field as witnessed by the Bell
parameter of $S=2.227\pm0.007>2$. Our results are an important step towards
fast and efficient utilization of multimode quantum memories both in protocols
and in fundamental tests.

optimizing the resource allocation to control an epidemic outbreak under
disease growth uncertainty. In this study, we address this core limitation by
presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which
integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control
an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program
involves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of
treatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of
new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection
and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment
funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage
value of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of
the proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart.
We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and
fair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of
infections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or
prevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating
treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing
such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of
infections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay
for the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic epidemic-logistics model is
practical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases in
meta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.

placing the theory on $S^1\times H^{d-1}$, where $H^{d-1}$ is the hyperbolic
space, and imposing on the fundamental fields a twisted periodicity condition
along $S^1$. In this description, the codimension two defect lies at the
boundary of $H^{d-1}$. We first study the general monodromy defect in the free
field theory, and then develop the large $N$ expansion of the defect in the
interacting theory, focusing for simplicity on the case of $N$ complex fields
with a one-parameter monodromy condition. We also use the $\epsilon$-expansion
in $d=4-\epsilon$, providing a check on the large $N$ approach. When the defect
has spherical geometry, its expectation value is a meaningful quantity, and it
may be obtained by computing the free energy of the twisted theory on
$S^1\times H^{d-1}$. It was conjectured that the logarithm of the defect
expectation value, suitably multiplied by a dimension dependent sine factor,

flow that corresponds to imposing alternate boundary conditions on one of the

CP problem may have masses $m_a$ in the extended range $10^{-3}eV > m_a >
10^{-33} eV$. Ultralight axions provide so many degrees of freedom that their
entropy can exceed that of primordial black holes. This suggests that
ultralight axions are more suited than primordial black holes to be
constituents of dark matter.

notion of partiality is however notoriously difficult to characterize in this
way, although the importance of it is certain, especially for computer science
where entire research areas, such as synthetic and axiomatic domain theory
revolve around notions of partiality. More recently, this issue resurfaced in
the context of (constructive) intensional type theory. Here, we provide a
generic categorical iteration-based notion of partiality, which is arguably the
most basic one. We show that the emerging free structures, which we dub
uniform-iteration algebras enjoy various desirable properties, in particular,
yield an equational lifting monad. We then study the impact of classicality

suitable categorial formulation of the axiom of countable choice entailing that
the monad is an Elgot monad.

expressed in terms of the Bloch vectors -- the vectors in the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}-1}$ arising under decompositions of observables and states
in different operator bases. Within this formalism, we specify for all $d\geq2$
the set of Bloch vectors of traceless qudit observables and describe its
properties; also, find for the sets of the Bloch vectors of qudit states, pure
and mixed, the new compact expressions in terms of the operator norms that
explicitly reveal the general properties of these sets and have the unified
form for all $d\geq2$. For the sets of the Bloch vectors of qudit states under
the generalized Gell-Mann representation, these general properties cannot be
analytically extracted from the known equivalent specifications of these sets
via the system of algebraic equations. We derive the general equations
describing the time evolution of the Bloch vector of a qudit state if a qudit
system is isolated and if it is open and find for both cases the main
properties of the Bloch vector evolution in time. For a pure bipartite state of
a dimension $d_{1}\times d_{2}$, we quantify its entanglement in terms of the
Bloch vectors for its reduced states. The introduced general formalism is
important both for the theoretical analysis of quantum system properties and
for quantum applications, in particular, for optimal quantum control, since,
for systems where states are described by vectors in the Euclidean space, the
methods of optimal control, analytical and numerical, are well developed.

a natural way. Given a sequence as an instance of the parallelized problem,
another sequence is a solution of this problem if every component is
instance-wise a solution of the original problem. In the Weihrauch lattice
parallelization is a closure operator. Here we introduce a dual operation that
we call stashing and that also lifts problems to sequences, but such that only
some component has to be an instance-wise solution. In this case the solution
is stashed away in the sequence. This operation, if properly defined, induces
an interior operator in the Weihrauch lattice. We also study the action of the
monoid induced by stashing and parallelization on the Weihrauch lattice, and we
prove that it leads to at most five distinct degrees, which (in the maximal
case) are always organized in pentagons. We also introduce another closely
related interior operator in the Weihrauch lattice that replaces solutions of
problems by upper Turing cones that are strong enough to compute solutions. It
turns out that on parallelizable degrees this interior operator corresponds to
stashing. This implies that, somewhat surprisingly, all problems which are
simultaneously parallelizable and stashable have computability-theoretic
characterizations. Finally, we apply all these results in order to study the
recently introduced discontinuity problem, which appears as the bottom of a
number of natural stashing-parallelization pentagons. The discontinuity problem
is not only the stashing of several variants of the lesser limited principle of
omniscience, but it also parallelizes to the non-computability problem. This
supports the slogan that ""non-computability is the parallelization of
discontinuity"".

previous investigations of this effect with a two fluid model that captures the
balance of diffusive and thermal equilibration processes within the island. We
show that the effective power, and resulting strength of the condensation
effect, can be greatly enhanced by avoiding collisional heat loss to the ions.
The relative impact of collisions on the overall power balance within the
island depends on the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time scale and the
electron-ion equilibration time, rather than the latter alone. Although
relative heat loss to ions increases with island size, the heating efficiency
does as well. In particular, we show that the latter safely dominates for large
deposition profiles, as is typically the case for LHCD. This supports the
possibility of passive stabilization of NTMs, without the precise aiming of the
rf waves required for ECCD stabilization.

fundamental limits on the accuracy of such covariant codes for approximate

capability of random covariant codes. In particular, we show that
$U(1)$-covariant codes generated by Haar random $U(1)$-symmetric unitaries,
i.e. unitaries that commute with the charge operator (or conserve the charge),
typically saturate the fundamental limits to leading order in terms of both the
average- and worst-case purified distances against erasure noise. We note that
the results hold for symmetric variants of unitary 2-designs, and comment on
the convergence problem of charge-conserving random circuits. Our results not

the regime where the dispersive optomechanical coupling in the system vanishes.
Such a regime is found to be possible if the membrane is less reflecting than
the adjacent mirror, yielding a potentially very strong dissipative
optomechanical coupling. Specifically, if the absolute values of amplitude
transmission coefficients of the membrane and the mirror, $t$ and $t_m$
respectively, obey the condition $ t_m^2< t\ll t_m\ll 1$, the dissipative

dissipative interaction. It is shown that under the above condition, the system

transferring quantum information using classical communication and preshared
entanglement. We develop a new teleportation protocol based upon the idea of
using ancillary entanglement catalytically, i.e. without depleting it. This
protocol is then used to show that catalytic entanglement allows for a
noiseless quantum channel to be simulated with a quality that could never be
achieved using only entanglement from the shared state, even for catalysts with
a small dimension. On the one hand, this allows for a more faithful
transmission of quantum information using generic states and a fixed amount of
consumed entanglement. On the other hand, this shows, for the first time, that
entanglement catalysis provides a genuine advantage in a generic
quantum-information processing task. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be
directly applied to study quantum catalysis for more general problems in
quantum mechanics. As an application, we show that catalysts can activate
so-called passive states, a concept that finds widespread application e.g. in
quantum thermodynamics.

production processes. Currently, several machine learning and deep
learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and
diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of
such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations
and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the
unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised
models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis
in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three
parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first
part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted.
Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an
unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of
the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in
fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret
black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by
the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for
diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause
analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets
containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also
presents a comparison between models used in machine learning explainability:
SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest (Local-
DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several state-of-art anomaly detection
algorithms in rotating machinery is included.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where each predicate has a strong and a
weak form and given a CSP instance, the objective is to distinguish if the
strong form can be satisfied vs. even the weak form cannot be satisfied. Since
their formal introduction by Austrin, Guruswami, and H\aa stad, there has been
a flurry of works on PCSPs [BBKO19,KO19,WZ20]. The key tool in studying PCSPs
is the algebraic framework developed in the context of CSPs where the closure
properties of the satisfying solutions known as the polymorphisms are analyzed.
  The polymorphisms of PCSPs are much richer than CSPs. In the Boolean case, we
still do not know if dichotomy for PCSPs exists analogous to Schaefer's
dichotomy result for CSPs. In this paper, we study a special case of Boolean
PCSPs, namely Boolean Ordered PCSPs where the Boolean PCSPs have the predicate
$x \leq y$. In the algebraic framework, this is the special case of Boolean
PCSPs when the polymorphisms are monotone functions. We prove that Boolean
Ordered PCSPs exhibit a computational dichotomy assuming the Rich 2-to-1
Conjecture [BKM21] which is a perfect completeness surrogate of the Unique
Games Conjecture.
  Assuming the Rich 2-to-1 Conjecture, we prove that a Boolean Ordered PCSP can
be solved in polynomial time if for every $\epsilon>0$, it has polymorphisms
where each coordinate has Shapley value at most $\epsilon$, else it is NP-hard.
The algorithmic part of our dichotomy is based on a structural lemma that
Boolean monotone functions with each coordinate having low Shapley value have
arbitrarily large threshold functions as minors. The hardness part proceeds by
showing that the Shapley value is consistent under a uniformly random 2-to-1
minor. Of independent interest, we show that the Shapley value can be
inconsistent under an adversarial 2-to-1 minor.

generalizing a model to categories unseen during training by leveraging class
attributes, but challenges still remain. Recently, methods using generative
models to combat bias towards classes seen during training have pushed the
state of the art of ZSL, but these generative models can be slow or
computationally expensive to train. Additionally, while many previous ZSL
methods assume a one-time adaptation to unseen classes, in reality, the world
is always changing, necessitating a constant adjustment for deployed models.
Models unprepared to handle a sequential stream of data are likely to
experience catastrophic forgetting. We propose a meta-continual zero-shot

pairing self-gating of attributes and scaled class normalization with
meta-learning based training, we are able to outperform state-of-the-art
results while being able to train our models substantially faster

by performing experiments on five standard ZSL datasets (CUB, aPY, AWA1, AWA2

dynamical template for making non-flat thin films through self-assembling
processes. We employ large-scale finite element simulations of a bilayer
neo-Hookean solid (e.g., a film bonded on a substrate) to explore mechanical
principles that govern the formation of hexagonal wrinkling patterns and
strategies for making nearly perfect hexagonal patterns. In our model, the
wrinkling instabilities are driven by the confined film expansion. Our results
indicate robust hexagonal patterns exist at a relatively small modulus mismatch
(on the order of 10) between the film and substrate. Besides, the film
expansion should not exceed the onset of wrinkling value too much to avoid
post-buckling patterns. By harnessing the imperfection insensitivity of
one-dimension sinusoidal wrinkles, we apply a sequential loading to the bilayer
structure to produce the nearly perfect hexagonal patterns. Lastly, we discuss
the connection between the simple bilayer model and the gradient structures

prototypical titanium-based ( e.g. $Ti_3C_2O_2$) MXene electrodes. We attribute
this high pseudocapacitance to the Faradaic voltage windows of group-VI MXene
electrodes, which are predicted to be 1.2 to 1.8 times larger than those of
titanium-based MXenes. The size of the pseudocapacitive voltage window
increases with the range of oxidation states that is accessible to the MXene
transition metals. By similar mechanisms, the presence of multiple ions in the
solvent (Li$^+$ and H$^+$) leads to sharp changes in the transition-metal
oxidation states and can significantly increase the charge capacity of MXene

fine-grained analysis of the (parameterized) computational complexity of Fair
Connected Districting. In particular, we prove that it is polynomial-time
solvable on paths, cycles, stars, and caterpillars, but already becomes NP-hard

complexity analysis with respect to various graph parameters, including
treewidth, and problem-specific parameters, including, the numbers of colors

  Maps",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  3D microscopy is key in the investigation of diverse biological systems, and
the ever increasing availability of large datasets demands automatic cell
identification methods that not only are accurate, but also can imply the
uncertainty in their predictions to inform about potential errors and hence
confidence in conclusions using them. While conventional deep learning methods
often yield deterministic results, advances in deep Bayesian learning allow for
accurate predictions with a probabilistic interpretation in numerous image
classification and segmentation tasks. It is however nontrivial to extend such
Bayesian methods to cell detection, which requires specialized learning
frameworks. In particular, regression of density maps is a popular successful
approach for extracting cell coordinates from local peaks in a postprocessing
step, which hinders any meaningful probabilistic output. We herein propose a
deep learning-based cell detection framework that can operate on large
microscopy images and outputs desired probabilistic predictions by (i)
integrating Bayesian techniques for the regression of uncertainty-aware density
maps, where peak detection can be applied to generate cell proposals, and (ii)
learning a mapping from the numerous proposals to a probabilistic space that is
calibrated, i.e. accurately represents the chances of a successful prediction.
Utilizing such calibrated predictions, we propose a probabilistic spatial
analysis with Monte-Carlo sampling. We demonstrate this in revising an existing
description of the distribution of a mesenchymal stromal cell type within the
bone marrow, where our proposed methods allow us to reveal spatial patterns
that are otherwise undetectable. Introducing such probabilistic analysis in
quantitative microscopy pipelines will allow for reporting confidence intervals
for testing biological hypotheses of spatial distributions.

challenging task, because a desirable iteration update often involves an
expectation over an on-policy distribution. Prior off-policy actor-critic (AC)
algorithms have introduced a new critic that uses the density ratio for
adjusting the distribution mismatch in order to stabilize the convergence, but
at the cost of potentially introducing high biases due to the estimation errors
of both the density ratio and value function. In this paper, we develop a
doubly robust off-policy AC (DR-Off-PAC) for discounted MDP, which can take
advantage of learned nuisance functions to reduce estimation errors. Moreover,
DR-Off-PAC adopts a single timescale structure, in which both actor and critics
are updated simultaneously with constant stepsize, and is thus more sample
efficient than prior algorithms that adopt either two timescale or nested-loop
structure. We study the finite-time convergence rate and characterize the
sample complexity for DR-Off-PAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate optimal
policy. We also show that the overall convergence of DR-Off-PAC is doubly
robust to the approximation errors that depend only on the expressive power of
approximation functions. To the best of our knowledge, our study establishes
the first overall sample complexity analysis for a single time-scale off-policy
AC algorithm.

CRSI by IN damping is important in setting the amplitude of Alfv\'en waves that
scatter cosmic rays and control galactic-scale transport. Our study employs the
MHD-PIC hybrid fluid-kinetic numerical technique to follow linear growth as
well as post-linear and saturation phases. During the linear phase of the
instability -- where simulations and analytical theory are in good agreement --
IN damping prevents wave growth at small and large wavelengths, with the
unstable bandwidth lower for higher ion-neutral collision rate $\nu_{\rm in}$.
Purely MHD effects during the post-linear phase extend the wave spectrum
towards larger $k$. In the saturated state, the cosmic ray distribution evolves
toward greater isotropy (lower streaming velocity) by scattering off of Alv\'en
waves excited by the instability. In the absence of low-$k$ waves, CRs with
sufficiently high momentum are not isotropized. The maximum wave amplitude and
rate of isotropization of the distribution function decreases at higher
$\nu_{\rm in}$. When the IN damping rate approaches the maximum growth rate of
CSRI, wave growth and isotropization is suppressed. Implications of our results

solutions to the scalar wave equation on subextremal Kerr backgrounds,

significantly from the non-rotating Schwarzschild setting (""Price's law""). The
main differences with Schwarzschild are slower decay rates for higher angular
frequencies and oscillations along the null generators of the event horizon. We
introduce a physical space-based method that resolves the following two main
difficulties for establishing $\ell$-dependent asymptotics in the Kerr setting:
1) the coupling of angular modes and 2) a loss of ellipticity in the
ergoregion. Our mechanism identifies and exploits the existence of conserved
charges along null infinity via a time invertibility theory, which in turn
relies on new elliptic estimates in the full black hole exterior. This
framework is suitable for resolving the conflicting numerology in Kerr
late-time asymptotics that appears in the numerics literature.

with current models for its CSM, and that observations at a later time would
have been useful for this event. Secondly, we statistically analyze an ensemble

machine learning. We define its quantum generalization, the quantum cross

fidelity. In the classical case, minimizing cross entropy is equivalent to
maximizing likelihood. In the quantum case, when the quantum cross entropy is
constructed from quantum data undisturbed by quantum measurements, this
relation holds. Classical cross entropy is equal to negative log-likelihood.
When we obtain quantum cross entropy through empirical density matrix based on

presence of a mobility edge separating single-particle delocalized states from
localized and multifractal states in the Floquet spectrum. Such a mobility edge
does not have any counterpart in the static Aubry-Andr\'{e} model and exists
for a range of drive frequencies near the critical frequency at which the

distinct imprint on fermion transport in the driven chain; it also influences
the Shannon entropy and the survival probability of the fermions at long times.
In addition, we find the presence of CAT states in the Floquet spectrum with
weights centered around a few nearby sites of the chain. This is shown to be
tied to the flattening of Floquet bands over a range of quasienergies. We
support our numerical studies with a semi-analytic expression for the Floquet
Hamiltonian ($H_F$) computed within a Floquet perturbation theory. The
eigenspectra of the perturbative $H_F$ so obtained exhibit qualitatively
identical properties to the exact eigenstates of $H_F$ obtained numerically.

central dark matter density that is lower than expected in the Standard
$\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. In this work, we present
dynamical observations for 77 member stars in this system, more than doubling
previous studies to determine whether this galaxy is truly a low density
outlier. We measure a systemic velocity of $v_r=-363.4\pm1.0\,{\rm kms}^{-1}$
and a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=6.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9}\,{\rm kms}^{-1}$,
consistent with previous work and within $1\sigma$ of predictions made within
the modified Newtonian dynamics framework. We also measure the metallicity of
our member stars from their spectra, finding a mean value of ${\rm
[Fe/H]}=-1.7\pm0.1$~dex. We model the dark matter density profile of And~XXI
using an improved version of \GravSphere, finding a central density of
$\rho_{\rm DM}({\rm 150 pc})=2.7_{-1.7}^{+2.7} \times 10^7 \,{\rm

of $\rho_{\rm DM}({\rm 1.75 kpc})=0.9_{-0.2}^{+0.3} \times 10^5 \,{\rm

lower than the densities expected from abundance matching in $\Lambda$CDM. We
show that this cannot be explained by `dark matter heating' since And~XXI had
too little star formation to significantly lower its inner dark matter density,
while dark matter heating only acts on the profile inside the half light
radius. However, And~XXI's low density can be accommodated within $\Lambda$CDM
if it experienced extreme tidal stripping (losing $>95\%$ of its mass), or if
it inhabits a low concentration halo on a plunging orbit that experienced
repeated tidal shocks.

algorithms using a set of hand-crafted features. Recently, researchers have
leveraged deep learning models in information retrieval. These models are
trained end-to-end to extract features from the raw data for ranking tasks, so
that they overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. A variety of deep
learning models have been proposed, and each model presents a set of neural
network components to extract features that are used for ranking. In this
paper, we compare the proposed models in the literature along different
dimensions in order to understand the major contributions and limitations of
each model. In our discussion of the literature, we analyze the promising
neural components, and propose future research directions. We also show the
analogy between document retrieval and other retrieval tasks where the items to
be ranked are structured documents, answers, images and videos.

results are intended to generalize is a critical decision. Randomized and
observational studies each have strengths and limitations for estimating causal
effects in a target population. Estimates from randomized data may have
internal validity but are often not representative of the target population.
Observational data may better reflect the target population, and hence be more
likely to have external validity, but are subject to potential bias due to
unmeasured confounding. While much of the causal inference literature has
focused on addressing internal validity bias, both internal and external
validity are necessary for unbiased estimates in a target population. This
paper presents a framework for addressing external validity bias, including a
synthesis of approaches for generalizability and transportability, the
assumptions they require, as well as tests for the heterogeneity of treatment
effects and differences between study and target populations.

building block of autonomous driving, multi-agent interaction modeling. We
propose Grounded Relational Inference (GRI). It models an interactive system's
underlying dynamics by inferring an interaction graph representing the agents'

the relational latent space into semantic interactive behaviors defined with
expert domain knowledge. We demonstrate that it can model interactive traffic
scenarios under both simulation and real-world settings, and generate semantic

flows in aerodynamics. For these models to work efficiently, it is best to
avoid Biot-Savart interactions. This work presents a grid-based treatment of
potential flows in two dimensions and its use in a vortex model for simulating
unsteady aerodynamic flows. For flows consisting of vortex elements, the
treatment follows the vortex-in-cell approach and solves the
streamfunction-vorticity Poisson equation on a Cartesian grid after
transferring the circulation from the vortices onto the grid. For sources and
sinks, an analogous approach can be followed using the scalar potential. The
combined velocity field due to vortices, sinks, and sources can then be
obtained using the Helmholtz decomposition. In this work, we use several key
tools that ensure the approach works on arbitrary geometries, with and without
sharp edges. Firstly, the immersed boundary projection method is used to
account for bodies in the flow and the resulting body-forcing Lagrange
multiplier is identified as the bound vortex sheet strength. Secondly, sharp
edges are treated by decomposing the vortex sheet strength into a singular and
smooth part. To enforce the Kutta condition, the smooth part can then be
constrained to remove the singularity introduced by the sharp edge. These
constraints and the Poisson equation are formulated as a saddle-point system
and solved using the Schur complement method. The lattice Green's function is
used to efficiently solve the discrete Poisson equation with unbounded boundary
conditions. The method and its accuracy are demonstrated for several problems.

solution is computationally intractable and we seek algorithms that perform
well in practice. Since computational intractability often results from
pathological instances, we look for methods to benchmark the performance of
algorithms against optimal solutions on real-world instances. The main
challenge is that an optimal solution cannot be efficiently computed for
intractable problems, and we therefore often do not know how far a solution is
from being optimal. A major question is therefore how to measure the
performance of an algorithm in comparison to an optimal solution on instances
we encounter in practice.
  In this paper, we address this question in the context of submodular
optimization problems. For the canonical problem of submodular maximization
under a cardinality constraint, it is intractable to compute a solution that is
better than a $1-1/e \approx 0.63$ fraction of the optimum. Algorithms like the
celebrated greedy algorithm are guaranteed to achieve this $1-1/e$ bound on any
instance and are used in practice.
  Our main contribution is not a new algorithm for submodular maximization but
an analytical method that measures how close an algorithm for submodular
maximization is to optimal on a given problem instance. We use this method to
show that on a wide variety of real-world datasets and objectives, the
approximation of the solution found by greedy goes well beyond $1-1/e$ and is
often at least 0.95. We develop this method using a novel technique that lower
bounds the objective of a dual minimization problem to obtain an upper bound on
the value of an optimal solution to the primal maximization problem.

replay, a novel policy gradient learning rule is derived that associates place
cell activity with responses in cells representing actions. This new model is
evaluated using a simulated robot spatial navigation task inspired by the

from reinforcement, whilst improving stability and robustness over multiple

absence. We conclude that reverse replay may enhance reinforcement learning in

hole accreting matter at low or medium rates. At such rates, the accretion flow
usually consists of a cold optically thick disk, plus a hot, low density,
collisionless corona. In the latter component, charged particles can be
accelerated to high energies by various mechanisms. Aims. We aim to
investigate, in detail, nonthermal processes in hot accretion flows onto
supermassive black holes, covering a wide range of accretion rates and
luminosities. Methods. We developed a model consisting of a thin
Shakura-Sunyaev disk plus an inner hot accretion flow or corona, modeled as a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow, where nonthermal processes take place.
We solved the transport equations for relativistic particles and estimated the
spectral energy distributions resulting from nonthermal interactions between
the various particle species and the fields in the source. Results. We covered
a variety of scenarios, from low accretion rates up to 10% of the Eddington
limit, and identified the relevant cooling mechanisms in each case. The
presence of hadrons in the hot flow is decisive for the spectral shape, giving
rise to secondary particles and gamma-ray cascades. We applied our model to the

to detect and explain the presence of this chasm effect. We analyze the
interactions among a few well-observed network-growing mechanisms with a simple
model to reveal the sufficient and necessary conditions for both phases in the
chasm effect to occur. By generalizing the simple model naturally, we present a
complete bi-affiliation bipartite network-growth model that could successfully
capture disparities at all social levels and reproduce real social networks.
Finally, we illustrate that addressing the chasm effect can create fairer
systems with two applications in advertisement and fact-checks, thereby
demonstrating the potential impact of the chasm effect on the future research
of minority-majority disparities and fair algorithms.

algorithms in the machine learning literature. We demonstrate that SVM can be
used to balance covariates and estimate average causal effects under the

kernel-based weighting procedure that minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy
between the treatment and control groups while simultaneously maximizing
effective sample size. We also show that SVM is a continuous relaxation of the
quadratic integer program for computing the largest balanced subset,
establishing its direct relation to the cardinality matching method. Another
important feature of SVM is that the regularization parameter controls the
trade-off between covariate balance and effective sample size. As a result, the
existing SVM path algorithm can be used to compute the balance-sample size
frontier. We characterize the bias of causal effect estimation arising from
this trade-off, connecting the proposed SVM procedure to the existing kernel
balancing methods. Finally, we conduct simulation and empirical studies to
evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology and find that SVM is
competitive with the state-of-the-art covariate balancing methods.

PS2 is applied to a comparison among three competing public policies aimed at
reducing inequality and alleviating poverty: (a) house acquisition by the
government and distribution to lower income households, (b) rental vouchers,
and (c) monetary aid. Within the model context, the monetary aid, that is,
smaller amounts of help for a larger number of households, makes the economy
perform better in terms of production, consumption, reduction of inequality,

the passage of the cascade of particles. These attempts have led to the
detection of a handful of signals only, all of them forward-directed along the
shower axis and hence suggestive of originating from geomagnetic and Askaryan
emissions extending into GHz frequencies close to the Cherenkov angle. In this
paper, the lack of detection of events is explained by the coherent suppression
of the MBR in frequency ranges below the collision rate due to the destructive
interferences impacting the emission amplitude of photons between the
successive collisions of the electrons. The spectral intensity at the ground
level is shown to be several orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of
experimental setups. In particular, the spectral intensity at 10~km from the
shower core for a vertical shower induced by a proton of $10^{17.5}$ eV is
7-to-8 orders of magnitude below the reference value anticipated from a scaling
law converting a laboratory measurement to EAS expectations. Consequently, the

sensitivities of ~$10^{27}$ yr, requiring suppressing backgrounds to <1
count/tonne/yr. For this, any extra background rejection handle, beyond
excellent energy resolution and the use of extremely radiopure materials, is of
utmost importance. The NEXT experiment exploits differences in the spatial
ionization patterns of double beta decay and single-electron events to
discriminate signal from background. While the former display two Bragg peak
dense ionization regions at the opposite ends of the track, the latter
typically have only one such feature. Thus, comparing the energies at the track
extremes provides an additional rejection tool. The unique combination of the
topology-based background discrimination and excellent energy resolution (1%
FWHM at the Q-value of the decay) is the distinguishing feature of NEXT.
Previous studies demonstrated a topological background rejection factor of ~5
when reconstructing electron-positron pairs in the $^{208}$Tl 1.6 MeV double
escape peak (with Compton events as background), recorded in the NEXT-White
demonstrator at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc, with 72% signal
efficiency. This was recently improved through the use of a deep convolutional
neural network to yield a background rejection factor of ~10 with 65% signal
efficiency. Here, we present a new reconstruction method, based on the
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm, which allows reversing the blurring
induced by electron diffusion and electroluminescence light production in the
NEXT TPC. The new method yields highly refined 3D images of reconstructed
events, and, as a result, significantly improves the topological background
discrimination. When applied to real-data 1.6 MeV $e^-e^+$ pairs, it leads to a
background rejection factor of 27 at 57% signal efficiency.

identical to the Shapley value. However, for certain natural policies, such as
those that select individuals with a specific set of attributes (e.g. high

Specifically, our findings show that adversarially trained models that are
robust to input perturbations are still (or even more) vulnerable to weight
perturbations when compared to standard models. In this paper, we formalize the
notion of non-singular adversarial robustness for neural networks through the
lens of joint perturbations to data inputs as well as model weights. To our
best knowledge, this study is the first work considering simultaneous
input-weight adversarial perturbations. Based on a multi-layer feed-forward
neural network model with ReLU activation functions and standard classification
loss, we establish error analysis for quantifying the loss sensitivity subject
to $\ell_\infty$-norm bounded perturbations on data inputs and model weights.
Based on the error analysis, we propose novel regularization functions for
robust training and demonstrate improved non-singular robustness against joint

luminosity tails of the two LFs converge, indicating that the most
infrared-luminous galaxies are AGN-powered. Our results shed light to the
decades-old conundrum regarding the flatter high-luminosity slope seen in the
IR galaxy LF compared to that in the UV and optical. We attribute this
difference to the increasing fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies with increasing
total infrared luminosity (L_IR). We partition the L_IR-z parameter space into
a star-formation and an AGN-dominated region, finding that the most luminous
galaxies at all epochs lie in the AGN-dominated region. This sets a potential
`limit' to attainable star formation rates, casting doubt on the abundance of
`extreme starbursts': if AGN did not exist, L_IR>10^13 Lsun galaxies would be
significantly rarer than they currently are in our observable Universe. We also
find that AGN affect the average dust temperatures (T_dust) of galaxies and
hence the shape of the well-known L_IR-T_dust relation. We propose that the
reason why local ULIRGs are hotter than their high redshift counterparts is
because of a higher fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies amongst the former

  Until now, no well-formed theoretical argument has been presented to explain
this deficiency. In this paper, we will argue that convolutional layers are of
little use for such problems, since comparison tasks are global by nature, but
convolutional layers are local by design. We will use this insight to
reformulate a comparison task into a sorting task and use findings on sorting
networks to propose a lower bound for the number of parameters a neural network
needs to solve comparison tasks in a generalizable way. We will use this lower

sudden emergence of coupled activity across the brain. The resulting functional
networks - in which edges indicate strong enough coupling between brain regions
- are consistent with the notion of percolation, which is a phenomenon in
complex networks corresponding to the sudden emergence of a giant connected
component. Traditionally, work has concentrated on noise-free percolation with
a monotonic process of network growth, but real-world networks are more
complex. We develop a class of random graph hidden Markov models (RG-HMMs) for
characterizing percolation regimes in noisy, dynamically evolving networks in
the presence of edge birth and edge death, as well as noise. This class is used
to understand the type of phase transitions undergone in a seizure, and in
particular, distinguishing between different percolation regimes in epileptic
seizures. We develop a hypothesis testing framework for inferring putative
percolation mechanisms. As a necessary precursor, we present an EM algorithm
for estimating parameters from a sequence of noisy networks only observed at a
longitudinal subsampling of time points. Our results suggest that different
types of percolation can occur in human seizures. The type inferred may suggest
tailored treatment strategies and provide new insights into the fundamental
science of epilepsy.

solutions to compensate for unreliable or incomplete observations. In this

data as a compact yet lossless representation, a cylindrical depth map.
However, despite the smoothness of real-world objects, many points on the depth
map are dropped out through the laser measurement, which causes learning
difficulty on generative models. To circumvent this issue, we introduce
measurement uncertainty into the generation process, which allows the model to
learn a disentangled representation of the underlying shape and the dropout
noises from a collection of real LiDAR data. To simulate the lossy measurement,
we adopt a differentiable sampling framework to drop points based on the
learned uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on

potential applications by restoring LiDAR data with various types of

15 GHz and 25 GHz in a compact range anechoic chamber. The measurement results
show that the average RCS of the UAVs depends on shape, size, material
composition of the target UAV as well as the azimuth angle, frequency, and
polarization of the illuminating radar. Afterward, radar characterization of
the target UAVs is achieved by fitting the RCS measurement data to 11 different
statistical models. From the model selection analysis, we observe that the
lognormal, generalized extreme value, and gamma distributions are most suitable
for modeling the RCS of the commercial UAVs while the Gaussian distribution
performed relatively poorly. The best UAV radar statistics forms the class
conditional probability densities for the proposed UAV statistical recognition
system. The performance of the UAV statistical recognition system is evaluated
at different signal noise ratio (SNR) with the aid of Monte Carlo analysis. At
an SNR of 10 dB, the average classification accuracy of 97.43% or better is

dealt with special or limiting cases, such as considering only cells with an
infinite line of descent, assuming deterministic tumor growth, or taking
large-time or large-population limits. In this work, we derive exact
expressions for the expected SFS of a cell population that evolves according to
a stochastic branching process, first for cells with an infinite line of
descent and then for the total population, evaluated either at a fixed time
(fixed-time spectrum) or at the stochastic time at which the population reaches
a certain size (fixed-size spectrum). We find that while the rate of mutation
scales the SFS of the total population linearly, the rates of cell birth and
cell death change the shape of the spectrum at the small-frequency end,
inducing a transition between a $1/j^2$ power-law spectrum and a $1/j$ spectrum
as cell viability decreases. We show that this insight can in principle be used
to estimate the ratio between the rate of cell death and cell birth, as well as
the mutation rate, using the site frequency spectrum alone. Although the
discussion is framed in terms of tumor dynamics, our results apply to any

polarized drivers. We find that in many cases the emitted harmonics do not
originate in electron-hole pairs created at the minimum band gap, where the
tunneling probability is maximized, but rather in pairs created across an
extended region of the Brillouin zone (BZ). In these situations, the analogy to
gas-phase HHG in terms of the short- and long-trajectory categorizations is
inadequate. Our analysis methodology comprises three complementary levels of
theory: the numerical solutions to the semiconductor Bloch equations, an
extended semiclassical recollision model, and a quantum wave packet approach.
We apply this methodology to two general material types with representative
band structures: a bulk system and a hexagonal monolayer system. In the bulk,
the interband harmonics generated using elliptically-polarized drivers are
found to originate not from tunneling at the minimum band gap $\Gamma$, but
from regions away from it. In the monolayer system driven by linearly-polarized
pulses, tunneling regions near different symmetry points in the BZ lead to
distinct harmonic energies and emission profiles. We show that the imperfect
recollisions, where an electron-hole pair recollide while being spatially
separated, are important in both bulk and monolayer materials. The excellent
agreement between our three levels of theory highlights and characterizes the
complexity behind the HHG emission dynamics in solids, and expands on the
notion of interband HHG as always originating in trajectories tunnelled at the
minimum band gap. Our work furthers the fundamental understanding of HHG in
periodic systems and will benefit the future design of experiments.

methods is widely recognised as one of the key challenges of modern AI. Recent
years have seen large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI
systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse and mostly
empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid
systems. In this paper we analyse a large body of recent literature and we
propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic
systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of
hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building
blocks.
  The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised
vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid
systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems, organised in a
set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an
application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI
systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not
recognised until now. Finally, our design patterns extend and refine Kautz'
earlier attempt at categorising neuro-symbolic architectures.

as porous media or narrow channels) significantly differs from free space. With
a simple model of two types of particles competing to transport via a passive
single-lane channel connecting two chemical baths, we find two dynamical modes
of transportation -- the dud mode and the ratchet mode. At the ratchet mode,
the gradient flow of one type of particle forces the other into a transient
anti-equilibrium flow against its gradient. At the dud mode, the two types of
particles both flow according to their gradients. This counter-intuitive
non-equilibrium effect can be explained by a sloppy gear mechanism. In addition
to the anti-gradient flow observed in the ratchet mode, we find that the
non-equilibrium sloppy gear mechanism suppresses the flow of one particle while
allowing the flow for the other. This mechanism provides a general theoretical
framework to explain and design the selective transportation of particles via
passive channels.

the spectral density function (SDF) and identify predefined frequency bands
that have the most substantial relative contributions to the overall variance
of the signal. However, a limitation of this approach is that the precise
frequency and bandwidth of oscillations vary with cognitive demands. Thus they
should not be arbitrarily defined a priori in an experiment. In this paper, we
develop a data-driven approach that identifies (i) the number of prominent
peaks, (ii) the frequency peak locations, and (iii) their corresponding
bandwidths (or spread of power around the peaks). We propose a Bayesian mixture
auto-regressive decomposition method (BMARD), which represents the standardized
SDFas a Dirichlet process mixture based on a kernel derived from second-order
auto-regressive processes which completely characterize the location (peak)and
scale (bandwidth) parameters. We present a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs
algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the mixture parameters.
Simulation studies demonstrate the robustness and performance of the BMARD

potential (LFP) activity from the hippocampus of laboratory rats across
different conditions in a non-spatial sequence memory experiment to identify
the most interesting frequency bands and examine the link between specific
patterns of activity and trial-specific cognitive demands.

saddle point of the free energy surface, we have identified the parameters
whereof the smallness is necessary for the resulting kinetic equation to have
the form of the Fokker-Planck equation with linear (in droplet variables) force
coefficients. The ""non-smallness"" of these parameters results either in the
appearance of the third or higher order partial derivatives of the distribution
function in the kinetic equation or in its force coefficients becoming
non-linear functions of droplet variables, or both; this would render the
conventional kinetic equation of multicomponent nucleation and its predictions

iterative queries and feedback to arrive at the minimizer of a convex function.
It has gained considerable popularity thanks to its scalability in large-scale
optimization and machine learning. The repeated interactions, however, expose
the learner to privacy risks from eavesdropping adversaries that observe the
submitted queries. In this paper, we study how to optimally obfuscate the
learner's queries in convex optimization with first-order feedback, so that
their learned optimal value is provably difficult to estimate for an
eavesdropping adversary. We consider two formulations of learner privacy: a
Bayesian formulation in which the convex function is drawn randomly, and a
minimax formulation in which the function is fixed and the adversary's
probability of error is measured with respect to a minimax criterion.
  Suppose that the learner wishes to ensure the adversary cannot estimate
accurately with probability greater than $1/L$ for some $L>0$. Our main results
show that the query complexity overhead is additive in $L$ in the minimax
formulation, but multiplicative in $L$ in the Bayesian formulation. Compared to
existing learner-private sequential learning models with binary feedback, our
results apply to the significantly richer family of general convex functions
with full-gradient feedback. Our proofs learn on tools from the theory of
Dirichlet processes, as well as a novel strategy designed for measuring
information leakage under a full-gradient oracle.

approximate a Brownian random walk and that the particles can be treated as
noninteracting. We measure the contact-interval (also called the waiting-time
or inter-arrival-time), contact-count, and contact-duration distributions in
populations of individuals undergoing noninteracting continuous-space-time
random walks on a periodic two-dimensional plane (a torus), as functions of the
population number density, walker radius, and random-walk step size. The
contact-interval is exponentially distributed for times longer than the
mean-free-collision time but not for times shorter than that, and the contact
duration distribution is strongly peak at the ballistic-crossing time for
head-on collisions, when the ballistic-crossing time is short compared to the
mean step duration. While successive contacts between individuals are
independent, the probability of repeat contact decreases with time after a
previous contact. This leads to a negative duration dependence of the
waiting-time interval and over dispersion of the contact-count probability
density function for all time intervals. The paper demonstrates that for
populations of small particles (walker radius small compared to the
mean-separation or random-walk step size) the mean-free-collision interval, the
ballistic-crossing time, and the random-walk-step duration can be used to
construct temporal scalings which allow for common waiting-time, contact-count,

which the inter-band repulsive interactions play the dominant role. We first
demonstrate three different schemes of constraining the ratios between the
three types of inter-band interactions -- density-density, spin exchange, and
pair-hopping -- that render the model free of the fermionic sign-problem for
any filling and, consequently, amenable to efficient Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We then study the behavior of these sign-problem-free models in
the strong-coupling regime. In the cases where spin-rotational invariance is
preserved or lowered to a planar symmetry, the strong-coupling ground state is
a quantum paramagnet. However, in the case where there is only a residual Ising
symmetry, the strong-coupling expansion maps onto the transverse-field
$J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model, whose pseudospins are associated with local inter-band
magnetic order. We show that by varying the band structure parameters within a
reasonable range of values, a variety of ground states and quantum critical
points can be accessed in the strong-coupling regime, some of which are not
realized in the weak-coupling regime. We compare these results with the case of
the single-band Hubbard model, where only intra-band repulsion is present, and
whose strong-coupling behavior is captured by a simple Heisenberg model.

cone to the (mildly non-convex) prox-regular moving set $C(t)$, supposed to
have an absolutely continuous variation, is perturbed by a sum of a
Carath\'{e}odory mapping and an integral forcing term. The integrand of the
forcing term depends on two time-variables, that is, we study a general
integro-differential sweeping process of Volterra type. By setting up an
appropriate semi-discretization method combined with a new Gronwall-like
inequality (differential inequality), we show that the integro-differential
sweeping process has one and only one absolutely continuous solution. We also
establish the continuity of the solution with respect to the initial value. The
results of the paper are applied to the study of nonlinear integro-differential
complementarity systems which are combination of Volterra integro-differential
equations with nonlinear complementarity constraints. Another application is
concerned with non-regular electrical circuits containing time-varying

naturally adapted to the symmetry of the body, and we express the gravitational

elliptic integrals. An equilibrium shape occurs when the gravitational
potential energy and the rotational kinetic energy at the surface of the body
balance each other out. Such an equilibrium shape can be derived as a solution

the smallest number of entries of $M$ which one must change to make its rank at
most $r$. There are many known applications of rigidity lower bounds to a
variety of areas in complexity theory, but fewer known applications of rigidity
upper bounds. In this paper, we use rigidity upper bounds to prove new upper
bounds in a few different models of computation. Our results include:
  $\bullet$ For any $d> 1$, and over any field $\mathbb{F}$, the $N \times N$
Walsh-Hadamard transform has a depth-$d$ linear circuit of size $O(d \cdot N^{1
+ 0.96/d})$. This circumvents a known lower bound of $\Omega(d \cdot N^{1 +
1/d})$ for circuits with bounded coefficients over $\mathbb{C}$ by Pudl\'ak
(2000), by using coefficients of magnitude polynomial in $N$. Our construction
also generalizes to linear transformations given by a Kronecker power of any
fixed $2 \times 2$ matrix.
  $\bullet$ The $N \times N$ Walsh-Hadamard transform has a linear circuit of
size $\leq (1.81 + o(1)) N \log_2 N$, improving on the bound of $\approx 1.88 N
\log_2 N$ which one obtains from the standard fast Walsh-Hadamard transform.
  $\bullet$ A new rigidity upper bound, showing that the following classes of
matrices are not rigid enough to prove circuit lower bounds using Valiant's
approach:
  $-$ for any field $\mathbb{F}$ and any function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to
\mathbb{F}$, the matrix $V_f \in \mathbb{F}^{2^n \times 2^n}$ given by, for any
$x,y \in \{0,1\}^n$, $V_f[x,y] = f(x \wedge y)$, and
  $-$ for any field $\mathbb{F}$ and any fixed-size matrices $M_1, \ldots, M_n
\in \mathbb{F}^{q \times q}$, the Kronecker product $M_1 \otimes M_2 \otimes
\cdots \otimes M_n$.
  This generalizes recent results on non-rigidity, using a simpler approach
which avoids needing the polynomial method.

attention, as they possess the excellent capability of processing graph-related
problems. In practice, hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) is critical for GNNs
to achieve satisfactory results, but this process is costly because the
evaluations of different hyperparameter settings require excessively training
many GNNs. Many approaches have been proposed for HPO, which aims to identify
promising hyperparameters efficiently. In particular, the genetic algorithm
(GA) for HPO has been explored, which treats GNNs as a black-box model, of
which only the outputs can be observed given a set of hyperparameters. However,
because GNN models are sophisticated and the evaluations of hyperparameters on
GNNs are expensive, GA requires advanced techniques to balance the exploration
and exploitation of the search and make the optimisation more effective given
limited computational resources. Therefore, we proposed a tree-structured
mutation strategy for GA to alleviate this issue. Meanwhile, we reviewed the
recent HPO works, which gives room for the idea of tree-structure to develop,

demonstrates that one AC generally provides three independent constraints for
relative pose estimation. For multi-camera systems, there is still not any
AC-based minimal solver for general relative pose estimation. To deal with this
problem, we propose a complete solution to relative pose estimation from two
ACs for multi-camera systems, consisting of a series of minimal solvers. The
solver generation in our solution is based on Cayley or quaternion
parameterization for rotation and hidden variable technique to eliminate
translation. This solver generation method is also naturally applied to
relative pose estimation from PCs, resulting in a new six-point method for
multi-camera systems. A few extensions are made, including relative pose

However, previous work has shown that theoretical models of the shift current

be investigated in order to obtain a complete picture of BPVE. In this Letter,
we demonstrate two approaches that enable the ab initio calculation of the
ballistic current originating from the electron-hole interaction in
semiconductors. Using BaTiO$_3$ and MoS$_2$ as two examples, we show clearly
that for them the asymmetric scattering from electron-hole interaction is less

scattering processes need to be included to further improve the BPVE theory.
Moreover, our approaches build up a venue for predicting and designing
materials with larger ballistic current due to electron-hole interactions.

theorem, which decomposes the accuracy disparity into the distance between
marginal label distributions and the distance between conditional
representations, to help explain why such accuracy disparity appears in
practice. Motivated by this error decomposition and the general idea of
distribution alignment with statistical distances, we then propose an algorithm
to reduce this disparity, and analyze its game-theoretic optima of the proposed
objective functions. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we also conduct

our proposed algorithms can effectively mitigate accuracy disparity while

many possible actions that can be taken in specific situations. We have
previously developed a means of constraining, and hence speeding up, the search
process through the use of motion primitives; motion primitives are sequences
of pre-specified actions taken across a state series. As a byproduct of this
work, we have found that if the motion primitives' motions and actions are
labeled, then the search can be sped up further. Since motion primitives may
initially lack such details, we propose a theoretically viewpoint-insensitive
and speed-insensitive means of automatically annotating the underlying motions
and actions. We do this through a differential-geometric, spatio-temporal
kinematics descriptor, which analyzes how the poses of entities in two motion
sequences change over time. We use this descriptor in conjunction with a
weighted-nearest-neighbor classifier to label the primitives using a limited
set of training examples.
  In our experiments, we achieve high motion and action annotation rates for
human-action-derived primitives with as few as one training sample. We also
demonstrate that reinforcement learning using accurately labeled trajectories
leads to high-performing policies more quickly than standard reinforcement
learning techniques. This is partly because motion primitives encode prior
domain knowledge and preempt the need to re-discover that knowledge during
training. It is also because agents can leverage the labels to systematically
ignore action classes that do not facilitate task objectives, thereby reducing
the action space.

alternating convectively stable and unstable layers. We have discussed wave
transmissions in two different circumstances: cases where the wave is
propagative in each layer and cases where wave tunneling occurs. We find that
efficient wave transmission can be achieved by `resonant propagation' or
`resonant tunneling', even when stable layers are strongly stratified, and we
call this phenomenon `enhanced wave transmission'. Enhanced wave transmission
only occurs when the total number of layers is odd (embedding stable layers are
alternatingly embedded within clamping convective layers, or vise versa). For
wave propagation, the occurrence of enhanced wave transmission requires that
clamping layers have similar properties, the thickness of each clamping layer
is close to a multiple of the half wavelength of the corresponding propagative
wave, and the total thickness of embedded layers is close to a multiple of the
half wavelength of the corresponding propagating wave (resonant propagation).
For wave tunneling, we have considered two cases: tunneling of gravity waves
and tunneling of inertial waves. In both cases, efficient tunneling requires
that clamping layers have similar properties, the thickness of each embedded
layer is much smaller than the corresponding e-folding decay distance, and the
thickness of each clamping layer is close to a multiple-and-a-half of half

resolution, we have recently suggested that as $d$ increases the behavior of
the RLG converges to the glassy description, and that percolation physics is
recovered thanks to finite-$d$ perturbative and non-perturbative (instantonic)
corrections [Biroli et al. arXiv:2003.11179]. Here, we expand on the
$d\rightarrow\infty$ physics by considering a simpler static solution as well
as the dynamical solution of the RLG. Comparing the $1/d$ correction of this
solution with numerical results reveals that even perturbative corrections fall
out of reach of existing theoretical descriptions. Comparing the dynamical
solution with the mode-coupling theory (MCT) results further reveals that
although key quantitative features of MCT are far off the mark, it does
properly capture the discontinuous nature of the $d\rightarrow\infty$ RLG.

out heavy fields in the path integral. The derivation of the corresponding
effective Lagrangian including the one-loop contributions of the heavy
particle(s) is particularly transparent, flexible, and algorithmic. The
background-field formalism allows for a clear separation of tree-level and
one-loop effects involving the heavy fields. Using expansion by regions the
one-loop effects are further split into contributions from large and small
momentum modes. The former are contained in Wilson coefficients of effective
operators, the latter are reproduced by one-loop diagrams involving effective
tree-level couplings. The method is illustrated by calculating potential
non-decoupling effects of a heavy Higgs boson in a singlet Higgs extension of
the Standard Model. In particular, we work in a field basis corresponding to
mass eigenstates and properly take into account non-vanishing mixing between
the two Higgs fields of the model. We also show that a proper choice of
renormalization scheme for the non-standard sector of the underlying full
theory is crucial for the construction of a consistent effective field theory.

network construction of a p-adic CFT encodes geometric information of a dual
geometry even as we deform the CFT away from the fixed point by finding a way
to assign distances to the tensor network. In fact we demonstrate that a unique
(up to normalizations) emergent graph Einstein equation is satisfied by the
geometric data encoded in the tensor network, and the graph Einstein tensor
automatically recovers the known proposal in the mathematics literature, at
least perturbatively order by order in the deformation away from the pure
Bruhat-Tits Tree geometry dual to pure CFTs. Once the dust settles, it becomes
apparent that the assigned distance indeed corresponds to some Fisher metric
between quantum states encoding expectation values of bulk fields in one higher
dimension. This is perhaps a first quantitative demonstration that a concrete
Einstein equation can be extracted directly from the tensor network, albeit in
the simplified setting of the p-adic AdS/CFT.

is formally applicable. We then summarize the evolution of the entropy theory
from a qualitative framework for organizing and interpreting
temperature-dependent viscosity data by Kauzmann to the formulation of a
hypothetical `ideal thermodynamic glass transition' by Gibbs and DiMarzio,
followed by seminal measurements linking entropy and relaxation by Bestul and
Chang and the Adam-Gibbs (AG) model of glass formation rationalizing the
observations of Bestul and Chang. These developments laid the groundwork for
the generalized entropy theory (GET), which merges an improved lattice model of
polymer thermodynamics accounting for molecular structural details and enabling
the analytic calculation of the configurational entropy with the AG model,
giving rise to a highly predictive model of the segmental structural relaxation
time of polymeric glass-forming liquids. The development of the GET has
occurred in parallel with the string model of glass formation in which concrete
realizations of the cooperatively rearranging regions are identified and
quantified for a wide range of polymeric and other glass-forming materials. The
string model has shown that many of the assumptions of AG are well supported by
simulations, while others are certainly not, giving rise to an entropy theory
of glass formation that is largely in accord with the GET. As the GET and
string models continue to be refined, these models progressively grow into a
more unified framework, and this Perspective reviews the present status of
development of this promising approach to the dynamics of polymeric
glass-forming liquids.

incomplete picture of the underlying counterfactual distributions. Here we
consider estimating the entire counterfactual density and generic functionals
thereof. We focus on two kinds of target parameters. The first is a density
approximation, defined by a projection onto a finite-dimensional model using a
generalized distance metric, which includes f-divergences as well as $L_p$
norms. The second is the distance between counterfactual densities, which can
be used as a more nuanced effect measure than the mean difference, and as a
tool for model selection. We study nonparametric efficiency bounds for these
targets, giving results for smooth but otherwise generic models and distances.
Importantly, we show how these bounds connect to means of particular
non-trivial functions of counterfactuals, linking the problems of density and
mean estimation. We go on to propose doubly robust-style estimators for the
density approximations and distances, and study their rates of convergence,
showing they can be optimally efficient in large nonparametric models. We also
give analogous methods for model selection and aggregation, when many models
may be available and of interest. Our results all hold for generic models and
distances, but throughout we highlight what happens for particular choices,
such as $L_2$ projections on linear models, and KL projections on exponential
families. Finally we illustrate by estimating the density of CD4 count among

each encoder and the decoder, and there is independent pairwise shared
randomness between all the three possible pairs of nodes. The decoder has to
output approximately i.i.d. copies of another random variable jointly
distributed with the two sources and the side information. We are interested in
the rate tuples which permit this simulation. This setting can be thought of as
a multi-terminal generalization of the point-to-point channel simulation
problem studied by Bennett et al. (2002) and Cuff (2013). When the pairwise
shared randomness between the encoders is absent, the setting reduces to a
special case of MAC simulation using another MAC studied by Haddadpour et
al.~(2013). We establish that the presence of encoder shared randomness can
strictly improve the communication rate requirements. We first show that the
inner bound derived from Haddadpour et al.~(2013) is tight when the sources at
the encoders are conditionally independent given the side-information at the
decoder. This result recovers the existing results on point-to-point channel

institutions to decide whether to approve or reject a credit loan. For sake of
reliability, it is necessary for credit scoring models to be both accurate and
globally interpretable. Simple classifiers, e.g., Logistic Regression (LR), are
white-box models, but not powerful enough to model complex nonlinear
interactions among features. Fortunately, automatic feature crossing is a
promising way to find cross features to make simple classifiers to be more
accurate without heavy handcrafted feature engineering. However, credit scoring
is usually based on different aspects of users, and the data usually contains
hundreds of feature fields. This makes existing automatic feature crossing
methods not efficient for credit scoring. In this work, we find local
piece-wise interpretations in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) of a specific feature
are usually inconsistent in different samples, which is caused by feature
interactions in the hidden layers. Accordingly, we can design an automatic
feature crossing method to find feature interactions in DNN, and use them as
cross features in LR. We give definition of the interpretation inconsistency in
DNN, based on which a novel feature crossing method for credit scoring
prediction called DNN2LR is proposed. Apparently, the final model, i.e., a LR
model empowered with cross features, generated by DNN2LR is a white-box model.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on both public and business datasets
from real-world credit scoring applications. Experimental shows that, DNN2LR
can outperform the DNN model, as well as several feature crossing methods.
Moreover, comparing with the state-of-the-art feature crossing methods, i.e.,
AutoCross, DNN2LR can accelerate the speed for feature crossing by about 10 to
40 times on datasets with large numbers of feature fields.

mitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is
introduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and
subsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities
to be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to
improve the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is
decreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is
improved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both
simulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing
performance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the
labeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram

frequency in power systems. Power grids are equipped with Rate-of-Change-of
Frequency (ROCOF) and Load Shedding (LS) relays in order to keep
load-generation balance. With the increasing penetration of renewables, the
inertia of the power grids is declining, which results in a faster drop in
system frequency in case of load-generation imbalance. In this context, we
analyze the feasibility of launching False Data Injection (FDI) in order to
create False Relay Operations (FRO), which we refer to as FRO attack, in the
power systems with high renewables. We model the frequency dynamics of the
power systems and corresponding FDI attacks, including the impact of
parameters, such as synchronous generators inertia, and governors time constant
and droop, on the success of FRO attacks. We formalize the FRO attack as a
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and solve using Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT). Our case studies show that power grids with renewables are more
susceptible to FRO attacks and the inertia of synchronous generators plays a
critical role in reducing the success of FRO attacks in the power grids.

Equations (BSDEs) and non-linear parabolic partial differential equations

high-dimensional semi-linear parabolic PDEs. This scheme is inspired by the
approach coming from machine learning and developed using deep neural networks
in Han and al. [32]. Our algorithm is based on a Picard iteration scheme in
which a sequence of linear-quadratic optimisation problem is solved by means of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. In the framework of a linear
specification of the approximation space, we manage to prove a convergence
result for our scheme, under some smallness condition. In practice, in order to
be able to treat high-dimensional examples, we employ sparse grid approximation
spaces. In the case of periodic coefficients and using pre-wavelet basis
functions, we obtain an upper bound on the global complexity of our method. It
shows in particular that the curse of dimensionality is tamed in the sense that
in order to achieve a root mean squared error of order ${\epsilon}$, for a
prescribed precision ${\epsilon}$, the complexity of the Picard algorithm grows
polynomially in ${\epsilon}^{-1}$ up to some logarithmic factor $
|log({\epsilon})| $ which grows linearly with respect to the PDE dimension.
Various numerical results are presented to validate the performance of our

this work, we address the challenge of predicting prices evolution among
multiple potentially interacting financial assets. A solution to this problem
has obvious importance for governments, banks, and investors. Statistical
methods such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are widely
applied to these problems. In this paper, we propose to approach economic time
series forecasting of multiple financial assets in a novel way via video
prediction. Given past prices of multiple potentially interacting financial
assets, we aim to predict the prices evolution in the future. Instead of
treating the snapshot of prices at each time point as a vector, we spatially
layout these prices in 2D as an image, such that we can harness the power of
CNNs in learning a latent representation for these financial assets. Thus, the
history of these prices becomes a sequence of images, and our goal becomes
predicting future images. We build on a state-of-the-art video prediction
method for forecasting future images. Our experiments involve the prediction
task of the price evolution of nine financial assets traded in U.S. stock
markets. The proposed method outperforms baselines including ARIMA, Prophet,
and variations of the proposed method, demonstrating the benefits of harnessing
the power of CNNs in the problem of economic time series forecasting.

new machine learning based approach to extract the cellular force distributions
from the microscope images. The full process can be divided into three steps.
First, we culture the cells on a special substrate allowing to measure both the
cellular traction force on the substrate and the corresponding substrate
wrinkles simultaneously. The cellular forces are obtained using the traction
force microscopy (TFM), at the same time that cell-generated contractile forces
wrinkle their underlying substrate. Second, the wrinkle positions are extracted
from the microscope images. Third, we train the machine learning system with
GAN (generative adversarial network) by using sets of corresponding two images,
the traction field and the input images (raw microscope images or extracted
wrinkle images), as the training data. The network understands the way to
convert the input images of the substrate wrinkles to the traction distribution
from the training. After sufficient training, the network is utilized to
predict the cellular forces just from the input images. Our system provides a
powerful tool to evaluate the cellular forces efficiently because the forces
can be predicted just by observing the cells under the microscope, which is a
way simpler method compared to the TFM experiment. Additionally, the machine
learning based approach presented here has the profound potential for being
applied to diverse cellular assays for studying mechanobiology of cells.

suppose that we can rank them by a user-specified scoring function $f$, which

scores were within top-$k$ among those records within a ""durability window"" of

searches for various superconducting superhydrides. It was experimentally
observed that thorium hydrides, ThH$_{10}$ and ThH$_9$, are stabilized at much
lower pressures compared to LaH$_{10}$. Based on first-principles
density-functional theory calculations, we reveal that the isolated Th
frameworks of ThH$_{10}$ and ThH$_9$ have relatively more excess electrons in
interstitial regions than the La framework of LaH$_{10}$. Such interstitial
excess electrons easily participate in the formation of anionic H cage
surrounding metal atom. The resulting Coulomb attraction between cationic Th
atoms and anionic H cages is estimated to be stronger than the corresponding
one of LaH$_{10}$, thereby giving rise to larger chemical precompressions in
ThH$_{10}$ and ThH$_9$. Such a formation mechanism of H clathrates can also be
applied to another experimentally synthesized superhydride CeH$_9$, confirming
the experimental evidence that the chemical precompression in CeH$_9$ is larger
than that in LaH$_{10}$. Our findings demonstrate that interstitial excess
electrons in the isolated metal frameworks of high-pressure superhydrides play
an important role in generating the chemical precompression of H clathrates.

multivariate normal distribution when the scale is unknown under quadratic
loss. The priors considered put the improper invariant prior on the scale while
the prior on the mean has a hierarchical normal structure conditional on the
scale. This conditional hierarchical prior is essentially that of Maruyama and
Strawderman (2021, Biometrika) (MS21) which is indexed by a hyperparameter $a$.
In that paper $a$ is chosen so this conditional prior is proper which
corresponds to $a>-1$. This paper extends MS21 by considering improper
conditional priors with $a$ in the closed interval $[-2, -1]$, and establishing
admissibility for such $a$. The authors, in Maruyama and Strawderman (2017,
JMVA), have earlier shown that such conditional priors with $a < -2$ lead to
inadmissible estimators. This paper therefore completes the determination of
admissibility/inadmissibility for this class of priors. It establishes the the
boundary as $a = -2$, with admissibility holding for $a\geq -2$ and
inadmissibility for $a < -2$. This boundary corresponds exactly to that in the
known scale case for these conditional priors, and which follows from Brown
(1971, AOMS). As a notable benefit of this enlargement of the class of
admissible generalized Bayes estimators, we give admissible and minimax
estimators in all dimensions greater than $2$ as opposed to MS21 which required
the dimension to be greater than $4$. In one particularly interesting special
case, we establish that the joint Stein prior for the unknown scale case leads
to a minimax admissible estimator in all dimensions greater than $2$.

out of equilibrium. For example, the standard derivation of the fluctuation
theorem relies on the assumption that the initial state of the heat bath is the
canonical ensemble. On the other hand, the recent progress in the foundation of
statistical mechanics has revealed that a thermal equilibrium state is not
necessarily described by the canonical ensemble but can be a quantum pure state
or even a single energy eigenstate, as formulated by the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Then, a question raised is how these two
pictures, the canonical ensemble and a single energy eigenstate as a thermal
equilibrium state, are compatible in the fluctuation theorem. In this paper, we
theoretically and numerically show that the fluctuation theorem holds in both
of the long and short-time regimes, even when the initial state of the bath is
a single energy eigenstate of a many-body system. Our proof of the fluctuation
theorem in the long-time regime is based on the ETH, while it was previously
shown in the short-time regime on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound and the
ETH [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 100601 (2017)]. The proofs for these time regimes
are theoretically independent and complementary, implying the fluctuation
theorem in the entire time domain. We also perform a systematic numerical
simulation of hard-core bosons by exact diagonalization and verify the
fluctuation theorem in both of the time regimes by focusing on the finite-size
scaling. Our results contribute to the understanding of the mechanism that the
fluctuation theorem emerges from unitary dynamics of quantum many-body systems,
and can be tested by experiments with, e.g., ultracold atoms.

number counts, sky brightness or redshift distributions in large samples of
distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), have yielded values of the peculiar
velocity many times larger than that from the CMBR, though surprisingly, in all
cases the directions agreed with the CMBR dipole. Here we determine our
peculiar motion from a sample of ~0.28 million AGNs, selected from the Mid
Infra Red Active Galactic Nuclei (MIRAGN) sample comprising more than a million
sources. From this, we find a peculiar velocity, which is more than four times
the CMBR value, although the direction seems to be within $\sim 2\sigma$ of the
CMBR dipole. A genuine value of the solar peculiar velocity should be the same
irrespective of the data or the technique employed to estimate it. Therefore,
such discordant dipole amplitudes, might mean that the explanation for these
dipoles, including that of the CMBR, might in fact be something else. But, the
observed fact that the direction in all cases, is the same, though obtained
from completely independent surveys using different instruments and techniques,
by different sets of people employing different computing routines, might
nonetheless indicate that these dipoles are not merely due to some systematics,
otherwise why would they all be pointing along the same direction. It might
instead suggest a preferred direction in the Universe, implying a genuine
anisotropy, which would violate the Cosmological Principle, the core of the
modern cosmology.

highest magnetic field in known neutron star X-ray binary systems.
Observational data of the X-ray outbursts in GRO J1008-57 from 2017 to 2020
were collected by the Insight-HXMT satellite. In this work, the spin period of
the neutron star in GRO J1008-57 was determined to be about 93.28 seconds in
August 2017, 93.22 seconds in February 2018, 93.25 seconds in June 2019 and
93.14 seconds in June 2020. GRO J1008-57 evolved in the spin-up process with a
mean rate of $-(2.10\pm 0.05)\times$10$^{-4}$ s/d from 2009 -- 2018, and turned
into a spin down process with a rate of $(6.7\pm 0.6)\times$10$^{-5}$ s/d from
Feb 2018 to June 2019. During the type II outburst of 2020, GRO J1008-57 had
the spin-up torque again. During the torque reversals, the pulse profiles and
continuum X-ray spectra did not change significantly, and the cyclotron
resonant scattering feature around 80 keV was only detected during the
outbursts in 2017 and 2020. Based on the observed mean spin-up rate, we
estimated the inner accretion disk radius in GRO J1008-57 (about 1 - 2 times of
the Alfv\'{e}n radius) by comparing different accretion torque models of
magnetic neutron stars. During the spin-down process, the magnetic torque
should dominate over the matter accreting inflow torque, and we constrained the
surface dipole magnetic field $B\geq 6\times 10^{12}$ G for the neutron star in
GRO J1008-57, which is consistent with the magnetic field strength obtained by

and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science.
First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to
data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or
probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant
perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented
in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all
possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of
nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction,
estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods
developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate
systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear
remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due
primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it
to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is
formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data
and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical
algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed
and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications.
In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory,
describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting
these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key
advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that
are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the
theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.

bound states in the continuum that are mirror-less but based on topology. Here
we report a compound method, combing mirrors and bound states in the continuum
in an optimized way, to achieve a class of on-chip optical cavities that have
high quality factors and small modal volumes. Specifically, light is trapped in
the transverse direction by the photonic band gap of the lateral
hetero-structure and confined in the vertical direction by the constellation of
multiple bound states in the continuum. As a result, unlike most bound states
in the continuum found in photonic crystal slabs that are de-localized Bloch
modes, we achieve light-trapping in all three dimensions and experimentally
demonstrate quality factors as high as $Q = 1.09 \times 10^6$ and modal volumes
as low as $V = 3.56~ \mu m^3$ in the telecommunication regime. We further prove
the robustness of our method through the statistical study of multiple
fabricated devices. Our work provides a new method of light trapping, which can
find potential applications in photonic integration, nonlinear optics and

Mean-Covariance Bandit (CMCB) model to explicitly take into account option

weight vectors on given options and observes random feedback according to the
decisions. The agent's objective is to achieve the best trade-off between
reward and risk, measured with option covariance. To capture different reward
observation scenarios in practice, we consider three feedback settings, i.e.,
full-information, semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback. We propose novel
algorithms with optimal regrets (within logarithmic factors), and provide
matching lower bounds to validate their optimalities. The experimental results
also demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that considers option correlation in
risk-aware bandits and explicitly quantifies how arbitrary covariance
structures impact the learning performance. The novel analytical techniques we
developed for exploiting the estimated covariance to build concentration and

cyclotomic sequences. Journal of Cryptologic Research,6(4):455-462, 2019). The

enough to resist the attack of the rational approximation algorithm(RAA) for
feedback with carry shift registers(FCSRs), i.e., it is in fact lower bounded
by $pq-p-q-1$, which is far larger than one half of the period of the
sequences. Particularly, the 2-adic complexity is maximal if suitable

of statistics and machine learning in the federated setting. In many cases the
best known LDP algorithms require sending prohibitively large messages from the
client device to the server (such as when constructing histograms over large
domain or learning a high-dimensional model). This has led to significant
efforts on reducing the communication cost of LDP algorithms.
  At the same time LDP reports are known to have relatively little information
about the user's data due to randomization. Several schemes are known that
exploit this fact to design low-communication versions of LDP algorithm but all
of them do so at the expense of a significant loss in utility. Here we
demonstrate a general approach that, under standard cryptographic assumptions,
compresses every efficient LDP algorithm with negligible loss in privacy and
utility guarantees. The practical implication of our result is that in typical
applications the message can be compressed to the size of the server's
pseudo-random generator seed. More generally, we relate the properties of an
LDP randomizer to the power of a pseudo-random generator that suffices for
compressing the LDP randomizer. From this general approach we derive
low-communication algorithms for the problems of frequency estimation and
high-dimensional mean estimation. Our algorithms are simpler and more accurate
than existing low-communication LDP algorithms for these well-studied problems.

mixing and reactions in unsaturated conditions. We obtain 3$D$ experimental
images of the phases distribution and of transported chemical reaction by
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using an immiscible non-wetting liquid as a
second phase and a fast irreversible bimolecular reaction. Keeping the P\'eclet
number (Pe) constant, we study the impact of phases saturation on the dynamics
of mixing and the reaction front. By measuring the local concentration of the
reaction product, we quantify temporally resolved effective reaction rate
($R$). We describe the temporal evolution of $R$ using the lamellar theory of
mixing, which explains faster than Fickian ($t^{0.5}$) rate of product
formation by accounting for the deformation of mixing interface between the two
reacting fluids. For a given Pe, although stretching and folding of the
reactive front are enhanced as saturation decreases, enhancing the product
formation, this is larger as saturation increases, i.e., volume controlled.
After breakthrough, the extinction of the reaction takes longer as saturation
decreases because of the larger non-mixed volume behind the front. These
results are the basis for a general model to better predict reactive transport

concentration gradients induce stresses. These are referred to as Korteweg
stresses and are analogous to interfacial tension between two immiscible
fluids, thereby acting as an effective interfacial tension (EIT) in
inhomogeneous miscible systems. EIT governs the formation of a viscous thread
in flow-focusing of two miscible fluids. To further investigate its
significance, we have studied thread formation of a colloidal dispersion
focused by its own solvent. Experiments are combined with three-dimensional
numerical models to systematically expand previous knowledge utilising
different flow-focusing channel setups. In the reference setup, the sheath
flows impinge the core flow orthogonally while in four other channel setups,
the sheath flows impinge the core flow at an oblique angle that is both
positive and negative with respect to the reference sheath direction. As an
initial estimate of the EIT, we fit the experimentally determined thread shape
in the reference setup to a master curve that depends on EIT through an
effective capillary number. By numerically reproducing these experimental
results, it is concluded that the estimated EIT is within 25% of the optimal
EIT value that can be deduced by iteratively fitting the numerical results to
the experimental measurements. Regardless of channel setups, further numerical
calculations performed using the optimal EIT evaluated from the reference setup
show good agreement with the experimental findings in terms of thread shapes,
wetted region morphologies, and velocity flow fields. The one-to-one comparison
of numerical and experimental findings unveil the crucial role of EIT on the
thread detachment from the top and bottom walls of the channel, bringing useful
insights to understand the physical phenomenons involved in miscible systems

the external magnetic field and the crystallographic axes. %By reliably
enlarging the limit of the spin and orbital sum rules, which usually holds for
materials where the magnetic ions exhibit a unique crystal field symmetry This
finding translates in a sign-reversal between the average Fe magnetic orbital
and spin moments. Large Fe-displacements, among some of the octahedral sites,
lower the symmetry of the system producing anisotropic paths for the Fe-O
bondings giving rise to a large orbital-lattice interaction akin to a
preferential crystallographic direction for the magnetic orbital moment. The
latter may lead to a partial re-orientation of the magnetic orbital moment
under an external magnetic field that, combined to the ferrimagnetic nature of
the GFO, can qualitatively explain the observed sign-reversal of the XMCD
integral. The results suggest that a control over the local symmetry of the
oxygen octahedra in transition metal oxides can offer a suitable leverage over
the manipulation of the effective orbital and spin moments in magnetoelectric

Motivated by the interest in designing conjugated polymers with tunable
photoswitchable pathways, we devised a computational framework to enhance the
sampling of the torsional conformational space and at the same time estimate
ground to excited-state free-energy differences. This scheme is based on a
combination of Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (REM), Parallel Bias metadynamics,
and free-energy perturbation theory. In our scheme, each REM replica samples an
intermediate unphysical state between the ground and the first two excited
states, which are characterized by TD-DFT simulations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level
of theory. We applied the method to a 5-mer of 9,9-dioctylfluorene and found
that upon irradiation this system can undergo a dihedral inversion from 155 to
-155 degrees crossing a barrier that decreases from 0.1 eV in the ground state
(S0) to 0.05 eV and 0.04 eV in the first (S1) and second (S2) excited states.
Furthermore, S1 and even more S2 were predicted to stabilize coplanar
dihedrals, with a local free-energy minimum located at +-44 degrees. The
presence of a free-energy barrier of 0.08 eV for the S1 and 0.12 eV for the S2
state can trap this conformation in a basin far from the global free-energy
minimum located at 155 degrees. The simulation results were compared with the

great successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone

image classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which
overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction
tasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT
that typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory
cost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve
high output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using
a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.
(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a
unified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply
replacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive
experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,
e.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with
a comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO
dataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP. We hope PVT

present an effective pressure gauge for DACs made of manganin metal, based on

is well established and shows excellent linear relations in the 0 - 30 GPa
pressure range with a slope of 23.4 (9) GPa for the first-cycle compression, in
contrast to that of multiple-cycle compression and decompression having a

monitoring the cell pressure of piezoelectric-driving DACs, and the reliability
of this method is also verified by the fixed-point method with a Bi pressure

approach, however, is undesired in mining the most appropriate QA pairs from

answer extraction, which may lead to incompatible QA pair generation, i.e., the
selected answer span is inappropriate for question generation. However, for
human annotators, we take the whole QA pair into account and consider the
compatibility between question and answer. Inspired by such motivation, instead
of the conventional pipeline approach, we propose a model named OneStop

questions and their corresponding answer span is extracted simultaneously and
the process of question generation and answer extraction mutually affect each

objectives that change over time, which requires the optimization algorithms to
quickly track the Pareto optimal front (POF) when the environment changes. In
recent years, evolutionary algorithms based on prediction models have been
considered promising. However, most existing approaches only make predictions
based on the linear correlation between a finite number of optimal solutions in
two or three previous environments. These incomplete information extraction
strategies may lead to low prediction accuracy in some instances. In this
paper, a novel prediction algorithm based on incremental support vector machine
(ISVM) is proposed, called ISVM-DMOEA. We treat the solving of dynamic
multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) as an online learning process,
using the continuously obtained optimal solution to update an incremental
support vector machine without discarding the solution information at earlier
time. ISVM is then used to filter random solutions and generate an initial
population for the next moment. To overcome the obstacle of insufficient
training samples, a synthetic minority oversampling strategy is implemented
before the training of ISVM. The advantage of this approach is that the
nonlinear correlation between solutions can be explored online by ISVM, and the
information contained in all historical optimal solutions can be exploited to a
greater extent. The experimental results and comparison with chosen
state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
effectively tackle dynamic multiobjective optimization problems.

problem due to large modality varitions between visible and infrared images.
Existing approaches usually bridge the modality gap with only feature-level
constraints, ignoring pixel-level variations. Some methods employ GAN to
generate style-consistent images, but it destroys the structure information and
incurs a considerable level of noise. In this paper, we explicitly consider
these challenges and formulate a novel spectrum-aware feature augementation
network named SFANet for cross-modality matching problem. Specifically, we put
forward to employ grayscale-spectrum images to fully replace RGB images for
feature learning. Learning with the grayscale-spectrum images, our model can
apparently reduce modality discrepancy and detect inner structure relations
across the different modalities, making it robust to color variations. In
feature-level, we improve the conventional two-stream network through balancing
the number of specific and sharable convolutional blocks, which preserve the
spatial structure information of features. Additionally, a bi-directional
tri-constrained top-push ranking loss (BTTR) is embedded in the proposed
network to improve the discriminability, which efficiently further boosts the
matching accuracy. Meanwhile, we further introduce an effective dual-linear
with batch normalization ID embedding method to model the identity-specific
information and assits BTTR loss in magnitude stabilizing. On SYSU-MM01 and
RegDB datasets, we conducted extensively experiments to demonstrate that our
proposed framework contributes indispensably and achieves a very competitive
VI-ReID performance.

our work is the first to investigate and analyze (using stochastic geometry) CS

Our evaluations show that our proposed enhancements lead to an improvement in

laboratory to probe the velocity dispersion function (VDF) of early-type

~ 1. Through the statistical analysis of the currently largest sample of
early-type galaxy gravitational lenses, we conclude that the VDF inferred
solely from strong lensing systems is well consistent with the measurements of
SDSS DR5 data in the local universe. In particular, our results strongly
indicate a decline in the number density of lenses by a factor of two and a 20%
increase in the characteristic velocity dispersion for the early-type galaxy
population at z ~ 1. Such VDF evolution is in perfect agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm (i.e., the hierarchical build-up of mass structures over
cosmic time) and different from ""stellar mass-downsizing"" evolutions obtained
by many galaxy surveys. Meanwhile, we also quantitatively discuss the evolution
of the VDF shape in a more complex evolution model, which reveals its strong
correlation with that of the number density and velocity dispersion of
early-type galaxies. Finally, we evaluate if future missions such as LSST can
be sensitive enough to place the most stringent constraints on the redshift

techniques is that human demonstrations follow a distribution with multiple
modes for one task query. Previous approaches fail to capture all modes or tend
to average modes of the demonstrations and thus generate invalid trajectories.
The other difficulty is the small number of demonstrations that cannot cover
the entire working space. To overcome this problem, a motion generation model
with extrapolation ability is needed. Previous works restrict task queries as
local frames and learn representations in local frames. We propose a model to
solve both problems. For multiple modes, we suggest to learn local latent
representations of motion trajectories with a density estimation method based
on real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) transformations that provides a
set of powerful, stably invertible, and learnable transformations. To improve
the extrapolation ability, we propose to shift the attention of the robot from
one local frame to another during the task execution. In experiments, we
consider the docking problem used also in previous works where a trajectory has
to be generated to connect two dockers without collision. We increase
complexity of the task and show that the proposed method outperforms other
approaches. In addition, we evaluate the approach in real robot experiments.

one of the main parameters to understand and correctly model the late stages of
stellar evolution. Nevertheless, a fully-comprehensive knowledge of the RGB
mass loss is still missing.
  Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) are ideal targets to derive empirical
formulations of mass loss, but the presence of multiple populations with
different chemical compositions has been a major challenge to constrain stellar
masses and RGB mass losses. Recent work has disentangled the distinct stellar
populations along the RGB and the horizontal branch (HB) of 46 GCs, thus
providing the possibility to estimate the RGB mass loss of each stellar
population. The mass losses inferred for the stellar populations with pristine
chemical composition (called first-generation or 1G stars) tightly correlate
with cluster metallicity. This finding allows us to derive an empirical RGB
mass-loss law for 1G stars.
  In this paper we investigate seven GCs with no evidence of multiple
populations and derive the RGB mass loss by means of high-precision {\it
Hubble-Space Telescope} photometry and accurate synthetic photometry.
  We find a cluster-to-cluster variation in the mass loss ranging from
$\sim$0.1 to $\sim$0.3 $M_{\odot}$.
  The RGB mass loss of simple-population GCs correlates with the metallicity of
the host cluster. The discovery that simple-population GCs and 1G stars of
multiple population GCs follow similar mass-loss vs. metallicity relations
suggests that the resulting mass-loss law is a standard outcome of stellar
evolution.

AU relation modeling are two effective aspects which are worth exploring.
However, the limited representation capacity of regional features makes it
difficult for relation models to embed AU relationship knowledge. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-level adaptive ROI and graph learning (MARGL)
framework to tackle this problem. Specifically, an adaptive ROI learning module
is designed to automatically adjust the location and size of the predefined AU
regions. Meanwhile, besides relationship between AUs, there exists strong
relevance between regional features across multiple levels of the backbone
network as level-wise features focus on different aspects of representation. In
order to incorporate the intra-level AU relation and inter-level AU regional
relevance simultaneously, a multi-level AU relation graph is constructed and
graph convolution is performed to further enhance AU regional features of each
level. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA demonstrate the proposed MARGL
significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.

fermionic field confined on a truncated cone with an arbitrary planar angle
deficit and threaded by a magnetic flux. Different combinations of the boundary
conditions are imposed on the edges of the cone. They include the bag boundary
condition as a special case. By using the generalized Abel-Plana-type summation
formula for the series over the eigenvalues of the radial quantum number, the
edge-induced contributions in the FC are explicitly extracted. The FC is an
even periodic function of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux
quantum. Depending on the boundary conditions, the condensate can be either
positive or negative. For a massless field the FC in the boundary-free conical
geometry vanishes and the nonzero contributions are purely edge-induced
effects. This provides a mechanism for time-reversal symmetry breaking in the
absence of magnetic fields. Combining the results for the fields corresponding
to two inequivalent irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra, the FC
is investigated in the parity and time-reversal symmetric fermionic models and
applications are discussed for graphitic cones.

further utilize different training techniques: layer freezing, block-wise

computational efficiency while offering the possibility of simulating complex
phenomena. While they are optimal for Cartesian meshes, adapted meshes have
traditionally been a stumbling block since it is difficult to predict the right
physics through various levels of meshes. In this work, we design a class of
fully adaptive LBM methods with dynamic mesh adaptation and error control
relying on multiresolution analysis. This wavelet-based approach allows to
adapt the mesh based on the regularity of the solution and leads to a very
efficient compression of the solution without loosing its quality and with the
preservation of the properties of the original LBM method on the finest grid.
This yields a general approach for a large spectrum of schemes and allows
precise error bounds, without the need for deep modifications on the reference
scheme. An error analysis is proposed. For the purpose of assessing the
approach, we conduct a series of test-cases for various schemes and scalar and
systems of conservation laws, where solutions with shocks are to be found and
local mesh adaptation is especially relevant. Theoretical estimates are
retrieved while a reduced memory footprint is observed. It paves the way to an
implementation in a multi-dimensional framework and high computational
efficiency of the method for both parabolic and hyperbolic equations, which is
the subject of a companion paper.

sources to investigate the wind environment of a O/B star irradiated by an
accreting neutron star. Previous studies and hydrodynamic simulations of the
system revealed a clumpy environment and the presence of two wakes: an
accretion wake surrounding the compact object and a photoionisation wake
trailing it along the orbit. Our goal is to conduct, for the first time,
high-resolution spectroscopy on Chandra/HETG data at the orbital phase
$\varphi_\mathrm{orb} \approx 0.75$, when the line of sight is crossing the
photoionisation wake. We aim to conduct plasma diagnostics, inferring the
structure and the geometry of the wind. We perform a blind search employing a
Bayesian Block algorithm to find discrete spectral features and identify them
thanks to the most recent laboratory results or through atomic databases.
Plasma properties are inferred both with empirical techniques and with
photoionisation models within CLOUDY and SPEX. We detect and identify five
narrow radiative recombination continua (Mg XI-XII, Ne IX-X, O VIII) and
several emission lines from Fe, S, Si, Mg, Ne, Al, and Na, including four
He-like triplets (S XV, Si XIII, Mg XI, and Ne IX). Photoionisation models well
reproduce the overall spectrum, except for the near-neutral fluorescence lines
of Fe, S, and Si. We conclude that the plasma is mainly photoionised, but more
than one component is most likely present, consistent with a multi-phase plasma
scenario, where denser and colder clumps of matter are embedded in the hot,
photoionised wind of the companion star. Simulations with the future X-ray
satellites Athena and XRISM show that a few hundred seconds of exposure will be
sufficient to disentangle the lines of the Fe K$\alpha$ doublet and the He-like
Fe XXV, improving, in general, the determination of the plasma parameters.

tuning the relative phase of the magnon pumping and cavity probe tones,
constructive and destructive interferences occur periodically, which strongly
modify both the cavity field transmission spectra and the group delay of light.
Moreover, the tunable amplitude ratio between pump-probe tones allows us to
further improve the signal absorption or amplification, accompanied by either
significantly enhanced optical advance or delay. Both the phase and
amplitude-ratio can be used to realize in-situ tunable and switchable fast-slow

triangular free-fermionic clouds, both trapped harmonically, perfectly explains
the former phenomenon but leaves uninterpreted the nature of the initial

origin, and the 2D-1D correspondence between the solution of [arXiv:2011.01415]

We present observations of the first coronal mass ejection (CME)
observed at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft on April 19, 2020, and the associated
Forbush decrease (FD) measured by its High Energy Telescope (HET). This CME is
a multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods. We
highlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of
the galactic cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The
analytical ForbMod model is applied to the FD measurements to reproduce the
Forbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for the model are derived
from both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The very
slow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the
low-energy cosmic ray measurements at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of
the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor
measurements. Significant differences are observed in the expansion behavior of
the CME at different locations, which may be related to influence of the
following high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions, ForbMod is
able to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from
HET as well as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not
agree with the FD amplitudes at higher energies measured by neutron monitors on
Earth. We study these discrepancies and provide possible explanations.
Conclusions. This study highlights that the novel measurements of the Solar
Orbiter can be coordinated with other spacecraft to improve our understanding
of space weather in the inner heliosphere. Multi-spacecraft observations
combined with data-based modeling are also essential to understand the
propagation and evolution of CMEs as well as their space weather impacts.

The rootfinding problem is thus reformulated as an eigenproblem, making the

practical importance. In this manuscript, we describe an $O(n^2)$ explicit
structured QR algorithm for colleague matrices and prove that it is
componentwise backward stable, in the sense that the backward error in the
colleague matrix can be represented as relative perturbations to its
components. A recent result of Noferini, Robol, and Vandebril shows that
componentwise backward stability implies that the backward error $\delta c$ in
the vector $c$ of Chebyshev expansion coefficients of the polynomial has the
bound $\lVert \delta c \rVert \lesssim \lVert c \rVert u$, where $u$ is machine
precision. Thus, the algorithm we describe has both the optimal backward error

establish the convergence of our method when used with gradient descent and
prove its advantage for label noise in 1d cases. We then validate empirically
our findings for the general case by showing that MW improves neural networks
accuracy in the presence of label noise on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M.
We also show the impact of our approach on adversarial robustness.

the s-wave superconductor in this work. For this, we employ the recently
developed unitary renormalisation group (URG) method on a generalised model of
2D electrons attractive interactions. The effective Hamiltonian obtained at the
stable low-energy fixed point of the RG flow corresponds to a gapped,
insulating state of quantum matter we call the Cooper pair insulator (CPI). We
show that the CPI ground state manifold displays several signatures of
topological order, including a four-fold degeneracy when placed on the torus.
Spectral flow arguments reveal the emergent gauge-theoretic structure of the
effective Hamiltonian, as it can be written entirely in terms of non-local
Wilson loops. It also contains a topological $\theta$-term whose coefficient is
quantised, in keeping with the requirement of invariance of the ground state
under large gauge transformations. We find that the long-ranged many-particle
entanglement content of the CPI ground state is driven by inter-helicity
two-particle scattering processes. Analysis of the passage from CPI to BCS
superconducting ground state shows the RG flow promotes fluctuations in the
number of condensed Cooper pairs and lowers those in the conjugate global
phase. Consequently, the distinct signatures of long-ranged entanglement in the
CPI are replaced by the well-known short-ranged entanglement of the BCS state.
Finally, we study the renormalisation of the entanglement in $k$-space for both
the CPI and BCS ground states. The topologically ordered CPI state is shown to
possess an emergent hierarchy of scales of entanglement, and that this
hierarchy collapses in the BCS state. Our work offers clear evidence for the
microscopic origins of topological order in this prototypical system, and lays
the foundation for similar investigations in other systems of correlated
electrons.

to be effective in various domains, such as board and video games. AlphaGo
represented a significant step forward in our ability to learn complex board
games, and it was rapidly followed by significant advances, such as AlphaGo
Zero and AlphaZero. Recently, MuZero demonstrated that it is possible to master
both Atari games and board games by directly learning a model of the
environment, which is then used with MCTS to decide what move to play in each
position. During tree search, the algorithm simulates games by exploring
several possible moves and then picks the action that corresponds to the most
promising trajectory. When training, limited use is made of these simulated
games since none of their trajectories are directly used as training examples.
Even if we consider that not all trajectories from simulated games are useful,
there are thousands of potentially useful trajectories that are discarded.
Using information from these trajectories would provide more training data,
more quickly, leading to faster convergence and higher sample efficiency.
Recent work introduced an off-policy value target for AlphaZero that uses data
from simulated games. In this work, we propose a way to obtain off-policy
targets using data from simulated games in MuZero. We combine these off-policy
targets with the on-policy targets already used in MuZero in several ways, and
study the impact of these targets and their combinations in three environments
with distinct characteristics. When used in the right combinations, our results
show that these targets can speed up the training process and lead to faster
convergence and higher rewards than the ones obtained by MuZero.

random walks (RWs) on random regular graphs (RRGs) of degree $c \ge 3$ and a
finite size $N$. Starting from a random initial node at time $t=1$, at each
time step $t \ge 2$ an RW hops randomly into one of the $c$ neighbors of its
previous node. In some of the time steps the RW may hop into a yet-unvisited
node while in other time steps it may revisit a node that has already been
visited before. The first time at which the RW enters a node that has already
been visited before is called the first hitting time or the first intersection
length. The first hitting event may take place either by backtracking (BT) to
the previous node or by retracing (RET), namely stepping into a node which has
been visited two or more time steps earlier. We calculate the tail distribution
$P( T_{\rm FH} > t )$ of first hitting (FH) times as well as its mean $\langle
T_{\rm FH} \rangle$ and variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FH})$. We also calculate the
probabilities $P_{\rm BT}$ and $P_{\rm RET}$ that the first hitting event will
occur via the backtracking scenario or via the retracing scenario,
respectively. We show that in dilute networks the dominant first hitting
scenario is backtracking while in dense networks the dominant scenario is
retracing and calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{\rm FH}=t| {\rm
BT})$ and $P(T_{\rm FH}=t| {\rm RET})$, for the two scenarios. The analytical
results are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from computer
simulations. Considering the first hitting event as a termination mechanism of
the RW trajectories, these results provide useful insight into the general
problem of survival analysis and the statistics of mortality rates when two or
more termination scenarios coexist.

Paper submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1925",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measuring the HI-halo mass scaling relation (HIHM) is fundamental to
understanding the role of HI in galaxy formation and its connection to
structure formation. While direct measurements of the HI mass in haloes are
possible using HI-spectral stacking, the reported shape of the relation depends
on the techniques used to measure it (e.g. monotonically increasing with mass
versus flat, mass-independent). Using a simulated HI and optical survey
produced with the SHARK semi-analytic galaxy formation model, we investigate
how well different observational techniques can recover the intrinsic,
theoretically predicted, HIHM relation. We run a galaxy group finder and mimic
the HI stacking procedure adopted by different surveys and find we can
reproduce their observationally derived HIHM relation. However, none of the
adopted techniques recover the underlying HIHM relation predicted by the
simulation. We find that systematic effects in halo mass estimates of galaxy
groups modify the inferred shape of the HIHM relation from the intrinsic one in
the simulation, while contamination by interloping galaxies, not associated
with the groups, contribute to the inferred HI mass of a halo mass bin, when
using large velocity windows for stacking. The effect of contamination is
maximal at Mvir~10^(12-12.5)Msol. Stacking methods based on summing the HI
emission spectra to infer the mean HI mass of galaxies of different properties
belonging to a group suffer minimal contamination but are strongly limited by
the use of optical counterparts, which miss the contribution of dwarf galaxies.
Deep spectroscopic surveys will provide significant improvements by going
deeper while maintaining high spectroscopic completeness; for example, the
WAVES survey will recover ~52% of the total HI mass of the groups with
Mvir~10^(14)Msol compared to ~21% in GAMA.

Generally, a random number generator should be small, robust, utilize as few

a high enough speed (bitrate) for a given purpose. In this work we present a
quantum random number generator (QRNG) which makes use of a photoelectric
effect in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) as a source of randomness and
is scalable to any desired bitrate. We use the random flip-flop method in which
random bits are obtained by periodic sampling of a randomly toggling flip-flop.
For the first time we investigate this method in detail and find that, out of
two main imperfections, bias is due only to hardware imperfections while
autocorrelation predominantly resides with the method itself. SPADs are
integrated on a silicon chip together with passive quenching and digital
pulse-shaping circuitry, using a standard 180 nm CMOS process. A separate FPGA
chip derives random numbers from the detection signals. The basic QRNG cell,
made of only two SPADs and a few logic circuits, can generate up to 20 Mbit/s
that pass NIST statistical tests without any further postprocessing. This

conditions under which the gate conditionally prepares quantum superposition of
two undistorted ""copies"" of an arbitrary input state that occupies a finite
area in phase space. A detailed analysis of the fidelity between the gate
output state and high-quality Schr\""odinger cat state is performed. A clear
interpretation of the output state quantum statistics in terms of Wigner
function in dependence on the gate parameters and measurement outcome is

simultaneous oxidation and reduction, which is essential for waste management

semiconductors and potentially efficient emitters in light emitting devices.
Photons are emitted when strongly bound excitons decay radiatively, and
accurate models of such excitons are important for a full understanding of the
emission. Importantly, photons are emitted in directions uniquely determined by
the exciton center of mass momentum and with lifetimes determined by the
exciton transition matrix element. The exciton band structures of
two-dimensional hexagonal materials, including TMDs, are highly unusual with
coexisting particle- and light-like bands. The latter is non-analytic with
emission selection rules essentially opposite to the particle-like states, but
has been ignored in analyses of TMD light emission so far. In the present work,
we analyse the temperature and angular dependence of light emission from both
exciton species and point out several important consequences of the unique
exciton band structure. Within a first-principles
Density-Functional-Theory+Bethe-Salpeter-Equation framework, we compute exciton
band structures and optical matrix elements for the important TMDs MoS2, MoSe2,
WS2, and WSe2. At low temperature, only the particle-like band is populated and
our results agree with previous work. However, at slightly elevated
temperatures, a significant population of the light-like band leads to modified
angular emission patterns and lifetimes. Clear experimental fingerprints are
predicted and explained by a simple four-state model incorporating spin-orbit
as well as intervalley exchange coupling.

  Rigid Motion Representation and Computation","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strapdown inertial navigation research involves the parameterization and
computation of the attitude, velocity and position of a rigid body in a chosen
reference frame. The community has long devoted to finding the most concise and
efficient representation for the strapdown inertial navigation system (INS).
The current work is motivated by simplifying the existing dual quaternion
representation of the kinematic model. This paper proposes a compact and
elegant representation of the body's attitude, velocity and position, with the
aid of a devised trident quaternion tool in which the position is accounted for
by adding a second imaginary part to the dual quaternion. Eventually, the
kinematics of strapdown INS are cohesively unified in one concise differential
equation, which bears the same form as the classical attitude quaternion
equation. In addition, the computation of this trident quaternion-based
kinematic equation is implemented with the recently proposed functional
iterative integration approach. Numerical results verify the analysis and show
that incorporating the new representation into the functional iterative
integration scheme achieves high inertial navigation computation accuracy as
well.

crucial for providing advanced support in computer-assisted interventions and
autonomous functionalities in robot-assisted surgeries. Prior works have
focused on recognizing either coarse activities, such as phases, or
fine-grained activities, such as gestures. This work aims at jointly
recognizing two complementary levels of granularity directly from videos,
namely phases and steps. Method: We introduce two correlated surgical
activities, phases and steps, for the laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure. We
propose a Multi-task Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTMS-TCN)
along with a multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training setup to
jointly predict the phases and steps and benefit from their complementarity to
better evaluate the execution of the procedure. We evaluate the proposed method
on a large video dataset consisting of 40 surgical procedures (Bypass40).
Results: We present experimental results from several baseline models for both
phase and step recognition on the Bypass40 dataset. The proposed MTMS-TCN
method outperforms in both phase and step recognition by 1-2% in accuracy,
precision and recall, compared to single-task methods. Furthermore, for step
recognition, MTMS-TCN achieves a superior performance of 3-6% compared to LSTM
based models in accuracy, precision, and recall. Conclusion: In this work, we
present a multi-task multi-stage temporal convolutional network for surgical
activity recognition, which shows improved results compared to single-task
models on the Bypass40 gastric bypass dataset with multi-level annotations. The
proposed method shows that the joint modeling of phases and steps is beneficial
to improve the overall recognition of each type of activity.

the L/RQEKF possess much larger convergence region than the traditional EKF
does, although they still require the aid of attitude initialization so as to
avoid large initial attitude errors.

  Applications in Mobile Edge Computing","14 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the fast development of mobile edge computing (MEC), there is an
increasing demand for running complex applications on the edge. These complex
applications can be represented as workflows where task dependencies are
explicitly specified. To achieve better Quality of Service (QoS), for instance,
faster response time and lower energy consumption, computation offloading is
widely used in the MEC environment. However, many existing computation
offloading strategies only focus on independent computation tasks but overlook
the task dependencies. Meanwhile, most of these strategies are based on search
algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA)
which are often time-consuming and hence not suitable for many delay-sensitive
complex applications in MEC. Therefore, a highly efficient graph-based strategy
was proposed in our recent work but it can only deal with simple workflow
applications with linear (namely sequential) structure. For solving these
problems, a novel graph-based strategy is proposed for workflow applications in
MEC. Specifically, this strategy can deal with complex workflow applications
with nonlinear (viz. parallel, selective and iterative) structures. Meanwhile,
the offloading decision plan with the lowest energy consumption of the
end-device under the deadline constraint can be found by using the graph-based
partition technique. We have comprehensively evaluated our strategy using both
a real-world case study on a MEC based UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) delivery
system and extensive simulation experiments on the FogWorkflowSim platform for
MEC based workflow applications. The evaluation results successfully
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy and its overall better
performance than other representative strategies.

induced regularizer in the function space as the minimum $\ell_2$ norm of
weights of a network required to realize a function. For two layer linear
convolutional networks with $C$ output channels and kernel size $K$, we show
the following: (a) If the inputs to the network are single channeled, the
induced regularizer for any $K$ is independent of the number of output channels
$C$. Furthermore, we derive the regularizer is a norm given by a semidefinite
program (SDP). (b) In contrast, for multi-channel inputs, multiple output
channels can be necessary to merely realize all matrix-valued linear functions
and thus the inductive bias does depend on $C$. However, for sufficiently large
$C$, the induced regularizer is again given by an SDP that is independent of
$C$. In particular, the induced regularizer for $K=1$ and $K=D$ (input
dimension) is given in closed form as the nuclear norm and the $\ell_{2,1}$
group-sparse norm, respectively, of the Fourier coefficients of the linear
predictor. We investigate the broader applicability of our theoretical results

fixations made by humans when viewing images. However, the field is lacking a
principled comparison of those models with respect to their predictive power.
In the past, models have usually been evaluated based on comparing human
scanpaths to scanpaths generated from the model. Here, instead we evaluate
models based on how well they predict each fixation in a scanpath given the
previous scanpath history. This makes model evaluation closely aligned with the
biological processes thought to underly scanpath generation and allows to apply
established saliency metrics like AUC and NSS in an intuitive and interpretable
way. We evaluate many existing models of scanpath prediction on the datasets

fail to predict human behaviour. The MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark will
implement the evaluation of scanpath models as detailed here, allowing
researchers to score their models on the established benchmark datasets MIT300

3460 galaxies covering a large range in extinction (up to $A_K$ = 1.15 or
E(B-V) ~ 3.19), we derive a correction factor $f = 0.83 \pm 0.01$ by fitting a
linear regression to the colour-extinction relation, confirming that the
Schlegel et al. maps overestimate the extinction. We argue that the use of only
a small range in extinction (e.g., $A_K$ < 0.4) increases the uncertainty in
the correction factor and may overestimate it. Our data confirms the
Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction law for the J- and K-band. We also tested four
all-sky extinction maps based on Planck satellite data. All maps require a
correction factor as well. In three cases the application of the respective
extinction correction to the galaxy colours results in a reduced scatter in the
colour-extinction relation, indicating a more reliable extinction correction.
Finally, the large galaxy sample allows an analysis of the calibration of the
extinction maps as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude. For all but
one extinction map we find a marked offset between the Galactic Centre and
Anticentre region, but not with the dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Based on our analysis, we recommend the use of the GNILC extinction map by

collected statistics are not sufficient to reflect how informative the feedback
is since fully informative feedback (equal affection of the choices) and fully

uninformative respondents' do not. With this assumption, we propose a new
definition for uninformative feedback and correspondingly design a family of

distinguish informative feedback and uninformative feedback (separation) even

compact models in object detection. Previous KD methods for object detection
mostly focus on imitating deep features within the imitation regions instead of

localization information and trivial improvement. In this paper, by
reformulating the knowledge distillation process on localization, we present a
novel localization distillation (LD) method which can efficiently transfer the

that logit mimicking can outperform feature imitation and localization
knowledge distillation is more important and efficient than semantic knowledge
for distilling object detectors. Our distillation scheme is simple as well as
effective and can be easily applied to different dense object detectors.

as it allows to incorporate human decision-makers in the process. Yet,
abstention can potentially amplify disparities and lead to discriminatory
predictions. The goal of this work is to build a general purpose classification
algorithm, which is able to abstain from prediction, while avoiding disparate
impact. We formalize this problem as risk minimization under fairness and
abstention constraints for which we derive the form of the optimal classifier.
Building on this result, we propose a post-processing classification algorithm,
which is able to modify any off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only
unlabeled sample. We establish finite sample risk, fairness, and abstention
guarantees for the proposed algorithm. In particular, it is shown that fairness
and abstention constraints can be achieved independently from the initial
classifier as long as sufficiently many unlabeled data is available. The risk
guarantee is established in terms of the quality of the initial classifier. Our
post-processing scheme reduces to a sparse linear program allowing for an
efficient implementation, which we provide. Finally, we validate our method
empirically showing that moderate abstention rates allow to bypass the

neutrinos. The recent anomalous excess at few keV electronic recoils observed
by the Xenon1T collaboration might indicate a $\sim 2.2\times10^{-11} \mu_B$
effective neutrino magnetic moment ($\mu_\nu^{eff}$) from solar neutrinos.
Therefore, it is essential to carry out the $\nu$MM searches at a different
experiment to confirm or exclude such hypothesis. We study the feasibility of
doing $\nu$MM measurement with 4 kton active mass at Jinping neutrino
experiment using electron recoil data from both natural and artificial neutrino
sources. The sensitivity of $\mu_\nu^{eff}$ can reach $1.2\times10^{-11}\mu_B$
at 90\% C.L. with 10-year data taking of solar neutrinos. Besides the intrinsic
low energy background $^{14}$C in the liquid scintillator, we find the
sensitivity to $\nu$MM is highly correlated with the systematic uncertainties
of $pp$ and $^{85}$Kr. Reducing systematic uncertainties ($pp$ and $^{85}$Kr)
and the intrinsic background ($^{14}$C and $^{85}$Kr) can help to improve
sensitivities below these levels and reach the region of astrophysical
interest. With a 3 mega-Curie (MCi) artificial neutrino source $^{51}$Cr
installed at Jinping neutrino detector for 55 days, it could give us a
sensitivity to the electron neutrino magnetic moment ($\mu_{\nu_e}$) with
$1.1\times10^{-11} \mu_B$ at 90\% C.L.. With the combination of those two
measurements, the flavor structure of the neutrino magnetic moment can be also

inexpensive and scalable alternative to the Bayesian LASSO introduced in [65].
It also includes a family of priors which more strongly promote sparsity. For
linear models the method requires only the iterative solution of deterministic
least squares problems. Furthermore, for p unknown covariates the method can be
implemented exactly online with a cost of $O(p^3)$ in computation and $O(p^2)$
in memory per iteration -- in other words, the cost per iteration is
independent of n, and in principle infinite data can be considered. For large

tuning are also considered. The method is implemented for real and simulated

framework-supported evaluation factors. Towards filling the gap, we propose an
Open Source Software Project Evaluation and Selection TOol (OSS PESTO).
Targeting OSS on Github, the largest OSS source code host, it facilitates the

present work aims at demonstrating the relevance of Bragg coherent diffraction

of nanometres are modelled with realistic interatomic potentials and relaxed
after introduction of coherent ordered nanoprecipitates. Diffraction patterns
from fundamental and superstructure reflections are calculated in the kinematic

inversion. We first tackle the case of single nanoprecipitates and show that
the strain field distribution from the ordered phase is retrieved very

smart contract platforms practical by improving their scalability, latency, and
privacy. This thesis starts by presenting the design and implementation of
Chainspace, a distributed ledger that supports user defined smart contracts and
execute user-supplied transactions on their objects. The correct execution of
smart contract transactions is publicly verifiable. Chainspace is scalable by
sharding state; it is secure against subsets of nodes trying to compromise its
integrity or availability properties through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).
This thesis also introduces a family of replay attacks against sharded
distributed ledgers targeting cross-shard consensus protocols; they allow an
attacker, with network access only, to double-spend resources with minimal
efforts. We then build Byzcuit, a new cross-shard consensus protocol that is
immune to those attacks and that is tailored to run at the heart of Chainspace.
Next, we propose FastPay, a high-integrity settlement system for pre-funded
payments that can be used as a financial side-infrastructure for Chainspace to
support low-latency retail payments. This settlement system is based on
Byzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of
full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has extremely
low-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Finally, this thesis
proposes Coconut, a selective disclosure credential scheme supporting
distributed threshold issuance, public and private attributes,
re-randomization, and multiple unlinkable selective attribute revelations. It
ensures authenticity and availability even when a subset of credential issuing
authorities are malicious or offline, and natively integrates with Chainspace
to enable a number of scalable privacy-preserving applications.

ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To fulfill these constraints
with computationally constrained receivers, such as low-budget IoT receivers,
optimal transmission parameters need to be studied in detail. In this paper, we
introduce a multi-objective optimization framework for the optimal design of
URLLC in the presence of decoding complexity constraints. We consider
transmission of short-blocklength codewords that are encoded with linear block
encoders, transmitted over a binary-input AWGN channel, and finally decoded
with order-statistics (OS) decoder. We investigate the optimal selection of a
transmission rate and power pair, while satisfying the constraints. For this
purpose, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated. Based on
the empirical model that accurately quantifies the trade-off between the
performance of an OS decoder and its computational complexity, the MOOP is
solved and the Pareto boundary is derived. In order to assess the overall
performance among several Pareto-optimal transmission pairs, two scalarization
methods are investigated. To exemplify the importance of the MOOP, a case study
on a battery-powered communication system is provided. It is shown that,
compared to the classical fixed rate-power transmissions, the MOOP provides the
optimum usage of the battery and increases the energy efficiency of the
communication system while maintaining the constraints.

employed to describe the hadronic phase, while the quark phase is described by
the same bag model as the one used in the QMC framework, so as to keep
consistency between the two coexisting phases. We analyze the effect of the
appearance of hadron-quark pasta phases on the neutron-star properties. We also
discuss the influence of nuclear symmetry energy and the bag constant B in
quark matter on the deconfinement phase transition. For the treatment of the
hadron-quark mixed phase, we use the energy minimization method and compare it
with the Gibbs construction. The finite-size effects like surface and Coulomb
energies are taken into account in the energy minimization method; they play
crucial roles in determining the pasta configuration during the hadron-quark
phase transition. It is found that the finite-size effects can significantly
reduce the region of the mixed phase relative to that of the Gibbs
construction. Using a consistent value of B in the QMC model and quark matter,
we find that hadron-quark pasta phases are formed in the interior of massive
stars, but no pure quark matter can exist.

Graphfool, a novel targeted label adversarial attack on graph embedding. It can
generate adversarial graph to attack graph embedding methods via classifying
boundary and gradient information in graph convolutional network (GCN).
Specifically, we perform the following steps: 1),We first estimate the
classification boundaries of different classes. 2), We calculate the minimal
perturbation matrix to misclassify the attacked vertex according to the target
classification boundary. 3), We modify the adjacency matrix according to the
maximal absolute value of the disturbance matrix. This process is implemented
iteratively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first targeted label

Graphfool can derive better performance than state-of-art techniques. Compared

  Ombao","Smooth Online Parameter Estimation for time varying VAR models with
  application to rat's LFP data",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate time series data appear often as realizations of non-stationary
processes where the covariance matrix or spectral matrix smoothly evolve over
time. Most of the current approaches estimate the time-varying spectral
properties only retrospectively - that is, after the entire data has been
observed. Retrospective estimation is a major limitation in many adaptive
control applications where it is important to estimate these properties and
detect changes in the system as they happen in real-time. One major obstacle in
online estimation is the computational cost due to the high-dimensionality of
the parameters. Existing methods such as the Kalman filter or local least
squares are feasible. However, they are not always suitable because they
provide noisy estimates and can become prohibitively costly as the dimension of
the time series increases. In our brain signal application, it is critical to
develop a robust method that can estimate, in real-time, the properties of the
underlying stochastic process, in particular, the spectral brain connectivity
measures. For these reasons we propose a new smooth online parameter estimation
approach (SOPE) that has the ability to control for the smoothness of the
estimates with a reasonable computational complexity. Consequently, the models
are fit in real-time even for high dimensional time series. We demonstrate that
our proposed SOPE approach is as good as the Kalman filter in terms of
mean-squared error for small dimensions. However, unlike the Kalman filter, the
SOPE has lower computational cost and hence scalable for higher dimensions.
Finally, we apply the SOPE method to a rat's local field potential data during
a hippocampus-dependent sequence-memory task. As demonstrated in the video, the
proposed SOPE method is able to capture the dynamics of the connectivity as the
rat performs the sequence of non-spatial working memory tasks.

holes. In the aspect of thermodynamics, we analyse the Hawking temperature, the
entropy, and the specific heat, and verify the existence of second-order phase

we find that the quasinormal modes of minimally coupled scalar field
perturbations are dependent on scale factors. Quite interesting is that the
behavior of quasinormal mode frequencies also supports the independence of
scale factors for the second-order phase transitions. Our results show that the
scale factors produce distinct thermodynamic and dynamic effects in the

randomly ""puncturing"" both the data matrix $X\in\mathbb{C}^{p\times n}$ (or
$\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$) and its corresponding kernel (Gram) matrix $K$
through Bernoulli masks: $S\in\{0,1\}^{p\times n}$ for $X$ and
$B\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ for $K$. The resulting ""two-way punctured"" kernel is
thus given by $K=\frac{1}{p}[(X \odot S)^{\sf H} (X \odot S)] \odot B$. We
demonstrate that, for $X$ composed of independent columns drawn from a Gaussian
mixture model, as $n,p\to\infty$ with $p/n\to c_0\in(0,\infty)$, the spectral
behavior of $K$ -- its limiting eigenvalue distribution, as well as its
isolated eigenvalues and eigenvectors -- is fully tractable and exhibits a
series of counter-intuitive phenomena. We notably prove, and empirically
confirm on GAN-generated image databases, that it is possible to drastically
puncture the data, thereby providing possibly huge computational and storage
gains, for a virtually constant (clustering of PCA) performance. This
preliminary study opens as such the path towards rethinking, from a large

already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in mass
vaccination campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became
crucial to control the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports
from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters
of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity
levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be
time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios,
where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021.
To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented
whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset
threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable
accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality,
hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was
under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination
was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated
model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention
measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its
potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the
hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases,
hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination
beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each
city.

statistical guarantees, DS leads to theoretically sound asymptotically
converging consistent estimators of the underlying density function. Density
sketches also have many appealing properties making them ideal for large-scale
distributed applications. DS construction is an online algorithm. The sketches
are additive, i.e., the sum of two sketches is the sketch of the combined data.
These properties allow data to be collected from distributed sources,
compressed into a density sketch, efficiently transmitted in the sketch form to

between cooperative and competitive behaviour in mixed environments. Unlike
cooperative environments where agents strive towards a common goal, mixed
environments are notorious for the conflicts of selfish and social interests.
As a consequence, purely rational agents often struggle to achieve and maintain
cooperation. A prevalent approach to induce cooperative behaviour is to assign
additional rewards based on other agents' well-being. However, this approach
suffers from the issue of multi-agent credit assignment, which can hinder
performance. This issue is efficiently alleviated in cooperative setting with
such state-of-the-art algorithms as QMIX and COMA. Still, when applied to mixed
environments, these algorithms may result in unfair allocation of rewards. We
propose BAROCCO, an extension of these algorithms capable to balance individual
and social incentives. The mechanism behind BAROCCO is to train two distinct
but interwoven components that jointly affect each agent's decisions. Our
meta-algorithm is compatible with both Q-learning and Actor-Critic frameworks.
We experimentally confirm the advantages over the existing methods and explore

Inspired by the traditional apprenticeship model, in which surgical training is

  organizations",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We focus on how individual behavior that complies with social norms
interferes with performance-based incentive mechanisms in organizations with
multiple distributed decision-making agents. We model social norms to emerge
from interactions between agents: agents observe other the agents' actions and,
from these observations, induce what kind of behavior is socially acceptable.
By complying with the induced socially accepted behavior, agents experience
utility. Also, agents get utility from a pay-for-performance incentive
mechanism. Thus, agents pursue two objectives. We place the interaction between
social norms and performance-based incentive mechanisms in the complex
environment of an organization with distributed decision-makers, in which a set
of interdependent tasks is allocated to multiple agents. The results suggest
that, unless the sets of assigned tasks are highly correlated, complying with
emergent socially accepted behavior is detrimental to the organization's
performance. However, we find that incentive schemes can help offset the
performance loss by applying individual-based incentives in environments with
lower task-complexity and team-based incentives in environments with higher
task-complexity.

years, data-driven neural network priors have shown promising performance for
RGB natural image denoising. Compared to classic handcrafted priors (e.g.,
sparsity and total variation), the ""deep priors"" are learned using a large
number of training samples -- which can accurately model the complex image
generating process. However, data-driven priors are hard to acquire for
hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the lack of training data. A remedy is to
use the so-called unsupervised deep image prior (DIP). Under the unsupervised
DIP framework, it is hypothesized and empirically demonstrated that proper
neural network structures are reasonable priors of certain types of images, and
the network weights can be learned without training data. Nonetheless, the most
effective unsupervised DIP structures were proposed for natural images instead
of HSIs. The performance of unsupervised DIP-based HSI denoising is limited by
a couple of serious challenges, namely, network structure design and network
complexity. This work puts forth an unsupervised DIP framework that is based on
the classic spatio-spectral decomposition of HSIs. Utilizing the so-called
linear mixture model of HSIs, two types of unsupervised DIPs, i.e., U-Net-like
network and fully-connected networks, are employed to model the abundance maps
and endmembers contained in the HSIs, respectively. This way, empirically
validated unsupervised DIP structures for natural images can be easily
incorporated for HSI denoising. Besides, the decomposition also substantially
reduces network complexity. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm is
proposed to handle the formulated denoising problem. Semi-real and real data
experiments are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

as multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). Given a graph, agents, their initial
locations, and destinations, a solution of MAPF is a set of paths without
collisions. Iterative refinement for MAPF is desirable for three reasons:
1)~optimization is intractable, 2)~sub-optimal solutions can be obtained
instantly, and 3)~it is anytime planning, desired in online scenarios where
time for deliberation is limited. Despite the high demand, this is
under-explored in MAPF because finding good neighborhoods has been unclear so
far. Our proposal uses a sub-optimal MAPF solver to obtain an initial solution
quickly, then iterates the two procedures: 1)~select a subset of agents, 2)~use
an optimal MAPF solver to refine paths of selected agents while keeping other
paths unchanged. Since the optimal solvers are used on small instances of the
problem, this scheme yields efficient-enough solutions rapidly while providing
high scalability. We also present reasonable candidates on how to select a
subset of agents. Evaluations in various scenarios show that the proposal is
promising; the convergence is fast, scalable, and with reasonable quality.

analysis of the frequency dynamics of the droop controlled grid-forming
inverter and the synchronous generator illuminates the inverted active
power-frequency relationship and the frequency response order reduction,
forming the basis for novel, non-linear frequency droop control approaches.
Device-level electromagnetic transient domain simulations corroborate the
order-reduction findings, establish that a properly designed DC-side system has
a negligible dynamical impact on active power transfer and will not impede
frequency regulation, and confirm the frequency response improvement with
non-linear control. Simulations of the 9- and 39-bus test systems validate the
order reduction and associated decoupling of the nadir and rate of change of
frequency in large networks. The primary system oscillatory mode confirms the
correlation between high shares of grid-forming inverters and increased mode
frequency and damping; a sharp decrease in damping is observed at shares above
80%, whether by grid-forming device quantity in large networks or rating
variations in a small test system. Finally, simulation results on the Hawaiian

crucial for our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this
context, it has been recently proposed that stellar clustering might be the key
in shaping the orbital architecture of exoplanets. The main goal of this work
is to explore the factors that shape the orbits of planets. We used a
homogeneous sample of relatively young FGK dwarf stars with RV detected planets
and tested the hypothesis that their association to phase space
(position-velocity) over-densities ('cluster' stars) and under-densities
('field' stars) impacts the orbital periods of planets. When controlling for
the host star properties, on a sample of 52 planets orbiting around 'cluster'
stars and 15 planets orbiting around 'field' star, we found no significant
difference in the period distribution of planets orbiting these two populations
of stars. By considering an extended sample of 73 planets orbiting around
'cluster' stars and 25 planets orbiting 'field' stars, a significant different
in the planetary period distributions emerged. However, the hosts associated to
stellar under-densities appeared to be significantly older than their 'cluster'
counterparts. This did not allow us to conclude whether the planetary
architecture is related to age, environment, or both. We further studied a
sample of planets orbiting 'cluster' stars to study the mechanism responsible
for the shaping of orbits of planets in similar environments. We could not
identify a parameter that can unambiguously be responsible for the orbital
architecture of massive planets, perhaps, indicating the complexity of the
issue. Conclusions. Increased number of planets in clusters and in over-density
environments will help to build large and unbiased samples which will then
allow to better understand the dominant processes shaping the orbits of
planets.

generalize to environments whose distributions differ from the ones used at
training time. Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly,
attempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with
the target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments
to reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor.
However, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data
representation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose
invariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e.,
nonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a
practical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e.,
a set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the
environment belongs to general exponential family distributions. Based on this,
we show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple
transformations. We also prove that all direct causes of the target can be
fully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees
in the nonlinear setting. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline
methods. Finally, in the discussion, we further explore the aforementioned
assumption and propose a more general hypothesis, called the Agnostic
Hypothesis: there exist a set of hidden causal factors affecting both inputs
and outcomes. The Agnostic Hypothesis can provide a unifying view of machine
learning. More importantly, it can inspire a new direction to explore a general
theory for identifying hidden causal factors, which is key to enabling the OOD
generalization guarantees.

with fixed asymptotic boundary conditions. We discuss this problem with the
help of the tensionless string on $\mathcal{M}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times
\mathbb{T}^4$ (with one unit of NS-NS flux) that was recently understood to be
dual to the symmetric orbifold $\text{Sym}^N(\mathbb{T}^4)$. We strengthen the
analysis of arXiv:2008.07533 and show that the perturbative string partition
function around a fixed bulk background already includes a sum over
semi-classical geometries and large stringy corrections can be interpreted as
various semi-classical geometries. We argue in particular that the string
partition function on a Euclidean wormhole geometry factorizes completely into
factors associated to the two boundaries of spacetime. Central to this is the
remarkable property of the moduli space integral of string theory to localize
on covering spaces of the conformal boundary of $\mathcal{M}_3$. We also
emphasize the fact that string perturbation theory computes the grand canonical
partition function of the family of theories
$\bigoplus_N\text{Sym}^N(\mathbb{T}^4)$. The boundary partition function is
naturally expressed as a sum over winding worldsheets, each of which we
interpret as a `stringy geometry'. We argue that the semi-classical bulk
geometry can be understood as a condensate of such stringy geometries. We also
briefly discuss the effect of ensemble averaging over the Narain moduli space
of $\mathbb{T}^4$ and of deforming away from the orbifold by the marginal
deformation.

artificial intelligence (AI) model distributively at edge devices to leverage
their data while preserving their data privacy. The execution of a power-hungry
learning task at energy-constrained devices is a key challenge confronting the
implementation of FEEL. To tackle the challenge, we propose the solution of
powering devices using wireless power transfer (WPT). To derive guidelines on
deploying the resultant wirelessly powered FEEL (WP-FEEL) system, this work
aims at the derivation of the tradeoff between the model convergence and the
settings of power sources in two scenarios: 1) the transmission power and
density of power-beacons (dedicated charging stations) if they are deployed, or
otherwise 2) the transmission power of a server (access-point). The development
of the proposed analytical framework relates the accuracy of distributed
stochastic gradient estimation to the WPT settings, the randomness in both
communication and WPT links, and devices' computation capacities. Furthermore,
the local-computation at devices (i.e., mini-batch size and processor clock
frequency) is optimized to efficiently use the harvested energy for gradient
estimation. The resultant learning-WPT tradeoffs reveal the simple scaling laws
of the model-convergence rate with respect to the transferred energy as well as
the devices' computational energy efficiencies. The results provide useful
guidelines on WPT provisioning to provide a guaranteer on learning performance.

Content-aware recommendation addresses this issue by incorporating content
information about the songs on top of collaborative filtering. However, methods
falling in this category rely on a shallow user/item interaction that
originates from a matrix factorization framework. In this work, we introduce
neural content-aware collaborative filtering, a unified framework which
alleviates these limits, and extends the recently introduced neural
collaborative filtering to its content-aware counterpart. We propose a
generative model which leverages deep learning for both extracting content
information from low-level acoustic features and for modeling the interaction

either directly predict the item embedding, or serve as a regularization prior,

consideration first- (Eckart) and second-order (Israel-Stewart) theories for
the relativistic cosmic fluid and integrated viscous equations of state in

obtained as analytical solutions. For Israel-Stewart, the differential
equations are very sophisticated to be solved. They are outlined here as
road-maps for future studies. For Eckart theory, the only possible solution is
the functionality, $H(a(t))$, where $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter and $a(t)$
is the scale factor, but none of them so far could to be directly expressed in
terms of either proper or cosmic time $t$. For Eckart-type viscous background,
especially at finite cosmological constant, non-singular $H(t)$ and $a(t)$ are
obtained, where $H(t)$ diverges for QCD/EW and asymptotic EoS. For non-viscous
background, the dependence of $H(a(t))$ is monotonic. The same conclusion can
be drawn for an ideal EoS. We also conclude that the rate of decreasing
$H(a(t))$ with increasing $a(t)$ varies from epoch to epoch, at vanishing and
finite cosmological constant. These results obviously help in improving our
understanding of the nucleosynthesis and the cosmological large-scale

unsuited for real-time imaging applications. In this work, we develop and
demonstrate a discriminative deep learning (DL) approach to separate electrical
noise from optoacoustic signals prior to image reconstruction. The proposed DL
algorithm is based on two key features. First, it learns spatiotemporal
correlations in both noise and signal by using the entire optoacoustic sinogram
as input. Second, it employs training based on a large dataset of
experimentally acquired pure noise and synthetic optoacoustic signals. We
validated the ability of the trained model to accurately remove electrical
noise on synthetic data and on optoacoustic images of a phantom and the human

optoacoustic images reaching 19% higher blood vessel contrast and localized

as difficult optimization problems, which may suffer from bad local minima and
high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a deep NMF (DNMF)
topic modeling framework to alleviate the aforementioned problems. It first
applies an unsupervised deep learning method to learn latent hierarchical
structures of documents, under the assumption that if we could learn a good
representation of documents by, e.g. a deep model, then the topic word
discovery problem can be boosted. Then, it takes the output of the deep model
to constrain a topic-document distribution for the discovery of the
discriminant topic words, which not only improves the efficacy but also reduces
the computational complexity over conventional unsupervised NMF methods. We
constrain the topic-document distribution in three ways, which takes the
advantages of the three major sub-categories of NMF -- basic NMF, structured
NMF, and constrained NMF respectively. To overcome the weaknesses of deep
neural networks in unsupervised topic modeling, we adopt a non-neural-network
deep model -- multilayer bootstrap network. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that a deep NMF model is used for unsupervised topic modeling. We have

develop a deep-learning model for IDH prediction in GBM by using Convoluted
Neural Networks (CNN) on multiparametric MRI. Methods: We included 100 adult
patients with pathologically proven GBM and IDH testing. MRI data included:
morphologic sequences, rCBV and ADC maps. Tumor area was obtained by a bounding
box function on the axial slice with widest tumor extension on T2 images and
was projected on every sequence. Data was split into training and test (80:20)
sets. A 4 block 2D - CNN architecture was implemented for IDH prediction on
every MRI sequence. IDH mutation probability was calculated with softmax
activation function from the last dense layer. Highest performance was
calculated accounting for model accuracy and categorical cross-entropy loss
(CCEL) in the test cohort. Results: Our model achieved the following
performance: T1 (accuracy 77%, CCEL 1.4), T2 (accuracy 67%, CCEL 2.41), FLAIR

accuracy of 83% with rCBV maps. High predictivity of perfusion images may
reflect the known correlation between IDH, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and
neoangiogenesis. This model may set a path for non-invasive evaluation of IDH

disease or characteristic phenotype. The variations come in many types and it
is a challenge, not only determining the variations accurately, but also
conducting the downstream statistical and analytical procedure. Method:
Structural variations, SVs, with size 1 base-pair to 1000s of base-pairs with
their precise breakpoints and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, were
determined for members of a family. The genome was assembled using optimal
metrics of ABySS and SOAPdenovo assembly tools using paired-end DNA sequence.
Results: An interesting discovery was the mitochondrial DNA could have paternal
leakage of inheritance or that the mutations could be high from maternal
inheritance. It is also discovered that the mitochondrial DNA is less prone to
SVs re-arrangements than SNPs, which propose better standards for determining
ancestry and divergence between races and species over a long-time frame. Sex
determination of an individual is found to be strongly confirmed using calls of
nucleotide bases of SVs to the Y chromosome, more strongly determined than
SNPs. We note that in general there is a larger variance -and thus the standard
deviation, in the sum of SVs nucleotide compared to sum of SNPs of an
individual when compared to reference sequence, and thus SVs serve as a
stronger means to characterize an individual for a given trait or phenotype or
to determine sex. The SVs and SNPs in HLA loci would also serve as a medical
transformation method for determining the success of an organ transplant for a
patient, and predisposition to diseases apriori.

using a power-law, is a \emph{non-integer power model} (or \emph{fractional
power model (FPM)}). Such a model, in non-integer power of time, namely $t^m$
up to constants, enables representing at each day, with a good precision, the
totality of the contaminated individuals. Despite being enriched with knowledge
through an internal structure based on a geometric sequence ""with variable
ratio"", the model (in its non-integer representation) has only three
parameters, among which the non-integer power, $m$, that determines on its own,
according to its value, an aggravation or an improvement of the viral
spreading. Its simplicity comes from the power-law, $t^m$, which simply
expresses the singular dynamics of the operator of non-integer differentiation
or integration, of high parametric compactness, that governs diffusion
phenomena and, as shown in this paper, the spreading phenomena by
contamination. The proposed model is indeed validated with the official data of
Ministry of Health on the COVID-19 spreading. Used in prediction, it well
enables justifying the choice of a lockdown, without which the spreading would
have highly worsened. The comparison of this model in $t^m$ with two known
models having the same number of parameters, well shows that its
representativity of the real data is better or more general. Finally, in a more
fundamental context and particularly in terms of complexity and simplicity, a
self-filtering action enables showing the compatibility between the
\emph{internal complexity} that the internal structure and its stochastic
behavior present, and the \emph{global simplicity} that the model in $t^m$
offers in a deterministic manner: it is true that the non-integer power of a
power-law is well a marker of complexity.

increasing attention in the machine learning and data mining community over the

using polysomnography. There is a need in general medicine and critical care
for a more convenient method to automatically detect sleep apnea from a simple,

(n = 412) dataset serving as ground truth. Methods: Simultaneously recorded
polysomnographic (PSG) and wearable respiratory effort data were used to train
and evaluate models in a cross-validation fashion. Time domain and complexity
features were extracted, important features were identified, and a random
forest model employed to detect events and predict AHI. Four models were
trained: one each using the respiratory features only, a feature from the SpO2
(%)-signal only, and two additional models that use the respiratory features
and the SpO2 (%)-feature, one allowing a time lag of 30 seconds between the two
signals. Results: Event-based classification resulted in areas under the
receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.94, 0.86, 0.82, and areas under
the precision-recall curves of 0.48, 0.32, 0.51 for the models using

between expert-labelled and predicted AHI was 0.96, 0.78, and 0.93,

SpO2 predicted AHI accurately. Given the large dataset and rigorous testing
design, we expect our models are generalizable to evaluating respiration in a
variety of environments, such as at home and in critical care.

emphasis on their optimization. Nevertheless, in view of highly diverse source
code and hardware, compilers still struggle to produce optimal target code. The
sheer number of possible loop optimizations, including their combinations,
exacerbates the problem further. Today's compilers use hard-coded heuristics to
decide when, whether, and which of a limited set of optimizations to apply.
Often, this leads to highly unstable behavior, making the success of compiler
optimizations dependent on the precise way a loop has been written. This paper
presents LoopLearner, which addresses the problem of compiler instability by
predicting which way of writing a loop will lead to efficient compiled code. To
this end, we train a neural network to find semantically invariant source-level
transformations for loops that help the compiler generate more efficient code.
Our model learns to extract useful features from the raw source code and
predicts the speedup that a given transformation is likely to yield. We
evaluate LoopLearner with 1,895 loops from various performance-relevant
benchmarks. Applying the transformations that our model deems most favorable
prior to compilation yields an average speedup of 1.14x. When trying the top-3
suggested transformations, the average speedup even increases to 1.29x.
Comparing the approach with an exhaustive search through all available code
transformations shows that LoopLearner helps to identify the most beneficial
transformations in several orders of magnitude less time.

factors that motivate the adoption of new innovative technology by agribusiness
enterprises are underexplored. The literature has indicated ICT adoption among

Nevertheless, this study addresses this gap by investigating the adoption of
ICT among small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia. The paper reports
the use of the Technology, Organization, Environment (TOE) framework. An online
survey has been conducted with random sampling for data collection, with 107
respondents. The respondents are from agribusiness staff and farmers from
various agricultural companies in Somalia. After quantitative data analysis,
the results indicated that relative advantage, complexity, top management
support, and competitive pressure factors are significant contributors to ICT
adoption in Somalian agribusiness enterprises, while ICT costs and vendor
support are not significantly related to the adoption of ICT in agricultural
business. This study concludes that ICT adoption in Somalia is inspired by
insight and motivation rather than financial and external support.
Understanding these factors leads to a better understanding of ICT adoption in

of smal sites of interest on the Moon's surface, creating risks of crowding and
interference at these locations. The Moon presents finite and scarce areas with
rare topography or concentrations of resources of special value. Locations of
interest to science, notably for astronomy, include the Peaks of Eternal Light,
the coldest of the cold traps and smooth areas on the far side. Regions richest
in physical resources could also be uniquely suited to settlement and commerce.
Such sites of interest are both few and small. Typically, there are fewer than
ten key sites of each type, each site spanning a few kilometres across. We
survey the implications for different kins of mission and find that the diverse
actors pursuing incomptible ends at these sites could soon crowd and interfere
with each other, leaving almost all actors worse off. Without proactive
measures to prevent these outcomes, lunar actors are likely to experience
significant losses of opportunity. We highlight the legal, policy, and ethical
ramifications. Insights from research on comparable sites on Earth present a
path toward managing lunar crowding and interference grounded in ethical and
practical near-term considerations. This article is part of a discussion
meeting issue 'Astronomy from the Moon: the next decades'.

  Devices",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Directional radio beams are used in the mm-Wave band to combat the high path
loss. The mm-Wave band also suffers from high penetration losses from drywall,
wood, glass, concrete, etc., and also the human body. Hence, as a mobile user
moves, the Line of Sight (LoS) path between the mobile and the Base Station
(BS) can be blocked by objects interposed in the path, causing loss of the
link. A mobile with a lost link will need to be re-acquired as a new user by
initial access, a process that can take up to a second, causing disruptions to
applications. UNBLOCK is a protocol that allows a mobile to recover from
transient blockages, such as those caused by a human hand or another human
walking into the line of path or other temporary occlusions by objects, which
typically disappear within the order of $100$ ms, without having to go through
re-acquisition. UNBLOCK is based on extensive experimentation in office type
environments which has shown that while a LoS path is blocked, there typically
exists a Non-LoS path, i.e., a reflected path through scatterers, with a loss
within about $10$ dB of the LoS path. UNBLOCK proactively keeps such a NLoS
path in reserve, to be used when blockage happens, typically without any
warning. UNBLOCK uses this NLoS path to maintain time-synchronization with the
BS until the blockage disappears, as well as to search for a better NLoS path
if available. When the transient blockage disappears, it reestablishes LoS
communication at the epochs that have been scheduled by the BS for
communication with the mobile.

  Perspectives",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Demand-side response programs which also called Demand Response (DR) are
interesting ways to attract consumers' participation in order to improve
electric consumption patterns. DR programs motivate customers to change
consumption patterns in response to price changes. This could be done by paying
incentives or considering penalties either when wholesale market prices are
high or when network reliability is at risk. The overall purpose of
implementing DR programs is to improve reliability of the networks, while
reducing the operation costs. Successful implementation of these DR programs
requires prerequisites, which without them, there is no guarantee of success.
Different disciplines have provided various scientific solutions for creating
optimal power consumption behavior in customers (such as utilizing intelligent
home appliances and big data techniques). Although each of these solutions
might be efficient and effective, they could not cover all the aspects of the
solutions. The results of studies conducted by many researchers show that in
addition to the technical and economic issues, social, cultural, and behavioral
factors are of great importance in DR implementation. Therefore, in this paper,
these aspects, as one of the vital requirements for better implementation of
DR, are investigated and analyzed in detail.
