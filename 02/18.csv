eigenvalue distribution of the product matrix. Finally, we consider the
opposite regime where $L$ is fixed with respect to $N$, known as the regime of
weak non-orthogonality. In this case each matrix in the product is very close
to an orthogonal matrix. We show that $\mathbb{E}(N^{(m)}_{\mathbb{R}}) \sim
c_{L,m}\,\log(N)$ as $N \to \infty$ and compute the constant $c_{L,m}$

gravitational wave sources with the current and future gravitational-wave
detectors, assuming a simple phenomenological model of evolving non-axisymmetry
of the rotating neutron star.
  Methods. We employ a numerical model of the Galactic neutron star population,
with the properties established by comparison with radio observations of
isolated Galactic pulsars. We generate an arbitrarily large synthetic
population of neutron stars and evolve their period, magnetic field, and
position in space. We use a gravitational wave emission model based on
exponentially decaying ellipticity - a non-axisymmetry of the star, with no
assumption of the origin of a given ellipticity. We calculate the expected
signal in a given detector for a 1 year observations and assume a detection
criterion of the signal-to-noise ratio of 11.4 - comparable to a targeted
continous wave search. We analyze the population detectable separately in each
detector: Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and the planned Einstein Telescope. In
the calculation of the expected signal we neglect signals frequency change due
to the source spindown and the Earth motion with respect to the Solar
barycentre.
  Results. With conservative values for the neutron stars evolution: supernova
rate once per 100 years, initial ellipticity $\epsilon_{0}$ = 1e-5 with no
decay of the ellipticity $\eta$ = $t_\rm{hub}$ = 1e4 Myr, the expected number
of detected neutron stars is below one: 0.15 (based on a simulation of 10 M
stars) for the Advanced LIGO detector. A broader study of the parameter space
($\epsilon_{0}$ , $\eta$) is presented. With the planned sensitivity for the
Einstein Telescope, and assuming the same ellipiticity model, the expected
detection number is: 26.4 pulsars during a 1-year long observing run.

can subsequently either retract to form a single droplet, or break up to form a
primary droplet and one or more satellite droplets. These satellite droplets
are undesirable since they degrade the quality and reproducibility of the
print. Existing strategies for the suppression of satellite droplet formation
include, among others, adding viscoelasticity to the ink. In the present work,
we aim to improve the understanding of the role of viscoelasticity in
suppressing satellite droplets in inkjet printing. We demonstrate that very
dilute viscoelastic aqueous solutions (concentrations $\sim$ 0.003\% wt.
polyethylene oxide (PEO), corresponding to nozzle Deborah number $De_{n}$
$\sim$ 3) can suppress satellite droplet formation. Furthermore, we show that,
for a given driving condition, upper and lower bounds of polymer concentration
exist, within which satellite droplets are suppressed. Satellite droplets are
formed at concentrations below the lower bound, while jetting ceases for
concentrations above the upper bound (for fixed driving conditions). Moreover,
we observe that, with concentrations in between the two bounds, the filaments
retract at velocities larger than the corresponding Taylor-Culick velocity for
the Newtonian case. We show that this enhanced retraction velocity can be
attributed to the elastic tension due to polymer stretching, which builds up
during the initial jetting phase. These results shed some light on the complex
interplay between inertia, capillarity, and viscoelasticity for retracting
liquid filaments, which is important for the stability and quality of inkjet
printing of polymer solutions.

Leakage (ASL), with the purpose of modeling neutrino-driven winds in neutron
star mergers. Based on a number of snapshots we gauge the ASL parameters by
comparing against both the two-moment (M1) scheme implemented in the FLASH code
and the Monte Carlo neutrino code Sedonu. The ASL scheme contains three
parameters, the least robust of which results to be a blocking parameter for
electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The parameter steering the angular
distribution of neutrino heating is re-calibrated compared to the earlier work.
We also present a new, fast and mesh-free algorithm for calculating spectral
optical depths, which, when using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), makes
the neutrino transport completely particle-based. We estimate a speed-up of a
factor of 100 in the optical depth calculation when comparing to a grid-based
approach. In the suggested calibration we recover luminosities and mean
energies within 25%. A comparison of the rates of change of internal energy and
electron fraction in the neutrino-driven wind suggests comparable accuracies of
ASL and M1, but a higher computational efficiency of the ASL scheme. We
estimate that the ratio between the CPU hours spent on the ASL neutrino scheme
and those spent on the hydrodynamics is 0.8 per timestep when considering the
SPH code MAGMA2 as source code for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics, to be compared
with a factor of 10 from the M1 in FLASH.

subsolutions of the equation: $-Au+cu=0$ in $D$, for a wide class of L\'evy
type integro-differential operators $A$, bounded and measurable function
$c:D\to[0,+\infty)$ and domain $D\subset \BR^d$. More precisely, we prove that
if {\em the strong maximum principle} (SMP) holds for $A$, then there exists a
Borel function $\psi:D\to(0,+\infty)$, depending only on the coefficients of
the operator $A$, $c$ and $D$ such that for any subsolution $u(\cdot)$ one can
find a constant $a>0$ (that in general depends on $u$), for which $\sup_{y\in
{\rm cl}D\cup {\cal S}(D)}u(y)-u(x)\ge a\psi(x)$, $x\in D$. Here ${\rm cl}D$ is
the closure of $D$. The set ${\cal S}(D)$ - called the range of non-locality of
$A$ over $D$ - is determined by the support of the Levy jump measure associated
with $A$. This type of a result we call the {\em generalized Hopf lemma}. It
turns out that the irreducibility property of the resolvent of $A$ implies the
SMP. The converse also holds, provided we assume some additional (rather weak)
assumption on the resolvent. For some classes of operators we can admit the
constant $a$ to be equal to $ \sup_{y\in {\rm cl}D\cup {\cal S}(D)}u(y)$. We
call this type of a result a {\em quantitative version} of the Hopf lemma.
Finally, we formulate a necessary and sufficient condition on $A$ - expressed
in terms of ergodic properties of its resolvent - which ensures that the lower
bound $\psi\in {\rm span}(\varphi_D)$, where $\varphi_D$ is a non-negative
eigenfunction of $A$ in $D$. We show that the aforementioned ergodic property
is implied by the intrinsic ultracontractivity of the semigroup associated with

consequence is that the Zakharov WKB approximation to Euler-Maxwell is unstable

the set of resonant frequencies as the locus of weak hyperbolicity for
linearized equations around the WKB solution. We analyze those linearized
equations with the symbolic flow method. Due to large transverse variations in
the WKB profile, the equation satisfied by the symbolic flow around resonant
frequencies is a linear {\it partial} differential equation. At space-time
resonances corresponding to Raman instabilities, we observe a fast growth of
the symbolic flow, which translates into an instability result for the original

  SimFaaS is open-source, well-documented, and publicly available, making it
easily usable and extendable to incorporate more use case scenarios in the
future. Besides, it provides performance engineers with a set of tools that can
calculate several characteristics of serverless platform internal states, which
is otherwise hard (mostly impossible) to extract from real platforms. We show
how SimFaaS facilitates the prediction of essential performance metrics such as
average response time, probability of cold start, and the average number of
instances reflecting the infrastructure cost incurred by the serverless
computing provider. We evaluate the accuracy and applicability of SimFaaS by
comparing the prediction results with real-world traces from Amazon AWS Lambda.

the computational complexity of the NP-hard problem Gerrymandering over Graphs

validate the analytical model of Hu & Kravtsov 2003 for the covariance matrix,
which takes into account both sources of statistical error. Then, we use such

study the impact of the cosmology dependence of the covariance matrix on the

scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields at all orders in black hole
spin. We use the unambiguous and gauge-invariant definition of Love numbers and
their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs as Wilson coefficients of the point particle
effective field theory. This definition also allows one to clearly distinguish
between conservative and dissipative response contributions. We demonstrate
that the behavior of Kerr black holes responses to spin-0 and spin-1 fields is
very similar to that of the spin-2 perturbations. In particular, static
conservative responses vanish identically for spinning black holes. This
implies that vanishing Love numbers are a generic property of black holes in

is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing metrics, which
were tailored solely to the image synthesis setup, exhibit a limited capacity
for diagnosing the different modes of failure of generative models across
broader application domains. In this paper, we introduce a 3-dimensional
evaluation metric, ($\alpha$-Precision, $\beta$-Recall, Authenticity), that
characterizes the fidelity, diversity and generalization performance of any
generative model in a domain-agnostic fashion. Our metric unifies statistical
divergence measures with precision-recall analysis, enabling sample- and
distribution-level diagnoses of model fidelity and diversity. We introduce
generalization as an additional, independent dimension (to the
fidelity-diversity trade-off) that quantifies the extent to which a model
copies training data -- a crucial performance indicator when modeling sensitive
data with requirements on privacy. The three metric components correspond to
(interpretable) probabilistic quantities, and are estimated via sample-level
binary classification. The sample-level nature of our metric inspires a novel
use case which we call model auditing, wherein we judge the quality of
individual samples generated by a (black-box) model, discarding low-quality
samples and hence improving the overall model performance in a post-hoc manner.

disks, while FRIs are powered by Advected Dominated Accretion Flows. The
sources with an efficient engine are optically classified as High Excitation
Radio Galaxies (HERGs) and those with an inefficient motor as Low Excitation
Radio Galaxies (LERGs). Recently, the study of Radio Galaxies down to mJy
fluxes has cast serious doubts on the LERG-FRI and HERG-FRII correspondence,
revealing that many LERGs show FRII radio morphologies. The FR catalogs
recently compiled by Capetti et al. (2017a,b) and Baldi et al. (2018) have
allowed us to explore this issue in the local ($z\le 0.15$) mJy Universe. Our
statistical study shows that the majority of nearby mJy objects are in a late
stage of their life. FRII-LERGs appear more similar to the old FRI-LERGs than
to the young FRII-HERGs. FRII-LERGs may be aged HERGs that, exhausted the cold
fuel, have changed their accretion regime or a separate LERG class particularly
efficient in launching jets. Exploiting the empirical relations which convert
L$_{\rm [OIII]}$ and L$_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$ into accretion power and jet kinetic
power, respectively, we observed that LERGs with similar masses and accretion
rates seem to expel jets of different power. We speculate that intrinsic
differences related to the black hole properties (spin and magnetic field at
its horizon) can determine the observed spread in jet luminosity. In this view,
FRII-LERGs should have the fastest spinning black holes and/or the most intense
magnetic fluxes. On the contrary, compact LERGs (i.e. FR0s) should host

fake news has been spreading even faster than the facts. During times such as

tweets. Additionally, we propose Cross-SEAN, a cross-stitch based
semi-supervised end-to-end neural attention model, which leverages the large
amount of unlabelled data. Cross-SEAN partially generalises to emerging fake
news as it learns from relevant external knowledge. We compare Cross-SEAN with
seven state-of-the-art fake news detection methods. We observe that it achieves
$0.95$ F1 Score on CTF, outperforming the best baseline by $9\%$. We also
develop Chrome-SEAN, a Cross-SEAN based chrome extension for real-time

investigate cortical representations of objects or constructs. While avoiding
ill-posed matrix inversions that plague multivariate approaches in the presence
of many outcome variables, it suffers from the confound arising from the
non-orthogonality of the design matrix. Here, a partial correlation approach
will be explored to adjust for this source of bias by partialling out this
confound in the context of the searchlight method for functional imaging
datasets. A formal analysis will show the existence of a dependency of this
confound on the temporal correlation model of the sequential observations,
motivating a data-driven approach that avoids the problem of misspecification
of this model. However, where the autocorrelation locally diverges from its
volume estimate, bias may be difficult to control for exactly, given the
difficulties of estimating the precise form of the confound at each voxel.
Application to real data shows the effectiveness of the partial correlation
approach, suggesting the impact of local bias to be minor. However, where the
control for bias locally fails, possible spurious associations with the
similarity matrix of the stimuli may emerge. This limitation may be intrinsic
to RSA applied to non-orthogonal designs. The software implementing the
approach is made publicly available

the eponymous blazar of BL Lac objects class, complicate the scenario in this
already puzzling class of objects. Understanding the jet geometry, in
connection with the jet kinematics and the physical conditions in the
surrounding medium, is fundamental to better constrain the formation,
acceleration and collimation mechanisms in extragalactic jets. With the aim of
investigating the jet geometry in the innermost regions of the jet of BL Lac,
and solving the controversy, we explore the radio jet in this source, using
high resolution millimeter-wave VLBI data. We collect 86GHz GMVA and 43GHz VLBA
data to obtain stacked images that we use to infer the jet collimation profile
by means of two comparable methods. We analyze the kinematics at 86GHz, and we
discuss it in the context of the jet expansion. Finally we consider a possible
implication of the Bondi sphere in shaping the different expanding region
observed along the jet. We found that the jet in BL Lac expands with an overall
conical geometry. A higher expanding rate region is observed between ~5 and 10
pc (de-projected) from the black hole. Such a region is associated with the
decrease in brightness usually observed in high-frequency VLBI images of BL
Lac. The jet retrieves the original jet expansion around 17 pc, where the
presence of a recollimation shock is supported by both the jet profile and the
15GHz kinematics (MOJAVE survey). The change in the jet expansion profile
occurring at ~5 pc could be associated with a change in the external pressure
profile in correspondence of the Bondi radius (~3.3X10$^5$$R_s$).

this quantity usually assume that, when expressed in a certain form, it depends
only on the mass variance of the linear density field. However, cosmological
simulations have revealed that this assumption breaks, leading to 10-20%
systematic effects. In this paper we employ a specially-designed suite of
simulations to further investigate this problem. Specifically, we carry out
cosmological N-body simulations where we systematically vary growth history at
a fixed linear density field, or vary the power spectrum shape at a fixed
growth history. We show that the halo mass function generically depends on
these quantities, thus showing a clear signal of non-universality. Most of this
effect can be traced back to the way in which the same linear fluctuation grows
differently into the nonlinear regime depending on details of its assembly
history. With these results, we propose a parameterization with explicit
dependence on the linear growth rate and power spectrum shape. Using an
independent suite of simulations, we show that this fitting function accurately
captures the mass function of haloes over cosmologies spanning a vast parameter
space, including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. Finally, we
employ this tool to improve the accuracy of so-called cosmology-rescaling
methods and show they can deliver 2% accurate predictions for the halo mass
function over the whole range of currently viable cosmologies.

are chosen to contribute radiation in the model as external, seed photons to
the external-Compton process, considering the observed $\gamma$-ray radiation.

that realistic, highly-variable accretion histories allow for a much greater

thermally relaxed objects, which may provide a significant source of radiative

atomic-cooling halos may impose a narrow spectrum of masses on the seeds of the
first massive quasars, however further studies incorporating realistic feedback
will be essential in order to confirm whether or not this holds true in all

separated from a trivial phase by an unavoidable quantum phase transition. This
can be overly restrictive, leaving out scenarios of practical relevance --
similar to the distinction between liquid water and vapor. Indeed, we show that
topological phenomena can be stable over a large part of parameter space even
when the bulk is strictly speaking in a trivial phase of matter. In particular,
we focus on symmetry-protected topological phases which can be trivialized by
extending the symmetry group. The topological Haldane phase in spin chains
serves as a paradigmatic example where the $SO(3)$ symmetry is extended to
$SU(2)$ by tuning away from the Mott limit. Although the Haldane phase is then
adiabatically connected to a product state, we show that characteristic
phenomena -- edge modes, entanglement degeneracies and bulk phase transitions
-- remain parametrically stable. This stability is due to a separation of
energy scales, characterized by quantized invariants which are well-defined
when a subgroup of the symmetry only acts on high-energy degrees of freedom.
The low-energy symmetry group is a quotient group whose emergent anomalies
stabilize edge modes and unnecessary criticality, which can occur in any
dimension.

remote compact astrophysical sources. To describe such GWs properly, we
introduce three scales, $\lambda, \; L_c$ and $L$, denoting, respectively, the
typical wavelength of GWs, the scale of the cosmological perturbations, and the
size of the observable universe. For GWs to be detected by the current and
foreseeable detectors, the condition $\lambda \ll L_c \ll L$ holds, and such
GWs can be well approximated as high-frequency GWs. In order for the
backreaction of the GWs to the background to be negligible, we must assume that
$\left|h_{\mu\nu}\right| \ll 1$, in addition to the condition $\epsilon \ll 1$,
which are also the conditions for the linearized Einstein field equations for
$h_{\mu\nu}$ to be valid, where $g_{\mu\nu} = \gamma_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon
h_{\mu\nu}$, and $\gamma_{\mu\nu}$ denotes the background. To simplify the
field equations, we show that the spatial, traceless, and Lorentz gauge
conditions can be imposed simultaneously, even when the background is not
vacuum, as long as the high-frequency GW approximation is valid. However, to
develop the formulas that can be applicable to as many cases as possible, we
first write down explicitly the linearized Einstein field equations by imposing
only the spatial gauge. Applying the general formulas together with the
geometrical optics approximation to such GWs, we find that they still move
along null geodesics and its polarization bi-vector is parallel-transported,
even when both the cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations are present. In
addition, we also calculate the gravitational integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects,
whereby the dependences of the amplitude, phase and luminosity distance of the
GWs on these two kinds of perturbations are read out explicitly.

substantially in the next few years. The statistical combination of large
samples of lenses has the potential of providing strong constraints on the
inner structure of galaxies. Aims: We investigate to what extent we can
calibrate stellar mass measurements and constrain the average dark matter
density profile of galaxies by statistically combining strong lensing data from
thousands of lenses. Methods: We generate mock samples of axisymmetric lenses.
We assume that, for each lens, we have measurements of two image positions of a
strongly lensed background source, as well as magnification information from
full surface brightness modelling, and a stellar population synthesis-based
estimate of the lens stellar mass. We then fit models describing the
distribution of the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter
$\alpha_{sps}$ (the ratio between the true stellar mass and the stellar
population synthesis-based estimate) and dark matter density profile of the
population of lenses to an ensemble of 1000 mock lenses. Results: The average
$\alpha_{sps}$, projected dark matter mass and dark matter density slope can be
obtained with great precision and accuracy, compared with current constraints.
A flexible model and the knowledge of the lens detection efficiency as a
function of image configuration are required in order to avoid a biased
inference. Conclusions: Statistical strong lensing inferences from upcoming
surveys have the potential to calibrate stellar mass measurements and to
constrain the inner dark matter density profile of massive galaxies.

  under a Convergence of Average Probability",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive experiments, including efficient average treatment effect estimation
and multi-armed bandit algorithms, have garnered attention in various
applications, such as social experiments, clinical trials, and online
advertisement optimization. This paper considers estimating the mean outcome of
an action from samples obtained in adaptive experiments. In causal inference,
the mean outcome of an action has a crucial role, and the estimation is an
essential task, where the average treatment effect estimation and off-policy
value estimation are its variants. In adaptive experiments, the probability of
choosing an action (logging policy) is allowed to be sequentially updated based
on past observations. Due to this logging policy depending on the past
observations, the samples are often not independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), making developing an asymptotically normal estimator difficult. A
typical approach for this problem is to assume that the logging policy
converges in a time-invariant function. However, this assumption is restrictive
in various applications, such as when the logging policy fluctuates or becomes
zero at some periods. To mitigate this limitation, we propose another
assumption that the average logging policy converges to a time-invariant
function and show the doubly robust (DR) estimator's asymptotic normality.
Under the assumption, the logging policy itself can fluctuate or be zero for
some actions. We also show the empirical properties by simulations.

locations of D-branes. In the past, it was argued that this simple 'emergent
space' picture cannot be used in the context of gauge/gravity duality, because
the ground-state wave function delocalizes at large $N$, leading to a conflict
with the locality in the bulk geometry. In this paper we show that this
conventional wisdom is not correct: the ground-state wave function does not
delocalize, and there is no conflict with the locality of the bulk geometry.
This conclusion is obtained by clarifying the meaning of the 'diagonalization
of a matrix' in Yang-Mills theory, which is not as obvious as one might think.
This observation opens up the prospect of characterizing the bulk geometry via
the color degrees of freedom in Yang-Mills theory, all the way down to the
center of the bulk.

In this work, a novel technique to authenticate PLCs is proposed that aims at
raising the bar against powerful attackers while being compatible with
real-time systems. The proposed technique captures timing information for each
controller in a non-invasive manner. It is argued that Scan Cycle is a unique
feature of a PLC that can be approximated passively by observing network
traffic. An attacker that spoofs commands issued by the PLCs would deviate from
such fingerprints. To detect replay attacks a PLC Watermarking technique is
proposed. PLC Watermarking models the relationship between the scan cycle and
the control logic by modeling the input/output as a function of
request/response messages of a PLC. The proposed technique is validated on an
operational water treatment plant (SWaT) and smart grid (EPIC) testbed. Results
from experiments indicate that PLCs can be distinguished based on their scan

operation of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar systems since RFI can severely degrade
the radar imaging capability and target detection performance. In this paper,
we address the RFI mitigation problem for one-bit UWB radar systems. A one-bit
UWB system obtains its signed measurements via a low-cost and high rate
sampling scheme, referred to as the Continuous Time Binary Value (CTBV)
technology. This sampling strategy compares the signal to a known threshold
varying with slow-time and therefore can be used to achieve a rather high
sampling rate and quantization resolution with rather simple and affordable
hardware. This paper establishes a proper data model for the RFI sources and
proposes a novel RFI mitigation method for the one-bit UWB radar system that
uses the CTBV sampling technique. Specifically, we first model the RFI sources
as a sum of sinusoids with frequencies fixed during the coherent processing
interval (CPI) and we exploit the sparsity of the RFI spectrum. We extend a
majorization-minimization based 1bRELAX algorithm, referred to as 1bMMRELAX, to
estimate the RFI source parameters from the signed measurements obtained by
using the CTBV sampling strategy. We also devise a new fast frequency
initialization method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM) methodology for the extended 1bMMRELAX algorithm to significantly
improve its computational efficiency. Moreover, an ADMM-based sparse method is
introduced to recover the desired radar echoes using the estimated RFI
parameters. Both simulated and experimental results are presented to
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing digital
integration method, especially for severe RFI cases.

is restricted to length scales smaller than their de Broglie wavelength. The
experimental realization of this effect has had wide ranging impact in diverse
fields of physics and facilitated the development of new technologies. In
semiconductor physics, quantum confinement of optically excited quasiparticles,
such as excitons or trions, is typically achieved by modulation of material
properties - an approach crucially limited by the lack of insitu tunability and
scalability of confining potentials. Achieving fully tunable quantum
confinement of optical excitations has therefore been an outstanding goal in
quantum photonics. Here, we demonstrate electrically controlled quantum
confinement of neutral excitons in a gate-defined monolayer p-i-n diode. A
combination of dc Stark shift induced by large in-plane fields and a previously
unknown confining mechanism based on repulsive interaction between excitons and
free charges ensures tight exciton confinement in the narrow neutral region.
Quantization of exciton motion manifests in multiple discrete, spectrally
narrow, voltage-dependent optical resonances that emerge below the free exciton
resonance. Our measurements reveal several unique physical features of these
quantum confined excitons, including an in-plane dipolar character,
one-dimensional center-of-mass confinement, and strikingly enhanced exciton
size in the presence of magnetic fields. Our method provides an experimental
route towards creating scalable arrays of identical single photon sources,
which will constitute building blocks of strongly correlated photonic systems.

span of each individual in the population is modelled by an exponential
distribution with parameter $\alpha$; and the disease spreads within the
population is modelled by a Poisson process with a rate $\lambda_{I}$.

bottleneck in the domain adaptation problem. This paper addresses this
challenging scenario by proposing a domain adaptation technique that does not
need any source data. Instead of the source data, we are only provided with a
classifier that is trained on the source data. Our proposed approach is based
on a generative framework, where the trained classifier is used for generating
samples from the source classes. We learn the joint distribution of data by
using the energy-based modeling of the trained classifier. At the same time, a
new classifier is also adapted for the target domain. We perform various
ablation analysis under different experimental setups and demonstrate that the

galaxy surveys in recent years since these features can assist in understanding
the nature of inflation. The null detection to date suggests that any such
features should be fairly weak, and next-generation galaxy surveys, with their
unprecedented sizes and precisions, are in a position to place stronger
constraints than before. However, even if such primordial features once existed
in the early Universe, they would have been significantly damped in the
nonlinear regime at low redshift due to structure formation, which makes them
difficult to be directly detected in real observations. A potential way to
tackle this challenge for probing the features is to undo the cosmological
evolution, i.e., using reconstruction to obtain an approximate linear density
field. By employing a set of N-body simulations, here we show that a
recently-proposed nonlinear reconstruction algorithm can effectively retrieve
damped oscillatory features from halo catalogues and improve the accuracy of
the measurement of feature parameters (assuming that such primordial features
do exist). We do a Fisher analysis to forecast how nonlinear reconstruction
affects the constraining power, and find that it can lead to significantly more
robust constraints on the feature amplitude for a DESI-like survey. Comparing
nonlinear reconstruction with other ways of improving constraints, such as
increasing the survey volume and range of scales, this shows that it is
possible to achieve what the latter do, but at a lower cost.

balance in the shock front region, but with different assumptions about local
equilibrium. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to
simulate a thermal blast in a one-component gas consisting of particles
interacting with the Lennard-Jones/spline potential. This provided data for the
theoretical analysis. Two cases were studied, a weak shock with Mach number $M
\approx 2$ and a strong shock with $M \approx 6$ and with a Prandtl number of
the gas $Pr \approx 1.4$ in both cases. The four theoretical methods gave
consistent results for the time-dependent surface excess entropy production for
both Mach numbers. The internal energy was found to deviate only slightly from
equilibrium values in the shock front. The pressure profile was found to be
consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations. The entropy production in the weak
and strong shocks were approximately proportional to the square of the Mach
number and decayed with time at approximately the same relative rate. In both
cases, some 97 \% of the total entropy production in the gas occurred in the
shock wave. The GEM showed that most of the shock's kinetic energy was
converted reversibly into enthalpy and entropy, and a small amount was
dissipated as produced entropy. The shock waves traveled at almost constant

process with increments given by a quadratic form of a fast Gaussian process.
We find that the rate function which describes sample-path large deviations for
such a process can be computed from the large domain size asymptotic of a
certain Fredholm determinant. The latter can be evaluated analytically using a
theorem of Widom which generalizes the celebrated Szeg\H{o}-Kac formula to the
multi-dimensional case. This provides a large class of random dynamical systems
with time scale separation for which an explicit sample-path large deviation
functional can be found. Inspired by problems in hydrodynamics and atmosphere
dynamics, we construct a simple example with a single slow degree of freedom
driven by the square of a fast multi-variate Gaussian process and analyse its
large deviations functional using our general results. Even though the
noiseless limit of this example has a single fixed point, the corresponding
large deviations effective potential has multiple fixed points. In other words,
it is the addition of noise that leads to metastability. We use the explicit
answers for the rate function to construct instanton trajectories connecting
the metastable states.

We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for

Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the
station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound
deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM), are
trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data
of SantaBarbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as
output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which
is an ensemble model of Convolutional NeuralNetwork LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is
trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to
the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry
yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation
for five weeks ahead forecasts.Finally, the forecasts of these two models are
ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing
a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is
found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance
by 5% compared to its best performing component model but also outperforms the
Deep Learning (DL) ensemble model found in literature by 33% for forecasting

synchronization-free algorithms, e.g. HOGWILD!, have received interest in
certain contexts, due to reduced overhead compared to synchronous
parallelization. Despite that they induce staleness and inconsistency, they
have shown speedup for problems satisfying smooth, strongly convex targets, and
gradient sparsity. Recent works take important steps towards understanding the
potential of parallel SGD for problems not conforming to these strong
assumptions, in particular for deep learning (DL). There is however a gap in
current literature in understanding when AsyncSGD algorithms are useful in
practice, and in particular how mechanisms for synchronization and consistency
play a role. We focus on the impact of consistency-preserving non-blocking
synchronization in SGD convergence, and in sensitivity to hyper-parameter
tuning. We propose Leashed-SGD, an extensible algorithmic framework of
consistency-preserving implementations of AsyncSGD, employing lock-free
synchronization, effectively balancing throughput and latency. We argue
analytically about the dynamics of the algorithms, memory consumption, the
threads' progress over time, and the expected contention. We provide a
comprehensive empirical evaluation, validating the analytical claims,
benchmarking the proposed Leashed-SGD framework, and comparing to baselines for
training multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
We observe the crucial impact of contention, staleness and consistency and show
how Leashed-SGD provides significant improvements in stability as well as
wall-clock time to convergence (from 20-80% up to 4x improvements) compared to
the standard lock-based AsyncSGD algorithm and HOGWILD!, while reducing the

Catalog of Galactic HII Regions to examine the form of the LF at multiple
infrared and radio wavelengths. Our sample is statistically complete for all
regions powered by single stars of type O9.5V and earlier. We fit the LF at
each wavelength with single and double power laws. Averaging the results from
all wavelengths, the mean of the best-fit single power law index is
$\langle\alpha\rangle=-1.75\,\pm\,0.01$. The mean best-fit double power law
indices are $\langle\alpha_1\rangle=-1.40\,\pm\,0.03$ and
$\langle\alpha_2\rangle=-2.33\,\pm\,0.04$. We conclude that neither a single

variation when we separate the HII region sample into subsets by heliocentric
distance, physical size, Galactocentric radius, and location relative to the
spiral arms, but blending individual HII regions into larger complexes does not
change the value of the power law indices of the best-fit LF models. The
consistency of the power law indices across multiple wavelengths suggests that
the LF is independent of wavelength. This implies that infrared and radio
tracers can be employed in place of H$\alpha$.

unclear. A potential mechanism comes from assuming that cell-substrate traction
forces persist over some time scale: with large enough persistence time,
collective cell packs emerge. To test this hypothesis, we measured the velocity
and net traction of each cell. The data showed that in addition to having some
temporal persistence, tractions were spatially correlated, suggesting that
cells coordinate with their neighbors to apply tractions in the same direction.
Chemical inhibitors and activators of actomyosin contraction were used to
determine effects of altering the traction persistence and alignment. Numerical
simulations based on the self-propelled Voronoi model, augmented to include
both traction persistence and alignment and calibrated against the experimental
data, matched the experimentally measured pack size. The model identified that
if there were no alignment of traction between neighboring cells, the size of
the collective pack would be substantially smaller than observed in the
experiments. Hence, combining experiments and a simple mechanical model, this
study confirms the long-standing assumption of traction persistence and adds
the notion of traction alignment between neighbors. Together, persistence and
alignment are two factors controlling the size of a collectively moving cell

membrane domains, forming structures such as the post-synaptic density and
diverse signaling clusters. Here we examine the physics of these surface
densities, employing minimal simulations of co-acervating polymers coupled to
an Ising membrane surface in conjunction with a complementary Landau theory. We
argue that these surface densities are a novel phase reminiscent of
pre-wetting, in which a molecularly thin three-dimensional liquid forms on a
usually solid surface. However, in surface densities the solid surface is
replaced by a membrane with an independent propensity to phase separate. We
show that proximity to criticality in the membrane dramatically increases the
parameter regime in which a pre-wetting-like transition occurs, leading to a
broad region where coexisting surface phases can form even when a bulk phase is
unstable. Our simulations naturally exhibit three surface phase coexistence
even though both the membrane and the polymer bulk can only display two phase
coexistence on their own. We argue that the physics of these surface densities
enables diverse functions seen in Eukaryotic cells.

the single-phase supercooled Stefan problem for the heat equation. To address
this conjecture, we extend the probabilistic formulation from [10] to multiple
space dimensions. We then show that the equation that characterizes the growth
rate of the solid phase in the supercooled Stefan problem is satisfied by the
scaling limit of the external MDLA process with an inequality, which can be
strict in general. In the course of the proof, we establish two additional
results interesting in their own right: (i) the stability of a ""crossing
property"" of planar Brownian motion and (ii) a rigorous connection between the
probabilistic solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem and its classical and
weak solutions.

opinion polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest, incorrectly predicted the
winning candidate. One leading explanation for this polling miss is that the
precipitous decline in traditional polling response rates led to greater
reliance on statistical methods to adjust for the corresponding bias -- and
that these methods failed to adjust for important interactions between key
variables like education, race, and geographic region. Finding calibration
weights that account for important interactions remains challenging with
traditional survey methods: raking typically balances the margins alone, while
post-stratification, which exactly balances all interactions, is only feasible
for a small number of variables. In this paper, we propose multilevel
calibration weighting, which enforces tight balance constraints for marginal
balance and looser constraints for higher-order interactions. This incorporates
some of the benefits of post-stratification while retaining the guarantees of
raking. We then correct for the bias due to the relaxed constraints via a
flexible outcome model; we call this approach Double Regression with
Post-stratification (DRP). We characterize the asymptotic properties of these
estimators and show that the proposed calibration approach has a dual
representation as a multilevel model for survey response. We then use these
tools to to re-assess a large-scale survey of voter intention in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, finding meaningful gains from the proposed methods. The
approach is available in the multical R package.

Nevertheless, systems engineering provides concepts which support decision
making in such situations. Complex socio-technical systems such as smart cities

preceding formal peer review. Since the launch of arXiv in 1991, preprints have
been increasingly distributed over the Internet as opposed to paper copies. It
allows open online access to disseminate the original research within a few
days, often at a very low operating cost. This work overviews how preprint has
been evolving and impacting the research community over the past thirty years
alongside the growth of the Web. In this work, we first report that the number
of preprints has exponentially increased 63 times in 30 years, although it only
accounts for 4% of research articles. Second, we quantify the benefits that
preprints bring to authors: preprints reach an audience 14 months earlier on
average and associate with five times more citations compared with a
non-preprint counterpart. Last, to address the quality concern of preprints, we
discover that 41% of preprints are ultimately published at a peer-reviewed
destination, and the published venues are as influential as papers without a
preprint version. Additionally, we discuss the unprecedented role of preprints
in communicating the latest research data during recent public health
emergencies. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence to unveil the
positive impact of preprints on individual researchers and the community.
Preprints make scholarly communication more efficient by disseminating
scientific discoveries more rapidly and widely with the aid of Web
technologies. The measurements we present in this study can help researchers
and policymakers make informed decisions about how to effectively use and
responsibly embrace a preprint culture.

unprecedented precision since 2016, recently reporting a non-hydrostatic
component in the tidal response of the planet. At the mid-mission perijove 17,
Juno registered a Love number $k_2=0.565\pm0.006$ that is $-4\pm1\%$
($1\sigma$) from the theoretical hydrostatic $k_2^{(hs)}=0.590$. Here we assess
whether the aforementioned departure of tides from hydrostatic equilibrium
represents the neglected gravitational contribution of dynamical tides. We
employ perturbation theory and simple tidal models to calculate a fractional
dynamical correction $\Delta k_2$ to the well-known hydrostatic $k_2$.
Exploiting the analytical simplicity of a toy uniform-density model, we show
how the Coriolis acceleration motivates the negative sign in the $\Delta k_2$
observed by Juno. By simplifying Jupiter's interior into a core-less,
fully-convective, and chemically-homogeneous body, we calculate $\Delta k_2$ in
a model following an $n=1$ polytrope equation of state. Our numerical results
for the $n=1$ polytrope qualitatively follow the behaviour of the
uniform-density model, mostly because the main component of the tidal flow is
similar in each case. Our results indicate that the gravitational effect of the
Io-induced dynamical tide leads to $\Delta k_2=-4\pm1\%$, in agreement with the
non-hydrostatic component reported by Juno. Consequently, our results suggest
that Juno obtained the first unambiguous detection of the gravitational effect
of dynamical tides in a gas giant planet. These results facilitate a future
interpretation of Juno tidal gravity data with the purpose of elucidating the
existence of a dilute core in Jupiter.

challenging problem when the sequence does not follow a consistent, fixed

explore how grid cell-based path integration in a cortical network can support
reliable recognition of objects given an arbitrary sequence of inputs. Our
network (GridCellNet) uses grid cell computations to integrate visual
information and make predictions based on movements. We use local Hebbian
plasticity rules to learn rapidly from a handful of examples (few-shot
learning), and consider the task of recognizing MNIST digits given only a
sequence of image feature patches. We compare GridCellNet to k-Nearest
Neighbour (k-NN) classifiers as well as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), both
of which lack explicit mechanisms for handling arbitrary sequences of input
samples. We show that GridCellNet can reliably perform classification,
generalizing to both unseen examples and completely novel sequence
trajectories. We further show that inference is often successful after sampling
a fraction of the input space, enabling the predictive GridCellNet to
reconstruct the rest of the image given just a few movements. We propose that
dynamically moving agents with active sensors can use grid cell representations
not only for navigation, but also for efficient recognition and feature
prediction of seen objects.

most of the models of dark matter (DM). Conventionally, the issue is resolved
by taking the temperature as a constant, and the chemical potential and the
mass density as position-dependent variables. In this paper, to close the
under-determined set of equations, we remove the mass density using
observations and leave the temperature and the chemical potential as
position-dependent variables. We analyze observations of the mass profiles of
175 late-type galaxies in the Spitzer Photometry \& Accurate Rotation Curves
(SPARC) database as well as 26 late-type dwarfs in the Little Things database,
to construct the temperature profile of their DM halos by assuming that (1) DM
in the halos obeys either the Fermi-Dirac or the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, and (2) the halos are in the virial state. We derive the
dispersion velocity of DM at the center of the halos and show that its
correlation with the halo's total mass is consistent with the direct
observations of visible matter. Taking the latter agreement as a validation of
our analysis, we derive the mass to the temperature of DM at the edge of the
halos and show that it is galaxy independent and is equal to
$m/T_{R_{200}}\simeq 10^{10}$ in natural units. In the thermal models of DM,
such universal temperature is inherently assumed. In this paper, we derive the
universal temperature from observations without imposing it by assumptions.
Therefore, $T_{R_{200}}$ in the above ratio can be expressed in terms of the
temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at the time of DM
decoupling. This result is used to study possible cosmological scenarios. We
show that observations are at odds with (1) non-thermal DM, (2) hot DM, and (3)
collision-less cold DM. If DM is warm, we estimate its mass to be in the range
of keV--MeV.

great deal of recent attention. A major drawback of the standard robust
learning framework is there is an artificial robustness radius $r$ that applies
to all inputs. This ignores the fact that data may be highly heterogeneous, in
which case it is plausible that robustness regions should be larger in some
regions of data, and smaller in others. In this paper, we address this
limitation by proposing a new limit classifier, called the neighborhood optimal
classifier, that extends the Bayes optimal classifier outside its support by
using the label of the closest in-support point. We then argue that this
classifier maximizes the size of its robustness regions subject to the
constraint of having accuracy equal to the Bayes optimal. We then present
sufficient conditions under which general non-parametric methods that can be

complementary focus on theory is required if the discipline is to mature. A
first step in theory-building involves the establishment of suitable
theoretical constructs. For researchers studying software projects, the lack of
a theoretical construct for context is problematic for both experimentation and
effort estimation. For experiments, insufficiently understood contextual
factors confound results, and for estimation, unstated contextual factors
affect estimation reliability. We have earlier proposed a framework that we
suggest may be suitable as a construct for context i.e. represents a minimal,
spanning set for the space of software contexts. The framework has six
dimensions, described as Who, Where, What, When, How and Why. In this paper, we
report the outcomes of a pilot study to test its suitability by categorising
contextual factors from the software engineering literature into the framework.
We found that one of the dimensions, Why, does not represent context, but
rather is associated with objectives. We also identified some factors that do
not clearly fit into the framework and require further investigation. Our
contributions are the pursuing of a theoretical approach to understanding
software context, the initial establishment and evaluation of a construct for
context and the exposure of a lack of clarity of meaning in many 'contexts'
currently applied as factors for estimating project outcomes.

  As a first step towards measuring news informedness at a scale, we study the

survey users about their knowledge of recent news. In particular, we formulate
the problem as two sequence-to-sequence tasks: question-answer generation (QAG)

applying large pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder models, namely PEGASUS

  We show that our models outperform strong baselines using both automated
metrics and human raters. We provide a case study of running weekly quizzes on

modeling of fluid-structure interaction. Using the discretized Navier-Stokes in
the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian reference frame, we generate the full-order
flow snapshots and point cloud displacements as target data for the learning
and inference of fluid-structure dynamics. The hybrid operation of this
methodology comes by combining two data-driven models for fluid and solid
subdomains via deep learning-based reduced-order models (DL-ROMs). The proposed
framework comprises the partitioned data-driven drivers for unsteady flow and
the moving point cloud displacements. At the fluid-structure interface, the
force information is exchanged between the two partitioned subdomain solvers.
The first component of our framework relies on the proper orthogonal
decomposition-based recurrent neural network (POD-RNN) as a DL-ROM procedure to
infer the point cloud with a moving interface. This model utilizes the POD
basis modes to reduce dimensionality and evolve them in time via RNN. The
second component employs the convolution-based recurrent autoencoder network
(CRAN) as a self-supervised DL-ROM procedure to infer the nonlinear flow
dynamics at static Eulerian probes. We introduce these probes as spatially
structured query nodes in the moving point cloud to treat the
Lagrangian-to-Eulerian conflict together with convenience in training the CRAN
driver. To determine these Eulerian probes, we construct a novel snapshot-field
transfer and load recovery algorithm. A popular prototypical fluid-structure
interaction problem of flow past a freely oscillating cylinder is considered to
assess the efficacy of the proposed methodology for a different set of reduced
velocities. The proposed framework tracks the interface description with
acceptable accuracy and predicts the nonlinear wake dynamics over the chosen
test data range.

find that while the random disorder acts to the detriment of superconductivity,
hybridization proceeds favoring it. Accordingly, hybridization plays an
important role in two-band models of superconductivity, in order to hold the
long-range order against the increase of disorder. This makes the present model
eligible to describe real materials, since the hybridization may be induced by
pressure or doping. In addition, the regime from moderate to strong disorder,
reveals that the system is broken into superconductor islands with correlated
local order parameters. These correlations persist to distances of several
order lattice spacing which corresponds to the size of the SC-Islands.

nonlinear dynamics of vesicles in large amplitude oscillatory extensional
(LAOE) flows using both experiments and boundary integral (BI) simulations. Our
results characterize the transient membrane deformations, dynamical regimes,
and stress response of vesicles in LAOE in terms of reduced volume (vesicle
asphericity), capillary number ($\Ca$, dimensionless flow strength), and
Deborah number ($\De$, dimensionless flow frequency). Results from single
vesicle experiments are found to be in good agreement with BI simulations
across a wide range of parameters. Our results reveal three distinct dynamical
regimes based on vesicle deformation: pulsating, reorienting, and symmetrical
regimes. We construct phase diagrams characterizing the transition of vesicle
shapes between pulsating, reorienting, and symmetrical regimes within the
two-dimensional Pipkin space defined by $\De$ and $\Ca$. Contrary to
observations on clean Newtonian droplets, vesicles do not reach a maximum
length twice per strain rate cycle in the reorienting and pulsating regimes.
The distinct dynamics observed in each regime result from a competition between
the flow frequency, flow time scale, and membrane deformation timescale. By
calculating the particle stresslet, we quantify the nonlinear relationship
between average vesicle stress and strain rate. Additionally, we present
results on tubular vesicles that undergo shape transformation over several
strain cycles. Broadly, our work provides new information regarding the

solvable optimal control (LSOC) problems of networked multi-agent systems

partition the optimal control problem of a networked MAS into several local
optimal control problems in factorial subsystems, such that each (central)
agent behaves optimally to minimize the joint cost function of a subsystem that
comprises a central agent and its neighboring agents, and the local control
actions (policies) only rely on the knowledge of local observations. Under this
framework, we not only preserve the correlations between neighboring agents,
but moderate the communication and computational complexities by decentralizing
the sampling and computational processes over the network. For discrete-time
systems modeled by Markov decision processes, the joint Bellman equation of
each subsystem is transformed into a system of linear equations and solved
using parallel programming. For continuous-time systems modeled by It\^o
diffusion processes, the joint optimality equation of each subsystem is
converted into a linear partial differential equation, whose solution is
approximated by a path integral formulation and a sample-efficient relative
entropy policy search algorithm, respectively. The learned control policies are
generalized to solve the unlearned tasks by resorting to the compositionality
principle, and illustrative examples of cooperative UAV teams are provided to
verify the effectiveness and advantages of these algorithms.

scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational
reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future
trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative
neural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving
heterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction
modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph
representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We
also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle
trajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but
also enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be
easily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy
proves to be improved by empirical results. The proposed system is evaluated on
three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents
cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline

compaction. While these domains are often imagined as static structures, they
are highly dynamic and show cell-to-cell variability. Since processes such as
gene regulation and DNA replication occur in the context of these domains, it
is important to understand their organization, fluctuation and dynamics. To
simulate chromatin domains, one requires knowledge of interaction strengths
among chromatin segments. Here, we derive interaction strength parameters from
experimentally known contact maps and use them to predict chromatin
organization and dynamics. Taking two domains on the human chromosome as
examples, we investigate its 3D organization, size/shape fluctuations, and
dynamics of different segments within a domain, accounting for hydrodynamic
effects. Considering different cell types, we quantify changes in interaction
strengths and chromatin shape fluctuations in different epigenetic states.
Perturbing the interaction strengths systematically, we further investigate how
epigenetic-like changes can alter the spatio-temporal nature of the domains.
Our results show that heterogeneous weak interactions are crucial in
determining the organization of the domains. Computing effective stiffness and
relaxation times, we investigate how perturbations in interactions affect the
solid-like and liquid-like nature of chromatin domains. Quantifying dynamics of
chromatin segments within a domain, we show how the competition between polymer
entropy and interaction energy influence the timescales of loop formation and
maintenance of stable loops.

evolve towards a 2nd-order phase transition at which interactions between
system components lead to scale-invariant events beneficial for system
performance. For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence
accumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types and
connections might exhibit SOC. Here we review experimental findings of
isolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize towards four dynamical
motifs identified in the cortex in vivo: up-states, oscillations, neuronal
avalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization
observed for nested theta/gamma-oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal
avalanches that exhibit robust power law scaling in size with a slope of -3/2
and a critical branching parameter of 1. This dynamical coordination, tracked
in the local field potential (nLFP) and pyramidal neuron activity using
2-photon imaging, emerges autonomously in superficial layers of organotypic
cortex cultures and acute cortex slices, is homeostatically regulated, displays
separation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs. quiet time dependencies.
A threshold operation identifies coherence potentials; avalanches that in
addition maintain the precise time course of propagated synchrony. Avalanches
emerge under conditions of external driving. Control parameters are established
by the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) and the neuromodulator
dopamine. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in dissociated cortex
cultures, which lack cortical layers and exhibit dynamics similar to a
1st-order phase transition. The precise interactions between up-states, nested
oscillations, avalanches, and coherence potentials in superficial cortical
layers provide compelling evidence for SOC in the brain.

crystallographic orientation in the oxidation and resultant optical properties

resistance behavior and the plasmonic performance of epitaxial TiN films follow
the order of (001) < (110) < (111). The effects of crystallographic orientation
on the lattice constants, optical properties, and oxidation levels of epitaxial
TiN films have been systematically studied by combined high-resolution X-ray
diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. To further understand the role of
crystallographic orientation in the initial oxidation process of TiN films,
density-functional-theory calculations are carried out, indicating the energy
cost of oxidation is (001) < (110) < (111), consistent with the experiments.
The superior endurance of the (111) orientation against mild oxidation can
largely alleviate the previously stringent technical requirements for the
growth of TiN films with high plasmonic performance. The crystallographic
orientation can also offer an effective controlling parameter to design
TiN-based plasmonic devices with desired peculiarity, e.g., superior chemical
stability against mild oxidation or large optical tunability upon oxidation.

input image, salient object detection (SOD) has been receiving great attention
in recent years. One kind of mainstream SOD methods is formed by a bottom-up
feature encoding procedure and a top-down information decoding procedure. While
numerous approaches have explored the bottom-up feature extraction for this
task, the design on top-down flows still remains under-studied. To this end,
this paper revisits the role of top-down modeling in salient object detection
and designs a novel densely nested top-down flows (DNTDF)-based framework. In
every stage of DNTDF, features from higher levels are read in via the
progressive compression shortcut paths (PCSP). The notable characteristics of
our proposed method are as follows. 1) The propagation of high-level features
which usually have relatively strong semantic information is enhanced in the
decoding procedure; 2) With the help of PCSP, the gradient vanishing issues
caused by non-linear operations in top-down information flows can be
alleviated; 3) Thanks to the full exploration of high-level features, the
decoding process of our method is relatively memory efficient compared against
those of existing methods. Integrating DNTDF with EfficientNet, we construct a
highly light-weighted SOD model, with very low computational complexity. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comprehensive experiments
are conducted on six widely-used benchmark datasets. The comparisons to the
most state-of-the-art methods as well as the carefully-designed baseline models
verify our insights on the top-down flow modeling for SOD. The code of this
paper is available at https://github.com/new-stone-object/DNTD.

of interest is to characterize the emergent behavior of such systems, which we
quantify in terms of the spectral gap of a weighted Laplacian associated with
the alignment operator. Our spectral analysis of energy fluctuation covers both
long-range and short-range kernels and does not require thermal equilibrium (no
closure for the pressure). In particular, in the prototypical case of
metric-based short-range kernels, the spectral gap admits a lower-bound
expressed in terms of the discrete Fourier coefficients of the radial kernel,
which enables us to quantify an emerging flocking behavior for non-vacuous
solutions. These large-time behavior results apply as long as the solutions
remain smooth. It is known that global smooth solutions exist in one and two
spatial dimensions, subject to sub-critical initial data. We settle the

referred to as ICD (International Classification of Diseases), to a medical
event based on the context captured in a clinical narrative. The latest version
of ICD, ICD-10, includes more than 70,000 codes. As this is a labor-intensive
and error-prone task, automatic ICD coding of medical reports using machine
learning has gained significant interest in the last decade. Existing
literature has modeled this problem as a multi-label task. Nevertheless, such
multi-label approach is challenging due to the extremely large label set size.
Furthermore, the interpretability of the predictions is essential for the
endusers (e.g., healthcare providers and insurance companies). In this paper,
we propose a novel approach for automatic ICD coding by reformulating the
extreme multi-label problem into a simpler multi-class problem using a
hierarchical solution. We made this approach viable through extensive data
collection to acquire phrase-level human coder annotations to supervise our
models on learning the specific relations between the input text and predicted
ICD codes. Our approach employs two independently trained networks, the
sentence tagger and the ICD classifier, stacked hierarchically to predict a
codeset for a medical report. The sentence tagger identifies focus sentences
containing a medical event or concept relevant to an ICD coding. Using a
supervised attention mechanism, the ICD classifier then assigns each focus
sentence with an ICD code. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines
by large margins of 23% in subset accuracy, 18% in micro-F1, and 15% in
instance based F-1. With our proposed approach, interpretability is achieved
not through implicitly learned attention scores but by attributing each

hysteresis effect is referred to that the hard-to-soft state transition in the
fast-rise stage occurs at much higher luminosity than the soft-to-hard state
transition in the slow-decay stage. That is, the same source can show different

to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However,
recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items
naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated
in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique
for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness
requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling
process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation
models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user's and each

sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the
adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each

nonlinear models of Taylor vortex flow. We use the resolvent formulation of
McKeon & Sharma (2010) to model these Taylor vortex solutions by treating the
nonlinearity not as an inherent part of the governing equations but rather as a
triadic constraint which must be satisfied by the model solution. We exploit
the low rank linear dynamics of the system to calculate an efficient basis for
our solution, the coefficients of which are then calculated through an
optimization problem where the cost function to be minimized is the triadic
consistency of the solution with itself as well as with the input mean flow.
Our approach constitutes, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first fully
nonlinear and self-sustaining, resolvent-based model described in the
literature. We compare our results to direct numerical simulation of Taylor
Couette flow at up to five times the critical Reynolds number, and show that
our model accurately captures the structure of the flow. Additionally, we find
that as the Reynolds number increases the flow undergoes a fundamental
transition from a classical weakly nonlinear regime, where the forcing cascade
is strictly down scale, to a fully nonlinear regime characterized by the
emergence of an inverse (up scale) forcing cascade. Triadic contributions from
the inverse and traditional cascade destructively interfere implying that the
accurate modeling of a certain Fourier mode requires knowledge of its immediate
harmonic and sub-harmonic. We show analytically that this finding is a direct
consequence of the structure of the quadratic nonlinearity of the governing
equations formulated in Fourier space. Finally, we show that using our model
solution as an initial condition to a higher Reynolds number DNS significantly
reduces the time to convergence.

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given stereo or egomotion image pairs, a popular and successful method for
unsupervised learning of monocular depth estimation is to measure the quality
of image reconstructions resulting from the learned depth predictions.
Continued research has improved the overall approach in recent years, yet the
common framework still suffers from several important limitations, particularly
when dealing with points occluded after transformation to a novel viewpoint.
While prior work has addressed this problem heuristically, this paper
introduces a z-buffering algorithm that correctly and efficiently handles
occluded points. Because our algorithm is implemented with operators typical of
machine learning libraries, it can be incorporated into any existing
unsupervised depth learning framework with automatic support for
differentiation. Additionally, because points having negative depth after
transformation often signify erroneously shallow depth predictions, we
introduce a loss function to penalize this undesirable behavior explicitly.
Experimental results on the KITTI data set show that the z-buffer and negative
depth loss both improve the performance of a state of the art depth-prediction
network.

is a similar trend of rising interest in Spatio-Temporal systems described by
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) among the robotics and control
communities. These systems often exhibit dramatic under-actuation, high
dimensionality, bifurcations, and multimodal instabilities. Their control
represents many of the current-day challenges facing the robotics and
automation communities. Not only are these systems challenging to control, but
the design of their actuation is an NP-hard problem on its own. Recent methods
either discretize the space before optimization, or apply tools from linear
systems theory under restrictive linearity assumptions in order to arrive at a
control solution. This manuscript provides a novel sampling-based stochastic
optimization framework based entirely in Hilbert spaces suitable for the
general class of \textit{semi-linear} SPDEs which describes many systems in
robotics and applied physics. This framework is utilized for simultaneous
policy optimization and actuator co-design optimization. The resulting
algorithm is based on variational optimization, and performs joint episodic
optimization of the feedback control law and the actuation design over
episodes. We study first and second order systems, and in doing so, extend
several results to the case of second order SPDEs. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach with several simulated experiments on a
variety of SPDEs in robotics and applied physics including an infinite
degree-of-freedom soft robotic manipulator.

variety of engineering systems, the Backward-Facing Step (BFS) geometry and
Confined Swirling Flow (CSF) geometry are invoked in the present case. The
calculation of the SGS stresses employs three models, namely, the Dynamic
Smagorinsky model, the Wall Adapting Local Eddy viscosity (WALE) model and the
Dynamic WALE model. For studying the effect of the grid sensitivity, the
simulations are performed over two sets of grids with different resolutions
based on the non-dimensional wall distance parameter ( y+ ). Grids
corresponding to y+ = 70 and y+ = 20 are employed for the subsonic flow over
the BFS while grids corresponding to y+ = 40 and y+ = 20 are employed for
supersonic flow over the BFS and for confined swirling flow geometry. The
validation against the experimental results includes the mean flow fields and
the turbulent stresses obtained for each case. The results reveal that for the
fine grid (y+ = 20), the near wall eddy viscosity profile for the WALE model is
better than both the Dynamic WALE and the Dynamic Smagorinsky model. The
difference between the predictions of the coarse and fine grids for Dynamic
Smagorinsky and the WALE model is high whereas, the Dynamic WALE model is
almost insensitive to the grid resolutions considered for the present case. The

  - We construct a CV-NIZK for QMA in the quantum secret parameter model where
a trusted setup sends a quantum proving key to the prover and a classical
verification key to the verifier. It is information theoretically sound and
zero-knowledge.
  - Assuming the quantum hardness of the learning with errors problem, we
construct a CV-NIZK for QMA in a model where a trusted party generates a CRS

preprocessing. This model is the same as one considered in the recent work by
Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang (CRYPTO '20).
  Our construction has the so-called dual-mode property, which means that there
are two computationally indistinguishable modes of generating CRS, and we have
information theoretical soundness in one mode and information theoretical
zero-knowledge property in the other. This answers an open problem left by
Coladangelo et al, which is to achieve either of soundness or zero-knowledge
information theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
dual-mode NIZK for QMA in any kind of model.
  - We construct a CV-NIZK for QMA with quantum preprocessing in the quantum
random oracle model. This quantum preprocessing is the one where the verifier
sends a random Pauli-basis states to the prover. Our construction uses the
Fiat-Shamir transformation. The quantum preprocessing can be replaced with the
setup that distributes Bell pairs among the prover and the verifier, and

the emergence of video-based data allows to enrich the widely used spatial
features with the inclusion of temporal information. However, such
spatio-temporal modelling often results in very high-dimensional feature spaces
and large volumes of data, making training difficult and time consuming. This
paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel model that efficiently
extracts both spatial and temporal features of the data by means of its
enhanced temporal modelling based on latent features. Our proposed model
consists of three major networks, coined Generator, Discriminator, and
Combiner, which are trained in an adversarial setting combined with curriculum
learning to enable our adaptive attention modules. In our experiments, we show
the effectiveness of our approach by reporting our competitive results on both
the AFEW-VA and SEWA datasets, suggesting that temporal modelling improves the
affect estimates both in qualitative and quantitative terms. Furthermore, we
find that the inclusion of attention mechanisms leads to the highest accuracy
improvements, as its weights seem to correlate well with the appearance of
facial movements, both in terms of temporal localisation and intensity.
Finally, we observe the sequence length of around 160\,ms to be the optimum one
for temporal modelling, which is consistent with other relevant findings
utilising similar lengths.

efficient exclusive-use spectrum licenses sold through spectrum auctions. Given
a system model in which customer demand, revenue, and bids of wireless
operators are characterized by stochastic processes and an operator is
interested in joining the market only if its expected revenue is above a
threshold and the lease duration is below a threshold, what is the optimal
lease duration which maximizes the net customer demand served by the wireless
operators? Increasing or decreasing lease duration has many competing effects;
while shorter lease duration may increase the efficiency of spectrum
allocation, longer lease duration may increase market competition by
incentivizing more operators to enter the market. We formulate this problem as
a two-stage Stackelberg game consisting of the regulator and the wireless
operators and design efficient algorithms to find the Stackelberg equilibrium
of the entire game. These algorithms can also be used to find the Stackelberg
equilibrium under some generalizations of our model. Using these algorithms, we
obtain important numerical results and insights that characterize how the
optimal lease duration varies with respect to market parameters in order to
maximize the spectrum utilization. A few of our numerical results are
non-intuitive as they suggest that increasing market competition may not
necessarily improve spectrum utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this

several centimeters, while planetesimals have sizes of hundreds of kilometers.
Therefore, various regimes for the aerodynamic drag between solid bodies and
gas can be realized in these disks, depending on the grain sizes and
velocities: Epstein, Stokes, and Newton, as well as transitional regimes
between them. For small bodies moving in the Epstein regime, the time required
to establish the constant relative velocity between the gas and bodies can be
much less than the dynamical time scale for the problem - the time for the
rotation of the disk about the central body. In addition, the dust may be
concentrated in individual regions of the disk, making it necessary to take
into account the transfer of momentum between the dust and gas. It is shown
that, for a system of equations for gas and monodisperse dust, a semi-implicit
first-order approximation scheme in time in which the interphase interaction is
calculated implicitly, while other forces, such as the pressure gradient and
gravity are calculated explicitly, is suitable for stiff problems with intense
interphase interactions and for computations of the drag in non-linear regimes.
The piece-wise drag coefficient widely used in astrophysical simulations has a
discontinuity at some values of the Mach and Knudsen numbers that are realized
in a circumstellar disk. A continuous drag coefficient is presented, which

malicious participants inserting corrupted data. Recent algorithmic advances in
learning from shared data focus on either one of these threats, leaving the

estimating the mean from i.i.d. samples. We introduce PRIME, which is the first
efficient algorithm that achieves both privacy and robustness for a wide range

time algorithm that improves the sample complexity of PRIME, achieving a
near-optimal guarantee and matching a known lower bound for (non-robust)

novel measure of robust convergence between pairs of system trajectories, and
the dependency on the task horizon $T$ of the resulting generalization bounds.
In particular, we propose and analyze incremental gain stability constrained

systems for which the number of trajectories needed to achieve
$\varepsilon$-suboptimality is sublinear in the task horizon $T$, and do so
without requiring (strong) convexity of the loss function in the policy

equal bandwidth, and then further assigning these M channels into P licensed
channels and M-P unlicensed channels. Licensed channels can be accessed both
for licensed and opportunistic use following a tiered structure which has a
higher priority for licensed use. Unlicensed channels can be accessed only for
opportunistic use. We address the following question in this paper. Given a
market setup, what values of M and P maximize the net spectrum utilization of
the spectrum band? While this problem is of fundamental nature, it is highly
relevant practically, e.g., in the context of partitioning the recently
proposed Citizens Broadband Radio Service band. If M is too high or too low, it
may decrease spectrum utilization due to limited channel capacity or due to
wastage of channel capacity, respectively. If P is too high (low), it will not
incentivize the wireless operators who are primarily interested in unlicensed
channels (licensed channels) to join the market. These tradeoffs are captured
in our optimization problem which manifests itself as a two-stage Stackelberg
game. We design an algorithm to solve the Stackelberg game and hence find the
optimal M and P. The algorithm design also involves an efficient Monte Carlo
integrator to evaluate the expected value of the involved random variables like
spectrum utilization and operators' revenue. We also benchmark our algorithms

measurements have been shown to undergo a phase transition, tuned by the rate
of measurement, from a state with volume-law entanglement to an area-law state.
From a broader perspective, these circuits generate a novel ensemble of quantum
many-body states at their output. In this paper, we characterize this ensemble
and classify the phases that can be established as steady states. Symmetry
plays a nonstandard role in that the physical symmetry imposed on the circuit
elements does not on its own dictate the possible phases. Instead, it is
extended by dynamical symmetries associated with this ensemble to form an
enlarged symmetry. Thus, we predict phases that have no equilibrium counterpart
and could not have been supported by the physical circuit symmetry alone. We
give the following examples. First, we classify the phases of a circuit
operating on qubit chains with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. One striking
prediction, corroborated with numerical simulation, is the existence of
distinct volume-law phases in one dimension, which nonetheless support true
long-range order. We furthermore argue that owing to the enlarged symmetry,
this system can in principle support a topological area-law phase, protected by
the combination of the circuit symmetry and a dynamical permutation symmetry.
Second, we consider a Gaussian fermionic circuit that only conserves fermion
parity. Here the enlarged symmetry gives rise to a $U(1)$ critical phase at
moderate measurement rates and a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to area-law
phases. We comment on the interpretation of the different phases in terms of
the capacity to encode quantum information. We discuss close analogies to the
theory of spin glasses pioneered by Edwards and Anderson as well as crucial
differences that stem from the quantum nature of the circuit ensemble.

the total latency of HLF can be modeled as a Gamma distribution, which is
validated by conducting a goodness-of-fit test (i.e., the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

distribution for various HLF environments. Furthermore, we explore the impacts
of three important HLF parameters including transaction generation rate, block
size, and block-generation timeout on the HLF latency. As a result, this
article provides design insights on minimizing the latency for HLF-enabled IoT.

performance improvements in hybrid and end-to-end automatic speech recognition

architecture, which is a variant of the Gaussian kernel, which itself is a
shift-invariant kernel. First, we mathematically demonstrate that
self-attention with shared weight parameters for queries and keys is equivalent
to a normalized kernel function. By replacing this kernel function with the
proposed Gaussian kernel, the architecture becomes completely shift-invariant
with the relative position information embedded using a frame indexing
technique. The proposed Gaussian kernelized SA was applied to connectionist
temporal classification (CTC) based ASR. An experimental evaluation with the
Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and TEDLIUM 3 benchmarks shows that the

WER to 6.0% in CSJ) in long sequence data without any windowing techniques.

both harmonic (H) and fundamental (F) bands using PIC simulations with various
$\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$. This allows us to directly simulate the feature of

that (1) the simulations reproduce the DPR effect nicely for the upper hybrid
(UH) and Z modes, as seen from their variation of intensity and linear growth
rate with $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, (2) the intensity of the H emission is
stronger than that of the F emission by $\sim$ 2 orders of magnitude and vary
periodically with increasing $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, while the F emission is
too weak to be significant, therefore we suggest that it is the H emission
accounting for solar ZPs, (3) the peak-valley contrast of the total intensity
of H is $\sim 4$, and the peak lies around integer values of
$\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$ (= 10 and 11) for the present parameter setup. We

best self-validation result with a standard deviation of {\sigma} = 0.24.
Testing on various sub-samples, we find that the DL algorithm generally has
lower values of {\sigma}, in addition to exhibiting a better performance in
other measures. Our DL method, which uses an easy to implement off-the-shelf
algorithm with no filtering nor removal of outliers, performs similarly to
other, more complex, algorithms, resulting in an accuracy of {\Delta}z < 0.1$
up to z ~ 2.5. Applying the DL algorithm trained on our 70,000 strong sample to
other independent (radio-selected) datasets, we find {\sigma} < 0.36 over a
wide range of radio flux densities. This indicates much potential in using this
method to determine photometric redshifts of quasars detected with the Square

agents often have limits on their processing abilities, making the assumption
of perfect rationality inapplicable to many real tasks. We propose an
information-theoretic approach to the inference of agent decisions under
Smithian competition. The model explicitly captures the boundedness of agents
(limited in their information-processing capacity) as the cost of information
acquisition for expanding their prior beliefs. The expansion is measured as the
Kullblack-Leibler divergence between posterior decisions and prior beliefs.
When information acquisition is free, the homo economicus agent is recovered,
while in cases when information acquisition becomes costly, agents instead
revert to their prior beliefs. The maximum entropy principle is used to infer
least-biased decisions based upon the notion of Smithian competition formalised
within the Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium framework. The
incorporation of prior beliefs into such a framework allowed us to
systematically explore the effects of prior beliefs on decision-making in the
presence of market feedback, as well as importantly adding a temporal
interpretation to the framework. We verified the proposed model using
Australian housing market data, showing how the incorporation of prior
knowledge alters the resulting agent decisions. Specifically, it allowed for
the separation of past beliefs and utility maximisation behaviour of the agent
as well as the analysis into the evolution of agent beliefs.

Bohr was the first who pointed to contextuality of quantum measurements as a
part of formulation of his principle of complementarity. (Instead of
""contextuality"", he considered dependence on ""experimental conditions."")
Unfortunately, the contextuality counterpart of the complementarity principle
was overshadowed by the issue of incompatibility of observables. And the
interest for contextuality of quantum measurements rose again only in
connection with the Bell inequality. The original Bohr's contextuality, as
contextuality of each quantum measurement, was practically forgotten. It was
highlighted in the works of the author of this paper, with applications both to
physics and cognition. In this note, the theory of open quantum systems is
applied to formalization of Bohr's contextuality within the the scheme of
indirect measurements. This scheme is widely used in quantum information theory

solutions. A novel approach that uses the link prediction problem in social
networks has been proposed in the literature that model the typical user-item

recommending an item to a user. The standard recommender system methods suffer
from the problems of sparsity and scalability. Since link prediction measures
involve computations pertaining to small neighborhoods in the network, this
approach would lead to a scalable solution to recommendation. One of the issues
in this conversion is that link prediction problem is modelled as a binary
classification task whereas the problem of recommender systems is solved as a
regression task in which the rating of the link is to be predicted. We overcome
this issue by predicting top k links as recommendations with high ratings
without predicting the actual rating. Our work extends similar approaches in
the literature by focusing on exploiting the probabilistic measures for link
prediction. Moreover, in the proposed approach, prediction measures that
utilize temporal information available on the links prove to be more effective
in improving the accuracy of prediction. This approach is evaluated on the
benchmark 'Movielens' dataset. We show that the usage of temporal probabilistic

similarly to classical bulges and early-type galaxies, while those with less

pseudo bulges in late-type galaxies. The host galaxy bulges, irrespective of

is a probabilistic approach to the analysis of aggregated data. One of the most
important operations in CGM is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of
unobserved variables under given observations. Because the MAP inference
problem for general CGMs has been shown to be NP-hard, an approach that solves
an approximate problem has been proposed. However, this approach has two major
drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in
the count tables are small, because the approximation becomes inaccurate.
Second, since continuous relaxation is applied, the integrality constraints of
the output are violated. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a new
method for MAP inference for CGMs on path graphs. First we show that the MAP
inference problem can be formulated as a (non-linear) minimum cost flow
problem. Then, we apply Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA), which is a
general methodology to minimize a function represented as the sum of a convex
function and a concave function. In our algorithm, important subroutines in DCA
can be efficiently calculated by minimum convex cost flow algorithms.
Experiments show that the proposed method outputs higher quality solutions than
the conventional approach.

The last decade has shown an increasing interest in the design of machine
learning-based heuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The
goal is to leverage knowledge from historical data to solve similar new

a maximum weighted subset $V'\subseteq V$ of the vertices such that $V'$

propose two new integer programming formulations with an exponential number of
constraints and branch-and-cut procedures for MWIF. Computational experiments
using benchmark instances are performed comparing several formulations,
including the newly proposed approaches and those available in the literature,
when solved by a standard commercial mixed integer programming solver. More
specifically, five formulations are compared, two compact (i.e., with a

small instances, especially the more challenging ones. Additionally, this

studied using rheology for a range of self-assembly conditions in recent years.
However, a one to one correlation between the onset of macroscopic network
failure and local deformations inside the sample is yet to be established in
these systems. Here, using shear rheology and in-situ high-resolution boundary
imaging, we study the yielding dynamics of in-vitro reconstituted networks of
uncrosslinked type-I collagen. We find that in the non-linear regime, the
differential shear modulus ($K$) of the network initially increases with
applied strain and then begins to drop as the network starts to yield beyond a
critical strain (yield strain). Measurement of the local velocity profile using
colloidal tracer particles reveals that beyond the peak of $K$, strong
strain-localization and slippage between the network and the rheometer plate
sets in that eventually leads to a detachment. We generalize this observation
for a range of collagen concentrations, applied strain ramp rates, as well as
different network architectures obtained by varying the polymerization
temperature. Furthermore, by fitting the stress vs strain data with a continuum
affine network model, we map out a state diagram showing the dependence of
yield-stain and -stress on the reduced persistence length and mesh size of the
network. Our findings can have broad implications in tissue engineering,
particularly, in designing highly resilient biological scaffolds.

been widely discussed as an alternative mechanism to address the coincidence
problem. As it is well known, it is possible to extend such models to obtain
quintessential inflation, that is, to incorporate inflationary stage as well.
Taking an alternative route, one can start from the well established
inflationary models and obtain successful quintessence models at the expense of
coupling with the CNB. To Follow this route, we use a slightly reformulated
model addressed in PRD95, 123521 (2017). This particular model assumes
$\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry for both scalar field potential and coupling term,
which then breaks down in course of the cosmological evolution. For our
discussion, however, the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry of the potential is not
mandatory the model to work. The conventional mechanism of particle production
by the oscillating inflaton field (and their subsequent thermalization) remains
operative. It is plain to see that the proposed construction can be easily
applied for many successful models of inflation to incorporate dark energy at
the expense of coupling with the CNB. We address the issue of neutrino nuggets
from the quantum field theory point of view. Namely, these nuggets are
considered as bound states caused basically by the Yukawa force, which arises
in the framework of linear perturbation theory due to exchange of virtual
quanta of quintessence field between the neutrinos.

has been solved by the slow adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian in time. The
methods for controlling a qutrit system using projection operators have been
developed and the numerical simulation has been performed. The Hamiltonians for
two well-known cluster-ing methods, one-hot encoding and k-means ++, have been
built. The first method has been used to partition a set of six points into
three or two clusters and the second method, to partition a set of nine points
into three clusters and seven points into four clusters. The simulation has
shown that the clustering problem can be ef-fectively solved on qutrits
represented by the spins S = 1. The advantages of clustering on qutrits over
that on qubits have been demonstrated. In particular, the number of qutrits
required to represent data points is smaller than the number of qubits by a
factor of log2 N / log3 N . Since, for qutrits, it is easier to partition the
data points into three clusters rather than two ones, the approximate
hierarchical procedure of data partition-ing into a larger number of clusters
is accelerated. At the exact data partition into more than three clusters, it
has been proposed to number the clusters by the numbers of states of the

Through

where the response is linear. Here, we apply large elastic strains to FeSe, and
perform two types of measurements. (1) Using applied strain to control
twinning, the nematic resistive anisotropy at temperatures below the nematic
transition temperature Ts is determined. (2) Resistive anisotropy is measured
as nematicity is induced through applied strain at fixed temperature above Ts.
In both cases, as nematicity strengthens the resistive anisotropy peaks about
about 7%, then decreases. Below ~40 K, the nematic resistive anisotropy changes
sign. We discuss possible implications of this behaviour for theories of
nematicity. We report in addition: (1) Under experimentally accessible
conditions with bulk crystals, stress, rather than strain, is the conjugate
field to the nematicity of FeSe. (2) At low temperatures the twin boundary
resistance is ~10% of the sample resistance, and must be properly subtracted to
extract intrinsic resistivities. (3) Biaxial inplane compression increases both
in-plane resistivity and the superconducting critical temperature Tc,
consistent with a strong role of the yz orbital in the electronic correlations.

order in a one-dimensional lattice displaying a delocalization-localization
phase transition at a finite critical value $V_c$ of the quasiperiodic
potential amplitude $V$. In terms of dynamical behavior of the system, the
phase transition is discontinuous when one measures the quantum diffusion
exponent $\delta$ of wave packet spreading, with $\delta=1$ in the delocalized
phase $V<V_c$ (ballistic transport), $\delta \simeq 1/2$ at the critical point
$V=V_c$ (diffusive transport), and $\delta=0$ in the localized phase $V>V_c$
(dynamical localization). However, the phase transition turns out to be smooth
when one measures, as a dynamical variable, the speed $v(V)$ of excitation
transport in the lattice, which is a continuous function of potential amplitude
$V$ and vanishes as the localized phase is approached. Here we consider a
non-Hermitian extension of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model, in which hopping
along the lattice is asymmetric, and show that the dynamical
localization-delocalization transition is discontinuous not only in the
diffusion exponent $\delta$, but also in the speed $v$ of ballistic transport.
This means that, even very close to the spectral phase transition point, rather
counter-intuitively ballistic transport with a finite speed is allowed in the
lattice. Also, we show that the ballistic velocity can increase as $V$ is
increased above zero, i.e. surprisingly disorder in the lattice can result in
an enhancement of transport.

non-intrusive Space-Time (ST) POD basis interpolation scheme is proposed, for
which we define ROM spatial and temporal basis \emph{curves on compact Stiefel

in a square matrix directly deduced using the space part, the singular values
and the temporal part, to obtain an interpolated snapshot matrix, keeping track
of accurate space and temporal eigenvectors. Moreover, in order to establish a
well-defined curve on the compact Stiefel manifold, we introduce a new
procedure, the so-called oriented SVD. Such an oriented SVD produces unique
right and left eigenvectors for generic matrices, for which all singular values
are distinct. It is important to notice that the ST POD basis interpolation
does not require the construction and the subsequent solution of a
reduced-order FEM model as classically is done. Hence it is avoiding the
bottleneck of standard POD interpolation which is associated with the
evaluation of the nonlinear terms of the Galerkin projection on the governing

While supernova remnant shocks are often invoked as the sites of acceleration,
it is now widely accepted that the difficulties of such sources in reaching PeV
energies are daunting and it seems likely that only a subclass of rare remnants
can satisfy the necessary conditions. Moreover the spectra of cosmic rays
escaping the remnants have a complex shape that is not obviously the same as
the spectra observed at the Earth. Here we investigate the process of particle
acceleration at the termination shock that develops in the bubble excavated by
star clusters' winds in the interstellar medium. While the main limitation to
the maximum energy in supernova remnants comes from the need for effective wave
excitation upstream so as to confine particles in the near-shock region and
speed up the acceleration process, at the termination shock of star clusters
the confinement of particles upstream in guaranteed by the geometry of the
problem. We develop a theory of diffusive shock acceleration at such shock and
we find that the maximum energy may reach the PeV region for powerful clusters
in the high end of the luminosity tail for these sources. A crucial role in
this problem is played by the dissipation of energy in the wind to magnetic
perturbations. Under reasonable conditions the spectrum of the accelerated
particles has a power law shape with a slope $4\div 4.3$, in agreement with
what is required based upon standard models of cosmic ray transport in the
Galaxy.

the joint analysis with the previous detection of [N II] lines for both the QSO

proposed. It will be constructed based on an upgraded heavy-ion accelerator,
High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) which is currently under
construction, together with a new electron ring. The proposed collider will
provide highly polarized electrons (with a polarization of $\sim$80%) and
protons (with a polarization of $\sim$70%) with variable center of mass
energies from 15 to 20 GeV and the luminosity of (2-3) $\times$ 10$^{33}$

ion beams from Carbon to Uranium, will be also available at the EicC.
  The main foci of the EicC will be precision measurements of the structure of
the nucleon in the sea quark region, including 3D tomography of nucleon; the
partonic structure of nuclei and the parton interaction with the nuclear
environment; the exotic states, especially those with heavy flavor quark
contents. In addition, issues fundamental to understanding the origin of mass
could be addressed by measurements of heavy quarkonia near-threshold production
at the EicC. In order to achieve the above-mentioned physics goals, a
hermetical detector system will be constructed with cutting-edge technologies.

equation where the measure is conserved to model the forward propagation
process of DNN which has not been addressed before. DNN learns the
transformation of the input distribution to the output one. However, in the
measure space, there are infinite curves connecting two distributions. Which
one can lead to good optimization and generaliztion for DNN? By diving the
optimal transport theory, we find DNN with weight decay attempts to learn the
geodesic curve in the Wasserstein space, which is induced by the optimal
transport map. Compared with plain network, ResNet is a better approximation to
the geodesic curve, which explains why ResNet can be optimized and generalize
better. Numerical experiments show that the data tracks of both plain network

  Method for Cross-chain Interaction",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cross-chain interaction is among different blockchains. When the number of
blockchains increases, it is difficult for blockchains to form a single star
topology or a fully connected topology. Meanwhile, different from legacy
networks, the propagation method is required to keep the data validity. Thus,
the blockchain topology and associated propagation methods are two key issues,
which should be ensured during the propagation. In this paper, we first propose
the confirmation-based propagation method to keep the validity of the
cross-chain data. The confirmation method is to seal the cross-chain
transaction synchronized from other blockchains. Second, we point out that a
valid topology requires blockchains to be strongly connected. With this
requirement, we propose several topologies, which match different connection
scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can securely
propagate the cross-chain data and the connection way is flexible.

high-sensitivity, high-resolution (<1 mJy/b and <15"") observations at ultra-low
frequencies (<100 MHz). To utilise these capabilities, the LOFAR Surveys Key
Science Project is undertaking a large survey to cover the entire northern sky
with Low Band Antenna (LBA) observations. The LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) aims
to cover the entire northern sky with 3170 pointings in the frequency range
42-66 MHz, at a resolution of 15 arcsec and at a sensitivity of 1 mJy/b. Here
we outline the survey strategy, the observational status, the current
calibration techniques, and briefly describe several scientific motivations. We
also describe the preliminary public data release. The preliminary images were
produced using a fully automated pipeline that aims to correct all
direction-independent effects in the data. Whilst the direction-dependent
effects, such as those from the ionosphere, are not yet corrected, the images
presented in this work are still 10 times more sensitive than previous surveys
available at these low frequencies. The preliminary data release covers 740
sqdeg around the HETDEX spring field region at a resolution of 47"" with a
median noise level of 5 mJy/b. The images and the catalogue with 25,247 sources
are publicly released. We demonstrate that the system is capable of reaching an
rms noise of 1 mJy/b and the resolution of 15"" once direction-dependent effects
are corrected for. LoLSS will provide the ultra-low-frequency information for
hundreds of thousands of radio sources, providing critical spectral information
and producing a unique dataset that can be used for a wide range of science
topics such as: the search for high redshift galaxies and quasars, the study of
the magnetosphere of exoplanets, and the detection of the oldest populations of
cosmic-rays in galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and from AGN activity.

optimization problems is adapted to accelerating stationary iterative solvers
for linear systems. Compared with classical Krylov subspace acceleration
methods, the proposed scheme requires more iterations, but it is trivial to
implement and retains essentially the same computational cost as the
unaccelerated method. An explicit formula for a fixed optimal parameter is
derived in the case where the stationary iteration matrix has only real
eigenvalues, based only on the smallest and largest eigenvalues. The fixed
parameter, and corresponding convergence factor, are shown to maintain their
optimality when the iteration matrix also has complex eigenvalues that are
contained within an explicitly defined disk in the complex plane. A comparison
to Chebyshev acceleration based on the same information of the smallest and
largest real eigenvalues (dubbed Restricted Information Chebyshev acceleration)
demonstrates that Nesterov's scheme is more robust in the sense that it remains
optimal over a larger domain when the iteration matrix does have some complex
eigenvalues. Numerical tests validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

own drawbacks, such as low data efficiency for RL and poor generalization

method that combines deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning from
expert demonstrations, which is applied to longitudinal vehicle motion control

incorporate both the goals of maximizing reward and imitating the expert.
Moreover, an adaptive prioritized experience replay is designed to sample
experience from both the agent's self-exploration and expert demonstration, in
order to improve sample efficiency. The proposed method is validated in a
simulated urban roundabout scenario and compared with various prevailing RL and

electromagnetic (EM) action and the notion of EM fields, but it only satisfies
the requirement of the covariance in Minkowski metric (Lorentz invariance).
Darwin's force law of moving charges, which originates from Maxwell's field
theory complies the Lorentz invariance as well. Poincar\'e's principle stating
that physical laws can be formulated with identical meaning on different
geometries suggest, that the retarded EM interaction of moving charges might be
covariant even in Euclidean geometry (Galilean invariance). Keeping the
propagation speed finite, but breaking with Maxwell's field theory in this
study an attempt is made to find a Galilean invariant force law. Through the
altering of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potential (LWP) a new retarded potential of
two moving charges, the Common Retarded Electric Potential (CREP) is introduced
which depends on the velocities of both interacting charges. The sought after
force law is determined by means of the second order approximation of CREP. The
law obtained is the Galilean invariant Weber's force law, surprisingly. Its
rediscovery from the second order approximation of a retarded electric
potential confirms the significance of Weber's force law and proves it to be a
retarded and approximative law. The fact that Weber's force law implies even
the magnetic forces tells us that magnetic phenomena are a manifestation of the
retarded electric interaction exclusively. The third order approximation of the
CREP opens the possibility of EM waves, and the creation of a complete,
Euclidean electrodynamics.

can be realized, which is necessary for the successful scenario of the
electroweak baryogenesis in addition to new CP-violating phases. In the
benchmark points satisfying neutrino data, lepton flavor violation data and the

some distribution parameters are updated more frequently than others, can be a
problem that prevents some submodels to be appropriately fitted within a
limited number of boosting iterations. We propose an approach using adaptive
step-length (ASL) determination within a non-cyclical boosting algorithm for
GAMLSS to prevent such imbalance. Moreover, for the important special case of
the Gaussian distribution, we discuss properties of the ASL and derive a
semi-analytical form of the ASL that avoids manual selection of the search
interval and numerical optimization to find the optimal step-length, and
consequently improves computational efficiency. We show competitive behavior of
the proposed approaches compared to penalized maximum likelihood and boosting
with a fixed step-length for GAMLSS models in two simulations and two
applications, in particular for cases of large variance and/or more variables
than observations. In addition, the idea of the ASL is also applicable to other
models with more than one predictor like zero-inflated count model, and brings
up insights into the choice of the reasonable defaults for the step-length in

Moreover, the lack of proper documentation for these deprecated APIs makes the

APIScanner that automatically detects deprecated APIs in Python libraries. This
algorithm parses the source code of the libraries using abstract syntax tree
(ASTs) and identifies the deprecated APIs via decorator, hard-coded warning or

warns the developer on the use of deprecated API elements while writing the

We observe good performance both in predictable, deterministic settings (~95%

the formalism originally developed by Bonora et al. and Bekaert et al. in their
studies of linear coupling of matter fields to an infinite tower of higher spin
fields. The off-shell definition is based on fields defined on a
$2d$-dimensional master space equipped with a symplectic structure, where the
infinite dimensional Lie algebra of gauge transformations is given by the Moyal
commutator. Using this algebra we construct well-defined weakly non-local
actions, both in the gauge and the matter sector, by mimicking the Yang-Mills
procedure. The theory allows for a description in terms of an infinite tower of
higher spin spacetime fields only on-shell. Interestingly, Euclidean theory
allows for such a description also off-shell. Owing to its formal similarity to
non-commutative field theories, the formalism allows for the introduction of a
covariant potential which plays the role of the generalised vielbein. This
covariant formulation uncovers the existence of other phases and shows that the
theory can be written in a matrix model form. The symmetries of the theory are
analyzed and conserved currents are explicitly constructed. By studying the
spin-2 sector we show that the emergent geometry is closely related to
teleparallel geometry, in the sense that the induced linear connection is
opposite to Weitzenb\""{o}ck's.

the supervisor and the plant. This assumption is violated in a networked-based
communication setting due to the presence of delays, and this may result in
incorrect behavior of a supervisor obtained from conventional supervisory
control theory. This paper presents a technique to synthesize a networked
supervisor handling communication delays. For this purpose, first, a networked
supervisory control framework is provided, where the supervisor interacts with
the plant through control and observation channels, both of which introduce
delays. The control channel is FIFO, but the observation channel is assumed to
be non-FIFO so that the observation of events may not necessarily be received
by the supervisor in the same order as they occurred in the plant. It is
assumed that a global clock exists in the networked control system, and so the
communication delays are represented in terms of time. Based on the proposed
framework, a networked plant automaton is achieved, which models the behavior
of the plant under the effects of communication delays and disordered
observations. Based on the networked plant, the networked supervisor is
synthesized, which is guaranteed to be (timed networked) controllable,
nonblocking, time-lock free, (timed networked) maximally permissive, and
satisfies control requirements for the plant.

The choice of attachment strategies therefore becomes a crucial factor for the

responsible for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the
synchrotron radiation scenario, the electron energy spectrum of the prompt
emission is diverse in theoretical works and has not been estimated from
observations in a general way (i.e., without specifying a certain physical
model for the electron spectrum). In this paper, we creatively propose a method
to directly estimate the electron spectrum for the prompt emission, without
specifying a certain physical model for the electron spectrum in the
synchrotron radiation scenario. In this method, an empirical function (i.e., a
four-order Bezier curve jointed with a linear function at high-energy) is
applied to describe the electron spectrum in log-log coordinate. It is found
that our empirical function can well mimic the electron spectra obtained in
many numerical calculations or simulations. Then, our method can figure out the
electron spectrum for the prompt emission without specifying a model. By
employing our method on observations, taking GRB 180720B and GRB 160509A as
examples, it is found that the obtained electron spectra are generally
different from that in the standard fast-cooling scenario and even a broken
power law. Moreover, the morphology of electron spectra in its low-energy
regime varies with time in a burst and even in a pulse. Our proposed method
provides a valuable way to confront the synchrotron radiation mechanism with
observations.

accounted for by assuming that not only the occupation of electronic states is

The ferromagnetic phase of FeRh, characterized by a minority band near the

embedding vector from a user's behavior sequence for the next-item
recommendation. However, from empirical analysis, we discovered that a user's
behavior sequence often contains multiple conceptually distinct items, while a
unified embedding vector is primarily affected by one's most recent frequent
actions. Thus, it may fail to infer the next preferred item if conceptually
similar items are not dominant in recent interactions. To this end, an
alternative solution is to represent each user with multiple embedding vectors
encoding different aspects of the user's intentions. Nevertheless, recent work
on multi-interest embedding usually considers a small number of concepts
discovered via clustering, which may not be comparable to the large pool of
item categories in real systems. It is a non-trivial task to effectively model
a large number of diverse conceptual prototypes, as items are often not
conceptually well clustered in fine granularity. Besides, an individual usually
interacts with only a sparse set of concepts. In light of this, we propose a
novel \textbf{S}parse \textbf{I}nterest \textbf{NE}twork (SINE) for sequential

prediction. Empirical results on several public benchmark datasets and one

extremely challenging to have news recommenders trained together with such big
models: the learning of news recommenders requires intensive news encoding
operations, whose cost is prohibitive if PLMs are used as the news encoder. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, {SpeedyFeed}, which efficiently
trains PLMs-based news recommenders of superior quality. SpeedyFeed is
highlighted for its light-weighted encoding pipeline, which gives rise to three
major advantages. Firstly, it makes the intermedia results fully reusable for
the training workflow, which removes most of the repetitive but redundant
encoding operations. Secondly, it improves the data efficiency of the training
workflow, where non-informative data can be eliminated from encoding. Thirdly,
it further saves the cost by leveraging simplified news encoding and compact
news representation. Extensive experiments show that SpeedyFeed leads to more
than 100$\times$ acceleration of the training process, which enables big models
to be trained efficiently and effectively over massive user data. The
well-trained PLMs-based model from SpeedyFeed demonstrates highly competitive
performance, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommenders with
significant margins. SpeedyFeed is also a model-agnostic framework, which is
potentially applicable to a wide spectrum of content-based recommender systems;

opportunities to track actual interests of users. Prior efforts mainly focus on
making recommendations based on relatively recent behaviors. However, the
overall sequential data may not be effectively utilized, as early interactions
might affect users' current choices. Also, it has become intolerable to scan
the entire behavior sequence when performing inference for each user, since
real-world system requires short response time. To bridge the gap, we propose a
novel long sequential recommendation model, called Dynamic Memory-based
Attention Network (DMAN). It segments the overall long behavior sequence into a
series of sub-sequences, then trains the model and maintains a set of memory
blocks to preserve long-term interests of users. To improve memory fidelity,
DMAN dynamically abstracts each user's long-term interest into its own memory
blocks by minimizing an auxiliary reconstruction loss. Based on the dynamic

  Storage Systems",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, many enterprises are facing the difficulties brought out by the
limitation of warehouse land and the increase of loan cost. As a promising
approach to improve space utilization rate, puzzle-based storage systems
(PBSSs) are drawing more attention from logistics researchers. In previous
research about PBSS, concentration has been paid to single target item
problems. However, there are no consensus algorithms to solve load retrievals
route programming in PBSSs with multiple target items. In this paper, a
heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve load retrievals route programming in
PBSSs with multiple target items, multiple escorts and multiple IOs. In this
paper, new concepts about the proposed algorithm are defined, including target
IOs, target position of escorts, number of escorts required, et al. Then, the
decision procedures are designed according to these concepts. Based on Markov
decision process, the proposed algorithm makes the decision of the next action
by analyzing the current status, until all the target items arrive at the IOs.
The case study results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed heuristic algorithm.

be a change between the two modelling regimes. Recent extensions to the coronal
modelling for carbon and oxygen lines in the solar transition region have shown
improvements in the emission of singly- and doubly-charged ions, along with
Li-like ions. However, discrepancies still remain, particularly for
singly-charged ions and intercombination lines. The aim of this work is to
explore additional atomic processes that could further alter the charge state
distribution and the level populations within ions, in order to resolve some of
the discrepancies. To this end, excitation and ionisation caused by both the
radiation field and by atom-ion collisions have been included, along with
recombination through charge transfer. The modelling is carried out using
conditions which would be present in the quiet Sun, which allows an assessment
of the part atomic processes play in changing coronal modelling, separately
from dynamic and transient events taking place in the plasma. The effect the
processes have on the fractional ion populations are presented, as well as the
change in level populations brought about by the new excitation mechanisms.
Contribution functions of selected lines from low charge states are also shown,

Without
query from user, it is challenging for system to match user traffic and ads
suitably. System packs up a group of users with common properties such as the
same gender or similar shopping interests into a crowd. Here term crowd can be
viewed as a tag over users. Then advertisers bid for different crowds and
deliver their ads to those targeted users. Matching module in most industrial
display advertising systems follows a two-stage paradigm. When receiving a user
request, matching system (i) finds the crowds that the user belongs to; (ii)
retrieves all ads that have targeted those crowds. However, in applications
such as display advertising at Alibaba, with very large volumes of crowds and
ads, both stages of matching have to truncate the long-tailed parts for online
serving, under limited latency. That's to say, not all ads have the chance to
participate in online matching. This results in sub-optimal result for both
advertising performance and platform revenue. In this paper, we study the
truncation problem and propose a Truncation Free Matching System (TFMS). The
basic idea is to decouple the matching computation from the online pipeline.
Instead of executing the two-stage matching when user visits, TFMS utilizes a
near-line truncation-free matching to pre-calculate and store those top
valuable ads for each user. Then the online pipeline just needs to fetch the
pre-stored ads as matching results. In this way, we can jump out of online
system's latency and computation cost limitations, and leverage flexible
computation resource to finish the user-ad matching. TFMS has been deployed in
our productive system since 2019, bringing (i) more than 50% improvement of
impressions for advertisers who encountered truncation before, (ii) 9.4%
Revenue Per Mile gain, which is significant enough for the business.

generated from a convex semi-definite programme that minimises the worst-case

this approximation error are obtained and the approach can be applied to a wide

become inevitable to analyze and quickly get results from this data. Most of
the relational databases primarily support SQL querying with a limited support
for complex data analysis. Due to this reason, data scientists have no other
option, but to use a different system for complex data analysis. Due to this,
data science frameworks are in huge demand. But to use such a framework, all
the data needs to be loaded into it. This requires significant data movement
across multiple systems, which can be expensive.
  We believe that it has become the need of the hour to come up with a single
system which can perform both data analysis tasks and SQL querying. This will
save the data scientists from the expensive data transfer operation across
systems. In our work, we present DaskDB, a system built over the Python's Dask
framework, which is a scalable data science system having support for both data
analytics and in situ SQL query processing over heterogeneous data sources.
DaskDB supports invoking any Python APIs as User-Defined Functions (UDF) over
SQL queries. So, it can be easily integrated with most existing Python data
science applications, without modifying the existing code. Since joining two
relations is a very vital but expensive operation, so a novel distributed
learned index is also introduced to improve the join performance. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that DaskDB significantly outperforms
existing systems.

society during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as they need regular
treatments in a hospital environment, facing infection risk. Moreover, the
demand for dialysis resources has significantly increased since many COVID-19
patients need acute dialysis due to kidney failure. In this study, we address
capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic located within a major
hospital in Istanbul, designated to serve both infected and uninfected patients
during the pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The
hemodialysis clinic applies a three-unit cohorting strategy to treat four types
of patients in separate units and at different times to mitigate infection
spread risk among patients. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the
clinic needs to determine the number of available dialysis machines to allocate
to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. Given the uncertainties in
the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis, it is a
challenge to allocate the scarce dialysis resources effectively by evaluating
which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions
of infected and uninfected patients over a week. We represent the uncertainties
in the number of patients by a set of scenarios and present a two-stage
stochastic programming approach to support capacity allocation decisions of the
clinic. We present a case study based on the real-world patient data obtained
from the clinic to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling

distribution of the local Red Clump (RC) giants from the APOGEE. Working within
a Bayesian approach, we sample the posterior probability distribution in a

spatial distribution and motion of the Gaia stars imply two recent SF bursts

enhancement, respectively, relative to a monotonously declining SFR continuum.
The stellar populations associated with this SF excess are found to be

displacement equation for the desired zoom system are derived by restricting
specific matrix elements. Properly selected trajectory of the particular

optimize the parameters to retrieve the optimum zoom trajectory in specific

changes as a stream of asynchronous ""events"". They offer significant advantages
compared to standard cameras due to their high temporal resolution, high
dynamic range and lack of motion blur. However, events only measure the varying
component of the visual signal, which limits their ability to encode scene
context. By contrast, standard cameras measure absolute intensity frames, which
capture a much richer representation of the scene. Both sensors are thus
complementary. However, due to the asynchronous nature of events, combining
them with synchronous images remains challenging, especially for learning-based
methods. This is because traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not
designed for asynchronous and irregular data from additional sensors. To
address this challenge, we introduce Recurrent Asynchronous Multimodal (RAM)
networks, which generalize traditional RNNs to handle asynchronous and
irregular data from multiple sensors. Inspired by traditional RNNs, RAM
networks maintain a hidden state that is updated asynchronously and can be
queried at any time to generate a prediction. We apply this novel architecture
to monocular depth estimation with events and frames where we show an
improvement over state-of-the-art methods by up to 30% in terms of mean
absolute depth error. To enable further research on multimodal learning with
events, we release EventScape, a new dataset with events, intensity frames,
semantic labels, and depth maps recorded in the CARLA simulator.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These networks, although effective in
multiple tasks such as classification or object detection, tend to focus on the
most discriminative part of an object rather than retrieving all its relevant
features. This behavior penalizes the performance of a CNN for the
re-identification task, since it should identify diverse and fine grained
features. It is then essential to make the network learn a wide variety of
finer characteristics in order to make the re-identification process of people
effective and robust to finer changes. In this article, we introduce Deep
Miner, a method that allows CNNs to ""mine"" richer and more diverse features
about people for their re-identification. Deep Miner is specifically composed
of three types of branches: a Global branch (G-branch), a Local branch
(L-branch) and an Input-Erased branch (IE-branch). G-branch corresponds to the
initial backbone which predicts global characteristics, while L-branch
retrieves part level resolution features. The IE-branch for its part, receives
partially suppressed feature maps as input thereby allowing the network to
""mine"" new features (those ignored by G-branch) as output. For this special
purpose, a dedicated suppression procedure for identifying and removing
features within a given CNN is introduced. This suppression procedure has the
major benefit of being simple, while it produces a model that significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) re-identification methods. Specifically, we
conduct experiments on four standard person re-identification benchmarks and
witness an absolute performance gain up to 6.5% mAP compared to SOTA.

greater effective spins because of strong tidal forces. In the local Universe,
about 16% of merging BBHs get effective spins larger than 0.1 even if BHs and
their progenitors do not get spin angular momenta other than tidal forces
exerted by their companion stars. If we assume that WR stars have flat and

phases, the effective spin distribution of merging BBHs is similar to that

Ia) is still under debate. Symbiotic channel is one of the possible progenitor
scenarios, in which the WDs in these systems increase in mass through wind
accretion from their red giant companions. The mass-loss processes of the
giants in the symbiotic systems could produce amount of circumstellar medium
(CSM), and the detections of the interaction signals between SN ejecta and CSM
can be used as an ideal way to distinguish the different progenitor models.
However, the density distribution and geometric structure of the CSM around the
symbiotic systems remain highly uncertain. By assuming that the tidal torque
from binary interaction can increase the mass-loss rate of the red giant and
cause the stellar wind concentrate towards the equatorial plane, we provide a
simplified method to estimate the density and the degree of deviation from
spherical symmetry of the CSM. Based on the calculations of the binary
evolutions of symbiotic systems using stellar evolution code MESA, we obtained
the parameter space for producing SNe Ia. We found that SNe Ia could originate
from symbiotic systems with massive carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs), while
the half-opening angle of the stellar wind from red giant towards the WD varies
with the binary evolution, resulting in the formation of surrounding CSM with
different geometric structures. The corresponding properties of ejecta-CSM
interactions may be examined by the spectropolarimetry observations in the
future, from which one may find additional relationship between circumstellar

In this paper, we employ the time-delay cosmography measurements from seven
lenses (here abbreviated as the TD data) to constrain interacting dark energy
(IDE) models. We mainly focus on the scenario of vacuum energy (with $w=-1$)
interacting with cold dark matter, and consider four typical cases of the
interaction form $Q$. When the TD data alone are employed, we find that the IDE
models with $Q\propto \rho_{\rm de}$ seem to have an advantage in relieving the
$H_{0}$ tension between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and TD data. When
the TD data are added to the CMB$+$BAO$+$SN$+H_0$ data, we find that: (i) the
coupling parameter $\beta$ in all the considered IDE models is positive within
1$\sigma$ range, implying a mild preference for the case of cold dark matter
decaying into dark energy; (ii) the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm
c}$ slightly relieves the $S_8$ tension, but the other considered IDE models
further aggravate this tension; (iii) the Akaike information criteria of the
IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm c}$ are lower than that of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, indicating that these IDE models are more preferred by the
current mainstream data. We conclude that the considered IDE models have their
own different advantages when the TD data are employed, and none of them can

perovskite quantum dots by applying unbiased Bayesian inference analysis
methods. We apply changepoint analysis (CPA) and a Bayesian state clustering
algorithm to determine the timing of switching events and the number of states
between which switching occurs in a statistically unbiased manner, which we
have benchmarked particularly to apply to highly multistate emitters. We
conclude that perovskite quantum dots display a plethora of gray states in
which brightness broadly speaking correlates inversely with decay rate,
confirming the multiple recombination centers model. We leverage the CPA
partitioning analysis to examine aging and memory effects. We find that dots
tend to return to the bright state before jumping to a dim state, and that when
choosing a dim state they tend to explore the entire set of states available.

pose estimation and propose to learn pose inference based on geometrically
stable patches extracted from observed 3D point clouds. According to the theory
of geometric stability analysis, a minimal set of three planar/cylindrical
patches are geometrically stable and determine the full 6DoFs of the object
pose. We train a deep neural network to regress 6D object pose based on
geometrically stable patch groups via learning both intra-patch geometric
features and inter-patch contextual features. A subnetwork is jointly trained
to predict per-patch poses. This auxiliary task is a relaxation of the group
pose prediction: A single patch cannot determine the full 6DoFs but is able to
improve pose accuracy in its corresponding DoFs. Working with patch groups
makes our method generalize well for random occlusion and unseen instances. The
method is easily amenable to resolve symmetry ambiguities. Our method achieves
the state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks compared not only to
depth-only but also to RGBD methods. It also performs well in category-level
pose estimation.

struggle with several limitations such as many false positive results and low
sensitivity. The detection of specific biomarkers is of high interest to
complement these conventional screening methods. The objective of this study is
to prove the power of 1H-NMR in metabolomics for the detection of smoking
behavior, which is the leading risk factor for lung cancer, and as such gain
more insights in the metabolic alterations that are caused by smoking. In this
research, 1H-NMR spectra of human blood plasma samples were divided in 110
integration regions, from which the integration values were used to train an
OPLS-DA classification model that underwent further data reduction. Results
show that a classification model could discriminate between individuals based
on their smoking status with a sensitivity of 96 percent and a specificity of
94 percent. This study also demonstrates that by performing a pathway-specific
variable reduction of almost 50 percent, the sensitivity and specificity of the
model almost remains the same. To conclude, 1H-NMR analyses show that the
bloods metabolic profile of a smoker is altered compared to that of a
non-smoker. Also, pathway-specific variable reduction shows great potential to
perform overall data reduction. This workflow could be interesting to apply in
the identification of lung cancer, to potentially detect specific biomarkers.

propose a policy gradient algorithm that leverages the analytical structure of
the reward function to approximate its derivative and improve stability. We
show that this scheme outperforms alternative popular RL approaches, and
generalizes to scenarios that were not seen during training. Our experiments,

using the conventional supervisory control theory, existing methods abstract TA
to finite automata (FA). For many applications, the abstraction of real-time

supervisory control synthesis algorithm directly applicable to the TA without
any abstraction. The plant is given as a TA with a set of uncontrollable events
and a set of forcible events. Forcible events can preempt the passage of time
when needed. The synthesis algorithm works by iteratively strengthening the
guards of edges labeled by controllable events and invariants of locations
where the progression of time can be preempted by forcible events. The
synthesized supervisor, which is also a TA, is guaranteed to be controllable,
maximally permissive, and results in a nonblocking and safe supervised plant.

This paper proposes a Domain Adaptive Learning method based on Sample-Dependent

propose a sample-dependent and learnable Positive Definite Quadratic Kernel

mean discrepancy between the data of source domain and target domain and then
transforms the data into an optimized RKHS generated by PDQK. We conduct a

processing large graphs. Currently there is a gap in the space of available
partitioning algorithms. On the one hand, there are streaming algorithms that
have been adopted to partition massive graph data on small machines. In the
streaming model, vertices arrive one at a time including their neighborhood and
then have to be assigned directly to a block. These algorithms can partition
huge graphs quickly with little memory, but they produce partitions with low
solution quality. On the other hand, there are offline (shared-memory)
multilevel algorithms that produce partitions with high quality but also need a
machine with enough memory. We make a first step to close this gap by
presenting an algorithm that computes significantly improved partitions of huge
graphs using a single machine with little memory in streaming setting. First,
we adopt the buffered streaming model which is a more reasonable approach in
practice. In this model, a processing element can store a buffer, or batch, of
nodes before making assignment decisions. When our algorithm receives a batch
of nodes, we build a model graph that represents the nodes of the batch and the
already present partition structure. This model enables us to apply multilevel
algorithms and in turn compute much higher quality solutions of huge graphs on
cheap machines than previously possible. To partition the model, we develop a
multilevel algorithm that optimizes an objective function that has previously
shown to be effective for the streaming setting. This also removes the
dependency on the number of blocks k from the running time compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Overall, our algorithm computes, on average, 75.9%
better solutions than Fennel using a very small buffer size. In addition, for
large values of k our algorithm becomes faster than Fennel.

document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process
the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual
re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous
literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used
as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each
printing command according to its structural function in the page. This
approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more
fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual
methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure
resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more
naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing
commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and
it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to
deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through
extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature
engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average
F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we

decision may depend on the entire history of inputs. If many computers run the

times, they do not necessarily make consistent decisions.
  In this work we introduce time-local online algorithms. These are online
algorithms where the output at a given time only depends on $T = O(1)$ latest
inputs. The use of (deterministic) time-local algorithms in a distributed
setting automatically leads to globally consistent decisions.
  Our key observation is that time-local online algorithms (in which the output
at a given time only depends on local inputs in the temporal dimension) are
closely connected to local distributed graph algorithms (in which the output of
a given node only depends on local inputs in the spatial dimension). This makes
it possible to interpret prior work on distributed graph algorithms from the
perspective of online algorithms.
  We describe an algorithm synthesis method that one can use to design optimal
time-local online algorithms for small values of $T$. We demonstrate the power
of the technique in the context of a variant of the online file migration
problem, and show that e.g. for two nodes and unit migration costs there exists
a $3$-competitive time-local algorithm with horizon $T=4$, while no
deterministic online algorithm (in the classic sense) can do better. We also
derive upper and lower bounds for a more general version of the problem; we
show that there is a $6$-competitive deterministic time-local algorithm and a
$2.62$-competitive randomized time-local algorithm for any migration cost

key to advancing technological applications in energy storage, neuromorphic
electronics, and bioelectronics. However, ions that are extrinsic to the host
materials possess challenges in fabrication of devices as there are extra steps
of ion intercalation. This results in degradation of the long-term stability of
the intercalated atomically thin structures. Here, we introduce large-area
single-crystal ultra-thin layered MnO$_2$ via chemical vapor deposition,
spontaneously intercalated by potassium ions during the synthesis. We studied
the ultra-thin 2D K-MnO$_2$ in detail and showed that charge transport in these
crystals is dominated by motion of hydrated potassium ions in the interlayer
space. Moreover, K-MnO$_2$ crystals exhibit reversible layered-to-spinel phase
transition accompanied by an optical contrast change based on the electrical
and optical modulation of the potassium and the interlayer water concentration.
We used the electric field driven ionic motion in K-MnO$_2$ based devices to
demonstrate the memristive properties of two terminal devices. As a possible

the system operation in response to problems and increasing risk in the

Traditional techniques for risk assessment focus on design-time techniques such
as hazard analysis, risk reduction, and assurance cases among others. However,
these static, design-time techniques do not consider the dynamic contexts and
failures the systems face at runtime. We hypothesize that this requires a
dynamic assurance approach that computes the likelihood of unsafe conditions or
system failures considering the safety requirements, assumptions made at design
time, past failures in a given operating context, and the likelihood of system
component failures. We introduce the ReSonAte dynamic risk estimation framework
for autonomous systems. ReSonAte reasons over Bow-Tie Diagrams (BTDs) which
capture information about hazard propagation paths and control strategies. Our
innovation is the extension of the BTD formalism with attributes for modeling
the conditional relationships with the state of the system and environment. We
also describe a technique for estimating these conditional relationships and
equations for estimating risk based on the state of the system and environment.
To help with this process, we provide a scenario modeling procedure that can
use the prior distributions of the scenes and threat conditions to generate the

scalability and reduce the amount of data required, this process considers each

linear programming, compared with the previous stage of obtaining nearly

if smartly taking advantage of problem characteristics and implementing
customized strategies. Among the important linear programming problems, many of
them arise from network applications and exhibit network structure. We look to
the tree structure of the optimal solutions and propose a tree-based crossover

be confirmed. The relations between the characteristics of these planetary
systems and the kinematics, Galactic components, and ages of their host stars
have yet to be well explored. Aiming to addressing these questions, we conduct
a research project, dubbed as PAST (Planets Across Space and Time). To do this,
one of the key steps is to accurately characterize the planet host stars. In
this paper, the Paper I of the PAST series, we revisit the kinematic method for
classification of Galactic components and extend the applicable range of
velocity ellipsoid from about 100 pc to 1, 500 pc from the sun in order to
cover most known planet hosts. Furthermore, we revisit the Age-Velocity
dispersion Relation (AVR), which allows us to derive kinematic age with a
typical uncertainty of 10-20% for an ensemble of stars. Applying the above
revised methods, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e. Galactic
positions, velocities, the relative membership probabilities among the thin
disk, thick disk, Hercules stream, and the halo) as well as other basic stellar
parameters for 2,174 host stars of 2,872 planets by combining data from Gaia,
LAMOST, APOGEE, RAVE, and the NASA exoplanet archive. The revised kinematic
method and AVR as well as the stellar catalog of kinematic properties and ages
lay foundation for future studies on exoplanets from two dimensions of space
and time in the Galactic context.

inversion symmetry, introduce a sublattice structure corresponding to an extra

Based on the superconducting fitness analysis and the quasiclassical
Eilenberger equations, we discuss two limits: Rashba spin-orbit coupling and
inter-layer hopping dominated normal state. In both limits, we are able find
two scenarios that generate phase diagrams in qualitative agreement with
experiments: i) intra-sublattice pairing with an even-odd transition under
magnetic field, and ii) inter-sublattice pairing with an odd-odd transition

Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from a given piece of text, if an

attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is an
important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data,
suicide notes, or other similar verified sources, web query data has emerged as
a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity

suicide versus depression classification method through a deep learning

we utilize a k-nearest neighbor entropy estimator in the low-dimensional

clarified on the basis of the classification of the representations of the

the generating role of the algebras localized in small, topological trivial,
regions, ii) diffeomorphism covariance, which guarantees the intrinsic

freedom with respect to the Schroedinger representation. The locally normal
representations of the resulting observable algebra are classified by unitary
representations of the fundamental group of the manifold, which actually
generate an observable, ""topological"", subalgebra. The result is confronted
with the standard approach based on the introduction of the universal covering
${\tilde{\cal M}}$ of $\cal{M}$ and on the decomposition of $L^2({\tilde{\cal

of a gauge group. It is shown that in this way one obtains all the

mainly focused on determining the structural and dynamical conditions driving a
set of interacting units to a coherent state globally stable. However, little
attention has been paid to the description of the dynamical development of each
individual networked unit in the process towards the synchronization of the
whole ensemble. In this paper, we show how in a network of identical dynamical
systems, nodes belonging to the same degree class differentiate in the same
manner visiting a sequence of states of diverse complexity along the route to
synchronization independently on the global network structure. In particular,
we observe, just after interaction starts pulling orbits from the initially
uncoupled attractor, a general reduction of the complexity of the dynamics of
all units being more pronounced in those with higher connectivity. In the weak
coupling regime, when synchronization starts to build up, there is an increase
in the dynamical complexity whose maximum is achieved, in general, first in the
hubs due to their earlier synchronization with the mean field. For very strong
coupling, just before complete synchronization, we found a hierarchical
dynamical differentiation with lower degree nodes being the ones exhibiting the
largest complexity departure. We unveil how this differentiation route holds
for several models of nonlinear dynamics including toroidal chaos and how it
depends on the coupling function. This study provides new insights to
understand better strategies for network identification and control or to

a non-negative least squares analysis employing a Gaussian basis, and
demonstrate the improved recovery of bimodal Gaussian distribution functions as

decreased dependence of the end result on the optimality of regularization

through thermal stimulus. Performance metrics include transmittance, passband
center wavelength (CWL), and bandwidth; ideally monitored during operation (in
situ) or after a set number of tuning cycles to validate real-time operation.
Measuring these aforementioned metrics in real-time is challenging.
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides the gold-standard for
performance characterization, yet is expensive and inflexible -- incorporating
the PCM tuning mechanism is not straightforward, hence in situ electro-optical
measurements are challenging. In this work, we implement an open-source
MATLAB-controlled real-time performance characterization system consisting of
an inexpensive linear variable filter (LVF) and mid-wave infrared camera,
capable of switching the PCM-based filters while simultaneously recording in

are calculated through pixel intensity measurements and displayed on a
custom-developed graphical user interface in real-time. The CWL is determined
through spatial position of intensity maxima along the LVF's longitudinal axis.
Furthermore, plans are detailed for a future experimental system that further
reduces cost, is compact, and utilizes a near-infrared camera.

decennium' ended by the discovery of electromagnetic induction by Faraday
(1831). During this decennium, in several experiments, the electromagnetic
induction was there, but it was not seen or recognized. Faraday built up a
local theory of electromagnetic induction based on the idea that there is an
induced current when there is an intersection between lines of magnetic force
and a conductor in relative motion. In 1873, Maxwell, within a Lagrangian
description of electric currents, wrote down a 'general law of electromagnetic
induction' in which a fundamental role is played by the vector potential. A
modern reformulation of Maxwell's general law is based on the definition of the
induced emf as the line integral of the Lorentz force on a unit positive charge
and the use of the equation that relates the electric field to the potentials.
Maxwell's general law has been rapidly forgotten; instead, the ""flux rule"" has
deeply taken root. The ""flux rule"" not always yields the correct prediction, it
does not say where the induced emf is localized, it requires ad hoc choices of
the integration paths. It is not a physical law but only a calculation tool. To
understand why Maxwell's `general law' has been forgotten, also a sample of
representative textbooks, distributed over about a century, has been analyzed.
In this framework, a part of the paper deals with the idea of rotating lines of
magnetic force, falsified by Faraday, but common in the first decades of the
Twentieth century and astonishingly resumed recently. It is shown that this
hypothesis is incompatible with Maxwell - Lorentz - Einstein electromagnetism
and that it is falsified also by recent experiments. Finally, the
electromagnetic induction in some recent research papers is briefly discussed.

sequence processing. However, if many works create extensions and improvements
of the RNN, few have focused on developing other ways for sequential data
processing with neural networks in a ""term-to-term"" way. This paper proposes
the original Hidden Neural Markov Chain (HNMC) framework, a new family of
sequential neural models. They are not based on the RNN but on the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM), a probabilistic graphical model. This neural extension is
possible thanks to the recent Entropic Forward-Backward algorithm for HMM
restoration. We propose three different models: the classic HNMC, the HNMC2,
and the HNMC-CN. After describing our models' whole construction, we compare
them with classic RNN and Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) models for some sequence

For every experiment, whatever the architecture or the embedding method used,
one of our proposed models has the best results. It shows this new neural
sequential framework's potential, which can open the way to new models, and

community has typically been seen as untyped. We consider the benefits of user
provided types on background knowledge. Building on the Meta-Interpretive
Learning (MIL) framework, we show that type checking is able to prune large
parts of the hypothesis space of programs. The introduction of polymorphic type
checking to the MIL approach to logic program synthesis is validated by strong
theoretical and experimental results, showing a cubic reduction in the size of
the search space and synthesis time, in terms of the number of typed background
predicates. Additionally we are able to infer polymorphic types of synthesized
clauses and of entire programs. The other advancement is in developing an
approach to leveraging refinement types in ILP. Here we show that further
pruning of the search space can be achieved, though the SMT solving used for

crucial role in modern financial risk control. But real-world credit rating
data usually shows long-tail distributions, which means heavy class imbalanced
problem challenging the corporate credit rating system greatly. To tackle that,
inspried by the recent advances of pre-train techniques in self-supervised
representation learning, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive
Pre-training for Corporate Credit Rating (CP4CCR), which utilizes the
self-surpervision for getting over class imbalance. Specifically, we propose
to, in the first phase, exert constrastive self-superivised pre-training
without label information, which want to learn a better class-agnostic
initialization. During this phase, two self-supervised task are developed
within CP4CCR: (i) Feature Masking (FM) and (ii) Feature Swapping(FS). In the
second phase, we can train any standard corporate redit rating model
initialized by the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments conducted on the
Chinese public-listed corporate rating dataset, prove that CP4CCR can improve
the performance of standard corporate credit rating models, especially for
class with few samples.

experience and accelerating innovation in software. However, since experiments
are typically limited in duration, observed treatment effects are not always
permanently stable, sometimes revealing increasing or decreasing patterns over
time. There are multiple causes for a treatment effect to change over time. In
this paper, we focus on a particular cause, user-learning, which is primarily
associated with novelty or primacy. Novelty describes the desire to use new
technology that tends to diminish over time. Primacy describes the growing
engagement with technology as a result of adoption of the innovation.
User-learning estimation is critical because it holds experimentation
responsible for trustworthiness, empowers organizations to make better
decisions by providing a long-term view of expected impact, and prevents user
dissatisfaction. In this paper, we propose an observational approach, based on
difference-in-differences technique to estimate user-learning at scale. We use
this approach to test and estimate user-learning in many experiments at
Microsoft. We compare our approach with the existing experimental method to
show its benefits in terms of ease of use and higher statistical power, and to
discuss its limitation in presence of other forms of treatment interaction with
time.

open source simulation platform, termed Open SOUrce Market Simulator (OSOUM) to
analyze trading markets and specifically data markets. We also describe and
implement a specific data market model, consisting of two types of agents:
sellers who own various datasets available for acquisition, and buyers
searching for relevant and beneficial datasets for purchase. The current
simulation treats data as an infinite supply product. Yet, other market
settings may be easily implemented using OSOUM. Although commercial frameworks,
intended for handling data markets, already exist, we provide a free and
extensive end-to-end research tool for simulating possible behavior for both
buyers and sellers participating in (data) markets.

both on the financial market and on claim arrival intensities and claim sizes
of insurers. Thus, when optimal investment and reinsurance strategies have to
be determined it is important to consider models which reflect this dependence.
In this paper we make a proposal how to generate dependence between the
financial market and claim sizes in times of crisis and determine via a
stochastic control approach an optimal investment and reinsurance strategy
which maximizes the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth. Moreover,
we also allow that the claim size distribution may be learned in the model. We
give comparisons and bounds on the optimal strategy using simple models. What
turns out to be very surprising is that numerical results indicate that even a
minimal dependence which is created in this model has a huge impact on the
control in the sense that the insurer is much more prudent then.

simulation. They solve discretized, complex physical equations in order to
compute evolutionary states of dynamical systems, such as the hydrodynamics of
a lake. However, high-resolution numerical solutions using such models are
extremely computational and time consuming, often requiring a high performance
computing architecture to be executed satisfactorily. Machine learning
(ML)-based low-dimensional surrogate models are a promising alternative to
speed up these simulations without undermining the quality of predictions. In
this work, we develop two examples of fast, reliable, low-dimensional surrogate
models to produce a 36 hour forecast of the depth-averaged hydrodynamics at
Lake George NY, USA. Our ML approach uses two widespread artificial neural
network (ANN) architectures: fully connected neural networks and long
short-term memory. These ANN architectures are first validated in the
deterministic and chaotic regimes of the Lorenz system and then combined with
proper orthogonal decomposition (to reduce the dimensionality of the incoming
input data) to emulate the depth-averaged hydrodynamics of a flow simulator
called SUNTANS. Results show the ANN-based reduced order models have promising
accuracy levels (within 6% of the prediction range) and advocate for further
investigation into hydrodynamic applications.

associated with fields whose Lagrangian densities are expressed as the dot
product of two multivector fields, e. g., scalar or gauge fields, in flat

methods to deal with the invariance of the action to infinitesimal space-time
translations; this direct derivation avoids the use of the canonical tensor.
Formulas for the tensor components and for the tensor itself are derived for
generic values of the multivector grade $s$ and of the number of time and space
dimensions, $k$ and $n$, respectively. A simple, coordinate-free, closed-form
expression for the interior derivative (divergence) of the symmetric
stress-energy-momentum tensor is also obtained: this expression provides a
natural generalization of the Lorentz force that appears in the context of the
electromagnetic theory. Applications of the formulas derived in this paper to
