as they employ standard time-averaging based estimators which suffer
significant information loss if the market observables are non-stationary. To
this end, we reformulate the portfolio optimization problem in the spectral
domain to cater for the nonstationarity inherent to asset price movements and,
in this way, allow for optimal capital allocations to be time-varying. Unlike
existing spectral portfolio techniques, the proposed framework employs
augmented complex statistics in order to exploit the interactions between the
real and imaginary parts of the complex spectral variables, which in turn
allows for the modelling of both harmonics and cyclostationarity in the time
domain. The advantages of the proposed framework over traditional methods are
demonstrated through numerical simulations using real-world price data.

the point-splitting method is then applied, since it is a valuable tool for
regularizing divergent observables. Among these, the stress-energy tensor is
expressed in terms of second covariant derivatives of the Hadamard Green
function, which is also closely linked to the effective action; therefore one
obtains a series expansion for the stress-energy tensor. Its divergent part can
be isolated, and a concise formula is here obtained: by dimensional analysis
and combinatorics, there are two kinds of terms: quadratic in curvature tensors
(Riemann, Ricci tensors and scalar curvature) and linear in their second
covariant derivatives. This formula holds for every space-time metric; it is
made even more explicit in the physically relevant particular cases of
Ricci-flat and maximally symmetric spaces, and fully evaluated for some
examples of physical interest: Kerr and Schwarzschild metrics and de Sitter

a fixed behavior policy in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision
process (MDP). While existing analyses of common approaches, such as fitted
$Q$-iteration (FQI), suggest a $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ convergence for regret,
empirical behavior exhibits much faster convergence. In this paper, we present
a finer regret analysis that exactly characterizes this phenomenon by providing
fast rates for the regret convergence. First, we show that given any estimate
for the optimal quality function $Q^*$, the regret of the policy it defines
converges at a rate given by the exponentiation of the $Q^*$-estimate's
pointwise convergence rate, thus speeding it up. The level of exponentiation
depends on the level of noise in the decision-making problem, rather than the
estimation problem. We establish such noise levels for linear and tabular MDPs
as examples. Second, we provide new analyses of FQI and Bellman residual
minimization to establish the correct pointwise convergence guarantees. As
specific cases, our results imply $O(1/n)$ regret rates in linear cases and
$\exp(-\Omega(n))$ regret rates in tabular cases.

experimentally demonstrate a superconductor completely free of quasiparticles

mesoscopic superconductor in real time by measuring the charge tunneling to a
normal metal contact. Quiet, excitation-free periods are interrupted by
random-in-time Cooper pair breaking events, followed by a burst of charge
tunneling within a millisecond. Our results demonstrate the possibility of
operating devices without quasiparticles with potentially improved performance.
In addition, our experiment probes the origins of nonequilibrium quasiparticles

first model is novel in the sense that it is divided into two phases: the first
phase obtains a crude estimate of the optical flow and then the second phase
refines this estimate using additional constraints. The correctness of this

estimation of angle by performing an anisotropic regularization of the

efficient. In fact, we empirically demonstrate that the single-phase and the

some set of alternatives to a non-empty subset of alternatives. The
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem has shown that only extremely restrictive SCFs
are strategyproof when there are more than two alternatives. For set-valued
SCFs, or so-called social choice correspondences, the situation is less clear.
There are miscellaneous - mostly negative - results using a variety of
strategyproofness notions and additional requirements. The simple and intuitive
notion of Kelly-strategyproofness has turned out to be particularly compelling
because it is weak enough to still allow for positive results. For example, the
Pareto rule is strategyproof even when preferences are weak, and a number of
attractive SCFs (such as the top cycle, the uncovered set, and the essential
set) are strategyproof for strict preferences. In this paper, we show that, for
weak preferences, only indecisive SCFs can satisfy strategyproofness. In
particular, (i) every strategyproof rank-based SCF violates Pareto-optimality,
(ii) every strategyproof support-based SCF (which generalize Fishburn's C2
SCFs) that satisfies Pareto-optimality returns at least one most preferred
alternative of every voter, and (iii) every strategyproof non-imposing SCF
returns the Condorcet loser in at least one profile. We also discuss the
consequences of these results for randomized social choice.

in disaster time for urban management. Most existing traditional methods for
change detection are categorized based on pixel or objects. Object-based models
are preferred to pixel-based methods for handling very high-resolution remote
sensing (VHR RS) images. Such methods can benefit from the ongoing research on
deep learning. In this paper, a fully automatic change-detection algorithm on
VHR RS images is proposed that deploys Fully Convolutional Siamese Concatenate
networks (FC-Siam-Conc). The proposed method uses preprocessing and an
attention gate layer to improve accuracy. Gaussian attention (GA) as a soft
visual attention mechanism is used for preprocessing. GA helps the network to
handle feature maps like biological visual systems. Since the GA parameters
cannot be adjusted during network training, an attention gate layer is
introduced to play the role of GA with parameters that can be tuned among other
network parameters. Experimental results obtained on Onera Satellite Change

Previous results show that clusters in Euclidean spaces that are convex and
separated with a margin can be reconstructed exactly using only $O(\log n)$
same-cluster queries, where $n$ is the number of input points. In this work, we
study this problem in the more challenging non-convex setting. We introduce a
structural characterization of clusters, called $(\beta,\gamma)$-convexity,
that can be applied to any finite set of points equipped with a metric (or even
a semimetric, as the triangle inequality is not needed). Using
$(\beta,\gamma)$-convexity, we can translate natural density properties of
clusters (which include, for instance, clusters that are strongly non-convex in
$\mathbb{R}^d$) into a graph-theoretic notion of convexity. By exploiting this
convexity notion, we design a deterministic algorithm that recovers
$(\beta,\gamma)$-convex clusters using $O(k^2 \log n + k^2
(6/\beta\gamma)^{dens(X)})$ same-cluster queries, where $k$ is the number of
clusters and $dens(X)$ is the density dimension of the semimetric. We show that
an exponential dependence on the density dimension is necessary, and we also
show that, if we are allowed to make $O(k^2 + k\log n)$ additional queries to a
""cluster separation"" oracle, then we can recover clusters that have different

Here, we present an analysis of data from four studies which sought to forecast
the outcomes of replication projects in the social and behavioural sciences,
using human experts who participated in prediction markets and answered
surveys. Because the number of findings replicated and predicted in each
individual study was small, pooling the data offers an opportunity to evaluate
hypotheses regarding the performance of prediction markets and surveys at a
higher power. In total, peer beliefs were elicited for the replication outcomes
of 103 published findings. We find there is information within the scientific

Our results show prediction markets can determine the outcomes of direct

  Hierarchical Planning",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To make good decisions in the real world people need efficient planning
strategies because their computational resources are limited. Knowing which
planning strategies would work best for people in different situations would be
very useful for understanding and improving human decision-making. But our
ability to compute those strategies used to be limited to very small and very
simple planning tasks. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we introduce
a cognitively-inspired reinforcement learning method that can overcome this
limitation by exploiting the hierarchical structure of human behavior. The
basic idea is to decompose sequential decision problems into two sub-problems:
setting a goal and planning how to achieve it. This hierarchical decomposition
enables us to discover optimal strategies for human planning in larger and more
complex tasks than was previously possible. The discovered strategies
outperform existing planning algorithms and achieve a super-human level of
computational efficiency. We demonstrate that teaching people to use those
strategies significantly improves their performance in sequential
decision-making tasks that require planning up to eight steps ahead. By
contrast, none of the previous approaches was able to improve human performance
on these problems. These findings suggest that our cognitively-informed
approach makes it possible to leverage reinforcement learning to improve human
decision-making in complex sequential decision-problems. Future work can
leverage our method to develop decision support systems that improve human
decision making in the real world.

diffusion gradients, which introduce artefacts that can impair subsequent
diffusion metric analysis. Existing retrospective correction techniques that
correct for diffusion gradient induced eddy currents do not account for eddy
current decay, which is generally effective for traditional Pulsed Gradient
Spin Echo (PGSE) diffusion encoding. However, these techniques do not
necessarily apply to advanced forms of dMRI that require substantial gradient
slewing, such as Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo (OGSE).
  Methods: An in-house algorithm (TVEDDY), that for the first time
retrospectively models eddy current decay, was tested on PGSE and OGSE brain
images acquired at 7T. Correction performance was compared to conventional
correction methods by evaluating the mean-squared error (MSE) between
diffusion-weighted images acquired with opposite polarity diffusion gradients.
As a ground truth comparison, images were corrected using field dynamics up to
third order in space measured using a field monitoring system.
  Results: Time-varying eddy currents were observed for OGSE, which introduced
blurring that was not reduced using the traditional approach but was diminished
considerably with TVEDDY and model-based reconstruction. No MSE difference was
observed between the conventional approach and TVEDDY for PGSE, but for OGSE
TVEDDY resulted in significantly lower MSE than the conventional approach. The
field-monitoring-informed model-based reconstruction had the lowest MSE for
both PGSE and OGSE.
  Conclusion: This work establishes that it is possible to estimate
time-varying eddy currents from the diffusion data itself, which provides
substantial image quality improvements for gradient-intensive dMRI acquisitions
like OGSE.

study the homology groups of a sequence of superlevel sets of the probability
surface over high-dimensional configuration spaces using persistent homology.
For alanine-dipeptide isomerization, a prototype of activated processes, we
identify locations of probability peaks and connecting-ridges, along with
measures of their global prominence. Instead of a saddle-point, the transition
state ensemble (TSE) of conformations are at the most prominent probability
peak after reactants/products, when proper reaction coordinates are included.
Intuition-based models, even those exhibiting a double-well, fail to capture
the dynamics of the activated process. Peak occurrence, prominence, and
locations can be distorted upon subspace projection. While principal component
analysis account for conformational variance, it inflates the complexity of the
surface topology and destroy dynamic properties of the topological features. In
contrast, TSE emerges naturally as the most prominent peak beyond the
reactant/product basins, when projected to a subspace of minimum dimension
containing the reaction coordinates. Our approach is general and can be applied
to investigate the topology of high-dimensional probability surfaces of other
activated process.

separate confounding factors from them. Extensive studies on multiple data sets

the method may be preconditioned by use of information from ensemble Kalman

precise songs becomes more and more complex. The identity of the singer
facilitates this search. In this project, we focus on the problem of
identifying the singer by using different methods for feature extraction.
Particularly, we introduce the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for this
purpose. To the best of our knowledge, DWT has never been used this way before
in the context of singer identification. This process consists of three crucial
parts. First, the vocal signal is separated from the background music by using
the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). Second, features from the
obtained vocal signal are extracted. Here, the goal is to study the performance
of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in comparison to the Mel Frequency
Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) which is the most used technique in audio signals.
Finally, we proceed with the identification of the singer where two methods
have experimented: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). We conclude that, for a dataset of 4 singers and 200 songs, the
best identification system consists of the DWT (db4) feature extraction
introduced in this work combined with a linear support vector machine for
identification resulting in a mean accuracy of 83.96%.

widely discussed in literature for the simplest non-trivial case: cold

of an arbitrary transparent dispersive medium with a given refractive index. We
calculate the deflection angle of light ray moving in a general spherically
symmetric metric in the presence of medium with the spherically symmetric
refractive index. The equation for the radius of circular light orbits is also
derived. We discuss in detail the properties of these results and various
special cases. In particular, we show that multiplying the refractive index by
a constant does not affect the deflection angle and radius of circular orbits.
At the same time, the presence of dispersion makes the trajectories different
from the case of vacuum even in spatially homogeneous medium. As one of the
applications of our results, we calculate the correction to the angle of vacuum
gravitational deflection for the case when a massive object is surrounded by
homogeneous but dispersive medium. As another application, we present the
calculation of the shadow of a black hole surrounded by medium with arbitrary

Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile

paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an
extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We
describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different

sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research
papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity
today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We
include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification,
describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations
between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving
acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter
efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse

for a sufficiently small \e > 0, one removes \edn edges to get connected
components of size independent of n. An important tool for sublinear algorithms
and property testing for such classes is the partition oracle, introduced by
the seminal work of Hassidim-Kelner-Nguyen-Onak (FOCS 2009). A partition oracle
is a local procedure that gives consistent access to a hyperfinite
decomposition, without any preprocessing. Given a query vertex v, the partition
oracle outputs the component containing v in time independent of n. All the
answers are consistent with a single hyperfinite decomposition. The partition
oracle of Hassidim et al. runs in time d^poly(d/\e) per query. They pose the
open problem of whether poly(d/\e)-time partition oracles exist. Levi-Ron
(ICALP 2013) give a refinement of the previous approach, to get a partition
oracle that runs in time d^{\log(d/\e)-per query. In this paper, we resolve
this open problem and give \poly(d/\e)-time partition oracles for bounded

ferroelectrics at a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), where several phases can
intimately coexist. Switching between these phases by electric field produces a
large electromechanical response. In the ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$, strain can be
used to create an MPB-like phase mixture and thus to generate large electric
field dependent strains. However, this enhanced response occurs at localized,
randomly positioned regions of the film, which potentially complicates
nanodevice design. Here, we use epitaxial strain and orientation engineering in
tandem - anisotropic epitaxy - to craft a hitherto unavailable low-symmetry
phase of BiFeO$_3$ which acts as a structural bridge between the
rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like polymorphs. Interferometric displacement
sensor measurements and first-principle calculations reveal that under external
electric bias, this phase undergoes a transition to the tetragonal-like

associated giant field-induced reversible strain. These results offer a new

In the case that $y_i=0$ for all $i$, the stationary distribution was
conjecturally linked to Schubert polynomials by Lam-Williams, and explicit

(GOx) onto Prussian blue (PB) modified TiO$_2$ nanotube arrays functionalized
by Au and AgO NPs. AgO-deposited TiO$_2$ nanotubes were synthesized through an
electrochemical anodization process followed by Ag electroplating process in
the same electrolyte. Deposition of PB particles was performed from an acidic
ferricyanide solution. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the
two fabricated biosensors were investigated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which indicate the
successful deposition of Au and AgO nanoparticles as well as PB nanocrystals.
Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were used to investigate the
performance of the modified electrochemical biosensors. The results show that
the developed electrochemical biosensors display excellent properties in terms
of electron transmission, low detection limit as well as high stability for the
determination of glucose. Under the optimized conditions, the amperometric
response shows a linear dependence on the glucose concentration to a detection
limit down to 4.91 $\mu$M with sensitivity of 185.1 mA M$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2]$ in Au
modified biosensor and detection limit of 58.7 $\mu$M with 29.1 mA M$^{-1}$

products of ""motivic Segre classes"", closely related to K-theoretic
Maulik--Okounkov stable classes living on the cotangent bundles of the flag
varieties. Without q->0, we avoid some divergences that blocked fuller
understanding of d=3,4. The puzzle computations are then explained (in

between Nakajima quiver varieties. More specifically, the conormal bundle to
the diagonal inclusion of a flag variety factors through a quiver variety that
is not a cotangent bundle, and it is on that intermediate quiver variety that
the R-matrix calculation occurs.

scenes and their optical flows. The model is trained on scenes of both safe
rides and near misses. After 42 hours of training on a single GPU, the model
shows high accuracy on the training, testing and validation sets. The model is
intended to be used for generating information that can draw significant
conclusions regarding cycling behaviour in cities and elsewhere, which could
help planners and policy-makers to better understand the requirement of safety
measures when designing infrastructure or drawing policies. As for future work,
the model can be pipelined with other state-of-the-art classifiers and object

electrocardiography into regression problems, constraining the solution space
by decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian impulse basis functions.
Impulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete
heart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume
conductor torso model. Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to
regular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive
capabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental
data. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to
map body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for
reconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were
predicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\pm1.4$%.
Predicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to
displacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and
predictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\%
increase in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse
function data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded
HSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time
Gaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean
absolute error of $10.4\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with
similar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are
potentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data
models for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the
neural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively
identify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent

to different categories of learning machines. According to Skinner's theory,
reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in human intuition and cognition.
Majority of the state-of-the-art methods including deep RL algorithms are
strongly influenced by the connectionist viewpoint. Such algorithms can
significantly benefit from theories of mind and learning in other disciplines.
This paper entertains the idea that theories such as language of thought
hypothesis (LOTH), script theory, and Piaget's cognitive development theory
provide complementary approaches, which will enrich the RL field. Following
this line of thinking, a general computational building block is proposed for
Piaget's schema theory that supports the notions of productivity,
systematicity, and inferential coherence as described by Fodor in contrast with
the connectionism theory. Abstraction in the proposed method is completely upon
the system itself and is not externally constrained by any predefined
architecture. The whole process matches the Neisser's perceptual cycle model.
Performed experiments on three typical control problems followed by behavioral
analysis confirm the interpretability of the proposed method and its
competitiveness compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Hence, the
proposed framework can be viewed as a step towards achieving human-like
cognition in artificial intelligent systems.

perpendicular (yy) to the superlattice period are highly symmetric for both p-

spin-orbital effect causes a significant split of conduction band and leads to
three-fold degenerate sub-bands and high density of states (DOS), which offers
opportunity to obtain the high n-type Seebeck coefficient (S). Interestingly,
the separated degenerate sub-bands and upper conduction band in monolayer WS2
form a remarkable stairlike DOS, yielding a higher S. The hole carriers with

search for axion-like particles (ALPs). Radiative decay of eV-mass ALPs can
contribute to cosmic background emissions at optical and infrared wavelengths.
Line intensity mapping is a unique means of measuring the background emission
at a given photon frequency. If ALPs constitute the abundance of cosmic dark
matter, line intensity maps can correlate with large-scale structures probed by
weak gravitational lensing effects in galaxy imaging surveys. We develop a
theoretical framework to predict the cross correlation. We then explore
potentiality of probing ALPs with the cross correlation in upcoming
galaxy-imaging and spectral surveys. Assuming SPHEREx and the Vera Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we find that the cross
correlation by the ALP decay can be greater than the astrophysical-line
counterparts at wavelength of $\sim3000\, {\rm nm}$ for ALPs with a particle
mass of $m_a\sim1\, \mathrm{eV}$ and a particle-to-two-photons coupling of

this limitation, we develop the first multi-agent reinforcement learning

to handle multiple specifications. We provide correctness and convergence

low scan quality and lack of language standardization.
  For the task of OCR post-hoc correction, we propose a neural approach based

According to the estimates of H.-W. Sinn[1], suppressing this volatility
requires pumped-storage plants with a huge capacity, several orders of
magnitude larger than the present available capacity in Germany[2]. Sinn
concluded that wind-solar power can be used only together with conventional
power plants as backups. However, based on German power data[3] of 2019 we show
that the required storage capacity can significantly be reduced, provided i) a
surplus of wind-solar power plants is supplied, ii) smart meters are installed,
iii) partly a different kind of wind turbines and solar panels are used in
Germany. Our calculations suggest that all the electric energy, presently
produced in Germany, can be obtained from wind-solar power alone. And our
results let us predict that wind-solar power can be used to produce in addition
the energy for transportation, warm water, space heating and in part for
process heating, meaning an increase of the present electric energy production
by a factor of about 5[1]. Of course, to put such a prediction on firm ground
the present calculations have to be confirmed for a period of many years. And
it should be kept in mind, that in any case a huge number of wind turbines and

aggregate interference, which depends on the spatial distributions of the

thus make the performance of large-scale networks environment-dependent (i.e.,
dependent on network topology, locations of the blockages, etc.). The
correlation can be exploited in protocol designs (e.g., spectrum-, load-,

stochastic geometry models and random graph techniques have been used to

  Learning","Accepted by ICASSP 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although impressive results have been achieved for age progression and
regression, there remain two major issues in generative adversarial networks
(GANs)-based methods: 1) conditional GANs (cGANs)-based methods can learn
various effects between any two age groups in a single model, but are
insufficient to characterize some specific patterns due to completely shared
convolutions filters; and 2) GANs-based methods can, by utilizing several
models to learn effects independently, learn some specific patterns, however,
they are cumbersome and require age label in advance. To address these
deficiencies and have the best of both worlds, this paper introduces a
dropout-like method based on GAN~(RoutingGAN) to route different effects in a
high-level semantic feature space. Specifically, we first disentangle the
age-invariant features from the input face, and then gradually add the effects
to the features by residual routers that assign the convolution filters to
different age groups by dropping out the outputs of others. As a result, the
proposed RoutingGAN can simultaneously learn various effects in a single model,
with convolution filters being shared in part to learn some specific effects.
Experimental results on two benchmarked datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

between different tracer nuclides using coincidence measurement of prompt
gamma-rays, which are emitted after positron emission. In MI-PET imaging with a
pure positron emitter and prompt-gamma emitter, because of the imperfectness of
prompt gamma-ray detection, an image for a pure positron emitter taken by
MI-PET is superposed by a positron-{\gamma} emitter. Therefore, in order to
make isolated images of the pure positron emitter, we developed image
reconstruction methods based on data subtraction specific to MI-PET. We tested
two methods, subtraction between reconstructed images and subtraction between
sinogram data. In both methods, normalization for position dependence of the
prompt {\gamma}-ray sensitivity is required in addition to detector sensitivity
normalization. For these normalizations, we performed normalization scans using
cylindrical phantoms of the positron-gamma emitters Sc-44m and Na-22. A long
period measurement using the activity decay of Sc-44m (Half-life 58.6 hours)
elucidated that the acquisition ratio between the prompt gamma-rays coincided
with PET event and pure PET event changes on the basis of object activities.
Therefore, we developed a correction method that involves subtraction
parameters dependent on the activities, i.e., the counting rate. From analysis
of dual-tracer phantom images, data subtraction in the sinogram data with
sensitivity correction gives a higher quality of isolated images for the pure
positron emitter than those from image subtractions. Furthermore, from
dual-isotope (F-18-FDG and Sc-44m) mouse imaging, we concluded that our
developed method can be used for practical imaging of a living organism.

for these models to accurately describe spatiotemporal deduction processes,

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of Chinese characters are monophonic, while a special group of
characters, called polyphonic characters, have multiple pronunciations. As a
prerequisite of performing speech-related generative tasks, the correct
pronunciation must be identified among several candidates. This process is
called Polyphone Disambiguation. Although the problem has been well explored
with both knowledge-based and learning-based approaches, it remains challenging
due to the lack of publicly available labeled datasets and the irregular nature
of polyphone in Mandarin Chinese. In this paper, we propose a novel
semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework for Mandarin Chinese polyphone
disambiguation that can potentially leverage unlimited unlabeled text data. We
explore the effect of various proxy labeling strategies including
entropy-thresholding and lexicon-based labeling. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
In addition, we publish a novel dataset specifically for the polyphone
disambiguation task to promote further researches.

can drastically change flow properties, such as reducing the drag and enhancing
mixing. One fundamental riddle is how these polymer additives interact with the
eddies of different spatial scales existing in the turbulent flow and in turn
alter the turbulence energy transfer. Here we show how turbulent kinetic energy
is transferred through deferent scales in the presence of the polymer
additives. In particular, we observed experimentally the emerging of a new
scaling range, referred to as the elastic range, where increasing amount of
energy is transferred by the elasticity of the polymers. In addition, the
existence of the elastic range prescribes the scaling of high-order velocity
statistics. Our findings have important implications to many turbulence systems
such as turbulence in plasmas or superfluids where interaction between
turbulent eddies and other nonlinear physical mechanisms are often involved.

  Rank Explanations for Improved Performance","Published as a journal at ACM TIST",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Explaining to users why some items are recommended is critical, as it can
help users to make better decisions, increase their satisfaction, and gain
their trust in recommender systems (RS). However, existing explainable RS
usually consider explanation as a side output of the recommendation model,
which has two problems: (1) it is difficult to evaluate the produced
explanations because they are usually model-dependent, and (2) as a result, how
the explanations impact the recommendation performance is less investigated.
  In this paper, explaining recommendations is formulated as a ranking task,
and learned from data, similar to item ranking for recommendation. This makes
it possible for standard evaluation of explanations via ranking metrics (e.g.,
NDCG). Furthermore, this paper extends traditional item ranking to an
item-explanation joint-ranking formalization to study if purposely selecting
explanations could reach certain learning goals, e.g., improving recommendation
performance. A great challenge, however, is that the sparsity issue in the
user-item-explanation data would be inevitably severer than that in traditional
user-item interaction data, since not every user-item pair can be associated
with all explanations. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes to perform
two sets of matrix factorization by considering the ternary relationship as two
groups of binary relationships. Experiments on three large datasets verify the
solution's effectiveness on both explanation ranking and item recommendation.

statistics of supersonic turbulent flows, such as those found in the cool
interstellar medium (ISM). The variance of the density field,
$\sigma^2_{\rho/\rho_0}$, is of particular interest for molecular clouds (MCs),
the birthplaces of stars in the Universe. The density variance may be used to
infer underlying physical processes in an MC, and parameterises the star
formation (SF) rate of a cloud. However, models for $\sigma^2_{\rho/\rho_0}$
all share a common feature -- the variance is assumed to be isotropic. This
assumption does not hold when a trans/sub-Alfv\'enic mean magnetic field,
$\vec{B}_0$, is present in the cloud, which observations suggest is relevant
for some MCs. We develop an anisotropic model for $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$,
using contributions from hydrodynamical and fast magnetosonic shocks that
propagate orthogonal to each other. Our model predicts an upper bound for
$\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$ in the high Mach number $(\mathcal{M})$ limit as
small-scale density fluctuations become suppressed by the strong $\vec{B}_0$.
The model reduces to the isotropic $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2-\mathcal{M}$
relation in the hydrodynamical limit. To validate our model, we calculate
$\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$ from 12~high-resolution, three-dimensional,
supersonic, sub-Alfv\'enic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations
and find good agreement with our theory. We discuss how the two MHD shocks may
be the bimodally oriented over-densities observed in some MCs and the
implications for SF theory in the presence of a sub-Alfv\'enic $\vec{B}_0$. By
creating an anisotropic, supersonic density fluctuation model, this study paves
the way for SF theory in the highly anisotropic regime of interstellar
turbulence.

wish to sequentially test the null that these binary random variables are
exchangeable. Nonnegative supermartingales (NSMs) are a workhorse of sequential
inference, but we prove that they are powerless for this problem. First,
utilizing a geometric concept called fork-convexity (a sequential analog of
convexity), we show that any process that is an NSM under a set of
distributions, is also necessarily an NSM under their ""fork-convex hull"".
Second, we demonstrate that the fork-convex hull of the exchangeable null
consists of all possible laws over binary sequences; this implies that any NSM
under exchangeability is necessarily nonincreasing, hence always yields a
powerless test for any alternative. Since testing arbitrary deviations from
exchangeability is information theoretically impossible, we focus on Markovian
alternatives. We combine ideas from universal inference and the method of
mixtures to derive a ""safe e-process"", which is a nonnegative process with
expectation at most one under the null at any stopping time, and is upper
bounded by a martingale, but is not itself an NSM. This in turn yields a level
$\alpha$ sequential test that is consistent; regret bounds from universal
coding also demonstrate rate-optimal power. We present ways to extend these
results to any finite alphabet and to Markovian alternatives of any order using
a ""double mixture"" approach. We provide an array of simulations, and give
general approaches based on betting for unstructured or ill-specified
alternatives. Finally, inspired by Shafer, Vovk, and Ville, we provide
game-theoretic interpretations of our e-processes and pathwise results.

survival data and the derivation of Hazard Ratio (HR) is well established.
While nonlinear, tree-based Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed
and applied to the survival analysis, no methodology exists for computing HRs
associated with explanatory variables from such models. We describe a novel way
to compute HRs from tree-based ML models using the Shapley additive explanation
(SHAP) values, which is a locally accurate and consistent methodology to
quantify explanatory variables' contribution to predictions.
  Methods: We used three sets of publicly available survival data consisting of
patients with colon, breast or pan cancer and compared the performance of CoxPH
to the state-of-art ML model, XGBoost. To compute the HR for explanatory
variables from the XGBoost model, the SHAP values were exponentiated and the
ratio of the means over the two subgroups calculated. The confidence interval
was computed via bootstrapping the training data and generating the ML model
1000 times. Across the three data sets, we systematically compared HRs for all
explanatory variables. Open-source libraries in Python and R were used in the
analyses.
  Results: For the colon and breast cancer data sets, the performance of CoxPH
and XGBoost were comparable and we showed good consistency in the computed HRs.
In the pan-cancer dataset, we showed agreement in most variables but also an
opposite finding in two of the explanatory variables between the CoxPH and
XGBoost result. Subsequent Kaplan-Meier plots supported the finding of the
XGBoost model.
  Conclusion: Enabling the derivation of HR from ML models can help to improve
the identification of risk factors from complex survival datasets and enhance
the prediction of clinical trial outcomes.

minimum number of independent couplings in the structures with even number of
the three-form, is 1062. We find that there are schemes in which there is no
coupling involving $R,\,R_{\mu\nu},\,\nabla_\mu F^{\mu\alpha\beta\gamma}$. In
these schemes, there are sub-schemes in which, except one coupling which has
the second derivative of $F^{(4)}$, the couplings can have no term with more
than two derivatives. We find some of the parameters by dimensionally reducing
the couplings on a circle and comparing them with the known couplings of the
one-loop effective action of type IIA superstring theory. In particular, we
find the coupling which has term with more than two derivatives is zero.

  arXiv:2101.02282",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous navigation of steel bridge inspection robots is essential for
proper maintenance. The majority of existing robotic solutions for steel bridge
inspection requires human intervention to assist in the control and navigation.
In this paper, a control and navigation framework has been proposed for the
steel bridge inspection robot developed by the Advanced Robotics and Automation
(ARA)to facilitate autonomous real-time navigation and minimize human
intervention. The ARA robot is designed to work in two modes: mobile and
inch-worm. The robot uses mobile mode when moving on a plane surface and
inch-worm mode when jumping from one surface to the other. To allow the ARA
robot to switch between mobile and inch-worm modes, a switching controller is
developed with 3D point cloud data based. The surface detection algorithm is
proposed to allow the robot to check the availability of steel surfaces (plane,
area, and height) to determine the transformation from mobile mode to inch-worm
one. To have the robot safely navigate and visit all steel members of the
bridge, four algorithms are developed to process the data from a depth camera,
segment it into clusters, estimate the boundaries, construct a graph
representing the structure, generate the shortest inspection path with any
starting and ending points, and determine available robot configuration for
path planning. Experiments on steel bridge structures setup highlight the
effective performance of the algorithms, and the potential to apply to the ARA
robot to run on real bridge structures.

the Internet. To meet the high bandwidth and stringent playback demand, one
feasible solution is to cache video contents on edge servers based on predicted
video popularity. Traditional caching algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU) are too
simple to capture the dynamics of video popularity, especially long-tailed
videos. Recent learning-driven caching algorithms (e.g., DeepCache) show
promising performance, however, such black-box approaches are lack of
explainability and interpretability. Moreover, the parameter tuning requires a
large number of historical records, which are difficult to obtain for videos
with low popularity. In this paper, we optimize video caching at the edge using
a white-box approach, which is highly efficient and also completely
explainable. To accurately capture the evolution of video popularity, we
develop a mathematical model called \emph{HRS} model, which is the combination
of multiple point processes, including Hawkes' self-exciting, reactive and
self-correcting processes. The key advantage of the HRS model is its
explainability, and much less number of model parameters. In addition, all its
model parameters can be learned automatically through maximizing the
Log-likelihood function constructed by past video request events. Next, we
further design an online HRS-based video caching algorithm. To verify its
effectiveness, we conduct a series of experiments using real video traces
collected from Tencent Video, one of the largest online video providers in
China. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms
the state-of-the-art algorithms, with 12.3\% improvement on average in terms of

large-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the
focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt
an activation function, e.g. $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or
$\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate
discrete values. However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck
into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We
call this problem ""Dead Bits Problem~(DBP)"". Besides, the existing quantization
loss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but
effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to
alleviate DBP. Moreover, we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further
alleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the
similarity between two images. The proposed gradient amplifier and error-aware
quantization loss are compatible with a variety of deep hashing methods.
Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the

  Tradeoff Perspective","ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained
network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of
a student network. The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels
for supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies
\citep{muller2019does,yuan2020revisiting} revealed an intriguing property of
the soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the
student network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization
aims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear
for training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance
tradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe
that during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further,
under the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the
distillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some
specific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples
lead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically
find that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates
distillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel
weighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise
bias-variance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate
the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at

images have been used in various applications. Meanwhile, there have emerged
some deep learning-based text editing algorithms which alter the textual
information of an image . In this work, we present a document forgery algorithm
to edit practical document images. To achieve this goal, the limitations of
existing text editing algorithms towards complicated characters and complex
background are addressed by a set of network design strategies. First, the
unnecessary confusion in the supervision data is avoided by disentangling the
textual and background information in the source images. Second, to capture the
structure of some complicated components, the text skeleton is provided as
auxiliary information and the continuity in texture is considered explicitly in
the loss function. Third, the forgery traces induced by the text editing
operation are mitigated by some post-processing operations which consider the
distortions from the print-and-scan channel. Quantitative comparisons of the
proposed method and the exiting approach have shown the advantages of our
design by reducing the about 2/3 reconstruction error measured in MSE,
improving reconstruction quality measured in PSNR and in SSIM by 4 dB and 0.21,
respectively. Qualitative experiments have confirmed that the reconstruction
results of the proposed method are visually better than the existing approach.
More importantly, we have demonstrated the performance of the proposed document
forgery algorithm under a practical scenario where an attacker is able to alter
the textual information in an identity document using only one sample in the
target domain. The forged-and-recaptured samples created by the proposed text
editing attack and recapturing operation have successfully fooled some existing
document authentication systems.

Effective privacy preservation is foremost for various mobile applications.
Recently, geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error are proposed
for limiting location leakages. In this paper, we argue that personalization
means regionalization for geo-indistinguishability, and we propose a
regionalized location obfuscation mechanism called DPIVE with personalized
utility sensitivities. This substantially corrects the differential and
distortion privacy problem of PIVE framework proposed by Yu et al. on NDSS
2017. We develop DPIVE with two phases. In Phase I, we determine disjoint sets
by partitioning all possible positions such that different locations in the
same set share the Protection Location Set (PLS). In Phase II, we construct a
probability distribution matrix in which the rows corresponding to the same PLS
have their own sensitivity of utility (PLS diameter). Moreover, by designing
QK-means algorithm for more search space in 2-D space, we improve DPIVE with
refined location partition and present fine-grained personalization, enabling
each location to have its own privacy level endowed with a customized privacy
budget. Experiments with two public datasets demonstrate that our mechanisms
have the superior performance, typically on skewed locations.

federated learning but often overlooked in the lens of robustness to
adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on characterizing and understanding its
impact on backdooring attacks in federated learning through comprehensive
experiments using synthetic and the LEAF benchmarks. The initial impression
driven by our experimental results suggests that data heterogeneity is the
dominant factor in the effectiveness of attacks and it may be a redemption for
defending against backdooring as it makes the attack less efficient, more
challenging to design effective attack strategies, and the attack result also
becomes less predictable. However, with further investigations, we found data
heterogeneity is more of a curse than a redemption as the attack effectiveness
can be significantly boosted by simply adjusting the client-side backdooring
timing. More importantly,data heterogeneity may result in overfitting at the
local training of benign clients, which can be utilized by attackers to
disguise themselves and fool skewed-feature based defenses. In addition,
effective attack strategies can be made by adjusting attack data distribution.
Finally, we discuss the potential directions of defending the curses brought by
data heterogeneity. The results and lessons learned from our extensive
experiments and analysis offer new insights for designing robust federated
learning methods and systems

  Electricity Sharing","This paper was accepted to IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics
  Magazine",,,,"eess.SY cs.CY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digitalization has led to radical changes in the distribution of goods across
various sectors. The tendency is to move from traditional buyer-seller markets
to subscription-based on-demand ""smart"" matching platforms enabled by pervasive
ICTs. The driving force behind this lies in the fact that assets, which were
scarce in the past, are readily abundant, approaching a regime of zero marginal
costs. This is also becoming a reality in electrified energy systems due to the
substantial growth of distributed renewable energy sources such as solar and
wind; the increasing number of small-scale storage units such as batteries and
heat pumps; and the availability of flexible loads that enable demand-side
management. In this context, this article proposes a system architecture based
on a logical (cyber) association of spatially distributed (physical) elements
as an approach to build a virtual microgrid operated as a software-defined
energy network (SDEN) that is enabled by packetized energy management. The
proposed cyber-physical system presumes that electrical energy is shared among
its members and that the energy sharing is enabled in the cyber domain by
handshakes inspired by resource allocation methods utilized in computer
networks, wireless communications, and peer-to-peer Internet applications
(e.g., BitTorrent). The proposal has twofold benefits: (i) reducing the
complexity of current market-based solutions by removing unnecessary and costly
mediations and (ii) guaranteeing energy access to all virtual microgrid members
according to their individual needs. This article concludes that the proposed
solution generally complies with the existing regulations but has highly
disruptive potential to organize a dominantly electrified energy system in the
mid- to long-term, being a technical counterpart to the recently developed

image enhancement (UIE) operators have been proposed during the past few years.
However, the lack of effective objective evaluation methods limits the further
development of UIE techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel rank learning
guided no-reference quality assessment method for UIE. Our approach, termed
Twice Mixing, is motivated by the observation that a mid-quality image can be
generated by mixing a high-quality image with its low-quality version. Typical
mixup algorithms linearly interpolate a given pair of input data. However, the
human visual system is non-uniformity and non-linear in processing images.
Therefore, instead of directly training a deep neural network based on the
mixed images and their absolute scores calculated by linear combinations, we
propose to train a Siamese Network to learn their quality rankings. Twice
Mixing is trained based on an elaborately formulated self-supervision
mechanism. Specifically, before each iteration, we randomly generate two mixing
ratios which will be employed for both generating virtual images and guiding
the network training. In the test phase, a single branch of the network is
extracted to predict the quality rankings of different UIE outputs. We conduct
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous methods

10-100% of the Eddington luminosity in the X-ray band during the last three
decades until mid-2018 when the source luminosity suddenly decreased by an
order of magnitude. This phase was followed by a change to a state with even
lower average X-ray fluxes never seen before during the outburst but presenting
renewed flaring activity at different wavelengths. Nevertheless, the mean
fluxes were still in decline. GRS 1915+105 has the longest orbital period known
among low-mass X-ray binaries, the largest accretion disk size, and therefore
the largest mass supply for accretion. The high inclination of the disk allows
the study of geometrical effects of the accretion flow such as changes in the
height-to-radius ratio or the effect of accretion disk winds on the intrinsic
emission that are expected during the outburst decay. In addition, the
transient jet is expected to change to a compact, self-absorbed, steady jet. We
conducted two full polarization Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations to
study the jet properties during the outburst decay by analyzing the spectral,
polarization, and intra-epoch variability for both observation epochs. In
addition, we analyzed nearly daily Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer
pointing observations consisting of modeling X-ray power spectral densities,
spectral energy distributions, and lightcurves with a physically motivated
model to follow the changing accretion disk properties throughout the outburst
decay and relating them to the jet emission. We show that the X-ray and mm
spectral, timing, and polarization properties are consistent with those of a
typical decaying X-ray binary outburst and that GRS 1915+105 has descended into
the low-luminosity hard X-ray state.

the density changes through the interface, the velocity of the interface in the
normal direction is the same as the normal velocity of the fluid along the

However, this issue is overlooked in the literature. Researchers tend to follow
tradition and use the standard measures of their field, although they often
became standard only because previous researchers started consistently using
them. In this work, we propose a new empirical evaluation framework to solve
this issue, and help the end user selecting an appropriate measure for their
application. For a collection of candidate measures, it first consists in
describing their behavior by computing them for a generated dataset of
partitions, obtained by applying a set of predefined parametric partition
transformations. Second, our framework performs a regression analysis to
characterize the measures in terms of how they are affected by these parameters
and transformations. This allows both describing and comparing the measures.
Our approach is not tied to any specific measure or application, so it can be
applied to any situation. We illustrate its relevance by applying it to a
selection of standard measures, and show how it can be put in practice through
two concrete use cases.

multi-agent systems. Here we study this problem under an idealized model, where
it is assumed that agents can sense the general tendency in the system. More
specifically, we consider $n$ agents, each being associated with a real-valued
number. In each round, each agent receives a noisy measurement of the average
value, and then updates its value, which is in turn perturbed by random drift.
We assume that both noises in measurements and drift follow Gaussian
distributions. What should be the updating policy of agents if their goal is to
minimize the expected deviation of the agents' values from the average value?
We prove that a distributed weighted-average algorithm optimally minimizes this
deviation for each agent, and for any round. Interestingly, this optimality
holds even in the centralized setting, where a master agent can gather all the
agents' measurements and instruct a move to each agent.We find this result
surprising since it can be shown that the total measurements obtained by all
agents contain strictly more information about the deviation of Agent $i$ from
the average value, than the information contained in the measurements obtained
by Agent $i$ alone. Although this information is relevant for Agent $i$, it is
not processed by it when running a weighted-average algorithm. Nevertheless,
the weighted-average algorithm is optimal, since by running it, other agents
manage to fully process this information in a way that perfectly benefits Agent
$i$.Finally, we also analyze the drift of the center of mass and show that no
distributed algorithm can achieve drift that is as small as the one that can be
achieved by the best centralized algorithm. In light of this, we also show that
the drift associated with our weighted-average algorithm incurs a relatively
small overhead over the best possible drift in the centralized setting.

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles). This approach involves a relatively simple
expansion of the distribution in powers of the P\'{e}clet number and in terms
of Hermite polynomials. We use this approach to cleanly formulate boundary
conditions, which allows us to study weakly active particles in several
geometries: confinement by a single wall or between two walls in 1D,
confinement in a circular or wedge-shaped region in 2D, motion near a
corrugated boundary, and finally absorption onto a sphere. We consider how
quantities such as the density, pressure, and flow of the active particles
change as we gradually increase the activity away from a purely passive system.
These results for the limit of weak activity help us gain insight into how

batch of collected data, without extra interactions with the environment during
training. However, current offline RL benchmarks commonly have a large reality
gap, because they involve large datasets collected by highly exploratory
policies, and the trained policy is directly evaluated in the environment. In
real-world situations, running a highly exploratory policy is prohibited to
ensure system safety, the data is commonly very limited, and a trained policy
should be well validated before deployment. In this paper, we present a near
real-world offline RL benchmark, named NeoRL, which contains datasets from
various domains with controlled sizes, and extra test datasets for policy
validation. We evaluate existing offline RL algorithms on NeoRL and argue that
the performance of a policy should also be compared with the deterministic
version of the behavior policy, instead of the dataset reward. The empirical
results demonstrate that the tested offline RL algorithms become less
competitive to the deterministic policy on many datasets, and the offline
policy evaluation hardly helps. The NeoRL suit can be found at

future research and draw more attention when deploying RL in real-world

eastern part of Denmark. The weather was cloudy over eastern Denmark, but many
people saw the sky light up-even in the heavily illuminated Copenhagen. Two
hundred and thirty three reports of the associated sound and light phenomena
were received by the Danish fireball network. We have formed a consortium to
describe the meteorite and the circumstances of the fall and the results are
presented in this paper. The first fragment of the meteorite was found the day
after the fall, and in the following weeks, a total of 11 fragments with a
total weight of 8982 g were found. The meteorite is an unbrecciated, weakly
shocked (S2), ordinary H chondrite of petrologic type 5/6 (Bouvier et al.
2017). The concentration of the cosmogenic radionuclides suggests that the
preatmospheric radius was rather small ~20 cm. The cosmic ray exposure age of
Ejby (83 +/- 11 Ma) is the highest of an H chondrite and the second highest age
for an ordinary chondrite. Using the preatmospheric orbit of the Ejby meteoroid
(Spurny et al. 2017) locations of the recovered fragments, and wind data from
the date of the fall, we have modeled the dark flight (below 18 km) of the
fragments. The recovery location of the largest fragment can only be explained
if aerodynamic effects during the dark flight phase are included. The recovery
location of all other fragments are consistent with the dark flight modeling.

operation, hybrid system management or energy trading, could benefit from
improved short-term solar forecasting, addressing the intermittent energy
production from solar panels. However, current approaches to modelling the
cloud cover dynamics from sky images still lack precision regarding the spatial
configuration of clouds, their temporal dynamics and physical interactions with
solar radiation. Benefiting from a growing number of large datasets, data
driven methods are being developed to address these limitations with promising
results. In this study, we compare four commonly used Deep Learning
architectures trained to forecast solar irradiance from sequences of
hemispherical sky images and exogenous variables. To assess the relative
performance of each model, we used the Forecast Skill metric based on the smart
persistence model, as well as ramp and time distortion metrics. The results
show that encoding spatiotemporal aspects of the sequence of sky images greatly
improved the predictions with 10 min ahead Forecast Skill reaching 20.4% on the
test year. However, based on the experimental data, we conclude that, with a
common setup, Deep Learning models tend to behave just as a 'very smart
persistence model', temporally aligned with the persistence model while
mitigating its most penalising errors. Thus, despite being captured by the sky
cameras, models often miss fundamental events causing large irradiance changes
such as clouds obscuring the sun. We hope that our work will contribute to a
shift of this approach to irradiance forecasting, from reactive to
anticipatory.

investigate fundamental laser-assisted processes in very powerful laser fields.
In the present work and within the framework of laser-assisted quantum
electrodynamics (QED), electron-proton scattering was considered in the
presence of a strong electromagnetic field of circular polarization. First, we
present a study of the process where we only take into account the relativistic
dressing of the electron without the proton. Then, in order to explore the
effect of the proton dressing, we fully consider the relativistic dressing of
the electron and the proton together and describe them by using Dirac-Volkov
functions. The analytical expression for the differential cross section (DCS)
in both cases is derived at lowest-order of perturbation theory. As a result,
the DCS is notably reduced by the laser field. It is found that the effect of
proton dressing begins to appear at laser field strengths greater than or equal
to $10^{10}~\text{V/cm}$ and it therefore must be taken into account. The
influence of the laser field strength and frequency on the DCS is reported. A
comparison with the Mott scattering and the laser-free results is also
included.

  Estimation based on Empirical Probabilities",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Quantification of information content and its temporal variation in
intracellular calcium spike trains in neurons helps one understand functions
such as memory, learning, and cognition. Such quantification could also reveal
pathological signaling perturbation that potentially leads to devastating
neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and
Huntington's diseases. Accordingly, estimation of entropy rate, an
information-theoretic measure of information content, assumes primary
significance. However, such estimation in the present context is challenging
because, while entropy rate is traditionally defined asymptotically for long
blocks under the assumption of stationarity, neurons are known to encode
information in short intervals and the associated spike trains often exhibit
nonstationarity. Against this backdrop, we propose an entropy rate estimator
based on empirical probabilities that operates within windows, short enough to
ensure approximate stationarity. Specifically, our estimator, parameterized by
the length of encoding contexts, attempts to model the underlying memory
structures in neuronal spike trains. In an example Markov process, we compared
the performance of the proposed method with that of versions of the Lempel-Ziv
algorithm as well as with that of a certain stationary distribution method and
found the former to exhibit higher accuracy levels and faster convergence.
Also, in experimentally recorded calcium responses of four hippocampal neurons,
the proposed method showed faster convergence. Significantly, our technique
detected structural heterogeneity in the underlying process memory in the
responses of the aforementioned neurons. We believe that the proposed method
facilitates large-scale studies of such heterogeneity, which could in turn
identify signatures of various diseases in terms of entropy rate estimates.

magnetic fields originating from network and internetwork regions on the solar
surface. The continuous interaction between these different magnetic patches
leads to transient brightenings or bursts that might contribute to the heating
of the solar atmosphere. However, it remains unclear whether such transients,
which are mostly observed in the EUV, play a significant role in atmospheric
heating. We revisit the open question of these bursts as a prelude to the new
high-resolution EUV imagery expected from the recently launched Solar Orbiter.
We use EUV images recorded by the SDO/AIA to investigate statistical properties
of the bursts. We detect the bursts in the 171 {\AA} filter images of AIA in an
automated way through a pixel-wise analysis by imposing different intensity
thresholds. By exploiting the high cadence (12 s) of the AIA observations, we
find that the distribution of lifetimes of these events peaks at about 120 s.
The sizes of the detected bursts are limited by the spatial resolution, which
indicates that a larger number of events might be hidden in the AIA data. We
estimate that about 100 new bursts appear per second on the whole Sun. The
detected bursts have nanoflare-like energies of $10^{24}$\,erg per event. Based
on this, we estimate that at least 100 times more events of a similar nature
would be required to account for the energy that is required to heat the
corona. When AIA observations are considered alone, the EUV bursts discussed
here therefore play no significant role in the coronal heating of the quiet
Sun. If the coronal heating of the quiet Sun is mainly bursty, then the
high-resolution EUV observations from Solar Orbiter may be able to reduce the
deficit in the number of EUV bursts seen with SDO/AIA at least partly by
detecting more such events.

the thin disk as traced by red giant branch stars, possibly implying that
secular evolution is not the main contributor to the flaring but perturbation
scenarios such as interactions with passing dwarf galaxies should be more
possible. When comparing the scale height of OB stellar disk of the north and
south sides with the gas disk, the former one is slightly thicker than the
later one by $\approx$ 33 and 9 \,pc, meaning that one could tentatively use
young OB-type stars to trace the gas properties. Meanwhile, we unravel that the
radial scale length of the young OB stellar disk is 1.17 $\pm$ 0.05 \,kpc,
which is shorter than that of the gas disk, confirming that the gas disk is
more extended than stellar disk. What is more, by considering the mid-plane

are within 100 \,pc with the increasing trend as Galactocentric distance

functional data is implemented. The efficiency is achieved through two novel
features: using the recently introduced orthonormal spline bases, the so-called
{\it splinets} and accounting for the spline support sets in the proposed
spline object representation. The recently-introduced orthogonal splinets are
evaluated by {\it dyadic orthogonalization} of the $B$-splines. The package is
built around the {\it Splinets}-object that represents a collection of splines.
It treats splines as mathematical functions and contains information about the
support sets and the values of the derivatives at the knots that uniquely
define these functions. Algebra and calculus of splines utilize the Taylor
expansions at the knots within the support sets. Several orthonormalization
procedures of the $B$-splines are implemented including the recommended dyadic
method leading to the splinets. The method bases on a dyadic algorithm that can
be also viewed as the efficient method of diagonalizing a band matrix. The
locality of the $B$-splines in terms of the support sets is, to a great extend,
preserved in the corresponding splinet. This together with implemented
algorithms utilizing locality of the supports provides a valuable computational
tool for functional data analysis. The benefits are particularly evident when
the sparsity in the data plays an important role. Various diagnostic tools are
provided allowing to maintain the stability of the computations. Finally, the
projection operation to the space of splines is implemented that facilitates
functional data analysis. An example of a simple functional analysis of the
data using the tools in the package is presented. The functionality of the
package extends beyond the splines to piecewise polynomial functions, although
the splines are its focus.

design of optimization heuristics is currently shaking up evolutionary
computation (EC). Where the design of hand-picked guidelines for choosing a
most suitable heuristic has long dominated research activities in the field,
automatically trained heuristics are now seen to outperform human-derived
choices even for well-researched optimization tasks. ML-based EC is therefore
not any more a futuristic vision, but has become an integral part of our
community.
  A key criticism that ML-based heuristics are often faced with is their
potential lack of explainability, which may hinder future developments. This
applies in particular to supervised learning techniques which extrapolate
algorithms' performance based on exploratory landscape analysis (ELA). In such
applications, it is not uncommon to use dozens of problem features to build the
models underlying the specific algorithm selection or configuration task. Our
goal in this work is to analyze whether this many features are indeed needed.
Using the classification of the BBOB test functions as testbed, we show that a
surprisingly small number of features -- often less than four -- can suffice to
achieve a 98\% accuracy. Interestingly, the number of features required to meet
this threshold is found to decrease with the problem dimension. We show that
the classification accuracy transfers to settings in which several instances
are involved in training and testing. In the leave-one-instance-out setting,
however, classification accuracy drops significantly, and the
transformation-invariance of the features becomes a decisive success factor.

patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (ES-AD) versus healthy control
(HC) subjects, from datasets built with handwriting and drawing task records.
Method- The proposed approach uses subject's response times. An optimal subset
of tasks is first selected with a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM) associated
with a grid search. Mixtures of Gaussian distributions defined in the space of
task durations are then used to reproduce and explain the results of the SVM.
Finally, a surprisingly simple and efficient ad hoc classification algorithm is
deduced from the Gaussian mixtures. Results- The solution presented in this
paper makes two or even four times fewer errors than the best results of the
state of the art concerning the classification HC/ES-AD from handwriting and
drawing tasks. Discussion- The best SVM learning model reaches a high accuracy
for this classification but its learning capacity is too large to ensure a low
overfitting risk regarding the small size of the dataset. The proposed ad hoc
classification algorithm only requires to optimize three real-parameters. It
should therefore benefit from a good generalization ability.

of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless mobile networks that it becomes a

5G base stations and user devices can be measured at the order of 100 and 10,

antennas fit into a given aperture.
  The 5G developments enhance the transmitter and receiver functionalities, but
the wireless channel propagation remains an uncontrollable system. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and its mathematical notation will be introduced
later. Transmitted signals with three different frequencies are shown to
illustrate the fact that attenuation can vary greatly across frequencies.
Looking beyond 5G, the advent of electromagnetic components that can shape how

significant degradation in its generalization performance. To resolve this
issue, we propose MARVEL (MARgins Via Early Learning), a new robust learning

new test statistic that tracks the goodness of ""fit"" of every instance based on
the epoch-history of its classification margins. If its classification margin
is small in a sequence of consecutive learning epochs, that instance is
declared noisy and the network abandons learning on it. Consequently, the
network first flags a possibly noisy instance, and then waits to see if
learning on that instance can be improved and if not, the network learns with
confidence that this instance can be safely abandoned. We also propose MARVEL+,
where arduous instances can be upweighted, enabling the network to focus and
improve its learning on them and consequently its generalization. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise and real-world

screening, diagnosis and therapy planning. Time domain full waveform inversion
(TD-FWI) is a promising UST image formation technique that fits the parameter
fields of a wave physics model by gradient-based optimization. For high
resolution 3D UST, it holds three key challenges: Firstly, its central building
block, the computation of the gradient for a single US measurement, has a
restrictively large memory footprint. Secondly, this building block needs to be
computed for each of the $10^3-10^4$ measurements, resulting in a massive
parallel computation usually performed on large computational clusters for
days. Lastly, the structure of the underlying optimization problem may result
in slow progression of the solver and convergence to a local minimum. In this
work, we design and evaluate a comprehensive computational strategy to overcome
these challenges: Firstly, we exploit a gradient computation based on time
reversal that dramatically reduces the memory footprint at the expense of one
additional wave simulation per source. Secondly, we break the dependence on the
number of measurements by using source encoding (SE) to compute stochastic
gradient estimates. Also we describe a more accurate, TD-specific SE technique
with a finer variance control and use a state-of-the-art stochastic LBFGS
method. Lastly, we design an efficient TD multi-grid scheme together with
preconditioning to speed up the convergence while avoiding local minima. All
components are evaluated in extensive numerical proof-of-concept studies
simulating a bowl-shaped 3D UST breast scanner prototype. Finally, we
demonstrate that their combination allows us to obtain an accurate 442x442x222

often impeded by the presence of acoustic streaming. For micrometer-sized
acoustic chambers, this acoustic streaming is typically driven from the
fluid-solid interface by viscous shear-stresses generated by the acoustic
actuation. AC electroosmosis is another boundary-driven streaming phenomena
routinely used in microfluidic devices for handling of particle suspensions in
electrolytes. Here, we study how streaming can be suppressed by combining
ultrasound acoustics and AC electroosmosis. Based on a theoretical analysis of
the electrokinetic problem, we are able to compute numerically a form of the
electrical potential at the fluid-solid interface, which is suitable for
suppressing a typical acoustic streaming pattern associated with a standing
acoustic half-wave. In the linear regime, we even derive an analytical
expression for the electroosmotic slip velocity at the fluid-solid interface,
and use this as a guiding principle for developing models in the experimentally
more relevant nonlinear regime that occurs at elevated driving voltages. We
present simulation results for an acoustofluidic device, showing how
implementing a suitable AC electroosmosis results in a suppression of the
resulting streaming in the bulk of the device by two orders of magnitude.

problem within the framework of structured prediction. We then consider kernel
ridge regression where we improve known rates in $n^{-1/4}$ to arbitrarily fast
rates, depending on a parameter characterizing the hardness of the problem,
thus allowing, under smoothness assumptions, to bypass the curse of

phenomena such as solar flares and are often sites of reconnection and particle
acceleration. Dynamic twisting of a magnetic null point can generate a
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) within its fan plane and, under continued
twisting, can instigate spine-fan reconnection and an associated collapse of
the null point.
  Aim: This article aims to compare the effects of isotropic and anisotropic
viscosity in simulations of the KHI and collapse in a dynamically twisted
magnetic null point.
  Methods: Simulations were performed using the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code
Lare3d with a custom anisotropic viscosity module. A pair of high resolution
simulations was performed, one using isotropic viscosity and another using
anisotropic viscosity, keeping all other factors identical, and the results
analysed in detail. A further parameter study was performed over a range of
values for viscosity and resistivity.
  Results: Both viscosity models permit the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability and the eventual collapse of the null point. Over all studied
parameters, anisotropic viscosity allows a faster growing instability, while
isotropic viscosity damps the instability to the extent of stabilisation in
some cases. Although the viscous heating associated with anisotropic viscosity
is generally smaller, the ohmic heating dominates and is enhanced by the
current sheets generated by the instability, leading to a greater overall
heating rate when using anisotropic viscosity. The collapse of the null point
occurs significantly sooner when anisotropic viscosity is employed.

two-fluid model, which aims at the description of the phase separation of
non-entangled polymer solutions, where viscoelastic effects play a role. It is
directly based upon the coarse-graining of a well-defined molecular model, such
that all degrees of freedom have a clear and unambiguous molecular
interpretation. The considerations are based upon a free-energy functional, and
the dynamics is split into a conservative and a dissipative part, where the
latter satisfies the Onsager relations and the Second Law of thermodynamics.
The model is therefore fully consistent with both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The derivation proceeds in two steps: Firstly,
we derive an extended model comprising two scalar and four vector fields, such
that inertial dynamics of the macromolecules and of the relative motion of the
two fluids is taken into account. In the second step, we eliminate these
inertial contributions and, as a replacement, introduce phenomenological
dissipative terms, which can be modeled easily by taking into account the
principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The final simplified model
comprises the momentum conservation equation, which includes both interfacial
and elastic stresses, a convection-diffusion equation where interfacial and
elastic contributions occur as well, and a suitably convected relaxation
equation for the end-to-end vector field. In contrast to the traditional
two-scale description that is used to derive rheological equations of motion,
we here treat the hydrodynamic and the macromolecular degrees of freedom on the
same basis. Nevertheless, the resulting model is fairly similar, though not
fully identical, to models that have been discussed previously. Notably, we
find a rheological constitutive equation that differs from the standard
Oldroyd-B model. ...

identification of blueshifted UV absorption lines in low and high ionization

ongoing star formation without the need for an Active Galactic Nucleus. The
derived low mass loading factor ($\eta$= 0.05 $\pm$ 0.03) indicates that
although massive, this phase of the outflow can not be relevant for the
quenching of the star formation. In addition, only a small fraction ($\leq$
15%) of the ionized outflowing material with velocities above 372 km s$^{-1}$
could escape the gravitational potential, and enrich the surrounding
circum-galactic medium at distances above tens of kpc. The ionized phase of the

the evolution of the host galaxy nor in the enrichment of the intergalactic

dust grain concentration, processing, and collisional fragmentation. We study
gravito-turbulence and its associated spiral structure in thin gaseous disks
subject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence,
and propagation of the spirals and examine when the flow deviates from viscous
disk models. We used the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of
self-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas
was cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational
instability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and
cooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress
transports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk
theory. The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density
wakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium. These
wakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material from the disk with
its corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly
corotate with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral
arms exhibit no long-term global coherence, and energy thermalization is an
essentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures or tidal
forcing, and provided a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a
local phenomenon in thin gaseous disks.

both the Front and rear-end vehicle witnessed in dense traffic and high speed

avoidance algorithm coined as Midvehicle Collision Detection and Avoidance
System (MCDAS) is proposed to evade the possible crash at both ends of the host
vehicle. The method based upon Constant Velocity (CV) model specifically,
addresses two scenarios, the first scenario encompasses two sub-scenario
namely, a) A rear-end collision avoidance mechanism that accelerates the host
vehicle under no front-end vehicle condition and b) Curvilinear motion based on
front and host vehicle offset (position), whilst, the other scenario deals with
parallel parking issues. The offset based curvilinear motion of the host
vehicle plays a vital role in threat avoidance from the front-end vehicle. A
desired curvilinear strategy on left and right sides is achieved by the host
vehicle with concern of possible CV to avoid both end collisions. In this
methodology, path constraint is applicable for both scenarios with required
direction. Monte Carlo analysis of MCDAS covering vehicle kinematics
demonstrated acute discrimination with consistent performance for the collision
validated on simulated with real-time data.

molecular clouds are studied within the SILCC-Zoom project. Since the time
scales of cloud evolution and molecule formation are comparable, the
simulations include a live chemical network. Two sets of simulations with an
increasing spatial resolution (d$x=3.9$ pc to d$x=0.06$ pc) are used to
investigate the convergence of the synthetic CO emission, which is computed by
post-processing the simulation data with the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code.
To determine the excitation conditions, it is necessary to include atomic
hydrogen and helium alongside H$_2$, which increases the resulting CO emission
by ~7-26 per cent. Combining the brightness temperature of $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO, we compare different methods to estimate the excitation temperature,
the optical depth of the CO line and hence, the CO column density. An
intensity-weighted average excitation temperature results in the most accurate
estimate of the total CO mass. When the pixel-based excitation temperature is
used to calculate the CO mass, it is over-/underestimated at low/high CO column
densities where the assumption that $^{12}$CO is optically thick while
$^{13}$CO is optically thin is not valid. Further, in order to obtain a
converged total CO luminosity and hence <$X_{\rm CO}$> factor, the 3D
simulation must have d$x\lesssim0.1$ pc. The <$X_{\rm CO}$> evolves over time
and differs for the two clouds; yet pronounced differences with numerical
resolution are found. Since high column density regions with a visual
extinction larger than 3~mag are not resolved for d$x\gtrsim 1$~pc, in this
case the H$_2$ mass and CO luminosity both differ significantly from the higher
resolution results and the local $X_{\rm CO}$ is subject to strong noise. Our
calculations suggest that synthetic CO emission maps are only converged for
simulations with d$x\lesssim 0.1$ pc.

unrolled learned iterative schemes have shown to consistently deliver
state-of-the-art results for image reconstruction problems across different

in the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either
relatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which
are computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have so far not
been applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems.
Methods: In this work, we propose a CNN-architecture for image reconstruction
of accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is
based on a computationally light CNN-component and a subsequent conjugate
gradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient
training strategy. We investigate the proposed training-strategy and compare
our method to other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and

all other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs
similar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method
using adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate
that even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to
increase the length of the network at test time and further improve the
results. Conclusions: End-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of
trainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further,
because it is possible to change the length of the network at test time, the
need to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the
number of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant.

$^{184}$W target nuclei at laboratory angles of 0$^{\circ}$--45$^{\circ}$ by
$K^-$ mesons with momenta of 2.5, 2.8 and 3.5 GeV/c, which are close to the
threshold momentum ($\approx$ 2.95 GeV/c) for $K_1(1270)^+$ meson production
off the free target proton at rest. The intrinsic properties of carbon and
tungsten target nuclei have been described in terms of their spectral
functions, which take into account the momenta of target protons and the
energies of their separation from the considered nuclei. We show that the
differential and total (absolute and relative) $K_1(1270)^+$ antikaon-induced
production cross sections at initial momenta not far from threshold -- at
momenta $\sim$ 2.8--3.5 GeV/c, at which there is yet no strong drop in their
strength, reveal a distinct sensitivity to changes in the in-medium shift of
the $K_1(1270)^+$ mass, studied in the paper, both in the $K_1(1270)^+$ meson

permit evaluating this shift. Experimental data necessary for this aim can be

the firmware. Based on the CDT, we evaluate security requirements through
automated analysis and requirements verification using policy enforcement
checks and vulnerabilities detection. The evaluation of a CDT is conducted
continuously integrating new checks derived from new security requirements and
from newly disclosed vulnerabilities. We applied our approach to about 100
automotive firmwares. In average, about 600 publicly disclosed vulnerabilities

  from molecular dynamics simulations","16 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point defects in real crystals at finite temperatures are inevitable. Their
dynamics severely influence the mechanical properties of crystals under shear
giving rise to nonlinear effects such as ductility. Therefore, it is crucial to
explore the interplay of the equilibrium point-defect diffusion timescales and
shear-induced timescales to understand the plastic deformation of crystals.
Using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we present a
study on the yielding behavior of cluster crystals (CC), an archetypal model
for defect-rich crystals where the crystalline structure is characterized by
multiple occupancies (cluster) of particles at a lattice site. In equilibrium,
particles diffuse via site-to-site hopping keeping the crystalline structure
intact. We consider the CCs at a fixed density and different temperatures where
it remains in the FCC structure, and the diffusion timescales of particles vary
depending on the temperature. We choose the range of shear rates, which covers
timescales higher and much lower than the equilibrium diffusion timescales at
high temperatures. For the considered range of shear rates and temperatures,
both the macro and microscopic responses of CCs to the shear suggest that the
yielding scenario remains independent of the diffusion of particles. It
involves the plastic deformation of the underlying crystalline structure. The
averaged local bond order parameters and local angle measurements demonstrate
the structural changes and cooperative movement of the center of masses of the
clusters close to the yield point. A comparison with the soft-sphere (SS) FCC
crystal reveals the similarities in the yielding behavior of both systems.
Nonetheless, diffusion of particles influences certain features, such as a less
prominent increase in the local bond order parameters and local angles close to
the yield point.

One distinctive feature of UIP is that its construction only requires summary

investigating the efficacy of memantine in Alzheimer's disease, we illustrate
its ability of adaptively borrowing information from multiple historical

categories from a small number of training examples. A central challenge is
that the available training examples are normally insufficient to determine
which visual features are most characteristic of the considered categories. To
address this challenge, we organize these visual features into facets, which
intuitively group features of the same kind (e.g. features that are relevant to
shape, color, or texture). This is motivated from the assumption that (i) the
importance of each facet differs from category to category and (ii) it is
possible to predict facet importance from a pre-trained embedding of the
category names. In particular, we propose an adaptive similarity measure,
relying on predicted facet importance weights for a given set of categories.
This measure can be used in combination with a wide array of existing
metric-based methods. Experiments on miniImageNet and CUB show that our

that these fluxes are reduced by several percent compared to the case when no

as bright white specks on the soft tissue background of the breast.
Microcalcifications may be a unique indication for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
breast cancer, and therefore their accurate detection is crucial for diagnosis
and screening. Manual detection of these tiny calcium residues in mammograms is
both time-consuming and error-prone, even for expert radiologists, since these
microcalcifications are small and can be easily missed. Existing computerized
algorithms for detecting and segmenting microcalcifications tend to suffer from
a high false-positive rate, hindering their widespread use. In this paper, we
propose an accurate calcification segmentation method using deep learning. We
specifically address the challenge of keeping the false positive rate low by
suggesting a strategy for focusing the hard pixels in the training phase.
Furthermore, our accurate segmentation enables extracting meaningful statistics
on clusters of microcalcifications.

This paper further designs a new optimization-based algorithm -- GOLF, and

  via Exploiting Chordal Structure",,,,,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) plays an important role in the
field of real algebraic geometry and many other areas. As is well-known, the
choice of variable ordering while computing CAD has a great effect on the time
and memory use of the computation as well as the number of sample points
computed. In this paper, we indicate that typical CAD algorithms, if executed
with respect to a special kind of variable orderings (called ""the perfect
elimination orderings""), naturally preserve chordality, which is an important
property on sparsity of variables. Experimentation suggests that if the
associated graph of the polynomial system in question is chordal (\emph{resp.},
is nearly chordal), then a perfect elimination ordering of the associated graph
(\emph{resp.}, of a minimal chordal completion of the associated graph) can be
a good variable ordering for the CAD computation. That is, by using the perfect
elimination orderings, the CAD computation may produce a much smaller full set
of projection polynomials than by using other naive variable orderings. More
importantly, for the complexity analysis of the CAD computation via a perfect
elimination ordering, a so-called $(m,d)$-property of the full set of
projection polynomials obtained via such an ordering is given, through which
the ""size"" of this set is characterized. This property indicates that when the
corresponding perfect elimination tree has a lower height, the full set of
projection polynomials also tends to have a smaller ""size"". This is well
consistent with the experimental results, hence the perfect elimination
orderings with lower elimination tree height are further recommended to be used
in the CAD projection.

an organisation's strategic positioning goals. Such goals often deviate from
the assumptions of standardised affective models. While certain emotions such
as Joy and Trust typically represent desirable brand associations, specific
communication goals formulated by marketing professionals often go beyond such
standard dimensions. For instance, the brand manager of a television show may
consider fear or sadness to be desired emotions for its audience. This article
introduces expansion techniques for affective models, combining common and
commonsense knowledge available in knowledge graphs with language models and
affective reasoning, improving coverage and consistency as well as supporting
domain-specific interpretations of emotions. An extensive evaluation compares
the performance of different expansion techniques: (i) a quantitative
evaluation based on the revisited Hourglass of Emotions model to assess
performance on complex models that cover multiple affective categories, using
manually compiled gold standard data, and (ii) a qualitative evaluation of a
domain-specific affective model for television programme brands. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate that the introduced techniques support a variety

Semantic Grouping Network (SGN) that attempts (1) to group video frames with

on discarding or merging repetitive information based only on the input video.
The SGN learns an algorithm to capture the most discriminating word phrases of
the partially decoded caption and a mapping that associates each phrase to the
relevant video frames - establishing this mapping allows semantically related
frames to be clustered, which reduces redundancy. In contrast to the prior
methods, the continuous feedback from decoded words enables the SGN to
dynamically update the video representation that adapts to the partially
decoded caption. Furthermore, a contrastive attention loss is proposed to
facilitate accurate alignment between a word phrase and video frames without
manual annotations. The SGN achieves state-of-the-art performances by
outperforming runner-up methods by a margin of 2.1%p and 2.4%p in a CIDEr-D

of an exercise regime, we have to account for the associated kinetics of
phosphate (carried by ATP), and for the non-linear dependence of protein
synthesis rates on muscle fibre size. We suggest that the latter effect may
occur via the steric inhibition of ribosome diffusion through the sieve-like
myofilament lattice. The full model yields a steady-state solution
(homeostasis) for muscle cross-sectional area and tension, and a quantitatively
plausible hypertrophic response to training as well as atrophy following an
extended reduction in tension.

portable electronics to electric vehicles. Irrespective of the application,
reliable real-time estimation of battery state of health (SOH) by on-board
computers is crucial to the safe operation of the battery, ultimately
safeguarding asset integrity. In this paper, we design and evaluate a machine
learning pipeline for estimation of battery capacity fade - a metric of battery
health - on 179 cells cycled under various conditions. The pipeline estimates
battery SOH with an associated confidence interval by using two parametric and
two non-parametric algorithms. Using segments of charge voltage and current
curves, the pipeline engineers 30 features, performs automatic feature
selection and calibrates the algorithms. When deployed on cells operated under
the fast-charging protocol, the best model achieves a root mean squared percent
error of 0.45\%. This work provides insights into the design of scalable
data-driven models for battery SOH estimation, emphasising the value of
confidence bounds around the prediction. The pipeline methodology combines
experimental data with machine learning modelling and can be generalized to
other critical components that require real-time estimation of SOH.

of radio galaxies. The set of thirteen Haralick features represent an extremely
compact non-parametric representation of image texture, and are calculated
directly from imagery using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The
GLCM is an encoding of the relationship between the intensity of neighbouring
pixels in an image. Using 10,000 sources detected in the first data release of
the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), we demonstrate that Haralick features
are highly efficient, rotationally invariant descriptors of radio galaxy
morphology. After calculating Haralick features for LoTSS sources, we employ
the fast density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm HDBSCAN to group radio
sources into a sequence of morphological classes, illustrating a simple
methodology to classify and label new, unseen galaxies in large samples. By
adopting a 'soft' clustering approach, we can assign each galaxy a probability
of belonging to a given cluster, allowing for more flexibility in the selection
of galaxies according to combinations of morphological characteristics and for
easily identifying outliers: those objects with a low probability of belonging
to any cluster in the Haralick space. Although our demonstration focuses on
radio galaxies, Haralick features can be calculated for any image, making this
approach also relevant to large optical imaging galaxy surveys.

method can extract community structures without needing a complete network
graph for the Twitter network and validate its size using ""reference score"". It
also takes care of the sampling size problem in Twitter by tracking the
percentage of known nodes that have been included in the data. Thus, solving
most major problems in Twitter data collection procedures and moving a step
further to formalizing data collection methods for the platform. Once the
communities are crawled, and the network graph is clean and complete; it is
then possible to train Machine Learning classifiers using communities as

In this work, we propose a novel approach that models phone-level prosodies

synthetic speech and GMM-MDN can generate more natural and smooth prosody

improves the prosody diversity in synthetic speech without the need of manual

the ADER approach together with an AENO reconstruction technique. Accuracy,

involves only Green's functions of products of gauge-invariant operators,
situated at distinct space-time points, in a way as to avoid potential contact
singularities. Such Green's functions can be computed nonperturbatively in
numerical simulations, with no need to fix a gauge: thus, renormalization to
this ""intermediate"" scheme can be carried out in a completely nonperturbative
manner.
  Expressing renormalized operators in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme requires
the calculation of corresponding conversion factors. The latter can only be
computed in perturbation theory, by the very nature of the $\overline{\rm MS}$;
however, the computations are greatly simplified by virtue of the following
attributes: i) In the absense of operator mixing, they involve only massless,
two-point functions; such quantities are calculable to very high perturbative
order. ii) They are gauge invariant; thus, they may be computed in a convenient
gauge. iii) Where operator mixing may occur, only gauge-invariant operators
will appear in the mixing pattern: Unlike other schemes, involving mixing with
gauge-variant operators (which may contain ghost fields), the mixing matrices
in the present scheme are greatly reduced. Still, computation of some
three-point functions may not be altogether avoidable.
  We exemplify the procedure by computing, to lowest order, the conversion
factors for fermion bilinear operators of the form $\bar\psi\Gamma\psi$ in QCD.
We also employ the gauge-invariant scheme in the study of mixing between gluon
and quark energy-momentum tensor operators: We compute to one loop the
conversion factors relating the nonperturbative mixing matrix to the
$\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.

A major difficulty in application of the periodic boundary is how to deal with
contours when they cross the boundaries. It has been overcome by virtue of a
periodic Green's function, which effectively introduces the periodic boundary

are confirmed by comparing with an analytical solution for the piece-wise

primordial black holes may form close binaries either in the early universe or
more recently through dynamical interactions. A signature of dynamical
formation would be the observation of non-circularized orbits. We search for

clients, ranging up to 32, to evaluate the impact of distributed compute on
task performance in the federated averaging setting. While our findings suggest
that the large sizes of the evaluated models are not generally prohibitive to
federated training, we found that the different models handle federated

slower with larger numbers of clients, and under some circumstances, even
collapses to chance level performance. Investigating this issue presents an

the lack of access to adequately labeled data, which is majorly due to legal
protection regulations or industrial confidentiality. Methods to mitigate this
stir from the area of federated learning, whereby no direct access to training

model synchronization by periodical aggregation of all model parameters.
However, there are many scenarios where trained models cannot be published
since its either confidential knowledge or training data could be reconstructed

incentive-based decentralized routing strategy to nudge the network performance
closer to the system optimum for the context where all vehicles are connected

first stage incorporates a decentralized local route switching dynamical system
to approximate the system optimal route flow in a local area based on vehicles'
knowledge of local traffic information. The second stage optimizes the route
for each CAV by considering individual heterogeneity in traveler preferences
(e.g., the value of time) to maximize the utilities of all travelers in the
local area. Constraints are also incorporated to ensure that these routes can
achieve the approximated local system optimal flow of the first stage. The
third stage leverages an expected envy-free incentive mechanism to ensure that
travelers in the local area can accept the optimal routes determined in the
second stage. The study analytically discusses the convergence of the local
route switching dynamical system. We also show that the proposed incentive
mechanism is expected individual rational and budget-balanced, which ensures
that travelers are willing to participate and guarantee the balance between
payments and compensations, respectively. Further, the conditions for the
expected incentive compatibility of the incentive mechanism are analyzed and
proved, ensuring behavioral honesty in disclosing information.

autonomous UAV in turbulent and varying weather intended to test and validate
the GNSS-Denied performance of different navigation algorithms. Its open-source
\nm{\CC} implementation has been released and is publicly available.
  Onboard sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, a Pitot
tube, an air data system, a GNSS receiver, and a digital camera, so the
simulation is valid for inertial, visual, and visual inertial navigation
systems. Two scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are considered: the
first represents the challenges involved in aborting the mission and heading
towards a remote recovery location while experiencing varying weather, and the
second models the continuation of the mission based on a series of closely
spaced bearing changes.
  All simulation modules have been modeled with as few simplifications as
possible to increase the realism of the results. While the implementation of
the aircraft performances and its control system is deterministic, that of all
other modules, including the mission, sensors, weather, wind, turbulence, and
initial estimations, is fully stochastic. This enables a robust evaluation of
each proposed navigation system by means of Monte-Carlo simulations that rely

the rounding of observations. We show the benefits of the proposed approach on

that their Lebesgue measure is finite, subject to restrictions on $D$ in terms
of $N$. We then use this analysis to determine a bound on the fermionic
potential which yields the coercive property of the energy form. It is from
this, that we derive the existence and uniqueness of the solution. As a
by-product of our argumentation, we show that the Hamiltonian, restricted to
the valleys, has spectrum purely discrete with finite multiplicity. Remarkably,
this is in contrast to the case of the unrestricted space, where it is well
known that the spectrum comprises a continuous segment. We discuss the relation
of our work with the general ground state problem and the question of
confinement in models with strong interactions.

self-interaction correction (SIC) applied to a commonly used GGA energy
functional, however, provides close agreement with both experimental data and

the failure is not due to strong correlation but rather the single electron
self-interaction that is necessarily introduced in estimates of the classical
Coulomb and exchange-correlation energy when only the total electron density is
used as input. The corrected functional depends explicitly on the orbital
densities and can, therefore, avoid the introduction of self-Coulomb
interaction. The error arises because of over-stabilization of bonding
$d$-states in the minority spin channel resulting from an overestimate of the
$d$-electron self-interaction in the semi-local exchange-correlation
functionals. Since the computational effort in the self-interaction corrected
calculations scales with system size in the same way as for regular semi-local
functional calculations, this approach provides a way to calculate properties
of Mn nanoclusters as well as biomolecules and extended solids where Mn dimers

study various stochastic processes under restart mechanism. Emanating from the
canonical diffusion problem by Evans and Majumdar, restart has been shown to
outperform the completion of many first passage processes which otherwise would
take longer time to finish. However, most of the studies so far assumed
continuous time underlying first passage time processes and moreover considered
continuous time resetting restricting out restart processes broken up into
synchronized time steps. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study discrete
space and time first passage processes under discrete time resetting in a
general set-up. We sketch out the steps to compute the moments and the
probability density function which is often intractable in the continuous time
restarted process. A criterion that dictates when restart remains beneficial is
then derived. We apply our results to a symmetric and a biased random walker
(RW) in one dimensional lattice confined within two absorbing boundaries.
Numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with the
theoretical results. Our method can be useful to understand the effect of
restart on the spatiotemporal dynamics of confined lattice random walks in
arbitrary dimensions.

by letting the thickness of a layer surrounding the surface go to zero --
assuming a strong normal force -- is constructed. The new approach we follow to
achieve this is to start with an expression for the 3D momentum operators whose
components along the surface and the normal to the surface are separately
Hermitian. The normal part of the kinetic energy operator is a Hermitian
operator in this case. When this operator is dropped and the thickness of the
layer is set to zero, one automatically gets the Hermitian surface Hamiltonian
that contains the geometric potential term as expected. Hamiltonians for both a
neutral and a charged particle in an electromagnetic field are constructed. We
show that a Hermitian surface and normal momenta emerge automatically once one
symmetrizes the usual normal and surface momentum operators. The present
approach makes it manifest that the geometrical potential originates from the
term that is added to the surface momentum operator to render it Hermitian;
this term itself emerges from symmetrization/ordering of differential momentum
operators in curvilinear coordinates. We investigate the connection between
this approach and the similar approach of Jenssen and Koppe and Costa ( the so
called Thin-Layer Quantization (TLQ)). We note that the critical transformation
of the wavefunction introduced there before taking the thickness of the layer
to zero actually -- while not noted explicitly stated by the authors -- renders
each of the surface and normal kinetic energy operators Hermitian by itself,

handed circularly polarized light is used for sensing the handedness of
molecules. Currently, significant effort is directed towards enhancing weak
differential signals from the molecules, with the goal of extending the
capabilities of chiral spectrometers to lower molecular concentrations or small
analyte volumes. Previously, optical cavities for enhancing vibrational
circular dichroism have been introduced. Their enhancements are mediated by
helicity-preserving cavity modes which maintain the handedness of light due to
their degenerate TE and TM components. In this article, we simplify the design
of the cavity, and numerically compare it with the previous one using an
improved model for the response of chiral molecules. We use parameters of
molecular resonances to show that the cavities are capable of bringing the
vibrational circular dichroism signal over the detection threshold of typical
spectrometers for concentrations that are one to three orders of magnitude
smaller than those needed without the cavities, for a fixed analyte volume.
Frequency resolutions of current spectrometers result in enhancements of more
than one order (two orders) of magnitude for the new (previous) design. With
improved frequency resolution, the new design achieves enhancements of three
orders of magnitude. We show that the TE/TM degeneracy in perfectly helicity
preserving modes is lifted by factors that are inherent to the cavities. More
surprisingly, this degeneracy is also lifted by the molecules themselves due to
their lack of electromagnetic duality symmetry, that is, due to the partial
change of helicity during the light-molecule interactions.

of the DRLDO as a sub-component, an existing Intrusion Detection System could
be augmented with defensive capabilities against 'zero-day' attacks from
obfuscated and metamorphic variants of existing malware. This gains importance,
not only because there exists no system to date that uses advanced DRL to
intelligently and automatically normalize obfuscation down even to the opcode
level, but also because the DRLDO system does not mandate any changes to the
existing IDS. The DRLDO system does not even mandate the IDS' classifier to be
retrained with any new dataset containing obfuscated samples. Hence DRLDO could
be easily retrofitted into any existing IDS deployment. We designed, developed,
and conducted experiments on the system to evaluate the same against
multiple-simultaneous attacks from obfuscations generated from malware samples
from a standardized dataset that contains multiple generations of malware.
Experimental results prove that DRLDO was able to successfully make the
otherwise un-detectable obfuscated variants of the malware detectable by an
existing pre-trained malware classifier. The detection probability was raised
well above the cut-off mark to 0.6 for the classifier to detect the obfuscated
malware unambiguously. Further, the de-obfuscated variants generated by DRLDO
achieved a very high correlation (of 0.99) with the base malware. This
observation validates that the DRLDO system is actually learning to
de-obfuscate and not exploiting a trivial trick.

that, though a $2\times2$ matrix, are Abelian are seen to emerge and their

away these fields induces at the same time a rotation on the wavefunction about
a fixed axis but with a space-dependent angle, both of which being

equal-strength Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI (R+D SOI) is shown to fall within
this special class of Abelian gauge fields, and the phenomenon of Persistent
Spin Helix (PSH) that emerges in the presence of this latter SOI in a plane is
shown to fit naturally within the general formalism developed. The general
formalism is also extended to the case of a particle confined to a ring. It is
shown that the Hamiltonian on a ring in the presence of equal-strength R+D SOI
is unitarily equivalent to that of a particle subject to only a
spin-independent but $\theta$-dependent potential with the unitary
transformation relating the two being again the space-dependent rotation

6H-SiC(0001) by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), some important issues have
not been solved and full wafer scale epitaxy of Gr remains challenging,
hampering applications in microelectronics. With this study we shed light on
the generic mechanism which produces the coexistence of two different types of
Gr domains, whose proportion can be carefully controlled by tuning the H2 flow
rate. For the first time, we show that the growth of Gr using CVD under H2/Ar
flow rate proceeds in two stages. Firstly, the nucleation of free-standing
epitaxial graphene on hydrogen (H-Gr) occurs, then H-atoms eventually desorb
from either step edges or defects. This gives rise, for H2 flow rate below a
critical value, to the formation of (6x6)Gr domains on 6H-SiC(0001). The front
of H-desorption progresses proportionally to the reduction of H2. Using a
robust and generic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we
realistically quantify the proportions of H-Gr and (6x6)Gr domains of a Gr film
synthetized in any experimental conditions. Scanning tunnelling microscopy
supports the XPS measurements. From these results we can deduce that the H-
assisted CVD growth of Gr developed here is a unique method to grow fully
free-standing H-Gr on the contrary to the method consisting of H-intercalation
below epitaxial Gr on buffer layer. These results are of crucial importance for
future applications of Gr/SiC(0001) in nanoelectronics, providing the
groundwork for the use of Gr as an optimal template layer for Van der Waals
homo- and hetero-epitaxy.

distributed servers to compute a linearly separable function, was recently
formulated by the same authors and aims to alleviate the bottlenecks of
stragglers and communication cost in distributed computation. For this purpose,
the data center assigns a subset of input datasets to each server, and each
server computes some coded packets on the assigned datasets, which are then
sent to the user. The user should recover the task function from the answers of
a subset of servers, such the effect of stragglers could be tolerated. In this
paper, we formulate a novel secure framework for this distributed linearly
separable computation, where we aim to let the user only retrieve the desired
task function without obtaining any other information about the input datasets,
even if it receives the answers of all servers. In order to preserve the
security of the input datasets, some common randomness variable independent of
the datasets should be introduced into the transmission. We show that any
non-secure linear-coding based computing scheme for the original distributed
linearly separable computation problem, can be made secure without increasing
the communication cost. Then we focus on the case where the computation cost of
each server is minimum and aim to minimize the size of the randomness variable
introduced in the system while achieving the optimal communication cost. We
first propose an information theoretic converse bound on the randomness size.
We then propose secure computing schemes based on two well-known data
assignments, namely fractional repetition assignment and cyclic assignment. We
then propose a computing scheme with novel assignment, which strictly
outperforms the above two schemes. Some additional optimality results are also

thresholds so that the cumulative ranked sum does not exceed a user-specified
level $t$.
  We validate the use of this method from the multiple testing perspective: for
alternatives of appropriately large signal strength, the false discovery rate
(FDR) of the procedure is shown to converge to the target level $t$, while its
false negative rate (FNR) goes to $0$. We complement this study by providing
convergence rates for the method. Additionally, we prove that the $q$-value
multiple testing procedure shares similar convergence rates in this model.

the past couple of decades. Stable models of gravastar have been studied in
many of the alternative gravity theories besides standard General Relativity
(GR). The Rastall theory of gravity is a popular alternative to GR, specially
in the cosmological and astrophysical context. Here, we propose a stellar model
under the Rastall gravity following Mazur-Mottola's \cite{Mazur2001,Mazur2004}
conjecture. The gravastar consists of three regions, viz., ($I$) Interior
region, ($II$) Intermediate shell region, and ($III$) Exterior region. The
pressure within the interior core region is assumed with a constant negative
matter-energy density which provides a repulsive force over the entire thin
shell region. The shell is assumed to be made up of fluid of ultrarelativistic
plasma which follows the Zel'dovich's conjecture of stiff fluid
\cite{Zeldo1962,Zel'dovich1972}. It is also assumed that the pressure is
proportional to the matter-energy density according to Zel'dovich's conjecture,
which cancel the repulsive force exerted by the interior region. The exterior
region is completely vacuum which is described by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
solution. Under all these specifications we obtain a set of exact and
singularity-free solutions of the gravastar model presenting several physically
valid features within the framework of Rastall gravity. The physical properties
of the shell region namely, the energy density, proper length, total energy and
entropy are explored. The stability of the gravastar model is investigated
using the surface redshift against the shell thickness and maximizing the
entropy of the shell within the framework of Rastall gravity.

growth, coupled grain boundary motion, and recrystallization that occur under
extreme thermomechanical loads. A unified framework to study the coevolution of
grain boundaries with bulk plasticity has recently been developed by Admal et
al. (2018), which is based on modeling grain boundaries as continuum
dislocations governed by an energy based on the Kobayashi--Warren--Carter (KWC)
model (Kobayashi et al., 1998, 2000). While the resulting unified model
demonstrates coupled grain boundary motion and polygonization (seen in
recrystallization), it is restricted to grain boundary energies of the
Read--Shockley type, which applies only to small misorientation angles. In
addition, the implementation of the unified model using finite elements
inherits the computational challenges of the KWC model that originate from the
singular diffusive nature of its governing equations. The main goal of this
study is to generalize the KWC functional to grain boundary energies beyond the
Read--Shockley-type that respect the bicrystallography of grain boundaries. The
computational challenges of the KWC model are addressed by developing a
thresholding method that relies on a primal dual algorithm and the fast
marching method, resulting in an O(NlogN) algorithm, where N is the number of
grid points. We validate the model by demonstrating the Herring angle relation,
followed by a study of the grain microstructure evolution in a two-dimensional
face-centered cubic copper polycrystal with crystal symmetry-invariant grain

interest for many engineering fields and explainable machine learning. A
critical challenge compared with general training is that the term and format
of governing equations is not known as a prior. In addition, significant
measurement noise and complex algorithm hyperparameter tuning usually reduces
the robustness of existing methods. A robust data-driven method is proposed in
this study for identifying the governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
of a given system from noisy data. The proposed method is based on the concept
of Progressive Sparse Identification of PDEs (PSI-PDE or $\psi$-PDE). Special
focus is on the handling of data with huge uncertainties (e.g., 50$\%$ noise
level). Neural Network modeling and fast Fourier transform (FFT) are
implemented to reduce the influence of noise in sparse regression. Following
this, candidate terms from the prescribed library are progressively selected
and added to the learned PDEs, which automatically promotes parsimony with
respect to the number of terms in PDEs as well as their complexity. Next, the
significance of each learned terms is further evaluated and the coefficients of
PDE terms are optimized by minimizing the L2 residuals. Results of numerical
case studies indicate that the governing PDEs of many canonical dynamical
systems can be correctly identified using the proposed $\psi$-PDE method with
highly noisy data. One great benefit of proposed algorithm is that it avoids
complex algorithm modification and hyperparameter tuning in most existing
methods. Limitations of the proposed method and major findings are presented.
