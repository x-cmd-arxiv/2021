recovery rate above which a disease spreading in it becomes an epidemic. In the
absence of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. vaccines), the only way to
control a given disease is to move this threshold by non-pharmaceutical
interventions like social distancing, past the epidemic threshold corresponding
to the disease, thereby tipping the system from epidemic into a non-epidemic
regime. Modeling the disease as a spreading process on a social graph, social
distancing can be modeled by removing some of the graphs links. It has been
conjectured that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the
resulting graph corresponds to the systems epidemic threshold. Here we use a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to study those link removals that do
well at reducing the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The MCMC
method generates samples from the relative canonical network ensemble with a
defined expectation value of $\lambda_{max}$. We call this the
""well-controlling network ensemble"" (WCNE) and compare its structure to
randomly thinned networks with the same link density. We observe that networks
in the WCNE tend to be more homogeneous in the degree distribution and use this
insight to define two ad-hoc removal strategies, which also substantially
reduce the largest eigenvalue. A targeted removal of 80\% of links can be as
effective as a random removal of 90\%, leaving individuals with twice as many
contacts.

studied families are: {CNOT, H, T}, {CNOT, H, NOT}, {CNOT, H, S} (Clifford),
matchgates, and IQP (instantaneous quantum polynomial-time). We verified that
all the families of circuits satisfy on average the principle of decreasing
majorization. In most cases the asymptotic state (number of gates going to
infinity) behaves like a random vector. However, clear differences appear in
the fluctuations of the Lorenz curves associated to asymptotic states. The
fluctuations of the Lorenz curves discriminate between universal and
non-universal classes of random quantum circuits, and they also detect the
complexity of some non-universal but not classically efficiently simulatable
quantum random circuits. We conclude that majorization can be used as a
indicator of complexity of quantum dynamics, as an alternative to, e.g.,

  Quantum Information Science, Volume 11, Number 1, March 2021",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The postulate of the collapse of the wave function stands between the
microscopic, quantum world, and the macroscopic world. Because of this
intermediate position, the collapse process cannot be examined with the
formalism of the quantum mechanics (QM), neither with that of classical
mechanics. This fact makes some physicists to propose interpretations of QM,
which avoid this postulate. However, the common procedure used in that, is
making assumptions incompatible with the QM formalism. The present work
discusses the most popular interpretations. It is shown that because of such
assumptions those interpretations fail, i.e. predict for some experiments
results which differ from the QM predictions. Despite of that, special
attention is called to a proposal of S. Gao, the only one which addresses and
tries to solve an obvious and major contradiction. A couple of theorems are
proved for showing that the collapse postulate is necessary in the QM. Although
nonexplainable with the quantum formalism this postulate cannot be denied,
otherwise one comes to conclusions which disagree with the QM. It is also
proved here that the idea of collapse at a distance is problematic especially
in relativistic cases, and is a misunderstanding. Namely, in an entanglement of
two quantum systems, assuming that the measurement of one of the systems
(accompanied by collapse of that system on one of its states) collapses the
other system too without the second system being measured, leads to a
contradiction.

In the past decades, researchers have devoted many efforts to improving

strategy to improve activity of electrocatalysts by engineering their spatial
structures. Taking Pt catalyst as an example, the mosaic Pt leads to high
catalytic performance, showing a specific activity 11 times higher than uniform
Pt films for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as higher current
densities than commercial Pt/C and uniform Pt films. Such a strategy is found
to be general to other catalysts (e.g., twodimensional PtS) and other reactions
(e.g., oxygen evolution reaction). The improved catalytic performance of the
mosaic catalysts is attributed to enhanced mass transferability and local
electric field, both are determined by the occupation ratio of catalysts. Our
work shines new light on manipulating electrocatalysis from the perspective of
the spatial structure of catalyst, which would guide the design of efficient

multi-tiered quantum circuit optimization protocol called AQCEL. The first
ingredient is a technique to recognize repeated patterns of quantum gates,
opening up the possibility of future hardware co-optimization. The second
ingredient is an approach to reduce circuit complexity by identifying zero- or

demonstration, AQCEL is deployed on an iterative and efficient quantum

this algorithm, our optimization scheme brings a significant reduction in the

unintuitive for novice users as it is hard to predict the impact of changes to

their high-level preferences on the surface quality directly on the target

then automatically translated into low-level design parameters to generate the

effective non-Markovian dynamics of the combined TLS and cavity system, which

consequence of the systematic fading of its [WC\,10] central star whose
brightness has declined by about 10 mag in the past 40 years. Our main results
include that the [\ion{O}{iii}], [\ion{O}{ii}], [\ion{N}{ii}] line intensities
are increasing with time in the inner nebula as a consequence of an increase in
electron temperature from 11,000 K in 2005 to more than 14,000 K in 2018, due
to shocks. The intensity of the same lines are decreasing in the outer nebula,
due to a decrease in temperature, from 13,000 K to 7,000 K, in the same period.
The chemical composition of the inner and outer shells was derived and they are
similar. Both nebulae present subsolar O, S and Ar abundances, while they are
He, N and Ne rich. For the outer nebula the values are 12+log He/H=
11.13$\pm$0.05, 12+log O/H = 8.04$\pm$0.04, 12+log N/H= 7.87$\pm$0.06, 12+log

are several times lower than the average values found in disc non-Type I PNe,
and are reminiscent of some halo PNe. From high resolution spectra, an outflow
in the N-S direction was found in the inner zone. Position-velocity diagrams
show that the outflow expands at velocities in the $-$150 to 100 km s$^{-1}$

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The observed variations toward different

classes of PAH molecules, i.e. with respect to their size, structure, and
charge state. Laboratory spectra of members of these classes are needed to
compare them to observations and to benchmark quantum-chemically computed
spectra of these species. In this paper we present the experimental infrared
spectra of three different PAH dications, naphthalene$^{2+}$,
anthracene$^{2+}$, and phenanthrene$^{2+}$, in the vibrational fingerprint
region 500-1700~cm$^{-1}$. The dications were produced by electron impact
ionization of the vapors with 70 eV electrons, and they remained stable against
dissociation and Coulomb explosion. The vibrational spectra were obtained by IR
predissociation of the PAH$^{2+}$ complexed with neon in a 22-pole cryogenic
ion trap setup coupled to a free-electron infrared laser at the Free-Electron
Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) Laboratory. We performed anharmonic
density-functional theory calculations for both singly and doubly charged
states of the three molecules. The experimental band positions showed excellent
agreement with the calculated band positions of the singlet electronic ground
state for all three doubly charged species, indicating its higher stability
over the triplet state. The presence of several strong combination bands and
additional weaker features in the recorded spectra, especially in the
10-15~$\mu$m region of the mid-IR spectrum, required anharmonic calculations to
understand their effects on the total integrated intensity for the different
charge states. These measurements, in tandem with theoretical calculations,
will help in the identification of this specific class of doubly-charged PAHs
as carriers of AIBs.

Network (GWR) with recurrent connections, episodic memory and a novel subnode

movement per frame is stored in the GWR. For every frame, the current pose and
motion pair is compared against a predicted output of the GWR, allowing for
feedback not only on the pose but also on the velocity of the motion. In a
practical scenario, a physical exercise is performed by an expert like a
physiotherapist and then used as a reference for a humanoid robot like Pepper
to give feedback on a patient's execution of the same exercise. This approach,
however, comes with two challenges. First, the distance from the humanoid robot
and the position of the user in the camera's view of the humanoid robot have to
be considered by the GWR as well, requiring a robustness against the user's
positioning in the field of view of the humanoid robot. Second, since both the
pose and motion are dependent on the body measurements of the original
performer, the expert's exercise cannot be easily used as a reference. This
paper tackles the first challenge by designing an architecture that allows for
tolerances in translation and rotations regarding the center of the field of
view. For the second challenge, we allow the GWR to grow online on incremental
data. For evaluation, we created a novel exercise dataset with virtual avatars
called the Virtual-Squat dataset. Overall, we claim that our novel architecture

This is attributed to their capability on learning good user and item
embeddings by exploiting the collaborative signals from the high-order
neighbors. Like other GCN models, the GCN based recommendation models also
suffer from the notorious over-smoothing problem - when stacking more layers,
node embeddings become more similar and eventually indistinguishable, resulted
in performance degradation. The recently proposed LightGCN and LR-GCN alleviate
this problem to some extent, however, we argue that they overlook an important
factor for the over-smoothing problem in recommendation, that is, high-order
neighboring users with no common interests of a user can be also involved in
the user's embedding learning in the graph convolution operation. As a result,
the multi-layer graph convolution will make users with dissimilar interests
have similar embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel Interest-aware
Message-Passing GCN (IMP-GCN) recommendation model, which performs high-order
graph convolution inside subgraphs. The subgraph consists of users with similar
interests and their interacted items. To form the subgraphs, we design an
unsupervised subgraph generation module, which can effectively identify users
with common interests by exploiting both user feature and graph structure. To
this end, our model can avoid propagating negative information from high-order
neighbors into embedding learning. Experimental results on three large-scale
benchmark datasets show that our model can gain performance improvement by
stacking more layers and outperform the state-of-the-art GCN-based
recommendation models significantly.

to be an entanglement proxy for each symmetry sector, but may diverge in the

the negativity for a free Dirac field at finite temperature and size. We
consider both bipartite and tripartite geometries and exploit conformal field
theory to derive universal results for the charge imbalance resolved
negativity. To this end, we use a geometrical construction in terms of an

Another observation is the high computational cost, when we directly apply
multi-step attack methods designed for CNNs to attack CapsNets, due to the
computationally expensive routing mechanism. Motivated by these two

optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes while satisfying temporal logic
constraints with a desired probability throughout the learning process. An
automata-theoretic approach is proposed to ensure the probabilistic
satisfaction of the constraint in each episode, which is different from
penalizing violations to achieve constraint satisfaction after a sufficiently
large number of episodes. The proposed approach is based on computing a lower
bound on the probability of constraint satisfaction and adjusting the
exploration behavior as needed. We present theoretical results on the
probabilistic constraint satisfaction achieved by the proposed approach. We
also numerically demonstrate the proposed idea in a drone scenario, where the
constraint is to perform periodically arriving pick-up and delivery tasks and
the objective is to fly over high-reward zones to simultaneously perform aerial
monitoring.

In this study, a physicochemical model was developed by deriving a mathematical

a 3D computational model. The model parameters were calibrated using the
experimental data of hydrogen evolution by performing a Bayesian optimization
routine. The model was validated by comparing the predicted change of pH in

of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. From observable data on
confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, a noisy measurement for the contact
rate can be constructed. To filter out measurement errors and seasonality, a
novel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It specifies the log contact
rate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order.
The fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social
behavior such as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information.
A computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is
termed the fractional filter. It allows to estimate UC models with richer
long-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the prediction
error of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS)
estimator for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and
asymptotically normally distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for
several countries are well in line with the chronology of the pandemic, and
allow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy interventions.
As the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at
the end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in
real time.

bounded by $\alpha$. Bansal and Umboh [BU17] gave an $O(\alpha)$-approximation
LP rounding algorithm, which also translates into a near-linear time algorithm
using general-purpose approximation results for explicit mixed packing and
covering or pure covering LPs [KY14, You14, AZO19, Qua10]. Moreover, [BU17]
showed that it is NP-hard to achieve an asymptotic improvement for the
approximation factor. On the other hand, the previous two non-LP-based
algorithms, by Lenzen and Wattenhofer [LW10], and Jones et al. [JLR+13],
achieve an approximation factor of $O(\alpha^2)$ in linear time.
  There is a similar situation in the distributed setting: While there is an
$O(\log^2 n)$-round LP-based $O(\alpha)$-approximation algorithm implied in
[KMW06], the best non-LP-based algorithm by Lenzen and Wattenhofer [LW10] is an
implementation of their centralized algorithm, providing an
$O(\alpha^2)$-approximation within $O(\log n)$ rounds.
  We address the questions of whether one can achieve an
$O(\alpha)$-approximation algorithm that is not LP-based, either in the
centralized setting or in the distributed setting. We resolve both questions in
the affirmative, and en route achieve algorithms that are faster than the
state-of-the-art LP-based algorithms. More specifically, our contribution is
two-fold: 1. In the centralized setting, we provide a surprisingly simple
combinatorial algorithm that is asymptotically optimal in terms of both
approximation factor and running time: an $O(\alpha)$-approximation in linear
time. 2. Based on our centralized algorithm, we design a distributed
combinatorial $O(\alpha)$-approximation algorithm in the CONGEST model that
runs in $O(\alpha\log n )$ rounds with high probability.

surprisingly large electron kinetic energies, of approximately 10-14 eV.
Concomitantly, we present evidence for the onset of indirect, autoionization
phenomena (occurring via superexcited states) within a few eV of the primary
and secondary ionization thresholds. These processes are inferred to compete
with the direct ionization channels and primarily produce low-energy
photoelectrons at photon and electron impact excitation energies below ~15 eV.
Our results highlight that vibrational inelastic electron scattering processes
and neutral photoexcitation and autoionization channels become increasingly
important when photon and electron kinetic energies are decreased towards the
ionization threshold. Correspondingly, we show that for neat water and aqueous
solutions, great care must be taken when quantitatively analyzing photoelectron
spectra measured too close to the ionization threshold. Such care is essential
for both the accurate determination of solvent and solute ionization energies
as well as photoelectron branching ratios and peak magnitudes.

to create views, however, it can be difficult to overcome nuisance variables in

finding samples that are neighbors in the representation space of the network,
and then predict, from one sample's latent representation, the representation

tackle faced problems of MCS, in this paper, we integrate federated learning

\textsc{CrowdFL}. Specifically, in order to protect privacy, participants
locally process sensing data via federated learning and only upload encrypted

algorithm is proposed to average encrypted training models. To reduce
computation and communication overhead of restraining dropped participants,
discard and retransmission strategies are designed. Besides, a

to break the dilemma of privacy protection and data evaluation. Theoretical

the proposed \textsc{CrowdFL} can effectively protect participants privacy and

expansion rate after inflation, $m_{3/2} \lesssim H$, we find catastrophic
gravitational particle production, wherein the number of gravitationally
produced particles is divergent, caused by a transient vanishing of the
helicity-1/2 gravitino sound speed. In contrast with the conventional gravitino
problem, the spectrum of produced particles is dominated by those with momentum
at the UV cutoff. This suggests a breakdown of effective field theory, which
might be cured by new degrees of freedom that emerge in the UV. We study the UV
completion of the Rarita-Schwinger field, namely ${\cal N}=1$, $d=4$,
supergravity. We reproduce known results for models with a single superfield
and models with an arbitrary number of chiral superfields, find a simple
geometric expression for the sound speed in the latter case, and extend this to
include nilpotent constrained superfields and orthogonal constrained
superfields. We find supergravity models where the catastrophe is cured and
models where it persists. Insofar as quantizing the gravitino is tantamount to
quantizing gravity, as is the case in any UV completion of supergravity, the
models exhibiting catastrophic production are prime examples of 4-dimensional
effective field theories that become inconsistent when gravity is quantized,
suggesting a possible link to the Swampland program. We propose the Gravitino

mass distribution that can reproduce the observed multiply-imaging properties.
Such mass reconstructions are generically non-unique. Here, we present an
alternative strategy: instead of modelling the mass distribution, we search
cosmological galaxy-formation simulations for plausible matches. In this paper
we test the idea on seven well-studied lenses from the SLACS survey. For each
of these, we first pre-select a few hundred galaxies from the EAGLE
simulations, using the expected Einstein radius as an initial criterion. Then,
for each of these pre-selected galaxies, we fit for the source light
distribution, while using MCMC for the placement and orientation of the lensing
galaxy, so as to reproduce the multiple images and arcs. The results indicate
that the strategy is feasible, and even yields relative posterior probabilities
of two different galaxy-formation scenarios, though these are not statistically
significant yet. Extensions to other observables, such as kinematics and
colours of the stellar population in the lensing galaxy, is straightforward in
principle, though we have not attempted it yet. Scaling to arbitrarily large
numbers of lenses also appears feasible. This will be especially relevant for
upcoming wide-field surveys, through which the number of galaxy lenses will
rise possibly a hundredfold, which will overwhelm conventional modelling
methods.

of vector-like spectra in 4d F-theory compactifications, we analyze the
structure and origin of these bundles. Fractional powers of line bundles are
also known as root bundles and can be thought of as generalizations of spin
bundles. We explain how these root bundles are linked to inequivalent F-theory
gauge potentials of a $G_4$-flux.
  While this observation is interesting in its own right, it is particularly
valuable for F-theory Standard Model constructions. In aiming for MSSMs, it is
desired to argue for the absence of vector-like exotics. We work out the root
bundle constraints on all matter curves in the largest class of currently-known
F-theory Standard Model constructions without chiral exotics and gauge coupling
unification. On each matter curve, we conduct a systematic ""bottom""-analysis of
all solutions to the root bundle constraints and all spin bundles. Thereby, we
derive a lower bound for the number of combinations of root bundles and spin
bundles whose cohomologies satisfy the physical demand of absence of
vector-like pairs.
  On a technical level, this systematic study is achieved by a well-known
diagrammatic description of root bundles on nodal curves. We extend this
description by a counting procedure, which determines the cohomologies of
so-called limit root bundles on full blow-ups of nodal curves. By use of
deformation theory, these results constrain the vector-like spectra on the
smooth matter curves in the actual F-theory geometry.

of over 800 H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies, selected in 14 z~0.15-0.31 galaxy
clusters, spanning a range of masses and dynamical states. We investigate the
nature of the emission lines in relation to the host galaxy properties, its
location within the cluster, and the properties of the parent cluster. We
uncover remarkable differences between mergers and relaxed clusters. The
majority of H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies in merging cluster fields are
located within 3 Mpc of their center. A large fraction of these line-emitters
in merging clusters are powered by star formation irrespective of
cluster-centric radius, while the rest are powered by active galactic nuclei.
Star-forming galaxies are rare within 3 Mpc of relaxed clusters and active
galactic nuclei are most abundant at their outskirts (~1.5-3 Mpc). We discover
a population of star-forming galaxies with large equivalent widths and blue
UV-optical colors, found exclusively in the merging clusters in our sample. The
widespread emission-line activity in merging clusters is likely supported by
triggered activity in recently-accreted, gas-rich galaxies. By contrast, our
observations for relaxed clusters match established models, in which black hole
activity is enhanced at the virial radius and star-formation is quenched within
the infall region. We conclude that emission-line galaxies experience distinct
evolutionary paths in merging and relaxed clusters.

Initially, assuming a spatially flat universe, the results show that the

energy flux from dark matter to dark energy, with $\alpha \approx 0.2$, while
the non-interacting case, $\alpha = 0$, is ruled out by more than $3\sigma$

low masses, and jet-mode AGN feedback at high masses. Baryons and metals in the
CGM of quenched galaxies are $\gtrsim 90\%$ hot gas, while the CGM of
star-forming galaxies is more multi-phase. Hot CGM gas has low metallicity,
while warm and cool CGM gas have metallicity close to that of galactic gas.
Equivalent widths, covering fractions and total path absorption of HI and
selected metal lines (MgII, SiIII, CIV and OVI) around a matched sample of

observations to $\lesssim 0.4$~dex, depending on ion and assumed ionising
background. Around matched quenched galaxies, absorption in all ions is lower,
with HI absorption significantly under-predicted. Metal-line absorption is
sensitive to choice of photo-ionising background; assuming recent backgrounds,
Simba matches OVI but under-predicts low ions, while an older background
matches low ions but under-predicts OVI. Simba reproduces the observed
dichotomy of OVI absorption around star forming and quenched galaxies. CGM
metals primarily come from stellar feedback, while jet-mode AGN feedback
reduces absorption particularly for lower ions.

functions of an unknown quantum state from a few measurements of the state. It
relies on a unitary channel that efficiently scrambles the quantum information
of the state to the measurement basis. Facing the challenge of realizing deep
unitary circuits on near-term quantum devices, we explore the scenario in which
the unitary channel can be shallow and is generated by a quantum chaotic
Hamiltonian via time evolution. We provide an unbiased estimator of the density
matrix for all ranges of the evolution time. We analyze the sample complexity
of the Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography. For Pauli observables, we find
that it can be more efficient than the unitary-2-design-based shadow tomography
in a sequence of intermediate time windows that range from an order-1
scrambling time to a time scale of $D^{1/6}$, given the Hilbert space dimension
$D$. In particular, the efficiency of predicting diagonal Pauli observables is
improved by a factor of $D$ without sacrificing the efficiency of predicting
off-diagonal Pauli observables.

vacancies tend to be the dominant type of defect in these materials but a
fundamental understanding of their stability and electronic structure has so
far mostly been established in the bulk or strained bulk, neglecting interfaces
and surfaces present in a thin-film geometry. We investigate here, via density
functional theory calculations, oxygen vacancies in the model system of a
SrMnO$_3$ (SMO) thin film grown on a SrTiO$_3$ (STO) (001) substrate.
Structural and electronic differences compared to bulk SMO result mainly from
undercoordination at the film surface. The changed crystal field leads to a
depletion of subsurface valence-band states and transfer of this charge to
surface Mn atoms, both of which strongly affect the defect chemistry in the
film. The result is a strong preference of oxygen vacancies in the surface
region compared to deeper layers. Finally, for metastable oxygen vacancies in
the substrate, we predict a spatial separation of the defect from its excess
charge, the latter being accommodated in the film but close to the substrate
boundary. These results show that surface and interface effects lead to
significant differences in stability and electronic structure of oxygen
vacancies in thin-film geometries compared to the (strained) bulk.

modification to the Newtonian potential, encoded in a single parameter $\delta$
which controls the strength of the modified potential and whose specific values
affect the disc configurations when compared to the general relativistic case.
Our models span different magnetic field strengths, from purely hydrodynamical
discs to highly magnetized tori. The characteristics of the solutions are
identified by analyzing the central density, mass, geometrical size, angular
size, and the black hole metric deviations from the Schwarzschild space-time.
In the general relativistic limit ($\delta=0$) our models reproduce previous
results for a Schwarzschild black hole. For small values of the $\delta$
parameter, corresponding to $\sim 10\%$ deviations from general relativity, we
find variations of $\sim 2 \%$ in the event horizon size, a $\sim 5\%$ shift in
the location of the inner edge and center of the disc, while the outer edge
increases by $\sim 10\%$. Our analysis for $|\delta|>0.1$, however, reveals
notable changes in the black hole space-time solution which have a major impact
in the morphological and thermodynamical properties of the discs. The

identify code locations that might cause bugs in a program. Most existing fault
localization techniques are designed for imperative programs (e.g., C and Java)
and rely on analyzing correct and incorrect executions of the program to
identify suspicious statements. In this work, we introduce a fault localization
approach for models written in a declarative language, where the models are not
""executed,"" but rather converted into a logical formula and solved using
backend constraint solvers. We present FLACK, a tool that takes as input an
Alloy model consisting of some violated assertion and returns a ranked list of
suspicious expressions contributing to the assertion violation. The key idea is
to analyze the differences between counterexamples, i.e., instances of the
model that do not satisfy the assertion, and instances that do satisfy the
assertion to find suspicious expressions in the input model. The experimental
results show that FLACK is efficient (can handle complex, real-world Alloy
models with thousand lines of code within 5 seconds), accurate (can
consistently rank buggy expressions in the top 1.9\% of the suspicious list),
and useful (can often narrow down the error to the exact location within the
suspicious expressions).

generated at active regions undergoing magnetic field restructuring. Their
intensity varies by orders of magnitude within sub-second and sub-MHz scales.
But, the morphological evolution of these sources are not studied at these
scales, due to the lack of required imaging cadence and fidelity in metrewave
bands. Using data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), this work explores
the co-evolution of size, sky-orientation and intensity of a noise storm source
associated with a weak microflare. The work presents the discovery of two
correlated modes of evolution in the source parameters: a sausage like \s\ mode
where the source intensity and size shows an anti-correlated evolution; and a
torsional like \T\ mode where the source size and sky-orientation shows a
correlated evolution. A flare mediated mode conversion is observed from \T\ to
\s\ for the first time in these sources. These results support the idea of
build up of magnetic stress energy in braided active region loops, which later
go unstable causing flares and particle acceleration until they relax to a
minimally braided state. The discovered mode conversion can be a future
diagnostic to such active region phenomena.

at each time $t$, the sender observes a payoff-relevant state drawn
independently and identically from an unknown prior distribution, and shares
state information with the receiver, who then myopically chooses an action. As
in the standard setting, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver into
choosing actions that are aligned with the sender's preference by selectively
sharing information about the state. However, in contrast to the standard
models, the sender does not know the prior, and has to persuade while gradually
learning the prior on the fly.
  We study the sender's learning problem of making persuasive action
recommendations to achieve low regret against the optimal persuasion mechanism
with the knowledge of the prior distribution. Our main positive result is an
algorithm that, with high probability, is persuasive across all rounds and
achieves $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret, where $T$ is the horizon length. The core
philosophy behind the design of our algorithm is to leverage robustness against
the sender's ignorance of the prior. Intuitively, at each time our algorithm
maintains a set of candidate priors, and chooses a persuasion scheme that is
simultaneously persuasive for all of them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm, we further prove that no algorithm can achieve regret better
than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, even if the persuasiveness requirements were
significantly relaxed. Therefore, our algorithm achieves optimal regret for the
sender's learning problem up to terms logarithmic in $T$.

single domain. A far more typical scenario includes a set of closely related,

such algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in
LASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal performance. These
parameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal
sparsity, but this knowledge may often be unavailable. In such cases, cross
validation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven
fashion. Previous work analysing the use of CV in CS has been based on the
$\ell_2$ cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise. But it is well
known that the $\ell_2$ error is not robust to impulse noise and provides a
poor estimate of the recovery error, failing to choose the best parameter. Here
we propose using the $\ell_1$ CV error which provides substantial performance
benefits given impulse measurement noise. Most importantly, we provide a
detailed theoretical analysis and error bounds for the use of $\ell_1$ CV error
in CS reconstruction. We show that with high probability, choosing the
parameter that yields the minimum $\ell_1$ CV error is equivalent to choosing
the minimum recovery error (which is not observable in practice). To our best

several decades, many approaches have emerged to model and predict crack
failure. The phase field method for fracture uses a surrogate damage field to
model crack propagation, eliminating the arduous need for explicit crack
meshing. In this work a novel numerical framework is proposed for implementing
hybrid phase field fracture in heterogeneous materials. The proposed method is
based on the ""reflux-free"" method for solving, in strong form, the equations of
linear elasticity on a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (BSAMR) mesh.
The use of BSAMR enables highly efficient and scalable regridding, facilitates
the use of temporal subcycling for explicit time integration, and allows for
ultra-high refinement at crack boundaries with minimal computational cost. The
method is applied to a variety of simple heterogeneous structures: laminates,
wavy interfaces, and circular inclusions. In each case a non-dimensionalized
parameter study is performed to identify regions of behavior, varying both the
geometry of the problem and the relative fracture energy release rate. In the
laminate and wavy interface cases, regions of delamination and fracture
correspond to simple analytical predictions. For the circular inclusions, the
modulus ratio of the inclusion is varied as well as the delamination energy
release rate and the problem geometry. In this case, a wide variety of
behaviors was observed, including deflection, splitting, delamination, and pure
fracture.

restricted mean survival time (RMST), which does not rely on any model
assumption and can always be interpreted intuitively. As pointed out recently
by Horiguchi and Uno (2020), methods for the RMST based on asymptotic theory
suffer from inflated type-I error under small sample sizes. To overcome this
problem, they suggested a permutation strategy leading to more convincing
results in simulations. However, their proposal requires an exchangeable data
set-up between comparison groups which may be limiting in practice. In
addition, it is not possible to invert their testing procedure to obtain valid
confidence intervals, which can provide more in-depth information. In this
paper, we address these limitations by proposing a studentized permutation test
as well as the corresponding permutation-based confidence intervals. In our
extensive simulation study, we demonstrate the advantage of our new method,
especially in situations with relative small sample sizes and unbalanced
groups. Finally we illustrate the application of the proposed method by
re-analysing data from a recent lung cancer clinical trial.

be dealt with in special cases (e.g. hyperbolic spaces) but are often
sidestepped in higher rank by restricting to the compact quotient case. In this
paper, we present a new approach, using global automorphic Sobolev theory, a
robust framework for solving automorphic PDEs that does not require any
simplifying assumptions about the rank of the symmetric space or the
compactness of the arithmetic quotient. We construct an automorphic heat kernel

semantic segmentation where images are captured from large field of view (FoV)
cameras. State-of-the-art works have made considerable progress toward applying
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to standard (rectilinear) images. However,
the large FoV cameras used in autonomous vehicles produce fisheye images
characterized by strong geometric distortion. This work demonstrates that a CNN
trained on standard images can be readily adapted to fisheye images, which is
crucial in real-world applications where time-consuming real-time data
transformation must be avoided. Our adaptation protocol mainly relies on
modifying the support of the convolutions by using their deformable equivalents
on top of pre-existing layers. We prove that tuning an optimal support only
requires a limited amount of labeled fisheye images, as a small number of
training samples is sufficient to significantly improve an existing model's
performance on wide-angle images. Furthermore, we show that finetuning the
weights of the network is not necessary to achieve high performance once the
deformable components are learned. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of
the effect of the deformable convolutions, bringing elements of discussion on

provide a computationally efficient approximation of the log-partition function
for a generic graphical model. TRW provably provides an upper bound, but the
approximation ratio is generally not quantified.
  As the primary contribution of this work, we provide an approach to quantify
the approximation ratio through the property of the underlying graph structure.
Specifically, we argue that (a variant of) TRW produces an estimate that is
within factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa(G)}}$ of the true log-partition function
for any discrete pairwise graphical model over graph $G$, where $\kappa(G) \in
(0,1]$ captures how far $G$ is from tree structure with $\kappa(G) = 1$ for
trees and $2/N$ for the complete graph over $N$ vertices. As a consequence, the
approximation ratio is $1$ for trees, $\sqrt{(d+1)/2}$ for any graph with
maximum average degree $d$, and $\stackrel{\beta\to\infty}{\approx}
1+1/(2\beta)$ for graphs with girth (shortest cycle) at least $\beta \log N$.
In general, $\kappa(G)$ is the solution of a max-min problem associated with
$G$ that can be evaluated in polynomial time for any graph.
  Using samples from the uniform distribution over the spanning trees of G, we
provide a near linear-time variant that achieves an approximation ratio equal
to the inverse of square-root of minimal (across edges) effective resistance of
the graph. We connect our results to the graph partition-based approximation
method and thus provide a unified perspective.

existed to translate this performance to the visible, namely the realization of
Brillouin-active waveguides in ultra-low optical loss photonics. We have
overcome this barrier, demonstrating the first visible light photonic
integrated SBS laser, which operates at 674 nm to address the 88Sr+ optical

we also demonstrate lasing at 698 nm, the wavelength for the optical clock

approximated by eigenvalues of the learned state transition matrix. The
deterministic convolutional Koopman network (DCKNet) and the variational
convolutional Koopman network (VCKNet) are proposed to span some subspace for
approximating the Koopman operator respectively. Because CKNet is trained under
the constraints of the Koopman theory, the identified latent dynamics is in a

control matrices are trained as trainable tensors so that the identified
dynamics is also time-invariant. We also design an auxiliary weight term for
reducing multi-step linearity and prediction losses. Experiments were conducted

liquid argon, as both single- and dual-phase types, require reconstruction of
the energies of interacting particles, both in the field of direct detection of
dark matter (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles or WIMPs, axions, etc.) and
in neutrino physics. Experimentalists, as well as theorists who
reanalyze/reinterpret experimental data, have used a few different techniques
over the past few decades. In this paper, we review techniques based on solely
the primary scintillation channel, the ionization or secondary channel
available at non-zero drift electric fields, and combined techniques that
include a simple linear combination and weighted averages, with a brief
discussion of the applications of profile likelihood, maximum likelihood, and
machine learning. Comparing results for electron recoils (beta and gamma
interactions) and nuclear recoils (primarily from neutrons) from the Noble
Element Simulation Technique (NEST) simulation to available data, we confirm
that combining all available information generates higher-precision means,
lower widths (energy resolution), and more symmetric shapes (approximately
Gaussian) especially at keV-scale energies, with the symmetry even greater when
thresholding is addressed. Near thresholds, bias from upward fluctuations
matters. For MeV-GeV scales, if only one channel is utilized, an
ionization-only-based energy scale outperforms scintillation; channel
combination remains beneficial. We discuss here what major collaborations use.

sources in a region on the sky displaced 2$^\prime$. This offset preserves the
local field stellar density and magnitude distribution allowing us to
characterize the frequency of chance alignments. The resulting catalog with

is found with Pan-STARRS, where $\sim$99.8% of the sample within the Pan-STARRS

these results, we train a Gaussian Process Regressor to calibrate two
photometric metallicity relationships. For dwarfs of $3500<T_{eff}<5280$ K, we
use metallicity values of 4,378 stars from APOGEE and Hejazi et al. (2020) to
calibrate the relationship, producing results with a $1\sigma$ precision of
0.12 dex and few systematic errors. We then indirectly infer the metallicity of
4,018 stars with $2850<T_{eff}<3500$ K, that are wide companions of primaries
whose metallicities are estimated with our first regressor, to produce a
relationship with a $1\sigma$ precision of 0.21 dex and significant systematic
errors. Additional work is needed to better remove unresolved binaries from
this sample to reduce these systematic errors.

operating on the same resolution, while achieving higher accuracy as well. TNet
is modular, meaning that most classification models could be adopted as its

orthogonal to benefits offered by existing optimized deep models. Finally,
hard-attention guarantees a degree of interpretability to our model's

millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and 24 rotating radio transients(RRATs). Several
exotic pulsars have been discovered in the survey, including PSR J1759+5036, a
binary pulsar with a 176-ms spin period in an orbit with a period of 2.04 days,
an eccentricity of 0.3,and a projected semi-major axis of 6.8 light seconds.
Using seven years of timing data, we are able to measure one post-Keplerian
parameter, advance of periastron, which has allowed us to constrain the total
system mass to 2.62(3) solar masses. This constraint, along with the spin
period and orbital parameters, suggests that this is a double neutron star
system, although we cannot entirely rule out a pulsar-white dwarf binary. This
pulsar is only detectable in roughly 45% of observations, most likely due to
scintillation. However, additional observations are required to determine
whether there may be other contributing effects.

synchronisation errors as well. Moreover, these errors are rarely statistically
independent in nature. By extending on the idea of the Fritchman channel model,
a novel error category-based methodology in determining channel characteristics
is described for memory channels which contain insertion, deletion, and
substitution errors. The practicality of such a methodology is reinforced by
making use of real communication data from a visible light communication
system. Simulation results show that the error-free and error runs using this
new method of defining the channel clearly deviates from the Davey-Mackay
synchronisation model which is memoryless in nature. This further emphasises
the inherent memory in these synchronisation channels which we are now able to
characterise. Additionally, a new method to determine the parameters of a
synchronisation memory channel using the Levenshtein distance metric is
detailed. This method of channel modelling allows for more realistic
communication models to be simulated and can easily extend to other areas of
research such as DNA barcoding in the medical domain.

exchange among cortical regions in the human brain. Recently, it has been
observed that distant brain areas which are not directly connected by neural
links also experience synchronization. Such synchronization between remote
regions is sometimes due to the presence of a mediating region connecting them,
e.g., \textit{the thalamus}. The underlying network structure of this
phenomenon is star-like and motivates us to study the \textit{remote
synchronization} of Kuramoto oscillators, {modeling neural dynamics}, coupled
by a directed star network, for which peripheral oscillators get phase
synchronized, remaining the accommodating central mediator at a different
phase. We show that the symmetry of the coupling strengths of the outgoing
links from the central oscillator plays a crucial role in enabling stable
remote synchronization. We also consider the case when there is a phase shift
in the model which results from synaptic and conduction delays. Sufficient
conditions on the coupling strengths are obtained to ensure the stability of
remotely synchronized states. To validate our obtained results, numerical
simulations are also performed.

vector with $m < n$. The matrices $A_k$ are known and mutually independent for
different $k$. We introduce a novel gradient descent (GD) based solution called
AltGD-Min. We show that, if the $A_k$s are i.i.d. with i.i.d. Gaussian entries,
and if the right singular vectors of $X^*$ satisfy the incoherence assumption,
then $\epsilon$-accurate recovery of $X^*$ is possible with order $(n+q) r^2
\log(1/\epsilon)$ total samples and order $ mq nr \log (1/\epsilon)$ time.
Compared with existing work, this is the fastest solution. For $\epsilon <
r^{1/4}$, it also has the best sample complexity. A simple extension of
AltGD-Min also provably solves LR Phase Retrieval, which is a magnitude-only
generalization of the above problem. AltGD-Min factorizes the unknown $X$ as $X
= UB$ where $U$ and $B$ are matrices with $r$ columns and rows respectively. It
alternates between a (projected) GD step for updating $U$, and a minimization
step for updating $B$. Its each iteration is as fast as that of regular
projected GD because the minimization over $B$ decouples column-wise. At the
same time, we can prove exponential error decay for it, which we are unable to
for projected GD. Finally, it can also be efficiently federated with a
communication cost of only $nr$ per node, instead of $nq$ for projected GD.

those of the carbon-chain species in the warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC)

grading, staging, diagnosing and resecting cancers and other malignancies.
Current histopathological techniques require substantial sample processing
prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) dyes, to highlight nuclear
and cellular morphology. Sample preparation and staining is resource-intensive
and introduces potential for variability during sample preparation.
  Aim: We present a novel method for direct label-free histopathological
assessment of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks and thin tissue
sections using a dual contrast photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscopy
system.
  Approach: To emulate the nuclear and cellular contrast of H&E staining, we
leverage unique properties of the PARS system. Here the ultraviolet excitation
of the PAARS microscope takes advantage of DNA's unique optical absorption to
provide nuclear contrast analogous to hematoxylin staining of cell nucelli.
Concurrently, the optical scattering contrast of the PARS detection system is
leveraged to provide bulk tissue contrast analogous to eosin staining of cell
membranes.
  Results: We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by imaging human
breast tissue and human skin tissues in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
blocks and frozen sections respectively. Salient nuclear and extra-nuclear
features such as cancerous cells, glands and ducts, adipocytes, and stromal
structures such as collagen.
  Conclusions. The presented dual contrast PARS microscope enables label-free
visualizations of tissue with contrast and quality analogous to the current
gold standard for histopathological analysis. Thus, the proposed system is well
positioned to augment existing histopathological workflows, providing
histological imaging directly on unstained tissue blocks and sections.

suffer from high path-loss and intense shadowing which necessitates beamforming
for reliable data transmission. On the other hand, at high frequencies the
channels are sparse and consist of few spatial clusters. Therefore, beam
alignment (BA) strategies are used to find the direction of these channel
clusters and adjust the width of the beam used for data transmission. In this
work, a single-user uplink scenario where the channel has one dominant cluster
is considered. It is assumed that the user transmits a set of BA packets over a
fixed duration. Meanwhile, the base-station (BS) uses different probing beams
to scan different angular regions. Since the BS measurements are noisy, it is
not possible to find a narrow beam that includes the angle of arrival (AoA) of
the user with probability one. Therefore, the BS allocates a narrow beam to the
user which includes the AoA of the user with a predetermined error probability
while minimizing the expected beamwidth of the allocated beam. Due to
intractability of this noisy BA problem, here this problem is posed as an
end-to-end optimization of a deep neural network (DNN) and effects of different
loss functions are discussed and investigated. It is observed that the proposed
DNN based BA, at high SNRs, achieves a performance close to that of the optimal
BA when there is no-noise and for all SNRs, outperforms state-of-the-art.

have attempted to use metrics (e.g., perplexity, BLEU) in language generation

we propose a new framework named ENIGMA for estimating human evaluation scores
based on recent advances of off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning.
ENIGMA only requires a handful of pre-collected experience data, and therefore
does not involve human interaction with the target policy during the
evaluation, making automatic evaluations feasible. More importantly, ENIGMA is
model-free and agnostic to the behavior policies for collecting the experience
data (see details in Section 2), which significantly alleviates the technical
difficulties of modeling complex dialogue environments and human behaviors. Our
experiments show that ENIGMA significantly outperforms existing methods in

the synchronization overhead of tensor computations. As a result, the parallel
performance of ALTO-based tensor operations becomes a function of their
inherent data reuse. On a gamut of tensor datasets, ALTO outperforms an oracle
that selects the best state-of-the-art format for each dataset, when used in
key tensor decomposition operations. Specifically, ALTO achieves a geometric
mean speedup of 8X over the best mode-agnostic (coordinate and hierarchical
coordinate) formats, while delivering a geometric mean compression ratio of
4.3X relative to the best mode-specific (compressed sparse fiber) formats.

restrictions and control performance objectives arise. To confront such a
conflict, this letter proposes a novel methodology that embeds safety into
stability of control systems. The development enforces safety by means of
barrier functions used in optimization through the construction of barrier
states (BaS) which are embedded in the control system's model. As a result, as
long as the equilibrium point of interest of the closed loop system is
asymptotically stable, the generated trajectories are guaranteed to be safe.
Consequently, a conflict between control objectives and safety constraints is
substantially avoided. To show the efficacy of the proposed technique, we
employ barrier states with the simple pole placement method to design safe
linear controls. Nonlinear optimal control is subsequently employed to fulfill
safety, stability and performance objectives by solving the associated
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) which minimizes a cost functional that can
involve the BaS. Following this further, we exploit optimal control with
barrier states on an unstable, constrained second dimensional pendulum on a
cart model that is desired to avoid low velocities regions where the system may
exhibit some controllability loss and on two mobile robots to safely arrive to
opposite targets with an obstacle on the way.

(of size $d$) diseased individuals/defective items in a large population (of
size $n$). This process is based on a minimal number of suitably-designed group
tests on subsets of items, where the test outcome is positive iff the given
test contains at least one defective item. Motivated by physical
considerations, we consider a generalized setting that includes as special
cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature. In our
setting, which subsumes as special cases a variety of noiseless and noisy
group-testing models in the literature, the test outcome is positive with
probability $f(x)$, where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in a pool, and
$f(\cdot)$ is an arbitrary monotonically increasing (stochastic) test function.
Our main contributions are as follows.
  1. We present a non-adaptive scheme that with probability $1-\varepsilon$
identifies all defective items. Our scheme requires at most ${\cal O}( H(f)
d\log\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right))$ tests, where $H(f)$ is a suitably
defined ""sensitivity parameter"" of $f(\cdot)$, and is never larger than ${\cal
O}\left(d^{1+o(1)}\right)$, but may be substantially smaller for many
$f(\cdot)$.
  2. We argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least $\Omega
\left((1-\varepsilon)h(f) d\log\left(\frac n d\right)\right)$ tests to ensure
reliable recovery. Here $h(f) \geq 1$ is a suitably defined ""concentration
parameter"" of $f(\cdot)$.

sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature, and $\frac {H(f)}

rely on an arsenal of heuristics, including loss clipping and gradient
clipping, to ensure successful learning. These heuristics are reminiscent of
techniques from robust statistics, commonly used for estimation in outlier-rich
(``heavy-tailed'') regimes. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical
study to characterize the heavy-tailed nature of the gradients of the PPO
surrogate reward function. We demonstrate that the gradients, especially for
the actor network, exhibit pronounced heavy-tailedness and that it increases as
the agent's policy diverges from the behavioral policy (i.e., as the agent goes
further off policy). Further examination implicates the likelihood ratios and
advantages in the surrogate reward as the main sources of the observed
heavy-tailedness. We then highlight issues arising due to the heavy-tailed
nature of the gradients. In this light, we study the effects of the standard
PPO clipping heuristics, demonstrating that these tricks primarily serve to
offset heavy-tailedness in gradients. Thus motivated, we propose incorporating
GMOM, a high-dimensional robust estimator, into PPO as a substitute for three
clipping tricks. Despite requiring less hyperparameter tuning, our method
matches the performance of PPO (with all heuristics enabled) on a battery of
MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

global pandemic. Different studies have shown that increasing temperature can
play a crucial role in the spread of the virus. Most of these studies were
limited to winter or moderate temperature levels and were conducted using
conventional models. However, traditional models are too simplistic to
investigate complex, non-linear relationships and suffer from some
restrictions. Therefore, we employed copula models to examine the impact of
high temperatures on virus transmission. The findings from the copula models
showed that there was a weak to moderate effect of temperature on the number of
infections and the effect almost vanished under a lockdown policy. Therefore,
this study provides new insight into the relationship between COVID-19 and
temperature, both with and without social isolation practices. Such results can
lead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus. In particular, the
results derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing
traditional models, provide evidence that there is no substantial influence of
high temperatures on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation. In addition, the
results indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by
social isolation practices. To the best of the author knowledge, this is the
first copula model investigation applied to the COVID-19 pandemic.

communications has become a reality despite all the concerns about the
unfavorable propagation characteristics of these frequencies. Even though the
5G systems are still being rolled out, it is argued that their gigabits per
second rates may fall short in supporting many emerging applications, such as
3D gaming and extended reality. Such applications will require several hundreds
of gigabits per second to several terabits per second data rates with low
latency and high reliability, which are expected to be the design goals of the
next generation 6G communications systems. Given the potential of terahertz
(THz) communications systems to provide such data rates over short distances,
they are widely regarded to be the next frontier for the wireless
communications research. The primary goal of this chapter is to equip readers
with sufficient background about the mmWave and THz bands so that they are able
to both appreciate the necessity of using these bands for commercial
communications in the current wireless landscape and to reason the key design
considerations for the communications systems operating in these bands. Towards
this goal, this chapter provides a unified treatment of these bands with
particular emphasis on their propagation characteristics, channel models,
design and implementation considerations, and potential applications to 6G
wireless. A brief summary of the current standardization activities related to
the use of these bands for commercial communications applications is also
provided.

We believe that it is innovative as it was not discussed at all in any previous

  Software-only Target Row Refresh",,,,,"cs.CR cs.OS cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rowhammer attacks that corrupt level-1 page tables to gain kernel privilege
are the most detrimental to system security and hard to mitigate. However,
recently proposed software-only mitigations are not effective against such
kernel privilege escalation attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and
practical software-only defense, called SoftTRR, to protect page tables from
all existing rowhammer attacks on x86. The key idea of SoftTRR is to refresh
the rows occupied by page tables when a suspicious rowhammer activity is
detected. SoftTRR is motivated by DRAM-chip-based target row refresh (ChipTRR)
but eliminates its main security limitation (i.e., ChipTRR tracks a limited
number of rows and thus can be bypassed by many-sided hammer). Specifically,
SoftTRR protects an unlimited number of page tables by tracking memory accesses
to the rows that are in close proximity to page-table rows and refreshing the
page-table rows once the tracked access count exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
We implement a prototype of SoftTRR as a loadable kernel module, and evaluate
its security effectiveness, performance overhead, and memory consumption. The
experimental results show that SoftTRR protects page tables from real-world
rowhammer attacks and incurs small performance overhead as well as memory cost.

generalization. They can only forecast in a specific domain and fail when
applied to systems with different parameters, external forces, or boundary

generalize across heterogeneous domains by partitioning them into different
tasks. DyAd has two parts: an encoder which infers the time-invariant hidden
features of the task with weak supervision, and a forecaster which learns the
shared dynamics of the entire domain. The encoder adapts and controls the
forecaster during inference using adaptive instance normalization and adaptive
padding. Theoretically, we prove that the generalization error of such
procedure is related to the task relatedness in the source domain, as well as
the domain differences between source and target. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both
turbulent flow and real-world ocean data forecasting tasks.

controlled laboratory setting, variation in probe spot size can omit or uncover
crucial structural vibration mode coupling data. In another case, a finite
element simulation of laser vibrometry measures a nonlinearly clattering armor
plate system of a ground vehicle. The simulation shows that sensing the system
dynamics simultaneously over the entire structure reveals more vibration data
than point measurements using a small diameter laser beam spot, regardless of
the variation of footprint (coverage) boundaries. Furthermore, a simulation
method described herein allows calculation of transition probabilities between
modes (change-of-state). Wideband results of both cases demonstrate the 1/$f$

conventional controllers alone and requires highly intelligent processing. In
this regard, learning-based motion generations are currently being
investigated. However, the main issue has been improvements of the adaptability
to spatially varying environments, but a variation of the operating speed has
not been investigated in detail. In contact-rich tasks, it is especially
important to be able to adjust the operating speed because a nonlinear
relationship occurs between the operating speed and force (e.g., inertial and
frictional forces), and it affects the results of the tasks. Therefore, in this
study, we propose a method for generating variable operating speeds while
adapting to spatial perturbations in the environment. The proposed method can
be adapted to nonlinearities by utilizing a small amount of motion data. We
experimentally evaluated the proposed method by erasing a line using an eraser
fixed to the tip of the robot as an example of a contact-rich task.
Furthermore, the proposed method enables a robot to perform a task faster than
a human operator and is capable of operating close to the control bandwidth.

fundamental role in quantum mechanics and blurs the essential distinction
between the measurement apparatus and the objects under investigation. An
appealing phenomenon in quantum measurements, termed as quantum Zeno effect,
can be observed in particular subspaces selected by measurement Hamiltonian.
Here we apply the top-down Zeno mechanism to the particle physics. We indeed
develop an alternative insight into the properties of fundamental particles,
but not intend to challenge the Standard Model (SM). In a unified and simple
manner, our effective model allows to merge the origin of neutrino's small mass
and oscillations, the hierarchy pattern for masses of electric charged
fermions, the color confinement, and the discretization of quantum numbers,
using a perturbative theory for the dynamical quantum Zeno effect. Under
various conditions for vanishing transition amplitudes among particle
eigenstates in the effective model, it is remarkable to probe results that are
somewhat reminiscent of SM, including: (i) neutrino oscillations with big-angle
mixing and small masses emerge from the energy-momentum conservation, (ii)
electrically-charged fermions hold masses in a hierarchy pattern due to the
electric-charge conservation, (iii) color confinement and the associated
asymptotic freedom can be deduced from the color-charge conservation. We make
several anticipations about the basic properties for fundamental particles: (i)
the total mass of neutrinos and the existence of a nearly massless neutrino (of
any generation), (ii) the discretization in quantum numbers for the
new-discovered electrically-charged fermions, (iii) the confinement and the
associated asymptotic freedom for any particle containing more than two
conserved charges.

unequal and change continuously which results in that the laser frequency noise
is nearly $7-8$ orders of magnitude higher than the secondary noises (such as
acceleration noise, optical path noise, etc.). The time delay interferometry
(TDI) that synthesizes virtual interferometers from time-delayed one-way

equivalently recasts the highly oscillatory wave equation as a much less
oscillatory one (the $w$ equation) coupled with a set of ordinary differential
equations governing the dynamics of the so-called GWPT parameters. The
Hamiltonian of the $ w $ equation consists of a quadratic part and a small
non-quadratic perturbation, which is of order $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\varepsilon

expanding the solution of the $ w $ equation as a superposition of Hagedorn's

approximation. This numerical implementation of the GWPT avoids imposing
artificial boundary conditions and facilitates rigorous numerical analysis. For
arbitrary dimensional cases, we establish how the error of solving the

submodule $N$ of $M$ a quasi $J$-submodule if whenever $r\in R$ and $m\in M$
such that $rm\in N$ and $r\notin(J(R)M:M)$, then $m\in M$-$rad(N)$. We present
various properties and characterizations of this concept (especially in
finitely generated faithful multiplication modules). Furthermore, we provide
new classes of modules generalizing presimplifiable modules and justify their
relation with (quasi) $J$-submodules. Finally, for a submodule $N$ of $M$ and
an ideal $I$ of $R$, we characterize the quasi $J$-ideals of the idealization
ring $R(+)M$.

  Transformer","Extension of NAT",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the
success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either
manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search
(NAS) methods. However, even a well-designed/searched architecture may still
contain many nonsignificant or redundant modules/operations. Thus, it is
necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the
performance without introducing extra computational cost. To this end, we have
proposed a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) method which casts the
optimization problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and seeks to replace
the redundant operations with more efficient operations, such as skip or null
connection. Note that NAT only considers a small number of possible transitions
and thus comes with a limited search/transition space. As a result, such a
small search space may hamper the performance of architecture optimization. To
address this issue, we propose a Neural Architecture Transformer++ (NAT++)
method which further enlarges the set of candidate transitions to improve the
performance of architecture optimization. Specifically, we present a two-level
transition rule to obtain valid transitions, i.e., allowing operations to have
more efficient types (e.g., convolution->separable convolution) or smaller
kernel sizes (e.g., 5x5->3x3). Note that different operations may have
different valid transitions. We further propose a Binary-Masked Softmax
(BMSoftmax) layer to omit the possible invalid transitions. Extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the transformed
architecture significantly outperforms both its original counterpart and the
architectures optimized by existing methods.

disentanglement mathematically connects the data transformations to the

of the conditions satisfied and a necessary condition derived for the third
one, we offer additional constraints, from the perspective of the group-based

under the fixed forward simulation model to fit production data. This results
in many difficulties for both reservoir engineers and developers of new
efficient computation schemes. We present a unified approach to reservoir

forward pass from initial geological parameters of the 3D reservoir model
through dynamic state variables to well's production rates and backward
gradient propagation to any model inputs and variables. The model fitting and
geological parameters adaptation both become the optimization problem over
specific parts of the same neural network model. Standard gradient-based
optimization schemes can be used to find the optimal solution. Using real-world
oilfield model and historical production rates we demonstrate that the

the field of energy conversion and transmission. During the conversion from
chemical energy to electrical energy, the species diffusion is generally linked
to the rate of exchange, and hence to the performance of the conversion device.
Alternatively, the transmission of the electric field diffuses the species when
it passes through any medium. The consequences of this effect can be regulated
to attune surface nano-patterns. Otherwise, uncontrolled morphologies may lead
to permanent degradation of the metallic conductors. Therefore, the
understanding of the material behavior, in the presence of the driving forces
of the diffusional species, is of scientific interest. The presented
dissertation proposes to investigate one example of species diffusion in each
case, during energy conversion and transmission. Specifically, the objective of
the study is to explore the lithium insertion into the cathode electrode of
lithium-ion batteries and the morphological evolution of inclusions, while
propagating under the electromigration in the metallic conductors. The

Triangular meshes are used as a surface map representation that is free of

leverage planar parametrization methods to obtain a lower-dimensional

we interpret the original surface and its lower-dimensional representation as

planner can reliably plan high-quality near-optimal trajectories at minimal
computational cost. The accompanying multimedia attachment demonstrates
feasibility on a real OMAV. The obtained paths show less than 10% deviation

Further, we prove that GMA is Pareto optimal with respect to the allocation
size, and it has linear complexity in the input size. Finally, we show with
simulations that this theoretical result could be indeed applied to practical
scenarios, as the resulting path allocations are large enough to fit the

  Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021)",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of selecting optimal backdoor adjustment sets to estimate causal
effects in graphical models with hidden and conditioned variables is addressed.
Previous work has defined optimality as achieving the smallest asymptotic
estimation variance and derived an optimal set for the case without hidden
variables. For the case with hidden variables there can be settings where no
optimal set exists and currently only a sufficient graphical optimality
criterion of limited applicability has been derived. In the present work
optimality is characterized as maximizing a certain adjustment information
which allows to derive a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion for the
existence of an optimal adjustment set and a definition and algorithm to
construct it. Further, the optimal set is valid if and only if a valid
adjustment set exists and has higher (or equal) adjustment information than the
Adjust-set proposed in Perkovi{\'c} et al. [Journal of Machine Learning
Research, 18: 1--62, 2018] for any graph. The results translate to minimal
asymptotic estimation variance for a class of estimators whose asymptotic
variance follows a certain information-theoretic relation. Numerical
experiments indicate that the asymptotic results also hold for relatively small
sample sizes and that the optimal adjustment set or minimized variants thereof
often yield better variance also beyond that estimator class. Surprisingly,
among the randomly created setups more than 90\% fulfill the optimality
conditions indicating that also in many real-world scenarios graphical
optimality may hold. Code is available as part of the python package

IDAAC decouples the optimization of the policy and value function, using
separate networks to model them. Second, it introduces an auxiliary loss which
encourages the representation to be invariant to task-irrelevant properties of
the environment. IDAAC shows good generalization to unseen environments,

graph-based tasks. In a typical graph convolutional layer, node features are
updated by aggregating neighborhood information. Repeatedly applying graph
convolutions can cause the oversmoothing issue, i.e., node features at deep
layers converge to similar values. Previous studies have suggested that
oversmoothing is one of the major issues that restrict the performance of graph
convolutional networks. In this paper, we propose a stochastic regularization
method to tackle the oversmoothing problem. In the proposed method, we
stochastically scale features and gradients (SSFG) by a factor sampled from a
probability distribution in the training procedure. By explicitly applying a
scaling factor to break feature convergence, the oversmoothing issue is
alleviated. We show that applying stochastic scaling at the gradient level is
complementary to that applied at the feature level to improve the overall
performance. Our method does not increase the number of trainable parameters.
When used together with ReLU, our SSFG can be seen as a stochastic ReLU
activation function. We experimentally validate our SSFG regularization method
on three commonly used types of graph networks. Extensive experimental results
on seven benchmark datasets for four graph-based tasks demonstrate that our
SSFG regularization is effective in improving the overall performance of the
baseline graph networks.

i.e., several existing methods attack black-box models better partly because
they craft perturbations with 70% to 130% larger $\ell_2$ distances. Since
larger perturbations naturally lead to better transferability, we thereby
advocate that the strength of attacks should be simultaneously measured by both

emotional expressions in deep neural network (DNN)-based text-to-speech (TTS).
In this study, the meaning of ""extrapolate emotional expressions"" is to borrow
emotional expressions from others, and the collection of emotional speech
uttered by target speakers is unnecessary. Although a DNN has potential power
to construct DNN-based TTS with emotional expressions and some DNN-based TTS
systems have demonstrated satisfactory performances in the expression of the
diversity of human speech, it is necessary and troublesome to collect emotional
speech uttered by target speakers. To solve this issue, we propose
architectures to separately train the speaker feature and the emotional feature
and to synthesize speech with any combined quality of speakers and emotions.
The architectures are parallel model (PM), serial model (SM), auxiliary input
model (AIM), and hybrid models (PM&AIM and SM&AIM). These models are trained
through emotional speech uttered by few speakers and neutral speech uttered by
many speakers. Objective evaluations demonstrate that the performances in the
open-emotion test provide insufficient information. They make a comparison with
those in the closed-emotion test, but each speaker has their own manner of
expressing emotion. However, subjective evaluation results indicate that the
proposed models could convey emotional information to some extent. Notably, the
PM can correctly convey sad and joyful emotions at a rate of >60%.

  Variance",,,,,"math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have provided both empirical and theoretical evidence
illustrating that heavy tails can emerge in stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
in various scenarios. Such heavy tails potentially result in iterates with
diverging variance, which hinders the use of conventional convergence analysis
techniques that rely on the existence of the second-order moments. In this
paper, we provide convergence guarantees for SGD under a state-dependent and
heavy-tailed noise with a potentially infinite variance, for a class of
strongly convex objectives. In the case where the $p$-th moment of the noise
exists for some $p\in [1,2)$, we first identify a condition on the Hessian,
coined '$p$-positive (semi-)definiteness', that leads to an interesting
interpolation between positive semi-definite matrices ($p=2$) and diagonally
dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries ($p=1$). Under this
condition, we then provide a convergence rate for the distance to the global
optimum in $L^p$. Furthermore, we provide a generalized central limit theorem,
which shows that the properly scaled Polyak-Ruppert averaging converges weakly
to a multivariate $\alpha$-stable random vector. Our results indicate that even
under heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, SGD can converge to the global
optimum without necessitating any modification neither to the loss function or
to the algorithm itself, as typically required in robust statistics. We
demonstrate the implications of our results to applications such as linear
regression and generalized linear models subject to heavy-tailed data.

robotic assembly of space structures using techniques like on-orbit additive
manufacturing which can provide flexibility in constructing and even repairing
complex hardware. However, the dynamics underlying the robotic assembler during
manipulation may operate under inertial uncertainties. Thus, inertial
estimation of the robot and the manipulated component system must be considered
during structural assembly. The contribution of this work is to address both
the motion planning and control for robotic assembly with consideration of the
inertial estimation of the combined free-flying robotic assembler and
additively manufactured component system. Specifically, the Linear Quadratic
Regulator Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (LQR-RRT*) and dynamically
feasible path smoothing are used to obtain obstacle-free trajectories for the
system. Further, model learning is incorporated explicitly into the planning
stages via approximation of the continuous system and accompanying reward of
performing safe, objective-oriented motion. Remaining uncertainty can then be
dealt with using robust tube model predictive control. By obtaining controlled
trajectories that consider both obstacle avoidance and learning of the inertial
properties of the free-flyer and manipulated component system, the free-flyer
rapidly considers and plans the construction of space structures with enhanced
system knowledge. The approach naturally generalizes to repairing, refueling,

collision-free trajectories under e.g., inertial uncertainty.

optical nonlinearities arise either from direct photon coupling to excitons in
excited Rydberg states or from resonant two-photon excitation of Rydberg
excitons with finite-range interactions. The latter case yields conditions of
electromagnetically induced transparency and thereby provides an efficient
mechanism for single-photon switching between high transmission and reflectance
of the monolayer, with a tunable dynamical timescale of the emerging
photon-photon interactions. Remarkably, it turns out that the resulting high
degree of photon correlations remains virtually unaffected by Rydberg-state
decoherence, in excess of non-radiative decoherence observed for ground-state
excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors. This robustness to imperfections
suggests a promising new approach to quantum photonics at the level of

originates with Mikhail Gromov in 1999 and which was studied with deep
applications around 2000 by Elon Lindenstrauss and Benjamin Weiss within the
framework of amenable group actions. Let a countable discrete amenable group
$G$ act continuously on compact metrizable spaces $X$ and $Y$. Consider the
product action of $G$ on the product space $X\times Y$. The product inequality
for mean dimension is well known: $\mathrm{mdim}(X\times
Y,G)\le\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)+\mathrm{mdim}(Y,G)$, while it was unknown for a long
time if the product inequality could be an equality. In 2019, Masaki Tsukamoto
constructed the first example of two different continuous actions of $G$ on
compact metrizable spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively, such that the product
inequality becomes strict. However, there is still one longstanding problem
which remains open in this direction, asking if there exists a continuous
action of $G$ on some compact metrizable space $X$ such that
$\mathrm{mdim}(X\times X,G)<2\cdot\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)$. We solve this problem.
Somewhat surprisingly, we prove, in contrast to (topological) dimension theory,
a rather satisfactory theorem: If an infinite (countable discrete) amenable
group $G$ acts continuously on a compact metrizable space $X$, then we have
$\mathrm{mdim}(X^n,G)=n\cdot\mathrm{mdim}(X,G)$, for any positive integer $n$.
Our product formula for mean dimension, together with the example and
inequality (stated previously), eventually allows mean dimension of product
actions to be fully understood.

composite adaptive law ensures the above-mentioned properties under the
strictly weaker finite excitation (FE) condition. Unlike known solutions, in
addition to the PE requirement relaxation, it provides better transient
response under jump change of the plant uncertainty parameters. To derive such
an adaptive law, a novel scheme of uncertainty filtration with resetting is
proposed, which provides the required properties of the control system. A
rigorous proof of all mentioned properties of the developed adaptive law is
presented. Such law is compared with the known composite ones, which also relax
the PE requirement, using the wing-rock problem to conduct numerical
experiments. The obtained results fully support the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

n(n-1)$ and whose boundary coincides with $g_0|_{\partial S^{n}_{+}}$, then
$g=g_0$. This is related to the classical Gelfand problem, which investigates
$-\Delta u=\lambda g(u)$ for certain nonlinearity $g$ in a bounded region
$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition. It
is well-known that there exists an extremal $\lambda^{*}$, such that for

for $\lambda^{*}$ for $g(u)=e^{2u}$ when $n=2$ and
$g(u)=(1+u)^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}}$ for $n\geq 3$. We attempt to generalize the

including optimal policy factorisation, as characterised by minimum biclique

predictive models. In particular, in image segmentation neural networks may
overfit to the foreground samples from small structures, which are often
heavily under-represented in the training set, leading to poor generalization.
In this study, we provide new insights on the problem of overfitting under
class imbalance by inspecting the network behavior. We find empirically that
when training with limited data and strong class imbalance, at test time the
distribution of logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, while
samples of the well-represented class seem unaffected. This bias leads to a
systematic under-segmentation of small structures. This phenomenon is
consistently observed for different databases, tasks and network architectures.
To tackle this problem, we introduce new asymmetric variants of popular loss
functions and regularization techniques including a large margin loss, focal
loss, adversarial training, mixup and data augmentation, which are explicitly
designed to counter logit shift of the under-represented classes. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the proposed modifications to the objective function
can lead to significantly improved segmentation accuracy compared to baselines
and alternative approaches.

which means that formulae are evaluated not on a single assignment of values to
variables, but on a set of such assignments, called a team. This leads to high
expressive power, on the level of existential second-order logic. As an
alternative, Baltag and van Benthem have proposed a local variant of dependence
logic, called logic of functional dependence (LFD). While its semantics is also
based on a team, the formulae are evaluated locally on just one of its
assignments, and the team just serves as the supply of the possible assignments
that are taken into account in the evaluation process. This logic thus relies
on the modal perspective of generalized assignments semantics, and can be seen
as a fragment of first-order logic. For the variant of LFD without equality,
the satisfiability problem is decidable.
  We extend the idea of localising logics of dependence and independence in a
systematic way, taking into account local variants of standard atomic
dependency properties: besides dependence and independence, also inclusion,
exclusion, and anonymity. We study model-theoretic and algorithmic questions of
the localised logics, and also resolve some of the questions that had been left
open by Baltag and van Benthem. In particular, we study decidability issues of
the local logics, and prove that satisfiability of LFD with equality is
undecidable. Further, we establish characterisation theorems via appropriate
notions of bisimulation and study the complexity of model checking problems for
these logics.

that conclusions previously drawn from spoken speech studies may not be valid
in the sung speech domain. We first use a parallel singing/speaking corpus
(NUS-48E) to illustrate differences in sung vs spoken voicing characteristics
including pitch range, syllables duration, vibrato, jitter and shimmer. We then
use this analysis to inform speech recognition experiments on the sung speech
DSing corpus, using a state of the art acoustic model and augmenting
conventional features with various voice source parameters. Experiments are run
with three standard (increasingly large) training sets, DSing1 (15.1 hours),
DSing3 (44.7 hours) and DSing30 (149.1 hours). Pitch combined with degree of
voicing produces a significant decrease in WER from 38.1% to 36.7% when
training with DSing1 however smaller decreases in WER observed when training
with the larger more varied DSing3 and DSing30 sets were not seen to be
statistically significant. Voicing quality characteristics did not improve
recognition performance although analysis suggests that they do contribute to
an improved discrimination between voiced/unvoiced phoneme pairs.

of individuals are routinely captured. Although this has enabled many benefits,
it also infringes on personal privacy. A promising direction in research on
obfuscation of facial images has been the work in the k-same family of methods
which employ the concept of k-anonymity from database privacy. However, there
are a number of deficiencies of k-anonymity that carry over to the k-same
methods, detracting from their usefulness in practice. In this paper, we first
outline several of these deficiencies and discuss their implications in the
context of facial obfuscation. We then develop a framework through which we
obtain a formal differentially private guarantee for the obfuscation of facial
images in generative machine learning models. Our approach provides a provable
privacy guarantee that is not susceptible to the outlined deficiencies of
k-same obfuscation and produces photo-realistic obfuscated output. In addition,
we demonstrate through experimental comparisons that our approach can achieve
comparable utility to k-same obfuscation in terms of preservation of useful
features in the images. Furthermore, we propose a method to achieve
differential privacy for any image (i.e., without restriction to facial images)
through the direct modification of pixel intensities. Although the addition of
noise to pixel intensities does not provide the high visual quality obtained
via generative machine learning models, it offers greater versatility by
eliminating the need for a trained model. We demonstrate that our proposed use
of the exponential mechanism in this context is able to provide superior visual
quality to pixel-space obfuscation using the Laplace mechanism.

also be optimized further by caching the intermediate vectors, and it only

trajectories of the road-users involved were considered to investigate the
human errors as crash contributors. Primary crash contributing factor, evasive
manoeuvres performed, horizontal roadway alignment and speed-related factors
were identified, along with the most frequent configurations and those with the
greatest risk of severe injury. Straight Crossing Path/Lateral Direction was
the most frequent crash configuration and Turn Across Path/ Opposing Direction
that with the greatest risk of serious injury were identified. Multi-vehicle
crashes cannot be considered as a homogenous category of crashes to which the
same human failure is attributed, as different interactions between
motorcyclists and other road users are associated with both different types of
human error and different rider reactions. Human error in multiple-vehicle
crashes related to crossing paths configurations were different from errors
related to rear-end or head-on crashes. Multi-vehicle head-on crashes and
single-vehicle collisions frequently occur along curves. The involved collision
avoidance manoeuvres of the riders differed significantly among the highest
risk crash configurations. The most relevant lack of skills are identified and
linked to their most representative context. In most cases a combination of
different skills was required simultaneously to avoid the crash. The findings
underline the need to group accident cases, beyond the usual single-vehicle
versus multi-vehicle collision approach. Our methodology can also be applied to
support preventive actions based on riders training and eventually ADAS design.

function. The applicability of the algorithm to real smart grid scenarios is
verified and the performance of the algorithm is also demonstrated by numerical
examples.

dynamical characteristics of power grids. In this study, we bring the
operational perspective to the synchronization stability analysis by counting
not only full but also partial synchronization between nodes. To do so, we
introduce two distinct measures that estimate the operational resilience of
power-grid nodes: functional stability and functional resistance. We
demonstrate the practical applicability of the measures in a model network
motif and an IEEE test power grid. As a case study of German power grid, we
reveal that the modular structure of a power grid and particular unidirectional
current flow determine the distribution of the operational resilience of
power-grid nodes. Reproducing our finding on clustered benchmark networks, we
validate the modular effect on power grid stability and confirm that our
measures can be the insightful tools to understand the power grids'
synchronization dynamics.
