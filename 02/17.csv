attracted much attention. These systems feature a special band of eigenstates
called quantum many-body scar states in the energy spectrum. In this work we
study the fate of quantum many-body scar states in a two-dimensional lattice
against random disorders. We show that in both the square lattice and the
honeycomb lattice the scar states can persist up to a finite disorder strength,
before eventually being erased by the disorder. We further study the
localization properties of the system in the presence of even stronger
disorders and show that whether a full localization transition occurs depends
on the type of disorder we introduce. Our study thus reveals the fascinating
interplay between disorder and quantum many-body scarring in a two-dimensional
system.

positive solutions. However, it remains an outstanding open problem to develop
numerical methods that are both (i) of a high order of accuracy and (ii)
capable of preserving positivity. It is known that the two main families of
numerical methods, Runge-Kutta methods and multistep methods, face an order
barrier: if they preserve positivity, then they are constrained to low
accuracy: they cannot be better than first order. We propose novel methods that
overcome this barrier: our methods are of second order, and they are guaranteed
to preserve positivity. Our methods apply to a large class of differential
equations that have a special graph Laplacian structure, which we elucidate.
The equations need be neither linear nor autonomous and the graph Laplacian
need not be symmetric. This algebraic structure arises naturally in many
important applications where positivity is required. We showcase our new
methods on applications where standard high order methods fail to preserve
positivity, including infectious diseases, Markov processes, master equations
and chemical reactions.

interesting online matching property. The result appears in an implicit form in
[BZ 2019]. We present an explicit version of this property which is directly
amenable to typical applications, prove it in a self-contained manner that
clarifies the role of some parameters, and give two applications.
  A $(K, \epsilon)$ lossless expander is a bipartite graph such that any subset
$S$ of size at most $K$ of nodes on the left side of the bipartition has at
least $(1-\epsilon) D |S|$ neighbors, where $D$ is the left degree.The main
result is that any such graph, after a slight modification, admits
$(1-O(\epsilon)D, 1)$ online matching up to size $K$. This means that for any
sequence $S=(x_1, \ldots, x_K)$ of nodes on the left side of the bipartition,
one can assign in an online manner to each node $x_i$ in $S$ a set $A_i$
consisting of $(1-O(\epsilon))$ fraction of its neighbors so that the sets
$A_1, \ldots, A_K$ are pairwise disjoint. ""Online manner"" refers to the fact
that, for every $i$, the set of nodes assigned to $x_i$ only depends on the
nodes assigned to $x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}$.
  The first application concerns storage schemes for representing a set $S$, so
that a membership query ""Is $x \in S$?"" can be answered probabilistically by
reading a single bit. All the previous one-probe storage schemes were for a
static set $S$. We show that a lossless expander can be used to construct a
one-probe storage scheme for dynamic sets, i.e., sets in which elements can be
inserted and deleted without affecting the representation of other elements.
The second application is about non-blocking networks.

this work we propose an instance of the exponential mechanism that
simultaneously estimates exactly $m$ quantiles from $n$ data points while
guaranteeing differential privacy. The utility function is carefully structured
to allow for an efficient implementation that returns estimates of all $m$

empirical risk minimization problems. In this approach, multiple worker nodes
compute gradients in parallel, which are then used by the central node to
update the parameter by solving an auxiliary (preconditioned) smaller-scale
optimization problem. The recently proposed Statistically Preconditioned
Accelerated Gradient (SPAG) method has complexity bounds superior to other such
algorithms but requires an exact solution for computationally intensive
auxiliary optimization problems at every iteration. In this paper, we propose
an Inexact SPAG (InSPAG) and explicitly characterize the accuracy by which the
corresponding auxiliary subproblem needs to be solved to guarantee the same
convergence rate as the exact method. We build our results by first developing
an inexact adaptive accelerated Bregman proximal gradient method for general
optimization problems under relative smoothness and strong convexity
assumptions, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, we explore the
properties of the auxiliary problem in the InSPAG algorithm assuming Lipschitz
third-order derivatives and strong convexity. For such problem class, we
develop a linearly convergent Hyperfast second-order method and estimate the
total complexity of the InSPAG method with hyperfast auxiliary problem solver.
Finally, we illustrate the proposed method's practical efficiency by performing
large-scale numerical experiments on logistic regression models. To the best of
our knowledge, these are the first empirical results on implementing high-order
methods on large-scale problems, we work with data where the dimension is of

for probabilistic localization of insect-scale drones. The conventional
probabilistic localization approaches rely on the three-dimensional (3D)
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based representation of a 3D map. A GMM model with
hundreds of mixture functions is typically needed to adequately learn and
represent the intricacies of the map. Meanwhile, localization using complex GMM
map models is computationally intensive. Since insect-scale drones operate
under extremely limited area/power budget, continuous localization using GMM
models entails much higher operating energy -- thereby, limiting flying
duration and/or size of the drone due to a larger battery. Addressing the
computational challenges of localization in an insect-scale drone using a CIM
approach, we propose a novel framework of 3D map representation using a
harmonic mean of ""Gaussian-like"" mixture (HMGM) model. The likelihood function
useful for drone localization can be efficiently implemented by connecting many
multi-input inverters in parallel, each programmed with the parameters of the
3D map model represented as HMGM. When the depth measurements are projected to
the input of the implementation, the summed current of the inverters emulates
the likelihood of the measurement. We have characterized our approach on an
RGB-D indoor localization dataset. The average localization error in our
approach is $\sim$0.1125 m which is only slightly degraded than software-based
evaluation ($\sim$0.08 m). Meanwhile, our localization framework is
ultra-low-power, consuming as little as $\sim$17 $\mu$W power while processing
a depth frame in 1.33 ms over hundred pose hypotheses in the particle-filtering
(PF) algorithm used to localize the drone.

classification of astronomical objects such as radio galaxies, which are

reducing intra-class variability by preserving equivariance for the Euclidean

performance is modestly improved by the use of both cyclic and dihedral models
without additional hyper-parameter tuning, and that a D16 equivariant model
provides the best test performance. We use the Monte Carlo Dropout method as a

data analysis. Euler characteristic is a classical, well-understood topological
invariant that has appeared in numerous applications, including in the context
of random fields. The goal of this paper is to present the extension of using
the Euler characteristic in higher-dimensional parameter spaces. While
topological data analysis of higher-dimensional parameter spaces using stronger
invariants such as homology continues to be the subject of intense research,
Euler characteristic is more manageable theoretically and computationally, and
this analysis can be seen as an important intermediary step in multi-parameter

artificially generated examples, and a real-world application of detecting
diabetic retinopathy in retinal images.

variables is important for dealing with real-world applications such as
extra-planetary exploration and multi-vehicle transportation systems.
Meanwhile, generating high-quality solutions given certain hybrid planning
specifications is crucial to building high-performance hybrid systems. However,
since hybrid planning is challenging in general, most methods use greedy search
that is guided by various heuristics, which is neither complete nor optimal and
often falls into blind search towards an infinite-action plan. In this paper,
we present a hybrid automaton planning formalism and propose an optimal
approach that encodes this planning problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program
(MILP) by fixing the action number of automaton runs. We also show an extension
of our approach for reasoning over temporally concurrent goals. By leveraging
an efficient MILP optimizer, our method is able to generate provably optimal
solutions for complex mixed discrete-continuous planning problems within a
reasonable time. We use several case studies to demonstrate the extraordinary
performance of our hybrid planning method and show that it outperforms a
state-of-the-art hybrid planner, Scotty, in both efficiency and solution
qualities.

fuel mass fraction distributions, and it can determine the critical heating
power and minimum ignition energy for successful ignition. The flame initiation
process subject to central heating can be approximately decomposed into four
stages, i.e., the fast establishment of the ignition kernel, the
ignition-energy-supported flame kernel propagation, unsteady transition of the
flame kernel, and quasi-steady spherical flame propagation. Comparison between
present transient theory and previous quasi-steady theory indicates that the
unsteady effects directly lead to the appearance of flame kernel establishing
stage and considerably affect the subsequent flame kernel development by
lowering the flame propagation speed. Time scale analysis is conducted, and it
is found that the transient formulation completely degenerates to the
quasi-steady theory either in the neighborhood of stationary flame ball or as
approaching the planar flame. Previous quasi-steady theory shows that the
critical heating power for successful ignition is proportional to the cube of
the critical flame radius. However, the critical heating power predicted by the
present transient formulation deviates this scaling law, which can be
attributed to the unsteady thermal conduction from heating center to the flame
front. Furthermore, in the transient formulation the central heating with
finite duration is considered and the minimum ignition energy is obtained. For
the first time, the memory effect that persistently drives flame propagation
subsequent to central heating switching-off is examined. It is found that as
the heating power grows, the memory effect becomes increasingly important and
it can greatly reduce the minimum ignition energy.

linkage using a convenient algorithm combined with tractable Human Intelligent
Tasks (HITs; i.e. micro tasks requiring human judgment) that can support

requires both automatic processing of well-defined tasks and human processing
of tasks that require human judgment (i.e., HITs) on messy data. We present a
reproducible, interactive, and iterative framework for record linkage called
VIEW (Visual Interactive Entity-resolution Workbench). We implemented and
evaluated VIEW by integrating two commonly used hospital databases, the
American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals and the Medicare
Cost Reports for Hospitals from CMS. Results: Using VIEW to iteratively
standardize and clean the data, we linked all Texas hospitals common in both
databases with 100% precision by confirming 78 approximate linkages using HITs
and manually linking 28 hospitals using HITs. Discussion: Similarities in
hospital names and addresses and the dynamic nature of hospital attributes over
time make it impossible to build a fully automated linkage system for hospitals
that can be maintained over time. VIEW is a software that supports a
reproducible semi-automated process that can generate and track HITs to be
reviewed and linked manually for messy data elements such as hospitals that
have been merged. Conclusion: Effective software that can support the
interactive and iterative process of record linkage, and well-designed HITs can
streamline the linkage processes to support high quality replicable research

and nodes. If these objectives are achieved, an embedding is a meaningful,
understandable, compressed representations of a network that can be used for
other machine learning tools such as node classification, community detection,
or link prediction. The main challenge is that one needs to make sure that
embeddings describe the properties of the graphs well. As a result, selecting
the best embedding is a challenging task and very often requires domain
experts. In this paper, we do a series of extensive experiments with selected

conclusions. First, if one needs to pick one embedding algorithm before running
the experiments, then node2vec is the best choice as it performed best in our
tests. Having said that, there is no single winner in all tests and,
additionally, most embedding algorithms have hyperparameters that should be
tuned and are randomized. Therefore, our main recommendation for practitioners
is, if possible, to generate several embeddings for a problem at hand and then
use a general framework that provides a tool for an unsupervised graph
embedding comparison. This framework (introduced recently in the literature and

flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow
profiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the
transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$\mu$m to 100 $\mu $m,
which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing
processes. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An
order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading
order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset
memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order
indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\mu m$
radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of
$1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in
the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also
calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a
small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it
depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets
of radius $5\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is
seen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly
enhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.

Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). Recent observations of high-redshift galaxies
indicate the onset of earliest star formation just a few 100 million years
after the Big Bang (i.e., z = 12--15), and LST/AtLAST will provide a unique
pathway to uncover spectroscopically-identified first forming galaxies in the
pre-reionization era, once it will be equipped with a large format imaging
spectrograph. We propose a 3-band (200, 255, and 350 GHz), medium resolution (R
= 2,000) imaging spectrograph with 1.5 M detectors in total based on the KATANA
concept (Karatsu et al. 2019), which exploits technologies of the integrated
superconducting spectrometer (ISS) and a large-format imaging array. A 1-deg2
drilling survey (3,500 hr) will capture a large number of [O III] 88 um (and [C

raised by New Horizons' encounters with Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), with
arguably the most important being ""Does Pluto have a subsurface ocean?"". More
broadly, Persephone would answer four significant science questions: (1) What
are the internal structures of Pluto and Charon? (2) How have the surfaces and
atmospheres in the Pluto system evolved? (3) How has the KBO population
evolved? (4) What are the particles and magnetic field environments of the
Kuiper Belt? To answer these questions, Persephone has a comprehensive payload,
and would both orbit within the Pluto system and encounter other KBOs. The
nominal mission is 30.7 years long, with launch in 2031 on a Space Launch
System (SLS) Block 2 rocket with a Centaur kick stage, followed by a 27.6 year
cruise powered by existing radioisotope electric propulsion (REP) and a Jupiter
gravity assist to reach Pluto in 2058. En route to Pluto, Persephone would have
one 50- to 100-km-class KBO encounter before starting a 3.1 Earth-year orbital
campaign of the Pluto system. The mission also includes the potential for an
8-year extended mission, which would enable the exploration of another KBO in
the 100- to 150-km-size class. The mission payload includes 11 instruments:
Panchromatic and Color High-Resolution Imager; Low-Light Camera; Ultra-Violet
Spectrometer; Near-Infrared (IR) Spectrometer; Thermal IR Camera; Radio
Frequency Spectrometer; Mass Spectrometer; Altimeter; Sounding Radar;
Magnetometer; and Plasma Spectrometer. The nominal cost of this mission is
$3.0B, making it a large strategic science mission.

comparing the black hole lensing in general relativity and modified gravity
theories. This may help us to assess the phenomenological differences between
these models. A Kerr black hole is also a solution to some alternative theories
of gravity, while recently obtained modified Kerr black holes (hairy Kerr black
holes), which evade the no-hair theorem, are due to additional sources from
surrounding fluid, like dark matter, having conserved energy momentum tensor
(EMT). These hairy Kerr black holes may also be solutions to an alternative
theory of gravity. We generalize previous work on gravitational lensing by a
Kerr black hole in the strong deflection limits to the hairy Kerr black holes,
with a deviation parameter $\alpha$ and a primary hair $\ell_0$. Interestingly,
the deflection coefficient $\bar{a}$ increases and decreases with increasing
$\ell_0$ and $\alpha$ respectively. $\bar{b}$ shows opposite behaviour with
$\ell_0$ and $\alpha$. We also find that the deflection angle $\alpha_D$,
angular position $\theta_{\infty}$ and $u_{m}$ decrease, but angular separation
$s$ increases with $\alpha$. We compare our results with those for Kerr black
holes, and also apply the formalism to discuss the astrophysical consequences
in the context of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*. We observe that
the deviations of the angular positions from that of the Kerr black hole are
not more than $2.6~\mu$as for Sgr A* and $1.96~\mu$as for M87*, which are
unlikely to be resolved by the current EHT observations.

techniques including absorption, fluorescence, and phase-contrast are commonly
used. Other techniques such as off-resonance defocused imaging (ORDI), where an
in-focus image is deconvolved from a defocused image, have been demonstrated
but find only niche applications. The ORDI inversion process introduces
systematic artifacts because it relies on regularization to account for missing
information at some spatial frequencies. In the present work, we extend ORDI to
use multiple cameras simultaneously at degrees of defocus, eliminating the need
for regularization and its attendant artifacts. We demonstrate this technique
by imaging Bose-Einstein condensates, and show that the statistical
uncertainties in the measured column density using the multiple-camera
off-resonance defocused (MORD) imaging method are competitive with absorption
imaging near resonance and phase contrast imaging far from resonance.
Experimentally, the MORD method may be incorporated into existing set-ups with
minimal additional equipment.

multicomponent semi-compressible fluids with both reversible
(entropy-conserving) and irreversible (entropy-generating) processes.
Semi-compressible fluids are useful in describing \textit{low-Mach} dynamics,
since they are \textit{soundproof}. These models find wide use in many areas of
fluid dynamics, including both geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics.
Specifically, the Boussinesq, anelastic and pseudoincompressible equations are
developed through a unified treatment valid for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds,
thermodynamic potentials and geopotentials. By design, these formulations obey
the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics, ensuring their thermodynamic
consistency. This general approach extends and unifies existing work, and helps
clarify the thermodynamics of semi-compressible fluids. To further this goal,
evolution equations are presented for a wide range of thermodynamic variables:
entropy density $s$, specific entropy $\eta$, buoyancy $b$, temperature $T$,
potential temperature $\theta$ and a generic entropic variable $\chi$; along
with a general definition of buoyancy valid for all three semicompressible
models and arbitrary geopotentials. Finally, the elliptic equation is developed
for all three equation sets in the case of reversible dynamics, and for the
Boussinesq/anelastic equations in the case of irreversible dynamics; and some
discussion is given of the difficulty in formulating the elliptic equation for
the pseudoincompressible equations with irreversible dynamics.

important for the formation of several commonly observed species in disks and
this work demonstrates the need to accurately treat PDR chemistry in disks if
we are to make inferences on the chemical state of the disk during planet
formation epochs. This is found to be even more critical for molecules like
C$_2$H, CN or HCN that are commonly used to infer changes in the elemental disk
C/O and N/O ratios, with implications for planetesimal formation and the
composition of exoplanet atmospheres. Computed vertical column densities with
the full H$_2$ population calculation are increased by $\sim1-2$ orders of
magnitude for molecules such as CN, HCN/HNC compared to calculations with no
treatment of excited H$_2$. For the commonly used pseudo-level approximation,
the computed columns of these molecules are overestimated by a factor of
$\sim3-5$ when compared to the full model. We further note that the computed
abundance for these molecules strongly depends on the strength of the FUV
photons at energies that pump H$_2$ (i.e. 11-13.6 eV), which is not well
constrained in disks, and that rate constants as a function of H$_2$

interplanetary medium. This paper describes the methods and the required
calibrations applied to VEX-VeRa raw radio occultation data used to retrieve
vertical profiles of Venus' ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. In this work we
perform an independent analysis of a set of 25 VEX, single-frequency (X-band),
occultations carried out in 2014, recorded in open-loop at the NASA Deep Space
Network. Our temperature, pressure and electron density vertical profiles are
in agreement with previous studies available in the literature. Furthermore,
our analysis shows that Venus' ionosphere is more influenced by the day/night
condition than the latitude variations, while the neutral atmosphere
experiences the opposite. Our scientific interpretation of these results is
based on two major responsible effects: Venus' high thermal inertia and the
zonal winds. Their presence within Venus' neutral atmosphere determine why in
these regions a latitude dependence is predominant on the day/night condition.
On the contrary, at higher altitudes the two aforementioned effects are less
important or null, and Venus' ionosphere shows higher electron density peaks in
the probed day-time occultations, regardless of the latitude.

techniques are used for task allocation. The number of interactions is limited
by resource constraints such as on computation, storage, and network
communication. We can increase scalability by implementing the system as a
distributed task-allocation system, sharing tasks across many agents. However,
this also increases the resource cost of communications and synchronisation,
and is difficult to scale.
  In this paper we present four algorithms to solve these problems. The
combination of these algorithms enable each agent to improve their task
allocation strategy through reinforcement learning, while changing how much
they explore the system in response to how optimal they believe their current
strategy is, given their past experience. We focus on distributed agent systems
where the agents' behaviours are constrained by resource usage limits, limiting
agents to local rather than system-wide knowledge. We evaluate these algorithms
in a simulated environment where agents are given a task composed of multiple
subtasks that must be allocated to other agents with differing capabilities, to
then carry out those tasks. We also simulate real-life system effects such as
networking instability. Our solution is shown to solve the task allocation
problem to 6.7% of the theoretical optimal within the system configurations
considered. It provides 5x better performance recovery over no-knowledge
retention approaches when system connectivity is impacted, and is tested
against systems up to 100 agents with less than a 9% impact on the algorithms'

sheets end in the ocean. Ice mass loss via calving of the glaciers into the
ocean has increased over the last few decades. Information on the temporal
variability of the calving front position provides fundamental information on
the state of the glacier and ice stream, which can be exploited as calibration
and validation data to enhance ice dynamics modeling. To identify the calving
front position automatically, deep neural network-based semantic segmentation
pipelines can be used to delineate the acquired SAR imagery. However, the
extreme class imbalance is highly challenging for the accurate calving front
segmentation in these images. Therefore, we propose the use of the Mathews
correlation coefficient (MCC) as an early stopping criterion because of its
symmetrical properties and its invariance towards class imbalance. Moreover, we
propose an improvement to the distance map-based binary cross-entropy (BCE)
loss function. The distance map adds context to the loss function about the
important regions for segmentation and helps accounting for the imbalanced
data. Using Mathews correlation coefficient as early stopping demonstrates an
average 15% dice coefficient improvement compared to the commonly used BCE. The
modified distance map loss further improves the segmentation performance by
another 2%. These results are encouraging as they support the effectiveness of
the proposed methods for segmentation problems suffering from extreme class
imbalances.

of the analysis done in the first paper of the series at fixed cosmology. We
use three different synthetic galaxy samples whose clustering properties match
the ones of the CMASS and LOWZ catalogues of BOSS and the SDSS Main Galaxy
Sample. We investigate the relevance of allowing for either short range
non-locality or scale-dependent stochasticity by fitting the real-space galaxy
auto power spectrum or the combination of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power
spectrum. From a comparison among the goodness-of-fit ($\chi^2$), unbiasedness
of cosmological parameters (FoB), and figure-of-merit (FoM), we find that a
four-parameter model (linear, quadratic, cubic non-local bias, and constant
shot-noise) with fixed quadratic tidal bias provides a robust modelling choice
for the auto power spectrum of the three samples, up to $k_{\rm
max}=0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and for an effective volume of
$6\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$. Instead, a joint analysis of the two observables
fails at larger scales, and a model extension with either higher derivatives or
scale-dependent shot-noise is necessary to reach a similar $k_{\rm max}$, with
the latter providing the most stable results. These findings are obtained with
three, either hybrid or perturbative, prescriptions for the matter power
spectrum, \texttt{RESPRESSO}, gRPT and EFT. In all cases, the inclusion of
scale-dependent shot-noise increases the range of validity of the model in
terms of FoB and $\chi^2$. Interestingly, these model extensions with
additional free parameters do not necessarily lead to an increase in the
maximally achievable FoM for the cosmological parameters
$\left(h,\,\Omega_ch^2,\,A_s\right)$, which are generally consistent to those
of the simpler model at smaller $k_{\rm max}$.

ways. The multi-group resource allocation optimisation (MG-RAO) algorithm we
present uses multiple function approximations of resource demand over time,
alongside reinforcement learning techniques, to develop a novel method of
optimising resource allocation in these multi-agent systems. This method is
applicable where there are competing demands for shared resources, or in task
prioritisation problems. Evaluation is carried out in a simulated environment
containing multiple competing agents. We compare the new algorithm to an
approach where child agents distribute their resources uniformly across all the
tasks they can be allocated. We also contrast the performance of the algorithm
where resource allocation is modelled separately for groups of agents, as to
being modelled jointly over all agents. The MG-RAO algorithm shows a 23 - 28%
improvement over fixed resource allocation in the simulated environments.
Results also show that, in a volatile system, using the MG-RAO algorithm
configured so that child agents model resource allocation for all agents as a

dynamics is often described by continuum hydrodynamics. Proving this rigorously
is an outstanding open problem, and precise numerical demonstrations of the
equivalence of the hydrodynamic and microscopic descriptions are rare. We test
this equivalence in the context of the evolution of a blast wave, a problem
that is expected to be at the limit where hydrodynamics could work. We study a
one-dimensional gas at rest with instantaneous localized release of energy for
which the hydrodynamic Euler equations admit a self-similar scaling solution.
Our microscopic model consists of hard point particles with alternating masses,
which is a nonintegrable system with strong mixing dynamics. Our extensive
microscopic simulations find a remarkable agreement with Euler hydrodynamics,
with deviations in a small core region that are understood as arising due to
heat conduction.

unrealistic because (1) not everyone is willing to expose their profiles due to
privacy concerns; and (2) rich user profiles may involve a large number of
attributes (e.g., gender, age, tastes, . . .). In this paper, we study
personalized TDSs without assuming that user profiles are complete. We propose
a Cooperative Memory Network (CoMemNN) that has a novel mechanism to gradually
enrich user profiles as dialogues progress and to simultaneously improve
response selection based on the enriched profiles. CoMemNN consists of two core
modules: User Profile Enrichment (UPE) and Dialogue Response Selection (DRS).
The former enriches incomplete user profiles by utilizing collaborative
information from neighbor users as well as current dialogues. The latter uses
the enriched profiles to update the current user query so as to encode more
useful information, based on which a personalized response to a user request is
selected.
  We conduct extensive experiments on the personalized bAbI dialogue benchmark
datasets. We find that CoMemNN is able to enrich user profiles effectively,
which results in an improvement of 3.06% in terms of response selection
accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also test the robustness of
CoMemNN against incompleteness of user profiles by randomly discarding
attribute values from user profiles. Even when discarding 50% of the attribute
values, CoMemNN is able to match the performance of the best performing
baseline without discarding user profiles, showing the robustness of CoMemNN.

algorithms balancing the quality of the solution with applicability. For the
latter, an important measure is the \emph{adaptive complexity}, capturing the

obtain the first \emph{constant factor} approximation algorithm for
non-monotone submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint with
\emph{near-optimal} $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. Low adaptivity by itself,
however, is not enough: one needs to account for the total number of function

value queries, but can be modified to run with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ instead,
while retaining a low adaptive complexity of $O(\log^2n)$. Besides the above
improvement in adaptivity, this is also the first \emph{combinatorial} approach

comparable to the state-of-the-art even for the special cases of cardinality
constraints or monotone objectives. Finally, we showcase our algorithms'

ranging over the domain of some relational structure like $(\mathbb N;=)$ or
$(\mathbb Q;<)$. Register automata process words over the domain, and along a
run of the automaton, the registers can store data from the input word for
later comparisons. It is long known that the universality problem, i.e., the
problem to decide whether a given register automaton accepts all words over the
domain, is undecidable. Recently, we proved the problem to be decidable in
2-ExpSpace if the register automaton under study is over $(\mathbb N;=)$ and
unambiguous, i.e., every input word has at most one accepting run; this result
was shortly after improved to 2-ExpTime by Barloy and Clemente. In this paper,
we go one step further and prove that the problem is in ExpSpace, and in PSpace
if the number of registers is fixed. Our proof is based on new techniques that
additionally allow us to show that the problem is in PSpace for single-register

the problem is decidable (in ExpSpace) for a more expressive model of
unambiguous register automata, where the registers can take values
nondeterministically, if defined over $(\mathbb N;=)$ and only one register is

address churn, all contribute towards making domain-IP mappings unstable, and
prevent straightforward IP-based browsing tracking.
  In this paper, we show that this instability is not a roadblock (assuming a
universal DoT/DoH and ECH deployment), by introducing an IP-based website
fingerprinting technique that allows a network-level observer to identify at
scale the website a user visits. Our technique exploits the complex structure
of most websites, which load resources from several domains besides their
primary one. Using the generated fingerprints of more than 200K websites
studied, we could successfully identify 84% of them when observing solely
destination IP addresses. The accuracy rate increases to 92% for popular
websites, and 95% for popular and sensitive websites. We also evaluated the
robustness of the generated fingerprints over time, and demonstrate that they
are still effective at successfully identifying about 70% of the tested
websites after two months. We conclude by discussing strategies for website
owners and hosting providers towards hindering IP-based website fingerprinting

assignment for atomic constraint satisfaction problems i.e. where each
constraint is violated by only one assignment to its variables. Let $p$ denote
the maximum probability of violation of any constraint and let $\Delta$ denote
the maximum degree of the line graph of the constraints.
  Our main result is a nearly-linear (in the number of variables) time
algorithm for this problem, which is valid in a Lov\'asz local lemma type
regime that is considerably less restrictive compared to previous works. In
particular, we provide sampling algorithms for the uniform distribution on:
  (1) $q$-colorings of $k$-uniform hypergraphs with $\Delta \lesssim q^{(k-4)/3
+ o_{q}(1)}.$
  The exponent $1/3$ improves the previously best-known $1/7$ in the case $q,
\Delta = O(1)$ [Jain, Pham, Vuong; arXiv, 2020] and $1/9$ in the general case

  The constant $7.043$ improves upon the previously best-known constant of
$350$ [Feng, He, Yin; STOC 2021].
  At the heart of our analysis is a novel information-percolation type argument
for showing the rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics for a carefully
constructed projection of the uniform distribution on satisfying assignments.
Notably, there is no natural partial order on the space, and we believe that
the techniques developed for the analysis may be of independent interest.

these losses are agnostic of the metric structure of the parameters of the

invariant to some extraneous variable of interest by inverting the class of
contrastive losses, i.e., inverse contrastive loss (ICL). We show that if the
extraneous variable is binary, then optimizing ICL is equivalent to optimizing
a regularized MMD divergence. More generally, we also show that if we are
provided a metric on the sample space, our formulation of ICL can be decomposed
into a sum of convex functions of the given distance metric. Our experimental
results indicate that models obtained by optimizing ICL achieve significantly
better invariance to the extraneous variable for a fixed desired level of

explored the vulnerabilities of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to the

that an intelligent adversary can take advantage of a continual learning

it to learn and retain deliberately introduced misinformation. To demonstrate
this vulnerability, we inject backdoor attack samples into the training data.
These attack samples constitute the misinformation, allowing the attacker to
capture control of the model at test time. We evaluate the extent of this
vulnerability on both rotated and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset

that the adversary can create a ""false memory"" about any task by inserting
carefully-designed backdoor samples to the test instances of that task thereby

be either added to the word embedding or attached at the beginning of the
sentence. It serves as a language-specific signal for the Transformer to
capture contextual representations across languages. In this paper, we revisit
the use of language embedding and identify several problems in the existing

word embedding in the self-attention module, we find that the current methods
cannot reflect the language-specific word correlation well. Given these
findings, we propose a new approach called Cross-lingual Language Projection

embeddings into language-specific semantic space, and then the projected
embeddings will be fed into the Transformer model to process with their

appropriately encoding ""language"" in a multilingual Transformer model.
Experimental results show that XLP can freely and significantly boost the model

estimation with complex models, such as deep neural networks, can be difficult
and unreliable. We overcome this limitation by developing a new model-based

out-of-support state-action tuples, without requiring explicit uncertainty

Recently in [6,30], a powerful approach was introduced based on tilting
measures by suitable spherical integrals, particularly establishing a
non-universal large deviation behavior for fixed $p<1$ compared to the standard
Gaussian ($p=1$) case. The case when $p\to 0$ was however completely left open
with one expecting the dense behavior to hold only until the average degree is
logarithmic in $n$. In this article we focus on the case of constant average
degree i.e., $p=\frac{d}{n}$. We prove the following results towards a precise
understanding of the large deviation behavior in this setting.
  1. (Upper tail probabilities): For $\delta>0,$ we pin down the exact exponent
$\psi(\delta)$ such that $$\mathbb{P}(\lambda_1\ge \sqrt{2(1+\delta)\log

tail event, with high probability, a unique maximal clique emerges with a very
precise $\delta$ dependent size (takes either one or two possible values) and
the Gaussian weights are uniformly high in absolute value on the edges in the
clique. Finally, we also prove an optimal localization result for the leading
eigenvector, showing that it allocates most of its mass on the aforementioned
clique which is spread uniformly across its vertices.
  2. (Lower tail probabilities): The exact stretched exponential behavior of
$\mathbb{P}(\lambda_1\le \sqrt{2(1-\delta)\log n})$ is also established.
  As an immediate corollary, we get $\lambda_1 \approx \sqrt{2 \log n}$
typically, a result that surprisingly appears to be new. A key ingredient is an
extremal spectral theory for weighted graphs obtained via the classical
Motzkin-Straus theorem.

expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs)

knowledge. However, finetuning these large models can be costly and time
consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of
specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further
their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we
call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models
to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing
the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The
resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of
masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural
architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with
state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets.

several novel components: a graph-based approach for learning specification of

help programmers use APIs correctly and identify API misuses in their programs.
We evaluated our technique across two popular frameworks: JAAS security

other object-oriented patterns. Our evaluation results show (i) the feasibility
of using ArCode to learn the specification of a framework; (ii) ArCode
generates accurate recommendations for finding the next API call to implement
an architectural tactic/pattern based on the context of the programmer's code;
(iii) it accurately detects API misuses in the code that implements a

unsupervised learning. Although they are widely adopted beyond research, it has
been a longstanding open problem to understand mathematically the feature
extraction mechanism that trained nonlinear autoencoders provide.
  In this work, we make progress in this problem by analyzing a class of
two-layer weight-tied nonlinear autoencoders in the mean field framework. Upon
a suitable scaling, in the regime of a large number of neurons, the models
trained with stochastic gradient descent are shown to admit a mean field
limiting dynamics. This limiting description reveals an asymptotically precise
picture of feature learning by these models: their training dynamics exhibit
different phases that correspond to the learning of different principal
subspaces of the data, with varying degrees of nonlinear shrinkage dependent on
the $\ell_{2}$-regularization and stopping time. While we prove these results
under an idealized assumption of (correlated) Gaussian data, experiments on
real-life data demonstrate an interesting match with the theory.
  The autoencoder setup of interests poses a nontrivial mathematical challenge
to proving these results. In this setup, the ""Lipschitz"" constants of the
models grow with the data dimension $d$. Consequently an adaptation of previous
analyses requires a number of neurons $N$ that is at least exponential in $d$.
Our main technical contribution is a new argument which proves that the
required $N$ is only polynomial in $d$. We conjecture that $N\gg d$ is
sufficient and that $N$ is necessarily larger than a data-dependent intrinsic
dimension, a behavior that is fundamentally different from previously studied
setups.

which manifests itself in a linear string potential between two static charges.
Although gauge fields can be integrated out in one dimension, they can mediate
non-local interactions which in turn influence the paradigmatic Luttinger
liquid properties. However, when the charges become dynamical and their
densities finite, understanding confinement becomes challenging. Here we show
that confinement in 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, with dynamical
matter fields and arbitrary densities, is related to translational symmetry
breaking in a non-local basis. The exact transformation to this string-length
basis leads us to an exact mapping of Luttinger parameters reminiscent of a
Luther-Emery re-scaling. We include the effects of local, but beyond contact,
interactions between the matter particles, and show that confined mesons can
form a Mott-insulating state when the deconfined charges cannot. While the
transition to the Mott state cannot be detected in the Green's function of the
charges, we show that the metallic state is characterized by hidden
off-diagonal quasi-long range order. Our predictions provide new insights to
the physics of confinement of dynamical charges, and can be experimentally
addressed in Rydberg-dressed quantum gases in optical lattices.

candidate eclipsing AE Aqr object, and we present three epochs of time-series
spectroscopy that strongly support this hypothesis. We show that during the
photometric flares noted by Thorstensen (2020) (arXiv:2007.09285), the
half-width-at-zero-intensity of the Balmer and HeI lines routinely reaches a
maximum of ~3000 km/s, well in excess of what is observed in normal cataclysmic
variables. This is, however, consistent with the high-velocity emission seen in
flares from AE Aqr. Additionally, we confirm beyond doubt that J0240 is a
deeply eclipsing system. The flaring continuum, HeI and much of the Balmer
emission likely originate close to the WD because they disappear during the
eclipse that is centered on inferior conjunction of the secondary star. The
fraction of the Balmer emission remaining visible during eclipse has a steep
decrement and it is likely produced in the extended outflow. Most enticingly of
all, this outflow produces a narrow P-Cyg absorption component for nearly half
of the orbit, and we demonstrate that this scenario closely matches the outflow
kinematics predicted by Wynn, King, & Horne (1997). While an important piece of
evidence for the magnetic-propeller hypothesis -- a rapid WD spin period --

propeller-driven outflow viewed nearly edge-on, enabling a new means of

anomaly detection in high-energy physics. The operating principle is that
events which do not belong to the space of training data will be reconstructed
poorly, thus flagging them as anomalies. We point out that in a variety of
examples of interest, the connection between large reconstruction error and
anomalies is not so clear. In particular, for data sets with nontrivial
topology, there will always be points that erroneously seem anomalous due to
global issues. Conversely, neural networks typically have an inductive bias or
prior to locally interpolate such that undersampled or rare events may be
reconstructed with small error, despite actually being the desired anomalies.
Taken together, these facts are in tension with the simple picture of the
autoencoder as an anomaly detector. Using a series of illustrative
low-dimensional examples, we show explicitly how the intrinsic and extrinsic
topology of the dataset affects the behavior of an autoencoder and how this
topology is manifested in the latent space representation during training. We
ground this analysis in the discussion of a mock ""bump hunt"" in which the
autoencoder fails to identify an anomalous ""signal"" for reasons tied to the

deterministic unitary and probabilistic measurement induced state updates,
defining a quantum trajectory. For many-particle systems, the competition of
these different elements of dynamics can give rise to a scenario similar to
quantum phase transitions. To access it despite the randomness of single
quantum trajectories, we construct an $n$-replica Keldysh field theory for the
ensemble average of the $n$-th moment of the trajectory projector. A key
finding is that this field theory decouples into one set of degrees of freedom
that heats up indefinitely, while $n-1$ others can be cast into the form of
pure state evolutions generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This
decoupling is exact for free theories, and useful for interacting ones. In
particular, we study locally measured Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
which can be bosonized to a monitored interacting Luttinger liquid at long
wavelengths. For this model, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian corresponds to a
quantum Sine-Gordon model with complex coefficients. A renormalization group
analysis reveals a gapless critical phase with logarithmic entanglement entropy
growth, and a gapped area law phase, separated by a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The physical picture emerging here
is a pinning of the trajectory wave function into eigenstates of the
measurement operators upon increasing the monitoring rate.

the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the separation of astrophysical foreground
contamination. These foregrounds are known to lie in a wedge-shaped region of
$(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ Fourier space. Removing these Fourier modes excises
the foregrounds at grave expense to image fidelity, since the cosmological
information at these modes is also removed by the wedge filter. However, the
21-cm EoR signal is non-Gaussian, meaning that the lost wedge modes are
correlated to the surviving modes by some covariance matrix. We have developed
a machine learning-based method which exploits this information to identify
ionized regions within a wedge-filtered image. Our method reliably identifies
the largest ionized regions and can reconstruct their shape, size, and location
within an image. We further demonstrate that our method remains viable when
instrumental effects are accounted for, using the Hydrogen Epoch of

ability to recover spatial information from wedge-filtered images unlocks the
potential for imaging studies using current- and next-generation instruments

galaxies, such as accretion and supernova-driven winds, which are difficult to
constrain from observations alone. Here, we use the high-resolution TNG50
cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation to study the properties and
kinematics of the CGM around star-forming galaxies in
$10^{11.5}-10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$ halos at $z\simeq$ 1 using mock MgII absorption
lines, which we generate by postprocessing halos to account for photoionization
in the presence of a UV background. We find that the MgII gas is a very good
tracer of the cold CGM, which is accreting inward at inflow velocities of up to
50 km s$^{-1}$. For sight lines aligned with the galaxy's major axis, we find
that MgII absorption lines are kinematically shifted due to the cold CGM's
significant corotation at speeds up to 50% of the virial velocity for impact
parameters up to 60 kpc. We compare mock MgII spectra to observations from the
MusE GAs FLow and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey of strong MgII absorbers
($\rm{EW}^{2796\r{A}}_{0}>0.5 \; \r{A}$). After matching the equivalent-width
(EW) selection, we find that the mock MgII spectra reflect the diversity of
observed kinematics and EWs from MEGAFLOW, even though the sight lines probe a
very small fraction of the CGM. MgII absorption in higher-mass halos is
stronger and broader than in lower-mass halos but has qualitatively similar
kinematics. The median-specific angular momentum of the MgII CGM gas in TNG50
is very similar to that of the entire CGM and only differs from non-CGM
components of the halo by normalization factors of $\lesssim$ 1 dex.

this is accurate only to first-order in the characteristic opening angle
$\theta_\max$, it allows for efficient implementation via Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs). This work presents practical algorithms for computing the
power spectrum and 2PCF multipoles using pairwise lines-of-sight, adopting
either the galaxy midpoint or angle bisector definitions. Using newly derived
infinite series expansions for spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials, we
construct estimators accurate to arbitrary order in $\theta_\max$, though note
that the midpoint and bisector formalisms themselves differ at fourth order.
Each estimator can be straightforwardly implemented using FFTs, requiring only
modest additional computational cost relative to the Yamamoto approximation. We
demonstrate the algorithms by applying them to a set of realistic mock galaxy
catalogs, and find both procedures produce comparable results for the 2PCF,
with a slight preference for the bisector power spectrum algorithm, albeit at
the cost of greater memory usage. Such estimators provide a useful method to
reduce wide-angle systematics for future surveys.

recent years as they display a remarkable variety of correlated phenomena.
Besides insulating and superconducting phases in the vicinity of integer

nematic order both in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double-bilayer
graphene (tDBG), as signaled by the spontaneous breaking of the threefold
rotational symmetry of the moir\'{e} superlattices. Here, we combine
symmetry-based analysis with a microscopic continuum model to investigate the
structure of the nematic phase of tDBG and its experimental manifestations.
First, we perform a detailed comparison between the theoretically calculated
local density of states and recent scanning tunneling microscopy data
[arXiv:2009.11645] to resolve the internal structure of the nematic order
parameter in terms of the layer, sublattice, spin, and valley degrees of
freedom. We find strong evidence that the dominant contribution to the nematic
order parameter comes from states at the moir\'{e} scale rather than at the
microscopic scale of the individual graphene layers, which demonstrates the key
role played by the moir\'e degrees of freedom and confirms the correlated
nature of the nematic phase in tDBG. Secondly, our analysis reveals an
unprecedented tunability of the orientation of the nematic director in tDBG by
an externally applied electric field, allowing the director to rotate away from
high-symmetry crystalline directions. We compute the expected fingerprints of
this rotation in both STM and transport experiments, providing feasible ways to
probe it. Rooted in the strong sensitivity of the flat bands of tDBG to the
displacement field, this effect opens an interesting route to the electrostatic
control of electronic nematicity in moir\'{e} systems.

the pair production of the non-SM Higgs bosons via the universal gauge
interactions is the dominant mechanism once above the kinematic threshold.
Single Higgs boson production associated with a pair of heavy fermions could be
important in the parameter region with enhanced Yukawa couplings. For both
signal final states, $\mu^+\mu^-$ annihilation channels dominate over the
vector boson fusion (VBF) processes, except at high center of mass energies
where the VBF processes receive large logarithmic enhancement with the increase
of energies. Single Higgs boson $s$-channel production in
$\mu^+\mu^-$-annihilation via the radiative return can also be important for
the Type-L 2HDM in the very large $\tan\beta$ region, extending the kinematic
reach of the heavy Higgs boson mass to the collider energy. Considering both
the production and decay of non-SM Higgs bosons, signals can be identified over
the Standard Model backgrounds. With the pair production channels via
annihilation, 95\% C.L. exclusion reaches in the Higgs mass up to the
production mass threshold of $\sqrt{s}/2$ are possible when channels with
different final states are combined. Including single production modes can
extended the reach further. Different types of 2HDMs can be distinguishable for
moderate and large values of $\tan\beta$.

collapsars may be major sites of the rapid-neutron-capture (r-)process, but the
conditions determining the electron fraction (Y_e) remain uncertain given the
complexity of neutrino transfer and angular-momentum transport. After
discussing relevant weak-interaction regimes, we study the role of neutrino
absorption for shaping Y_e using an extensive set of simulations performed with
two-moment neutrino transport and again without neutrino absorption. We vary
the torus mass, BH mass and spin, and examine the impact of rest-mass and
weak-magnetism corrections in the neutrino rates. We also test the dependence
on the angular-momentum transport treatment by comparing axisymmetric models
using the standard alpha-viscosity with viscous models assuming constant
viscous length scales (l_t) and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. Finally, we discuss the nucleosynthesis yields and basic kilonova
properties. We find that absorption pushes Y_e towards ~0.5 outside the torus,
while inside increasing the equilibrium value Y_e^eq by ~0.05-0.2.
Correspondingly, a substantial ejecta fraction is pushed above Y_e=0.25,
leading to a reduced lanthanide fraction and a brighter, earlier, and bluer
kilonova than without absorption. More compact tori with higher neutrino
optical depth, tau, tend to have lower Y_e^eq up to tau~1-10, above which
absorption becomes strong enough to reverse this trend. Disk ejecta are less
(more) neutron-rich when employing an l_t=const. viscosity (MHD treatment). The
solar-like abundance pattern found for our MHD model marginally supports
collapsar disks as major r-process sites, although a strong r-process may be
limited to phases of high mass-infall rates, Mdot>~ 2 x 10^(-2) Msun/s.

  metallicity in the appendix. Conclusions unchanged",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1094",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Galaxy models have long predicted that galactic bars slow down by losing
angular momentum to their postulated dark haloes. When the bar slows down,
resonance sweeps radially outwards through the galactic disc while growing in
volume, thereby sequentially capturing new stars at its surface/separatrix.
Since trapped stars conserve their action of libration, which measures the
relative distance to the resonance centre, the order of capturing is preserved:
the surface of the resonance is dominated by stars captured recently at large
radius, while the core of the resonance is occupied by stars trapped early at
small radius. The slow-down of the bar thus results in a rising mean
metallicity of trapped stars from the surface towards the centre of the
resonance as the Galaxy's metallicity declines towards large radii. This
argument, when applied to Solar neighbourhood stars, allows a novel precision
measurement of the bar's current pattern speed $\Omega_p = 35.5 \pm 0.8$
km/s/kpc, placing the corotation radius at $R_{CR} = 6.6 \pm 0.2$ kpc. With
this pattern speed, the corotation resonance precisely fits the Hercules stream
in agreement with kinematics. Beyond corroborating the slow bar theory, this
measurement manifests the deceleration of the bar of more than 24% since its
formation and thus the angular momentum transfer to the dark halo by dynamical
friction. The measurement therefore supports the existence of a standard
dark-matter halo rather than alternative models of gravity.

galaxy-wide, AGN-driven outflows through coronal line (CL) emission. We find
strong CL detections in 5/9 galaxies (55$\%$) with line ratios incompatible
with shocks, confirming the presence of AGN in these galaxies. Similar CL
detection rates are found in larger samples of more massive galaxies hosting
type 1 and 2 AGN. We investigate the connection between the CLs and galaxy-wide
outflows by analyzing the kinematics of the CL region, as well as the scaling
of gas velocity with ionization potential of different CLs. In addition, using
complementary Keck KCWI observations of these objects, we find that the outflow
velocities measured in [Si VI] are generally faster than those seen in [O III].
The galaxies with the fastest outflows seen in [O III] also have the highest
[Si VI] luminosity. The lack of $J$-band CN absorption features, which are
often associated with younger stellar populations, provides further evidence
that these outflows are driven by AGN in low mass galaxies.

large uncertainties associated with the nuclear physics input in the yield

single-stellar populations in star-forming dwarf galaxies, products of binary
evolution are expected to significantly contribute to emissions of
hydrogen-ionizing photons. Among these products are stripped stars (or helium
stars), which have their envelopes stripped from interactions with binary
companions, leaving an exposed helium core. Previous work has suggested these
stripped stars can dominate the LyC photon output of high-redshift low
luminosity galaxies. Other sources of hard radiation in the early universe
include zero-metallicity Population III stars, which may have similar SED
properties to galaxies with radiation dominated by stripped star emissions.
Here, we use two metrics (the power-law exponent over wavelength intervals
240-500 \r{A}, 600-900 \r{A}, and 1200-2000 \r{A}, and the ratio of total
luminosity in FUV wavelengths to LyC wavelengths) to compare the SEDs of
simulated galaxies with only single-stellar evolution, galaxies containing
stripped stars, and galaxies containing Population III stars, with four
different IMFs. We find that stripped stars significantly alter the SEDs in the
LyC range of galaxies at the epoch of reionization. SEDs in galaxies with
stripped stars present have lower power-law indices in the LyC range and lower
FUV to LyC luminosity ratios. These differences in SEDs are present at all
considered luminosities ($M_{UV} > -15$, AB system), and are most pronounced
for lower luminosity galaxies. We also find that SEDs of galaxies with stripped

partly due to the fact that most fairness metrics of interest depend on both
the sensitive attribute information and label information of the data points.
In many scenarios it is not possible to collect large datasets with such
information. An alternate approach that is commonly used is to separately train
an attribute classifier on data with sensitive attribute information, and then
use it later in the ML pipeline to evaluate the bias of a given classifier.
While such decoupling helps alleviate the problem of demographic scarcity, it
raises several natural questions such as: how should the attribute classifier
be trained?, and how should one use a given attribute classifier for accurate
bias estimation? In this work we study this question from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives.
  We first experimentally demonstrate that the test accuracy of the attribute
classifier is not always correlated with its effectiveness in bias estimation
for a downstream model. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we
analyze an idealized theoretical model and characterize the structure of the
optimal classifier. Our analysis has surprising and counter-intuitive
implications where in certain regimes one might want to distribute the error of
the attribute classifier as unevenly as possible among the different subgroups.
Based on our analysis we develop heuristics for both training and using
attribute classifiers for bias estimation in the data scarce regime. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real and simulated

utilizes Line Outage Distribution Factors (LODFs) and group betweenness
centrality to identify subsets of critical branches. The proposed LODF metrics
are used to select the high-impact branches. Based on each selected branch, the
approach constructs the subgraph with parameters of distance and search level,

work is the use of the distance and search level parameters, which allow the
subgraph to identify the most coupled critical elements that may be far away
from a selected branch. The proposed approach is validated using the 200- and

multiple N-x contingencies that cause violations.

visited location using visual information. Many attempts to improve the
performance of VPR methods have been made in the literature. One approach that
has received attention recently is the multi-process fusion where different VPR
methods run in parallel and their outputs are combined in an effort to achieve
better performance. The multi-process fusion, however, does not have a
well-defined criterion for selecting and combining different VPR methods from a
wide range of available options. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
investigates the complementarity of state-of-the-art VPR methods systematically
for the first time and identifies those combinations which can result in better
performance. The paper presents a well-defined framework which acts as a sanity
check to find the complementarity between two techniques by utilising a
McNemar's test-like approach. The framework allows estimation of upper and
lower complementarity bounds for the VPR techniques to be combined, along with
an estimate of maximum VPR performance that may be achieved. Based on this
framework, results are presented for eight state-of-the-art VPR methods on ten
widely-used VPR datasets showing the potential of different combinations of
techniques for achieving better performance.

neuronal machinery can yield robust behaviour in a variety of environments
remains unclear. In the fly brain, motion-sensitive neurons indicate the
presence of nearby objects and directional cues are integrated within an area
known as the central complex. Such neuronal machinery, in contrast with the
traditional stream-based approach to signal processing, uses an event-based
approach, with events occurring when changes are sensed by the animal. Contrary
to von Neumann computing architectures, event-based neuromorphic hardware is
designed to process information in an asynchronous and distributed manner.
Inspired by the fly brain, we model, for the first time, a neuromorphic
closed-loop system mimicking essential behaviours observed in flying insects,
such as meandering in clutter and gap crossing, which are highly relevant for
autonomous vehicles. We implemented our system both in software and on
neuromorphic hardware. While moving through an environment, our agent perceives
changes in its surroundings and uses this information for collision avoidance.
The agent's manoeuvres result from a closed action-perception loop implementing
probabilistic decision-making processes. This loop-closure is thought to have
driven the development of neural circuitry in biological agents since the
Cambrian explosion. In the fundamental quest to understand neural computation
in artificial agents, we come closer to understanding and modelling biological
intelligence by closing the loop also in neuromorphic systems. As a closed-loop
system, our system deepens our understanding of processing in neural networks
and computations in biological and artificial systems. With these
investigations, we aim to set the foundations for neuromorphic intelligence in
the future, moving towards leveraging the full potential of neuromorphic

preserved by training the network at each scale with the high frequencies of

also shared across fusion layers within a network at a specific scale.

classification where multiple labels may be assigned to a given sample. In the
real world, it is more common to deal with noisy datasets than clean datasets,
given how modern datasets are labeled by a large group of annotators on
crowdsourcing platforms, but little attention has been given to evaluating
multi-label classifiers with noisy labels. Exploiting label correlations now
becomes a standard component of a multi-label classifier to achieve competitive
performance. However, this component makes the classifier more prone to poor
generalization - it overfits labels as well as label dependencies. We identify
three common real-world label noise scenarios and show how previous approaches
per-form poorly with noisy labels. To address this issue, we present a
Context-Based Multi-LabelClassifier (CbMLC) that effectively handles noisy
labels when learning label dependencies, without requiring additional

graph, that generalizes the notion of vertex coloring of a graph. Under a POC,
if $xy$ is an edge, then the larger weighted vertex receives a larger color; in
the case of equal weights of $x$ and $y$, their colors must be different. In
this paper, we shall initiate the study of this special coloring in graphs. For
a graph $G$, we introduce the function $f(G)$ which gives the maximum number of
colors required by a POC over all weightings of $G$. We show that
$f(G)=\ell(G)$, where $\ell(G)$ is the number of vertices of a longest path in
$G$.
  Another function we introduce is $\chi_{POC}(G;t)$ giving the minimum number
of colors required over all weightings of $G$ using $t$ distinct weights. We
show that the ratio of $\chi_{POC}(G;t)-1$ to $\chi(G)-1$ can be bounded by $t$
for any graph $G$; in fact, the result is shown by determining
$\chi_{POC}(G;t)$ when $G$ is a complete multipartite graph.
  We also determine the minimum number of colors to give a POC on a
vertex-weighted graph in terms of the number of vertices of a longest directed
path in an orientation of the underlying graph. This extends the so called
Gallai-Hasse-Roy-Vitaver theorem, a classical result concerning the
relationship between the chromatic number of a graph $G$ and the number of

COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In this chapter, we
summarize recent studies using large public Twitter data sets on these issues.
We have three primary objectives. First, we delineate epistemological and
practical considerations when combining the traditions of computational
research and social science research. A sensible balance should be struck when
the stakes are high between advancing social theory and concrete, timely
reporting of ongoing events. We additionally comment on the computational
challenges of gleaning insight from large amounts of social media data. Second,
we characterize the role of social bots in social media manipulation around the
discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Third,
we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts
still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from
state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion.
Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political
orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread
misinformation. We conclude that automation and social media manipulation pose
issues to a healthy and democratic discourse, precisely because they distort
representation of pluralism within the public sphere.

of our main results on the topic of Dark Energy. To begin with, we will report
our studies about nonlocal modifications of gravity involving the differential
operator $\Box^{-1}R$, with emphasis on a specific model and on the common
behavior shared by this and similar theories in the late stages of the
evolution of the Universe. Then we introduce a novel class of modified gravity
theories based on the anticurvature tensor $A^{\mu\nu}$ (the inverse of the
Ricci tensor), and assess their capability as source of Dark Energy. Finally,
we will discuss a type of drift effects which we predicted in the contest of
Strong Gravitational Lensing, which could be employed both to study the
effective equation of state of the Universe and to constrain violations of the

framework that would instrument existing sea ice buoys with strain gauges. This
measurement framework uses a Bayesian inference approach to infer ice loads
acting on the buoy from a set of strain gauge measurements. To test our
framework, strain measurements were collected from an experiment where a buoy
was frozen into ice that was subsequently compressed to simulate convergent sea
ice conditions. A linear elastic finite element model was used to describe the
response of the deformable buoy to mechanical loading, allowing us to link the
observed strain on the buoy interior to the applied load on the buoy exterior.

collections often contain tables created with a limited set of templates or
similar structures. It then selects a few representative table examples already
extracted with a pre-trained base deep learning model. Via an easy-to-use user
interface, users provide feedback to these selections without necessarily
having to identify every single error. TableLab then applies such feedback to
finetune the pre-trained model and returns the results of the finetuned model
back to the user. The user can choose to repeat this process iteratively until
obtaining a customized model with satisfactory performance.

can choose an input distribution based on the decisions of the algorithm and
the realizations of the inputs in the previous time steps.
  This paper presents a general technique for proving smoothed algorithmic
guarantees against adaptive adversaries, in effect reducing the setting of
adaptive adversaries to the simpler case of oblivious adversaries. We apply
this technique to prove strong smoothed guarantees for three problems:
  -Online learning: We consider the online prediction problem, where instances
are generated from an adaptive sequence of $\sigma$-smooth distributions and
the hypothesis class has VC dimension $d$. We bound the regret by
$\tilde{O}\big(\sqrt{T d\ln(1/\sigma)} + d\sqrt{\ln(T/\sigma)}\big)$. This
answers open questions of [RST11,Hag18].
  -Online discrepancy minimization: We consider the online Koml\'os problem,
where the input is generated from an adaptive sequence of $\sigma$-smooth and
isotropic distributions on the $\ell_2$ unit ball. We bound the $\ell_\infty$
norm of the discrepancy vector by $\tilde{O}\big(\ln^2\!\big(
\frac{nT}{\sigma}\big) \big)$.
  -Dispersion in online optimization: We consider online optimization of
piecewise Lipschitz functions where functions with $\ell$ discontinuities are
chosen by a smoothed adaptive adversary and show that the resulting sequence is
$\big( {\sigma}/{\sqrt{T\ell}}, \tilde O\big(\sqrt{T\ell}

its natural conclusion: lexicographic minimax fairness (or lexifairness for
short). Informally, given a collection of demographic groups of interest,
minimax fairness asks that the error of the group with the highest error be
minimized. Lexifairness goes further and asks that amongst all minimax fair
solutions, the error of the group with the second highest error should be
minimized, and amongst all of those solutions, the error of the group with the
third highest error should be minimized, and so on. Despite its naturalness,
correctly defining lexifairness is considerably more subtle than minimax
fairness, because of inherent sensitivity to approximation error. We give a
notion of approximate lexifairness that avoids this issue, and then derive
oracle-efficient algorithms for finding approximately lexifair solutions in a
very general setting. When the underlying empirical risk minimization problem
absent fairness constraints is convex (as it is, for example, with linear and
logistic regression), our algorithms are provably efficient even in the worst
case. Finally, we show generalization bounds -- approximate lexifairness on the
training sample implies approximate lexifairness on the true distribution with

an estimate of the NO content in the mesosphere, the regression coefficients

Marketing managers decide where to spend and how much to spend based on the
campaigns' performance. Apple's new privacy mechanisms have a profound impact
on how performance marketing is measured. Starting iOS 14.5, all apps must get
system permission for tracking explicitly via the new App Tracking Transparency
Framework, which shows the users a pop-up asking if they give the app
permission to track. If a user does not allow tracking, the required identifier
to deterministically find the online advertising campaign that brought the user
to install the app is not shared. Instead of relying on individual identifiers,
Apple proposed a new performance mechanism called conversion value, which is an
integer set by the apps for each user, and the developers can get the number of
installs per conversion value for each campaign. However, interpreting how
conversion values are used to measure the campaigns performance is not obvious
because it requires a method to translate the conversion values to revenue.
This paper investigates the task of attributing revenue to advertising
campaigns using the reported conversion values per campaign. Our contributions
are to formalize the problem, find the theoretically optimal revenue
attribution function for any conversion value schema, and show empirical
results on past data of a free-to-play mobile game using different conversion

Jurcak criterion, which states that umbra-penumbra boundaries in stable
sunspots are equally defined by a constant value of the vertical magnetic
field, Bver_crit, and by 0.5 continuum intensity of the quiet Sun, Iqs. Umbrae
with vertical magnetic fields stronger than Bver_crit are stable, whereas
umbrae with vertical magnetic fields weaker than Bver_crit are unstable and
prone to vanishing. Aims. To investigate the existence of a critical value of
the vertical magnetic field on a pore boundary and its role in the evolution of
the magnetic structure. Methods. We analysed SDO/HMI vector field maps
corrected for scattered light with a temporal cadence of 12 min during a
26.5-hour period. An intensity threshold (Ic = 0.55 Iqs) is used to define the
pore boundary and temporal evolutions of the magnetic properties are studied
there. Results. We observe stages in the pore evolution: (1)during an initial
formation phase, total magnetic field strength (B) and vertical magnetic field
(Bver) increase to their maximum values of ~1920 G and ~1730 G, respectively;
(2)then the pore reaches a stable phase; (3)in a second formation phase, the
pore undergoes a rapid growth in size, along with a decrease in B and Bver on
its boundary. In the newly formed area, Bver remains mostly below 1731 G and B
remains everywhere below 1921 G; (4)ultimately, pore decay starts. We find
overall that pore areas with Bver<1731 G, or equivalently B<1921 G,
disintegrate faster than regions that fulfil this criteria. Conclusions. The
most stable regions of the pore, similarly to the case of umbral boundaries,
are defined by a critical value of Bver that is comparable to that found in
stable sunspots. In addition, in this case study, the same pore areas can be
similarly well-defined by a critical value of the total magnetic field
strength.

multiple users utilize MRT and MRC, respectively, while a dedicated relay

operates in amplify-and-forward mode. For performance criterion, exact outage
probability (OP) expression is derived for Nakagami-m fading channels.
Furthermore, a tight lower bound and asymptotic expressions are also derived to
provide more insights into the obtained OP in terms of diversity order and

a performance trade-off between the MRT and MRC schemes is observed in the
presence of CEEs among users. Furthermore, it is shown that RHIs have a

smoothly and tightly integrates tensor factorization, outlier removal, and
temporal-pattern detection, which naturally reinforce each other. Moreover,
SOFIA integrates them in linear time, in an online manner, despite the presence
of missing entries. We experimentally show that SOFIA is (a) robust and

real vectors of any fixed dimension. The basic idea is to use vectors of
rational values (called rational vectors) to approximate vectors of real values
of the same dimension within $\epsilon$ range. For rational vectors of a fixed
dimension $m$, they can form a field that is an $m$th order extension
$\mathbf{Q}(\alpha)$ of the rational field $\mathbf{Q}$ where $\alpha$ has its
minimal polynomial of degree $m$ over $\mathbf{Q}$. Then, the arithmetics, such
as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, of real vectors can be
defined by using that of their approximated rational vectors within $\epsilon$
range. We also define complex conjugate of a real vector and then inner product
and convolutions of two real vectors and two real vector sequences (signals) of
finite length. With these newly defined concepts for real vectors, linear
processing, such as filtering, ARMA modeling, and least squares fitting, with
real vector-valued coefficients can be implemented to real vector-valued
signals, which will broaden the existing linear processing to scalar-valued
signals.

Neuroevolution is a term which describes these processes of automated

is computanalli expensive. Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution
states that the majority of evolutionary changes at molecular level are the

data stream model. The input to both problems are $m$ subsets of a universe of
size $n$ and a value $k\in [m]$. In Max-Cover, the problem is to find a
collection of at most $k$ sets such that the number of elements covered by at
least one set is maximized. In Max-Unique-Cover, the problem is to find a
collection of at most $k$ sets such that the number of elements covered by
exactly one set is maximized. Our goal is to design single-pass algorithms that
use space that is sublinear in the input size. Our main algorithmic results
are:
  If the sets have size at most $d$, there exist single-pass algorithms using
$\tilde{O}(d^{d+1} k^d)$ space that solve both problems exactly. This is
optimal up to polylogarithmic factors for constant $d$.
  If each element appears in at most $r$ sets, we present single pass
algorithms using $\tilde{O}(k^2 r/\epsilon^3)$ space that return a $1+\epsilon$
approximation in the case of Max-Cover. We also present a single-pass algorithm
using slightly more memory, i.e., $\tilde{O}(k^3 r/\epsilon^{4})$ space, that
$1+\epsilon$ approximates Max-Unique-Cover.
  In contrast to the above results, when $d$ and $r$ are arbitrary, any
constant pass $1+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for either problem requires
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}m)$ space but a single pass $O(\epsilon^{-2}mk)$ space
algorithm exists. In fact any constant-pass algorithm with an approximation
better than $e/(e-1)$ and $e^{1-1/k}$ for Max-Cover and Max-Unique-Cover
respectively requires $\Omega(m/k^2)$ space when $d$ and $r$ are unrestricted.
En route, we also obtain an algorithm for a parameterized version of the

techniques for lowering the computational overhead associated with the
underlying deep learning models. The first approach consists of leveraging a
specialized, lightweight model to directly answer the query. The second
approach focuses on filtering irrelevant frames using a lightweight model and
processing the filtered frames using a heavyweight model. These techniques
suffer from two limitations. With the first approach, the specialized model is
unable to provide accurate results for hard-to-detect events. With the second
approach, the system is unable to accelerate queries focusing on frequently
occurring events as the filter is unable to eliminate a significant fraction of
frames in the video.
  In this paper, we present THIA, a video analytics system for tackling these
limitations. The design of THIA is centered around three techniques. First,
instead of using a cascade of models, it uses a single object detection model
with multiple exit points for short-circuiting the inference. This early
inference technique allows it to support a range of throughput-accuracy
tradeoffs. Second, it adopts a fine-grained approach to planning and processes
different chunks of the video using different exit points to meet the user's
requirements. Lastly, it uses a lightweight technique for directly estimating
the exit point for a chunk to lower the optimization time. We empirically show
that these techniques enable THIA to outperform two state-of-the-art video
analytics systems by up to 6.5X, while providing accurate results even on
queries focusing on hard-to-detect events.

variance of the rounding errors (which is equal to $w^2/12$ where $w$ is the
size of the rounding window). Here the exact expressions for the sample
variance of the rounded variables are examined and it is also discussed when
the simple approximation $s^2=\sigma^2+w^2/12$ can be considered valid. In
particular, if the underlying distribution $f$ belongs to a family of symmetric
normalizable distributions such that $f(x)=\sigma^{-1}F(u)$ where
$u=(x-\mu)/\sigma$, and $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are the mean and variance of the

$s^2-(\sigma^2+w^2/12)\sim\sigma\Phi'(\sigma)$ as $\sigma\to\infty$ where
$\Phi(\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty{\rm d}u\,e^{iu\tau}F(u)$ is the

understanding the spectral energy distributions of M dwarfs over planetary
lifetimes. Surveys like MUSCLES, HAZMAT, and FUMES have collected
multiwavelength spectra across the spectral type's range of Teff and activity,
but the extreme ultraviolet flux (EUV, 100 to 912 Angstroms) of most of these
stars remains unobserved because of obscuration by the interstellar medium
compounded with limited detector sensitivity. While targets with observable EUV
flux exist, there is no currently operational facility observing between 150
and 912 Angstroms. Inferring the spectra of exoplanet hosts in this regime is
critical to studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres because the EUV
heats the top of the thermosphere and drives atmospheric escape. This paper
presents our implementation of the differential emission measure technique to
reconstruct the EUV spectra of cool dwarfs. We characterize our method's
accuracy and precision by applying it to the Sun and AU Mic. We then apply it
to three fainter M dwarfs: GJ 832, Barnard's Star, and TRAPPIST-1. We
demonstrate that with the strongest far ultraviolet (FUV, 912 to 1700
Angstroms) emission lines, observed with Hubble Space Telescope and/or Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, and a coarse X-ray spectrum from either
Chandra X-ray Observatory or XMM-Newton, we can reconstruct the Sun's EUV
spectrum to within a factor of 1.8, with our model's formal uncertainties
encompassing the data. We report the integrated EUV flux of our M dwarf sample
with uncertainties between a factor of 2 to 7 depending on available data
quality.

stellar objects (MYSOs) and Ultra-Compact HII regions (UCHII), where the former
are enshrouded in dense envelopes of dust and gas, which the latter have begun
dispersing. By selecting a complete sample of MYSOs and UCHII from the Red MSX
Source (RMS) survey data base, we combine Planck and IRAS data and build their
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). With these, we estimate the physical
properties (dust temperatures, mass, luminosity) of the sample. Because the RMS
database provides unique solar distances, it also allows investigating the
instantaneous Star Formation Efficiency (SFE) as a function of Galactocentric
radius. We find that the SFE increase between 2 and 4.5 kpc, where it reaches a
peak, likely in correspondence of the accumulation of molecular material at the
end of the Galactic bar. It then stays approximately constant up to 9 kpc,
after which it linearly declines, in agreement with predictions from
extragalactic studies. This behavior suggests the presence of a significant
amount of undetected molecular gas at R$_G$ $>$ 8 kpc. Finally we present
diagnostic colors that can be used to identify sites of massive star formation.

Thus, opinions of others often shape the developer's perception and decisions

conditioned upon what other developers think about the API. While many

conducted two surveys involving a total of 178 software developers. We analyzed
the data in two dimensions, each corresponding to specific needs related to API
reviews: (1) Needs for seeking API reviews, and (2) Needs for automated tool
support to assess the reviews. We observed that developers seek API reviews and
often have to summarize those for diverse development needs (e.g., API
suitability). Developers also make conscious efforts to judge the
trustworthiness of the provided opinions and believe that automated tool
support for API reviews analysis can assist in diverse development scenarios,
including, for example, saving time in API selection as well as making informed

interpretable models, but training these models is extremely computation
intensive. The asymptotic time complexity of subsequence-based algorithms
remains a higher-order polynomial, because these algorithms are based on
exhaustive search for highly discriminative subsequences. Pattern sampling has
been proposed as an effective alternative to mitigate the pattern explosion
phenomenon. Therefore, we employ pattern sampling to extract discriminative
features from discretized time series data. A weighted trie is created based on
the discretized time series data to sample highly discriminative patterns.
These sampled patterns are used to identify the shapelets which are used to
transform the time series classification problem into a feature-based
classification problem. Finally, a classification model can be trained using
any off-the-shelf algorithm. Creating a pattern sampler requires a small number
of patterns to be evaluated compared to an exhaustive search as employed by
previous approaches. Compared to previously proposed algorithms, our approach
requires considerably less computational and memory resources. Experiments

which diminishes with more evidence. While existing work focuses on using the
variance of the Bayesian posterior due to parameter uncertainty as a measure of
epistemic uncertainty, we argue that this does not capture the part of lack of
knowledge induced by model misspecification. We discuss how the excess risk,
which is the gap between the generalization error of a predictor and the Bayes
predictor, is a sound measure of epistemic uncertainty which captures the
effect of model misspecification. We thus propose a principled framework for
directly estimating the excess risk by learning a secondary predictor for the
generalization error and subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty,
i.e., intrinsic unpredictability. We discuss the merits of this novel measure
of epistemic uncertainty, and highlight how it differs from variance-based
measures of epistemic uncertainty and addresses its major pitfall. Our
framework, Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) is particularly
interesting in interactive learning environments, where the learner is allowed
to acquire novel examples in each round. Through a wide set of experiments, we
illustrate how existing methods in sequential model optimization can be
improved with epistemic uncertainty estimates from DEUP, and how DEUP can be
used to drive exploration in reinforcement learning. We also evaluate the
quality of uncertainty estimates from DEUP for probabilistic image
classification and predicting synergies of drug combinations.

both API code examples and reviews. In this paper, we present two novel
algorithms that can be used to automatically produce API documentation from SO

algorithm is called statistical documentation, which shows the distribution of
positivity and negativity around the code examples of an API using different
metrics (e.g., star ratings). The second algorithm is called concept-based
documentation, which clusters similar and conceptually relevant usage
scenarios. An API usage scenario contains a code example, a textual description

opinions with positive and negative sentiments) from other developers towards
the code example. We deployed the algorithms in Opiner, a web-based platform to

slowly decaying aftershock sequence (p=0.8) which included ~18,000 autodetected
events in 3.5 months. Double-difference, waveform-based relative relocation of
16,714 earthquakes reveals a complex network of faults, many of which cross the
inferred 35-km long east-northeast-striking, left-lateral mainshock rupture.
Seismicity aligns with left-lateral, right-lateral, and normal mechanism moment
tensors of 128 of the largest earthquakes. The mainshock occurred near the
middle of the aftershock zone at the intersection of two distinct zones of
seismicity. In the western section, numerous subparallel, shallow,
north-northeast-striking faults form a broad flower-structure-like fault mesh
that coalesces at depth into a near-vertical, left-lateral fault. We infer the
near-vertical fault to be a region of significant slip in the mainshock and an
eastward extension of the left-lateral Candelaria fault. Near the mainshock
hypocenter, seismicity occurs on a northeast-striking, west-dipping structure
which extends north from the Eastern Columbus Salt Marsh normal fault.
Together, these two intersecting structures bound the Columbus Salt Marsh
tectonic basin. East of this intersection and the mainshock hypocenter,
seismicity occurs in a narrow, near-vertical, east-northeast-striking fault
zone through to its eastern terminus. At the eastern end, the aftershock zone
broadens and extends northwest towards the southern extension of the
northwest-striking, right-lateral Petrified Springs fault system. The eastern

of nonlinear partial differential equations that arises in models that have
relevance to steady isochoric flows of colloidal suspensions. The symmetric
velocity gradient is assumed to be a monotone nonlinear function of the
deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor. We prove the existence of a unique
weak solution to the problem, and under the additional assumption that the
nonlinearity involved in the constitutive relation is Lipschitz continuous we
also prove uniqueness of the weak solution. We then construct mixed finite
element approximations of the system using both conforming and nonconforming
finite element spaces. For both of these we prove the convergence of the method
to the unique weak solution of the problem, and in the case of the conforming
method we provide a bound on the error between the analytical solution and its
finite element approximation in terms of the best approximation error from the
finite element spaces. We propose first a Lions-Mercier type iterative method

state-of-the-art de-identification systems, are based on bidirectional long
short-term memory (biLSTM) units augmented by a conditional random field (CRF)
sequence optimizer. These systems process the input sentence by sentence. This
approach prevents the systems from capturing dependencies over sentence
boundaries and makes accurate sentence boundary detection a prerequisite. Since
sentence boundary detection can be problematic especially in clinical reports,
where dependencies and co-references across sentence boundaries are abundant,
these systems have clear limitations. In this study, we built a new system on
the framework of one of the current state-of-the-art de-identification systems,
NeuroNER, to overcome these limitations. This new system incorporates context
embeddings through forward and backward n-grams without using sentence
boundaries. Our context-enhanced de-identification (CEDI) system captures
dependencies over sentence boundaries and bypasses the sentence boundary
detection problem altogether. We enhanced this system with deep affix features
and an attention mechanism to capture the pertinent parts of the input. The
CEDI system outperforms NeuroNER on the 2006 i2b2 de-identification challenge

can produce a fast evaluation scheme by analyzing the algebro-geometric

individual datasets. These studies assume the availability of a sufficient
amount of human-annotated data to train models that can generalize to

have limited or no in-house training data. Existing systems and external data
can help jump-start de-identification on in-house data; however, the most
efficient way of utilizing existing systems and external data is unclear. This
article investigates the transferability of a state-of-the-art neural clinical
de-identification system, NeuroNER, across a variety of datasets, when it is
modified architecturally for domain generalization and when it is trained
strategically for domain transfer. Methods and Materials: We conducted a
comparative study of the transferability of NeuroNER using four clinical note
corpora with multiple note types from two institutions. We modified NeuroNER
architecturally to integrate two types of domain generalization approaches. We
evaluated each architecture using three training strategies. We measured:
transferability from external sources; transferability across note types; the
contribution of external source data when in-domain training data are
available; and transferability across institutions. Results and Conclusions:
Transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent results. Using
additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of approximately
80%. Fine-tuning emerged as a dominant transfer strategy, with or without
domain generalization. We also found that external sources were useful even in
cases where in-domain training data were available. Transferability across
institutions differed by note type and annotation label but resulted in
improved performance.

object oriented and traditional verification techniques determine how higher
resolution soil moisture initial conditions influences the prediction of the
location and timing of convective initiation (CI) within a convective
permitting, operational NWP model over South Africa. Two, to study the modelled
CI-soil moisture relationship during real afternoon thunderstorm events. The
study reports the results from 66 Unified Model simulations (at 4.4km grid
resolution) for nine summer afternoon CI events during synoptically benign
conditions over South Africa. The higher resolution soil moisture conditions
reduce centroid distance between observed and forecast storms on average by 7km
(9 percent improvement), with the most decrease in centroid distance occurring
at the shortest lead times, by 12km. Most improvement in location error occurs
in the zonal directional. However, little to no difference is found in the
timing of CI, most likely attributable to the dominant effect of model grid
size on CI timing, overshadowing the influence from soil moisture anomalies.
Probability of CI is highest over dry and moderate soils and areas along
distinct soil moisture gradients. The conclusion is that modelled CI over South
Africa preferentially occurs on the periphery of wet soil moisture patches,
where there is increased surface convergence of wind and higher sensible heat
flux.

the cortical areas of an atlas-based segmentation of the human cerebral cortex,
and the inter-node coupling strengths are derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging
data of the connectome of the human brain. Nodes are coupled using an additive
scheme without delays and are driven by background inputs with fixed mean and
additive Gaussian noise. Optimal control inputs to nodes are determined by
minimizing a cost functional that penalizes the deviations from a desired
network dynamic, the control energy, and spatially non-sparse control inputs.
Using the strength of the background input and the overall coupling strength as
order parameters, the network's state-space decomposes into regions of low and
high activity fixed points separated by a high amplitude limit cycle all of
which qualitatively correspond to the states of an isolated network node. Along
the borders, however, additional limit cycles, asynchronous states and
multistability can be observed. Optimal control is applied to several
state-switching and network synchronization tasks, and the results are compared
to controllability measures from linear control theory for the same connectome.
We find that intuitions from the latter about the roles of nodes in steering
the network dynamics, which are solely based on connectome features, do not
generally carry over to nonlinear systems, as had been previously implied.
Instead, the role of nodes under optimal nonlinear control critically depends
on the specified task and the system's location in state space. Our results
shed new light on the controllability of brain network states and may serve as
an inspiration for the design of new paradigms for non-invasive brain
stimulation.

shown to move along the surface of a Poincar\'{e} cone. The radial motion shows
a rich structure where the existence of various bound, plunging, or escaping
trajectories depend on the constants of motion. Curves of energy and angular
momentum corresponding to spherical orbits show a swallow-tail structure highly

compact direction is varied, the is a critical point beyond which the
swallow-tail kink disappears and becomes a smooth curve.

However, little work studies exactly what information is encoded by popular
embedding methods, and how this information correlates with performance in
downstream machine learning tasks. We tackle this question by studying whether
embeddings can be inverted to (approximately) recover the graph used to
generate them. Focusing on a variant of the popular DeepWalk method (Perozzi et
al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2018), we present algorithms for accurate embedding
inversion - i.e., from the low-dimensional embedding of a graph G, we can find
a graph H with a very similar embedding. We perform numerous experiments on
real-world networks, observing that significant information about G, such as
specific edges and bulk properties like triangle density, is often lost in H.
However, community structure is often preserved or even enhanced. Our findings
are a step towards a more rigorous understanding of exactly what information
embeddings encode about the input graph, and why this information is useful for
learning tasks.

We consider two scenarios where causal effects are estimable. First, we discuss
interventions on a part of the treatment called functional interventions and a
sufficient condition for effect estimation of these interventions called
functional positivity. Second, we develop conditions for nonparametric effect
estimation based on the gradient fields of the functional confounder and the
true outcome function. To estimate effects under these conditions, we develop
Level-set Orthogonal Descent Estimation (LODE). Further, we prove error bounds
on LODE's effect estimates, evaluate our methods on simulated and real data,

statistical ecology: species distribution modeling (SDM). In SDM, the
occurrence pattern of a species on a landscape is predicted by environmental
features based on observations at a set of locations. At first, SDM may appear
to be a binary classification problem, and one might be inclined to employ
classic tools (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, neural
networks) to tackle it. However, wildlife surveys introduce structured noise
(especially under-counting) in the species observations. If unaccounted for,
these observation errors systematically bias SDMs. To address the unique
challenges of SDM, this paper proposes a framework called StatEcoNet.
Specifically, this work employs a graphical generative model in statistical
ecology to serve as the skeleton of the proposed computational framework and
carefully integrates neural networks under the framework. The advantages of
StatEcoNet over related approaches are demonstrated on simulated datasets as
well as bird species data. Since SDMs are critical tools for ecological science
and natural resource management, StatEcoNet may offer boosted computational and
analytical powers to a wide range of applications that have significant social
impacts, e.g., the study and conservation of threatened species.

is proposed to tackle the issue of translating communication speech into
human-readable text in air traffic control (ATC) systems. In the proposed
framework, we focus on integrating the multilingual automatic speech
recognition (ASR) into one model, in which an end-to-end paradigm is developed
to convert speech waveform into text directly, without any feature engineering
or lexicon. In order to make up for the deficiency of the handcrafted feature
engineering caused by ATC challenges, a speech representation learning (SRL)
network is proposed to capture robust and discriminative speech representations
from the raw wave. The self-supervised training strategy is adopted to optimize
the SRL network from unlabeled data, and further to predict the speech
features, i.e., wave-to-feature. An end-to-end architecture is improved to
complete the ASR task, in which a grapheme-based modeling unit is applied to
address the multilingual ASR issue. Facing the problem of small transcribed
samples in the ATC domain, an unsupervised approach with mask prediction is
applied to pre-train the backbone network of the ASR model on unlabeled data by
a feature-to-feature process. Finally, by integrating the SRL with ASR, an
end-to-end multilingual ASR framework is formulated in a supervised manner,
which is able to translate the raw wave into text in one model, i.e.,
wave-to-text. Experimental results on the ATCSpeech corpus demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high performance with a very small labeled corpus
and less resource consumption, only 4.20% label error rate on the 58-hour
transcribed corpus. Compared to the baseline model, the proposed approach
obtains over 100% relative performance improvement which can be further
enhanced with the increasing of the size of the transcribed samples.

polarization of news shared in online communities have become ever more
relevant concerns with real world harms across our society. Studying online
news sharing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which
is shared by millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore,
existing research has largely focused on specific communities or specific
interventions, such as bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread
of misinformation and polarization more broadly, across thousands of online
communities, is critical for the development of governance strategies,
interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct the largest study of news
sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning 4
years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check to
annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness. We
find that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have
105% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links
to relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit users'
voting and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely
biased and low factual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30% fewer
exposures from crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This
suggests that reddit is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We
show that extremely biased and low factual content is very concentrated, with
99% of such content being shared in only 0.5% of communities, giving credence
to the recent strategy of community-wide bans and quarantines.

tasks like autonomous driving. Chance constraints which guarantee the
satisfaction of state constraints at a high probability are suitable to
represent the requirements in real-world environment with uncertainty. Existing
chance constrained RL methods like the penalty method and the Lagrangian method
either exhibit periodic oscillations or cannot satisfy the constraints. In this
paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated
proportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. Taking a control
perspective, we first interpret the penalty method and the Lagrangian method as
proportional feedback and integral feedback control, respectively. Then, a
proportional-integral Lagrangian method is proposed to steady learning process
while improving safety. To prevent integral overshooting and reduce
conservatism, we introduce the integral separation technique inspired by PID
control. Finally, an analytical gradient of the chance constraint is utilized
for model-based policy optimization. The effectiveness of SPIL is demonstrated
by a narrow car-following task. Experiments indicate that compared with
previous methods, SPIL improves the performance while guaranteeing safety, with
a steady learning process.

Approximation at the floating point unit (FPU) allows saving energy by simply
reducing the number of computed floating point bits in return for accuracy
loss. Although, finding the most energy efficient approximation for various
applications with minimal effort is the main challenge. To address this issue,
we propose NEAT: a pin tool that helps users automatically explore the
accuracy-energy tradeoff space induced by various floating point
implementations. NEAT helps programmers explore the effects of simultaneously
using multiple floating point implementations to achieve the lowest energy
consumption for an accuracy constraint or vice versa. NEAT accepts one or more
user-defined floating point implementations and programmable placement rules
for where/when to apply them. NEAT then automatically replaces floating point
operations with different implementations based on the user-specified rules
during the runtime and explores the resulting tradeoff space to find the best
use of approximate floating point implementations for the precision tuning
throughout the program. We evaluate NEAT by enforcing combinations of 24/53
different floating point implementations with three sets of placement rules on
a wide range of benchmarks. We find that heuristic precision tuning at the
function level provides up to 22% and 48% energy savings at 1% and 10% accuracy
loss comparing to applying a single implementation for the whole application.
Also, NEAT is applicable to neural networks where it finds the optimal
precision level for each layer considering an accuracy target for the model.

prograde g modes is known to be useful to measure rotation rates in the g-mode
cavity of rapidly rotating $\gamma$ Dor and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars. In
a rapidly rotating star, an inertial mode in the convective core can resonantly
couple with g modes propagative in the surrounding radiative region. The
resonant coupling causes a dip in the $P$-$\Delta P$ relation, distinct from
the modulations due to the chemical composition gradient. Such a resonance dip
in $\Delta P$ of prograde dipole g modes appears around a frequency
corresponding to a spin parameter $2f_{\rm rot}{\rm(cc)}/\nu_{\rm co-rot} \sim
8-11$ with $f_{\rm rot}$(cc) being the rotation frequency of the convective
core and $\nu_{\rm co-rot}$ the pulsation frequency in the co-rotating frame.
The spin parameter at the resonance depends somewhat on the extent of core
overshooting, central hydrogen abundance, and other stellar parameters. We can
fit the period at the observed dip with the prediction from prograde dipole g
modes of a main-sequence model, allowing the convective core to rotate
differentially from the surrounding g-mode cavity. We have performed such
fittings for 16 selected $\gamma$ Dor stars having well defined dips, and found
that the majority of $\gamma$ Dor stars we studied rotate nearly uniformly,
while convective cores tend to rotate slightly faster than the g-mode cavity in
less evolved stars.

challenge, and in recent years, the complexity of training data and models has
shown explosive growth, so the training method is gradually transformed into
distributed training. Classical synchronization strategy can guarantee accuracy
but frequent communication can lead to a slow training speed, although
asynchronous strategy training speed but can not guarantee the accuracy, and in
the face of the training of the heterogeneous cluster, the above work is not
efficient to work, on the one hand, can cause serious waste of resources, on
the other hand, frequent communication also made slow training speed, so this
paper proposes a semi-synchronous training strategy based on local-SDG,

key idea of our approach called cross modality educed distillation (CMEDL) is
to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide a CBCT segmentation network
training to extract more informative features during training. We accomplish
this by training an end-to-end network comprised of unpaired domain adaptation
(UDA) and cross-domain segmentation distillation networks (SDN) using unpaired

extract CBCT features that match the statistical distribution of MRI features
extracted by the teacher network and obtain better differentiation of tumor
from background.} We also compared against an alternative framework that used
UDA with MR segmentation network, whereby segmentation was done on the
synthesized pseudo MRI representation. All networks were trained with 216

direct-to-consumer settings. To promote discovery, collected genomic data is
often de-identified and shared, either in public repositories, such as OpenSNP,
or with researchers through access-controlled repositories. However, recent
studies have suggested that genomic data can be effectively matched to
high-resolution three-dimensional face images, which raises a concern that the
increasingly ubiquitous public face images can be linked to shared genomic
data, thereby re-identifying individuals in the genomic data. While these
investigations illustrate the possibility of such an attack, they assume that
those performing the linkage have access to extremely well-curated data. Given
that this is unlikely to be the case in practice, it calls into question the
pragmatic nature of the attack. As such, we systematically study this
re-identification risk from two perspectives: first, we investigate how
successful such linkage attacks can be when real face images are used, and
second, we consider how we can empower individuals to have better control over
the associated re-identification risk. We observe that the true risk of
re-identification is likely substantially smaller for most individuals than
prior literature suggests. In addition, we demonstrate that the addition of a
small amount of carefully crafted noise to images can enable a controlled
trade-off between re-identification success and the quality of shared images,
with risk typically significantly lowered even with noise that is imperceptible
to humans.

method of summing photon counts in a time gate loses all the timing information
crudely. We find that changing the gate width can only optimize the contrast or
the state variance, not both. In comparison, machine learning adaptively learns
from time-resolved fluorescence data, and offers the optimal data processing
model that elaborately weights each time bin to maximize the extracted
information. It is shown that our method can repair the processing result from
imperfect data, reducing 7% in spin readout error while optimizing the

copies of the unit interval $[0, 1]$. We explore which tangles guarantee
envy-free allocations of connected shares for n agents, meaning that such
allocations exist no matter which monotonic and continuous functions represent
agents' valuations. Each single tangle $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds in a natural
way to an infinite topological class $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{T})$ of multigraphs,
many of which are graphs. This correspondence links EF fair division of tangles
to EFk$_{outer}$ fair division of graphs. We know from Bil\`o et al that all
Hamiltonian graphs guarantee EF1$_{outer}$ allocations when the number of
agents is 2, 3, 4 and guarantee EF2$_{outer}$ allocations for arbitrarily many
agents. We show that exactly six tangles are stringable; these guarantee EF
connected allocations for any number of agents, and their associated
topological classes contain only Hamiltonian graphs. Any non-stringable tangle
has a finite upper bound r on the number of agents for which EF allocations of
connected shares are guaranteed. Most graphs in the associated non-stringable
topological class are not Hamiltonian, and a negative transfer theorem shows
that for each $k \geq 1$ most of these graphs fail to guarantee EFk$_{outer}$
allocations of vertices for r + 1 or more agents. This answers a question posed
in Bil\`o et al, and explains why a focus on Hamiltonian graphs was necessary.
With bounds on the number of agents, however, we obtain positive results for
some non-stringable classes. An elaboration of Stromquist's moving knife
procedure shows that the non-stringable lips tangle guarantees envy-free
allocations of connected shares for three agents. We then modify the discrete

test three turbulence-based IMF models (by Padoan & Nordlund 2002, Hennebelle &
Chabrier 2008, and Hopkins 2012), which predict the relation between the
high-mass slope ($\Gamma$) of the IMF, $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d} \log M \propto
M^{\Gamma}$ and the exponent n of the velocity power spectrum of turbulence,
$E_v(k)\propto k^{-n} $, where $n\approx 2$ corresponds to typical ISM
turbulence. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we drive turbulence with an unusual
index of $n\approx 1$, measure $\Gamma$, and compare the results with $n\approx
2$. We find that reducing $n$ from 2 to 1 primarily changes the high-mass
region of the IMF (beyond the median mass), where we measure high-mass slopes
within the 95 per cent confidence interval of $-1.5<\Gamma<-1$ for $n \approx
1$ and $-3.7<\Gamma<-2.4$ for $n\approx 2$, respectively. Thus, we find that
$n=1$ results in a significantly flatter high-mass slope of the IMF, with more
massive stars formed than for $n \approx 2$. We compare these simulations with
the predictions of the three IMF theories. We find that while the Padoan &
Nordlund theory matches our simulations with fair accuracy, the other theories
either fail to reproduce the main qualitative outcome of the simulations or
require some modifications. We conclude that turbulence plays a key role in
shaping the IMF, with a shallower turbulence power spectrum producing a
shallower high-mass IMF, and hence more massive stars.

we introduce the notion of functional pattern, which encodes the pairwise

allows to concurrently assign multiple desired functional patterns. Further, we
derive algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions to guarantee the feasibility

interpretable mapping between the structural constraints and their functional
implications in oscillator networks. As a proof of concept, we apply the

Given a
directed graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and edge weights in $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$,
we want to build a data structure such that given any source vertex $u$, any
target vertex $v$, and any failure $f$ (which is either a vertex or an edge),
it outputs the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ not going through
$f$. Our main result is a DSO with preprocessing time $O(n^{2.5794}M)$ and
constant query time. Previously, the best preprocessing time of DSOs for
directed graphs is $O(n^{2.7233}M)$, and even in the easier case of undirected
graphs, the best preprocessing time is $O(n^{2.6865}M)$ [Ren, ESA 2020]. One
drawback of our DSOs, though, is that it only supports distance queries but not
path queries.
  Our main technical ingredient is an algorithm that computes the inverse of a
degree-$d$ polynomial matrix (i.e. a matrix whose entries are degree-$d$
univariate polynomials) modulo $x^r$. The algorithm is adapted from [Zhou,
Labahn, and Storjohann, Journal of Complexity, 2015], and we replace some of
its intermediate steps with faster rectangular matrix multiplication
algorithms.
  We also show how to compute unique shortest paths in a directed graph with
edge weights in $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$, in $O(n^{2.5286}M)$ time. This algorithm
is crucial in the preprocessing algorithm of our DSO. Our solution improves the
$O(n^{2.6865}M)$ time bound in [Ren, ESA 2020], and matches the current best
time bound for computing all-pairs shortest paths.

pre-specified update penalty into the traditional MDP cost criteria to reduce
the use of communication resources. Under this criteria, a novel dynamic

is formulated as the minimization of the $\ell_0$-`norm' of an \emph{outlier
indicator vector}, under a second moment constraint on the datapoints. The
$\ell_0$-`norm' is then relaxed to the $\ell_p$-norm ($0<p\leq 1$) in the

$\ell_p$-minimization and hard thresholding algorithm is proposed that outputs
an order-optimal robust estimate of the population mean. The proposed algorithm
(with breakdown point $\approx 0.3$) does not require prior knowledge of the

does so, the cortex thickness is thinnest at the crest (gyri) and thickest at
the trough (sulci) of the folds. This observation cannot be simply explained by
elastic theories of buckling. A recent minimal model explained this phenomenon
by modeling the developing cortex as a growing fluid under the constraints of
radially spanning elastic fibers, a plia membrane and a nongrowing sub-cortex
(Engstrom, et. al., PRX 2019). In this minimal buckling without bending
morphogenesis (BWBM) model, the elastic fibers were assumed to act linearly
with strain. Here, we explore how nonlinear elasticity influences shape
development within BWBM. The nonlinear elasticity generates a quadratic
nonlinearity in the differential equation governing the system's shape and
leads to sharper troughs and wider crests, which is an identifying
characteristic of cerebellar folds at later stages in development. As
developing organs are typically not in isolation, we also explore the effects
of steric confinement, and observe flattening of the crests. Finally, as a
paradigmatic example, we propose a hierarchical version of BWBM from which a
novel mechanism of branching morphogenesis naturally emerges to qualitatively
predict later stages of the morphology of the developing cerebellum.

For scalability of the framework where multiple generators and discriminator
best responses are stored in the memory, we propose two solutions: 1) pruning
the weakly-dominated players' strategies to keep the oracles from becoming
intractable; 2) applying continual learning to retain the previous knowledge of
the networks. We apply our framework to established GAN architectures such as

$\gamma\,(>0)$ the (constant)\,density gradient characterizing the stably
stratified ambient, with $\rho_0$ being the fluid density taken to be a
constant within the Boussinesq framework. A reciprocal theorem formulation
identifies three contributions to the torque: (1) an $O(Re)$ inertial
contribution that already exists in a homogeneous ambient, and orients the
spheroid broadside-on; (2) an $O(Ri_v)$ hydrostatic contribution due to the
ambient linear stratification that also orients the spheroid broadside-on; and
(3) a hydrodynamic contribution arising from the perturbation of the ambient
stratification by the spheroid whose nature depends on $Pe$; $Pe = UL/D$ being
the Peclet number with $D$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For $Pe
\gg 1$, the hydrodynamic contribution is $O(Ri_v^{\frac{2}{3}}$) in the Stokes
stratification regime characterized by $Re \ll Ri_v^{\frac{1}{3}}$, and orients
the spheroid edgewise regardless of $\kappa$. The differing orientation
dependencies of the inertial and large-$Pe$ hydrodynamic stratification torques
imply that the broadside-on and edgewise settling regimes are separated by two
distinct $\kappa$-dependent critical curves in the

agent is forgetful of the prior due to the non-stationary nature of RL. These
observations suggest two extreme schedules of distillation: (i) over the entire

distillation method to inject the consistency prior at any time (even after
RL), and a simple yet efficient framework to automatically schedule the
distillation. Specifically, the proposed framework first focuses on mastering
train environments regardless of generalization by adaptively deciding which
{\it or no} augmentation to be used for the training. After this, we add the
distillation to extract the remaining benefits for generalization from all the

demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, in particular, that

unobservable directions. Traditional causal estimators, however, usually gain
spurious information on the unobservable directions, leading to over-confident
covariance inconsistent with actual estimator errors. The consistency problem
of fixed-lag smoothers (FLSs) has only been attacked by the first estimate
Jacobian (FEJ) technique because of the complexity to analyze their
observability property. But the FEJ has several drawbacks hampering its wide
adoption. To ensure the consistency of a FLS, this paper introduces the right
invariant error formulation into the FLS framework. To our knowledge, we are
the first to analyze the observability of a FLS with the right invariant error.
Our main contributions are twofold. As the first novelty, to bypass the
complexity of analysis with the classic observability matrix, we show that
observability analysis of FLSs can be done equivalently on the linearized
system. Second, we prove that the inconsistency issue in the traditional FLS
can be elegantly solved by the right invariant error formulation without
artificially correcting Jacobians. By applying the proposed FLS to the
monocular visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem,
we confirm that the method consistently estimates covariance similarly to a
batch smoother in simulation and that our method achieved comparable accuracy
as traditional FLSs on real data.

hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and
16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex

multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data
regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not
only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary
nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using
arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer
counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on
natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and

magnitude among themselves and with simulations. We aim to assess the validity
of an existing upper limit of solar convective flow amplitudes at a depth of
0.96 solar radii obtained using time-distance helioseismology and several
simplifying assumptions. We generated synthetic observations for convective
flow fields from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation (MURaM) using travel-time
sensitivity functions and a noise model. We compared the estimates of the flow
with the actual values. For the scales of interest ($\ell<100$), we find that
the current procedure for obtaining an upper limit gives the correct order of
magnitude of the flow for the given flow fields. We also show that this
estimate is not an upper limit in a strict sense because it underestimates the
flow amplitude at the largest scales by a factor of about two because the scale
dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio has to be taken into account. After
correcting for this and after taking the dependence of the measurements on
direction in Fourier space into account, we show that the obtained estimate is
indeed an upper limit. We conclude that time-distance helioseismology is able
to correctly estimate the order of magnitude (or an upper limit) of solar
convective flows in the deeper interior when the vertical correlation function
of the different flow components is known and the scale dependence of the
signal-to-noise ratio is taken into account. We suggest that future work should
include information from different target depths to better separate the effect
of near-surface flows from those at greater depths. The measurements are
sensitive to all three flow directions, which should be taken into account.

methods. Unfortunately, simply solving ERM on a complex, non-convex loss

minima. In this paper, we theoretically show that finding flat minima results
in a smaller domain generalization gap. We also propose a simple yet effective
method, named Stochastic Weight Averaging Densely (SWAD), to find flat minima.
SWAD finds flatter minima and suffers less from overfitting than does the
vanilla SWA by a dense and overfit-aware stochastic weight sampling strategy.
SWAD shows state-of-the-art performances on five DG benchmarks, namely PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, with consistent and large
margins of +1.6% averagely on out-of-domain accuracy. We also compare SWAD with
conventional generalization methods, such as data augmentation and consistency
regularization methods, to verify that the remarkable performance improvements
are originated from by seeking flat minima, not from better in-domain
generalizability. Last but not least, SWAD is readily adaptable to existing DG
methods without modification; the combination of SWAD and an existing DG method
further improves DG performances. Source code is available at

  Gradient Method",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Policy gradient (PG) gives rise to a rich class of reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. Recently, there has been an emerging trend to accelerate the
existing PG methods such as REINFORCE by the \emph{variance reduction}
techniques. However, all existing variance-reduced PG methods heavily rely on
an uncheckable importance weight assumption made for every single iteration of
the algorithms. In this paper, a simple gradient truncation mechanism is
proposed to address this issue. Moreover, we design a Truncated Stochastic
Incremental Variance-Reduced Policy Gradient (TSIVR-PG) method, which is able
to maximize not only a cumulative sum of rewards but also a general utility
function over a policy's long-term visiting distribution. We show an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity for TSIVR-PG to find an
$\epsilon$-stationary policy. By assuming the overparameterizaiton of policy
and exploiting the hidden convexity of the problem, we further show that
TSIVR-PG converges to global $\epsilon$-optimal policy with
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.

The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of
super-Earth sized planets close to their host stars in compact systems. When an
inward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these
planets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of
the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This
topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical
simulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a
resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We
performed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded
in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two
different ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner
boundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density
profile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional
outer planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a
chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final
configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB
counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical
expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show
that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in
thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable
librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems.
We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number
of planets in the disc inner cavity.

embedded/homogenized in-silico approach for modeling perfusion through solid
tumors. The rationale behind this novel idea is that only the larger blood
vessels have to be explicitly resolved while the smaller scales of the
vasculature are homogenized. As opposed to typical discrete or fully-resolved
1D-3D models, the required data can be obtained with in-vivo imaging techniques
since the morphology of the smaller vessels is not necessary. By contrast, the
larger vessels, whose topology and structure is attainable non-invasively, are
resolved and embedded as one-dimensional inclusions into the three-dimensional
tissue domain which is modeled as a porous medium. A sound mortar-type
formulation is employed to couple the two representations of the vasculature.
We validate the hybrid model and optimize its parameters by comparing its
results to a corresponding fully-resolved model based on several well-defined
metrics. These tests are performed on a complex data set of three different
tumor types with heterogeneous vascular architectures. The correspondence of
the hybrid model in terms of mean representative elementary volume blood and
interstitial fluid pressures is excellent with relative errors of less than 4%.
Larger, but less important and explicable errors are present in terms of blood
flow in the smaller, homogenized vessels. We finally discuss and demonstrate
how the hybrid model can be further improved to apply it for studies on tumor
perfusion and the efficacy of drug delivery.

initial orbit phase and the source localization in the sky. We use the the
minimal matching factor respect to the inclination angle, the initial orbit
phase and the source localization to quantify the performance of the higher

the minimal matching factor among the 24 tested elliptical BBHs increases from
90\% to 98\%. Following our previous $\texttt{SEOBNRE}$ waveform model, we call
our new waveform model $\texttt{SEOBNREHM}$. Our $\texttt{SEOBNREHM}$ waveform

place at even lower fields and $C_\mathrm{B}$ decreases continuously with

grant-free random access has emerged as a promising mechanism for massive
access, its potential has not been fully unleashed. Particularly, the two key
tasks in massive access systems, namely, user activity detection and data
detection, were handled separately in most existing studies, which ignored the
common sparsity pattern in the received pilot and data signal. Moreover, error
detection and correction in the payload data provide additional mechanisms for
performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a data-assisted activity
detection framework, which aims at supporting more active users by reducing the
activity detection error, consisting of false alarm and missed detection
errors. Specifically, after an initial activity detection step based on the
pilot symbols, the false alarm users are filtered by applying energy detection
for the data symbols; once data symbols of some active users have been
successfully decoded, their effect in activity detection will be resolved via
successive pilot interference cancellation, which reduces the missed detection
error. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively

observed in Mn-Ga ordered alloys is an attractive property for thermoelectric
applications exploiting the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE); however, its origin
has not been clarified. In this study, to gain insight into the negative
$S_\text{ANE}$, we prepared epitaxial thin films of Mn$_{x}$Ga$_{100-x}$ with
$x$ ranging from 56.2 to 71.7, and systematically investigated the structural,
magnetic, and transport properties including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
and the ANE. The measured $S_\text{ANE}$ is negative for all samples and shows
close to one order of magnitude difference among different compositions.
Together with the measured transport properties, we were able to separate the
two different contributions of the ANE, i.e., one originating from the
transverse thermoelectric coefficient ($\alpha_{xy}$), and the other one
originating from the AHE acting on the longitudinal carrier flow induced by the
Seebeck effect. Both contributions are found to be negative for all samples,
while the experimentally obtained negative $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a monotonic
increase towards zero with increasing $x$, which is consistent with the
tendency indicated by first-principles calculations. Our results show that the
large difference in the negative $S_\text{ANE}$ is mostly attributed to
$\alpha_{xy}$, and thus shed light on further enhancement of the ANE in
Mn-based ordered alloys.

proposed to derive the closed-loop expanded system. The approach explicitly
accounts for the closed-loop dynamics and preserves the $\mathcal{L}_2$-induced

polynomial chaos transformations. The effect of using finite-degree polynomial
chaos expansions is first captured by a norm-bounded linear differential
inclusion, and then addressed by formulating a robust polynomial chaos based
control synthesis problem. This proposed approach avoids the use of high-degree
polynomial chaos expansions to alleviate the destabilizing effect of truncation
errors, which significantly reduces computational complexity. In addition, some
analysis is given for the condition under which the robustly stabilized
expanded system implies the robust stability of the original system. A
numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

that this unique measure is in fact equivalent to the $p$-Lebesgue measure and
that the corresponding dynamical system is ergodic and has entropy
$\frac{1}{p}\log(\beta_{p-1}\cdots \beta_0)$. We then express the density of

$L_\boldsymbol{\beta}$ by showing that the lazy dynamical system is isomorphic
to the greedy one. We also provide an isomorphism with a suitable extension of

paradigm have shown a great modeling capability for recurrent systems without
the computing overheads required for other approaches. Among them, different
flavors of echo state networks have attracted many stares through time, mainly
due to the simplicity and computational efficiency of their learning algorithm.
However, these advantages do not compensate for the fact that echo state
networks remain as black-box models whose decisions cannot be easily explained
to the general audience. This work addresses this issue by conducting an
explainability study of Echo State Networks when applied to learning tasks with
time series, image and video data. Specifically, the study proposes three
different techniques capable of eliciting understandable information about the
knowledge grasped by these recurrent models, namely, potential memory, temporal
patterns and pixel absence effect. Potential memory addresses questions related
to the effect of the reservoir size in the capability of the model to store
temporal information, whereas temporal patterns unveils the recurrent
relationships captured by the model over time. Finally, pixel absence effect
attempts at evaluating the effect of the absence of a given pixel when the echo
state network model is used for image and video classification. We showcase the
benefits of our proposed suite of techniques over three different domains of
applicability: time series modeling, image and, for the first time in the
related literature, video classification. Our results reveal that the proposed
techniques not only allow for a informed understanding of the way these models
work, but also serve as diagnostic tools capable of detecting issues inherited
from data (e.g. presence of hidden bias).

relations over the video sequence based on the self-attention mechanism without
exhaustive optical flow prediction. Specially, we construct a memory using
several past frames to store the temporal information of the current frame. We
then propose a temporal memory attention module to capture the relation between
the current frame and the memory to enhance the representation of the current
frame. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performances on two challenging
video semantic segmentation datasets, particularly 80.3% mIoU on Cityscapes and
76.5% mIoU on CamVid with ResNet-50.

distributions, and as such have grown popular for machine learning
applications. However, these maps are generally defined on empirical
observations and cannot be generalized to new samples while preserving
asymptotic properties. We extend a novel method to learn a consistent estimator
of a continuous optimal transport map from two empirical distributions. The
consequences of this work are two-fold: first, it enables to extend the
transport plan to new observations without computing again the discrete optimal

applications of optimal transport. We illustrate the strength of this approach
by deriving a consistent framework for transport-based counterfactual

Furthermore, we discuss the combined model scenario including both the doublet

long-standing muon (g-2) anomaly which is an additional advantage. We
demonstrate that the allowed region for anomalous muon (g-2) explanation, which
has been updated very recently at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, can
also be probed at the future colliders which will thus be a simultaneous

superconducting droplets and strong coupling is due to the topological Dirac

transition temperature Tc. Localized electron pairing around effective
monopoles promotes, upon cooling, the formation of superconducting droplets
connected by Josephson links. Global superconductivity arises when strongly
coupled granules form an infinite cluster, and global superconducting phase
coherence sets in. The resulting Tc is estimated to fall in the range from

cuticles and utilise this understanding to create a novel mathematical model.
We model water sorption in astomatous isolated cuticles, utilising three
separate pathways of cellulose, aqueous pores and lipophilic. The results of
the model compare well to data both over time and increasing humidity. The
sensitivity analysis shows that the grouping of parameters influencing plant
species variations has the largest effect on sorption, the parameters

  Offloading","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.04854",,,,"cs.GT cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Coded distributed computing (CDC) has emerged as a promising approach because
it enables computation tasks to be carried out in a distributed manner while
mitigating straggler effects, which often account for the long overall
completion times. Specifically, by using polynomial codes, computed results
from only a subset of edge servers can be used to reconstruct the final result.
However, incentive issues have not been studied systematically for the edge
servers to complete the CDC tasks. In this paper, we propose a tractable
two-level game-theoretic approach to incentivize the edge servers to complete
the CDC tasks. Specifically, in the lower level, a hedonic coalition formation
game is formulated where the edge servers share their resources within their
coalitions. By forming coalitions, the edge servers have more Central
Processing Unit (CPU) power to complete the computation tasks. In the upper
level, given the CPU power of the coalitions of edge servers, an all-pay
auction is designed to incentivize the edge servers to participate in the CDC
tasks. In the all-pay auction, the bids of the edge servers are represented by
the allocation of their CPU power to the CDC tasks. The all-pay auction is
designed to maximize the utility of the cloud server by determining the
allocation of rewards to the winners. Simulation results show that the edge
servers are incentivized to allocate more CPU power when multiple rewards are
offered, i.e., there are multiple winners, instead of rewarding only the edge
server with the largest CPU power allocation. Besides, the utility of the cloud
server is maximized when it offers multiple homogeneous rewards, instead of
heterogeneous rewards.

strongly modified the physical and chemical nature of silicate crusts and
mantles. This alteration came in the form of melting through impacts, as well
as the belated addition of volatiles and the highly siderophile elements
(HSEs). Current debate centres on whether the lunar HSE record is
representative of its whole late accretion history or alternatively that these
were only retained in the mantle and crust after a particular time, and if so,
when. Here we employ improved Monte Carlo impact simulations of late accretion
onto the Moon and Mars and present an updated chronology based on new dynamical
simulations of leftover planetesimals and the E-belt. We take into account the
inefficient retention of colliding material. We compute the crater and basin
densities on the Moon and Mars, the largest objects to strike these planets and
the amount of material they accreted. Outputs are used to infer the mass in
leftover planetesimals at a particular time period, which is then compared to
the lunar HSE abundance. From this estimate we calculate a preferred lunar HSE
retention age of ca. 4450 Ma which means that the modelled lunar mantle HSE
abundances trace almost all of lunar late accretion. Based on our results, the
surface ages of the lunar highlands are at least 4370 Ma. We find that the mass
of leftover planetesimals with diameters Di<300 km at 4500 Ma that best fits
the crater chronology is approximately 2x10^{-3} Earth mass (ME) while the mass
of the E-belt was fixed at 4.5x10^{-4} ME. We also find that a leftover
planetesimal mass in excess of 0.01 ME results in a lunar HSE retention age
younger than major episodes of lunar differentiation and crust formation, which
in turn violates geochemical constraints for the timing and intensity of late
accretion to the Earth (Mojzsis et al., 2019).

limited information about the exact task duration at scheduling time, and (ii)
an opportunity to reschedule the remaining tasks each time a task processing is

the existing literature on robust scheduling does not explicitly consider the
second characteristic - the possibility to adjust decisions as more information

paper, we develop a scheduling approach that takes into account, at the
beginning of the planning horizon, the possibility that scheduling decisions

the first mixed integer linear programming model for adjustable robust

adjustable scheduling leads to solutions with better and more stable makespan

weak-plage regions were observed in the Mg II k and h lines with the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The deposited acoustic-energy flux was
derived from Doppler velocities observed at two different geometrical heights
corresponding to the middle and upper chromosphere. A set of scaled nonlocal
thermodynamic equilibrium 1D hydrostatic semi-empirical models (obtained by
fitting synthetic to observed line profiles) was applied to compute the
radiative losses. The characteristics of observed waves were studied by means
of a wavelet analysis. Results: Observed waves propagate upward at supersonic
speed. In the quiet chromosphere, the deposited acoustic flux is sufficient to
balance the radiative losses and maintain the semi-empirical temperatures in
the layers under study. In the active-region chromosphere, the comparison shows
that the contribution of acoustic-energy flux to the radiative losses is only
10 - 30 %. Conclusions: Acoustic and magnetoacoustic waves play an important
role in the chromospheric heating, depositing a main part of their energy in
the chromosphere. Acoustic waves compensate for a substantial fraction of the
chromospheric radiative losses in quiet regions. In active regions, their
contribution is too small to balance the radiative losses and the chromosphere
has to be heated by other mechanisms.

and density distribution of young stars; we show that this adds useful
constraints on the stars' distances, and hence luminosities. With these
distances we map the spatial distribution of a more stringently selected
sub-sample across the Galactic disc, and find it to be highly structured, with
distinct over- and under-densities. The most evident over-densities can be
associated with the presumed spiral arms of the Milky Way, in particular the
Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms. Yet, the spatial picture of the
Milky Way's young disc structure emerging in this study is complex, and
suggests that most young stars in our Galaxy ($t_{age}<t_{dyn}$) are not neatly
organised into distinct spiral arms. The combination of the comprehensive
spectroscopy to come from SDSS-V (yielding velocities, ages, etc..) with future
Gaia data releases will be crucial to reveal the dynamical nature of the spiral
arm themselves.

  In this thesis, the process conditions of the epitaxial graphene growth
through a socalled polymer-assisted sublimation growth method are minutely
investigated. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to show that the previously
neglected flow-rate of the argon process gas has a significant influence on the
morphology of the SiC substrate and atop carbon layers. The results can be well
explained using a simple model for the thermodynamic conditions at the layer
adjacent to the surface. The resulting control option of step-bunching on the
sub-nanometer scales is used to produce the ultra-flat, monolayer graphene
layers without the bilayer inclusions that exhibit the vanishing of the
resistance anisotropy. The comparison of four-point and scanning tunneling
potentiometry measurements shows that the remaining small anisotropy represents
the ultimate limit, which is given solely by the remaining resistances at the
SiC terrace steps. ... The precise control of step-bunching using the Ar flow
also enables the preparation of periodic non-identical SiC surfaces under the
graphene layer. Based on the work function measurements by Kelvin-Probe force
microscopy and X-ray photoemission electron microscopy, it is shown for the
first time that there is a doping variation in graphene, induced by a proximity
effect of the different near-surface SiC stacks. The comparison of the AFM and
low-energy electron microscopy measurements have enabled the exact assignment
of the SiC stacks, and the examinations have led to an improved understanding
of the surface restructuring in the framework of a step-flow mode. ...

selected option to achieve this goal. This contribution is implemented by the
XGIS Imaging System, based on that technique. The XGIS Imaging System has the
heritage of previous payload developments: LEGRI/Minisat-01, INTEGRAL,
UFFO/Lomonosov and ASIM/ISS. In particular the XGIS Imaging System is an
upgrade of the ASIM system in operation since 2018 on the International Space

while ASIM focuses on Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes, THESEUS aims for the GRBs.
For each of the two XGIS Cameras, the coded mask is located at 630 mm from the
detector layer. The coding pattern is implemented in a Tungsten plate (1 mm
thickness) providing a good multiplexing capability up to 150 keV. In that way
both XGIS detector layers (based on Si and CsI detectors) have imaging
capabilities at the medium - hard X-ray domain. This is an improvement achieved

designed to carry on-board two wide and deep sky monitoring instruments for
X/gamma-ray transients detection: a wide-field soft X-ray monitor with imaging
capability (Soft X-ray Imager, SXI, 0.3 - 5 keV), a hard X-ray,
partially-imaging spectroscopic instrument (X and Gamma Imaging Spectrometer,
XGIS, 2 keV - 10 MeV), and an optical/near-IR telescope with both imaging and
spectroscopic capability (InfraRed Telescope, IRT, 0.7 - 1.8 $\mu$m). The
spacecraft will be capable of performing fast repointing of the IRT to the
error region provided by the monitors, thus allowing it to detect and localize
the transient sources down to a few arcsec accuracy, for immediate
identification and redshift determination. The prime goal of the XGIS will be
to detect transient sources, with monitoring timescales down to milliseconds,
both independently of, or following, up SXI detections, and identify the
sources performing localisation at < 15 arcmin and characterize them over a
broad energy band, thus providing also unique clues to their emission physics.

arranged to cover 2 steradians . The XGIS will exploit an innovative technology

high-redshift GRBs for cosmology (pop-III stars, cosmic re-ionization, SFR and
metallicity evolution up to the ""cosmic dawn""), THESEUS will allow the
identification and study of the electromagnetic counterparts to sources of
gravitational waves which will be routinely detected in the late '20s / early
'30s by next generation facilities like aLIGO/aVirgo, LISA, KAGRA, and Einstein

thus providing an ideal synergy with the large e.m. facilities of the near

scientific objectives will be achieved by an unprecedented combination of
X/gamma-ray monitors, providing the capabilities of detecting and accurately
localize and kind of GRBs and may classes of transient in an energy band as
large as 0.1 keV - 10 MeV, with an on-board NIR telescope providing detection,

locally checkable graph problem we can define its mending radius, which
captures the idea of how far one needs to modify a partial solution in order to
""patch a hole.""
  We explore how mendability is connected to the existence of efficient
algorithms, especially in distributed, parallel, and fault-tolerant settings.
It is easy to see that $O(1)$-mendable problems are also solvable in $O(\log^*
n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model of distributed computing. One of the surprises is
that in paths and cycles, a converse also holds in the following sense: if a
problem $\Pi$ can be solved in $O(\log^* n)$, there is always a restriction
$\Pi' \subseteq \Pi$ that is still efficiently solvable but that is also
$O(1)$-mendable.
  We also explore the structure of the landscape of mendability. For example,
we show that in trees, the mending radius of any locally checkable problem is
$O(1)$, $\Theta(\log n)$, or $\Theta(n)$, while in general graphs the structure
is much more diverse.

many advantages for use in high data rate optical wireless communications. In
particular, the low cost and high-bandwidth properties of laser sources such as
vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) make them attractive for
future indoor optical wireless communications. In order to be integrated into
future indoor networks, such lasers should conform to eye safety regulations
determined by the international electrotechnical commission (IEC) standards for
laser safety. In this paper, we provide a detailed study of beam propagation to
evaluate the received power of various laser sources, based on which as well as
the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) defined by the IEC 60825-1:2014
standard, we establish a comprehensive framework for eye safety analyses. This
framework allows us to calculate the maximum allowable transmit power, which is
crucial in the design of a reliable and safe laser-based wireless communication
system. Initially, we consider a single-mode Gaussian beam and calculate the
maximum permissible transmit power. Subsequently, we generalize this approach
for higher-mode beams. It is shown that the M-squared-based approach for
analysis of multimode lasers ensures the IEC eye safety limits, however, in
some scenarios, it can be too conservative compared to the precise beam
decomposition method. Laser safety analyses with consideration of optical
elements such as lens and diffuser, as well as for VCSEL array have been also
presented. Skin safety, as another significant factor of laser safety, has also
been investigated in this paper. We have studied the impacts of various
parameters such as wavelength, exposure duration and the divergence angle of
laser sources on the safety analysis by presenting insightful results.

parasite Plasmodium, is considered to be a gold-standard for detecting
life-threatening disease malaria. Detecting the plasmodium parasite requires a
skilled examiner and may take up to 10 to 15 minutes to completely go through
the whole slide. Due to a lack of skilled medical professionals in the
underdeveloped or resource deficient regions, many cases go misdiagnosed;
resulting in unavoidable complications and/or undue medication. We propose to
complement the medical professionals by creating a deep learning-based method
to automatically detect (localize) the plasmodium parasites in the photograph
of stained film. To handle the unbalanced nature of the dataset, we adopt a
two-stage approach. Where the first stage is trained to detect blood cells and
classify them into just healthy or infected. The second stage is trained to
classify each detected cell further into the life-cycle stage. To facilitate
the research in machine learning-based malaria microscopy, we introduce a new
large scale microscopic image malaria dataset. Thirty-eight thousand cells are
tagged from the 345 microscopic images of different Giemsa-stained slides of
blood samples. Extensive experimentation is performed using different CNN
backbones including VGG, DenseNet, and ResNet on this dataset. Our experiments
and analysis reveal that the two-stage approach works better than the one-stage
approach for malaria detection. To ensure the usability of our approach, we
have also developed a mobile app that will be used by local hospitals for
investigation and educational purposes. The dataset, its annotations, and
implementation codes will be released upon publication of the paper.

multiple cloud platforms. The ability to dynamically grow and shrink the number
of nodes has paved the way for customised elastic computing both for High
Performance Computing and High Throughput Computing workloads. However,
elasticity is typically restricted to a single cloud site, thus hindering the
ability to provision computational resources from multiple geographically
distributed cloud sites. To this aim, this paper introduces an architecture of
open-source components that coherently deploy a virtual elastic cluster across
multiple cloud sites to perform large-scale computing. These hybrid virtual
elastic clusters are automatically deployed and configured using an
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach on a distributed hybrid testbed that
spans different organizations, including on-premises and public clouds,
supporting automated tunneling of communications across the cluster nodes with
advanced VPN topologies. The results indicate that cluster-based computing of
embarrassingly parallel jobs can benefit from hybrid virtual clusters that
aggregate computing resources from multiple cloud back-ends and bring them
together into a dedicated, albeit virtual network.

results allow us to unravel the vibrational decoherence pathways in combination
with $ab$ $initio$ calculations including vibronic coupling. We observe
field-induced spectral changes near 63 and 370 cm$^{-1}$ that are modeled in
terms of $f$-manifold crystal field excitations activated by odd-symmetry
vibrations. The overall extent of vibronic coupling in this system is limited
by a transparency window in the phonon density of states that acts to keep the
intramolecular vibrations and $M_J$ levels apart. These findings advance the
understanding of vibronic coupling in molecular magnets, place significant
constraints on the pattern of crystal field levels in these systems, and
provide a strategy for designing molecular spin qubits with improved coherence

by Marangoni flows that are driven by evaporative depletion of the volatile

operator $H = - \Delta +V(\textbf{x})$ with $V(\textbf{x})$ being in a large
class of periodic potentials. Specifically, we give very general conditions on
the potentials which ensure the existence of 3-fold Weyl points on the

which possess Dirac points where two adjacent band surfaces touch each other
conically, the 3-fold Weyl points are conically intersection points of two

As a consequence, new techniques combining more symmetries are used to justify
the existence of such conical points under the conditions proposed. This paper
provides comprehensive proof of such 3-fold Weyl points. In particular, the
role of each symmetry endowed to the potential is carefully analyzed. Our proof
extends the analysis on the conical spectral points to a higher dimension and
higher multiplicities. We also provide some numerical simulations on typical

traffic state time-series from the M25 motorway in London. We use it to train
models that predict the probability distribution of incident durations,
utilising both time-invariant and time-varying features of the data. The latter
allow predictions to be updated as an incident progresses, and more information
becomes available. For dynamic predictions, time-series features are fed into
the Match-Net algorithm, a temporal convolutional hitting-time network,
recently developed for dynamical survival analysis in clinical applications.
The predictions are benchmarked against static regression models for survival
analysis and against an established dynamic technique known as landmarking and
found to perform favourably by several standard comparison measures. To provide
interpretability, we utilise the concept of Shapley values from the domain of
interpretable artificial intelligence to rank the features most relevant to the
model predictions at different time horizons. For example, the time of day is
always a significantly influential time-invariant feature, whereas the
time-series features strongly influence predictions at 5 and 60-minute

magnetic metamaterials not conforming to the conventional framework of

with temperature, discrete steps are possible, resulting in a binary transition
in the interactions of the elements. The transition is enabled by nucleation
and annihilation of vortex cores, shifting topological charges between the

viewed as shifting their spin dimensionality, from 2 (XY-like) to 0, (vortices)
at the transition. The results provide insight into how dynamics at different

years. At the core of the technique, the depth of a target is measured by
constructing a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and
detected photon arrivals. A major data processing bottleneck arises on the
device when either the number of photons per pixel is large or the resolution
of the time stamp is fine, as both the space requirement and the complexity of
the image reconstruction algorithms scale with these parameters. We solve this
limiting bottleneck of existing lidar techniques by sampling the characteristic
function of the time of flight (ToF) model to build a compressive statistic, a
so-called sketch of the time delay distribution, which is sufficient to infer
the spatial distance and intensity of the object. The size of the sketch scales
with the degrees of freedom of the ToF model (number of objects) and not,
fundamentally, with the number of photons or the time stamp resolution.
Moreover, the sketch is highly amenable for on-chip online processing. We show
theoretically that the loss of information for compression is controlled and
the mean squared error of the inference quickly converges towards the optimal
Cram\'er-Rao bound (i.e. no loss of information) for modest sketch sizes. The
proposed compressed single-photon lidar framework is tested and evaluated on
real life datasets of complex scenes where it is shown that a compression rate
of up-to 150 is achievable in practice without sacrificing the overall
resolution of the reconstructed image.

it is actually beneficial. To answer this question, we consider an IRS-assisted

are closely related to the pump-induced modification of the metal's dielectric
functions, which are qualitatively visualized by transfer matrix and
two-temperature models. The ultrafast temporal evolution of nonlinear
absorption clearly demonstrated enhanced optical nonlinearity, disentangled by
the electron-electron and electron-phonon dynamic interactions at picosecond
time scales. A phenomenological pulse propagation model is employed that
incorporates the experimentally obtained nonlinear absorption coefficients and
different nonlinear effects exhibited by the system. Nonlinearity plays a
crucial role in controlling the ultrafast pulse propagation and could open a
new window for many nonlinear device applications. The findings of these new
optical materials could possibly pave the way for promising applications in
ultrafast photonics.

typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the
cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its
visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the
sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these
models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their
source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the
knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that
supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The
auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective
concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector
representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,
KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according
to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN
on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet
dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from
Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a
knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in
all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better
performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to
multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic
forgetting.

combination of both the valley and spin degrees of freedom can lead to a new
kind of topological transport phenomenon, dubbed quantum spin valley Hall
effect (QSVH), which can further expand the number of topologically protected
edge channels and would be useful for information multiplexing. However, it is
challenging to realize QSVH in most known material platforms, due to the
requirement of breaking both the (pseudo-)fermionic time-reversal (T) and
parity symmetries (P) individually, but leaving the combined symmetry S=TP
intact. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible platform to realize QSVH
for light, based on coupled ring resonators mediated by optical Kerr
nonlinearity. Thanks to the inherent flexibility of cross-mode modulation
(XMM), the coupling between the probe light can be engineered in a controllable
way such that spin-dependent staggered sublattice potential emerges in the
effective Hamiltonian. With delicate yet experimentally feasible pump
conditions, we show the existence of spin valley Hall induced topological edge
states. We further demonstrate that both degrees of freedom, i.e., spin and
valley, can be manipulated simultaneously in a reconfigurable manner to realize
spin-valley photonics, doubling the degrees of freedom for enhancing the
information capacity in optical communication systems.

of a single red blood cell (RBC) subjected to an external mechanical load. We
carry out a detailed comparison between the {\it loading} (L) dynamics,
following the imposition of the mechanical load on the RBC at rest, and the
{\it relaxation} (R) dynamics, allowing the RBC to relax to its original shape
after the sudden arrest of the mechanical load. Such a comparison is carried
out by analyzing the characteristic times of the two corresponding dynamics,
i.e., $t_L$ and $t_R$. When the intensity of the mechanical load is small
enough, the two kinds of dynamics are {\it symmetrical} ($t_L \approx t_R$) and
independent of the typology of mechanical load (intrinsic dynamics); otherwise,
in marked contrast, an {\it asymmetry} is found, wherein the loading dynamics
is typically faster than the relaxation one. This asymmetry manifests itself
with non-universal characteristics, e.g., dependency on the applied load and/or
on the viscoelastic properties of the RBC membrane. To deepen such a
non-universal behaviour, we consider the viscosity of the erythrocyte membrane
as a variable parameter and focus on three different typologies of mechanical
load (mechanical stretching, shear flow, elongational flow): this allows to
clarify how non-universality builds up in terms of the deformation and
rotational contributions induced by the mechanical load on the membrane.
Finally, we also investigate the effect of the elastic shear modulus on the
characteristic times $t_L$ and $t_R$. Our results provide crucial and
quantitative information on the unsteady dynamics of RBC and its membrane

control confounds in a matched quasi-experimental design: we identify focal

eating with a fixed partner regularly, and we match focal users into comparison
pairs such that paired users are nearly identical with respect to covariates
measured before acquiring the partner, where the two focal users' new eating
partners diverge in the healthiness of their respective food choice. A
difference-in-differences analysis of the paired data yields clear evidence of
social influence: focal users acquiring a healthy-eating partner change their
habits significantly more toward healthy foods than focal users acquiring an
unhealthy-eating partner. We further identify foods whose purchase frequency is

Beyond the main results, the work demonstrates the utility of passively sensed

Indeed most
prediction methods require careful calibration of hyperparameters usually
carried out on a hold-out \textit{validation} dataset to achieve
generalization. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach to
achieve generalization without any data splitting, which is based on a new risk
measure which directly quantifies a model's tendency to overfit. To fully
understand the intuition and advantages of this new approach, we illustrate it
in the simple linear regression model ($Y=X\beta+\xi$) where we develop a new
criterion. We highlight how this criterion is a good proxy for the true
generalization risk. Next, we derive different procedures which tackle several
structures simultaneously (correlation, sparsity,...). Noticeably, these
procedures \textbf{concomitantly} train the model and calibrate the
hyperparameters. In addition, these procedures can be implemented via classical
gradient descent methods when the criterion is differentiable w.r.t. the
hyperparameters. Our numerical experiments reveal that our procedures are
computationally feasible and compare favorably to the popular approach (Ridge,
LASSO and Elastic-Net combined with grid-search cross-validation) in term of
generalization. They also outperform the baseline on two additional tasks:
estimation and support recovery of $\beta$. Moreover, our procedures do not
require any expertise for the calibration of the initial parameters which
remain the same for all the datasets we experimented on.

  Programming (ICLP 2021), 15 pages",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.PL math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Probabilistic logic programming is a major part of statistical relational
artificial intelligence, where approaches from logic and probability are
brought together to reason about and learn from relational domains in a setting
of uncertainty. However, the behaviour of statistical relational
representations across variable domain sizes is complex, and scaling inference
and learning to large domains remains a significant challenge. In recent years,
connections have emerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and
learning from sampled subpopulations. The asymptotic behaviour of statistical
relational representations has come under scrutiny, and projectivity was
investigated as the strongest form of domain-size dependence, in which query
marginals are completely independent of the domain size.
  In this contribution we show that every probabilistic logic program under the
distribution semantics is asymptotically equivalent to an acyclic probabilistic
logic program consisting only of determinate clauses over probabilistic facts.
We conclude that every probabilistic logic program inducing a projective family
of distributions is in fact everywhere equivalent to a program from this
fragment, and we investigate the consequences for the projective families of
distributions expressible by probabilistic logic programs.
  To facilitate the application of classical results from finite model theory,
we introduce the abstract distribution semantics, defined as an arbitrary
logical theory over probabilistic facts. This bridges the gap to the
distribution semantics underlying probabilistic logic programming. In this
representation, determinate logic programs correspond to quantifier-free
theories, making asymptotic quantifier elimination results available for the
setting of probabilistic logic programming.

detection systems. Most of these rely on software that users download into

environment measurements taken by the mobile phone or reports these
measurements to a server on the Internet, which then analyzes the aggregated
measurements collected from many mobile phones. These systems suffer from two
main drawbacks. First, they require modification to the mobile phones in the
form of software and an active decision to participate from users. This
severely limits the number of obtained measurements. Second, they do not make
use of the information the mobile network has regarding network topology and
configuration. This results in less reliable predictions than could be made. We
present a network-based system for detecting false base stations that operate
on any 3GPP radio access technology, without requiring modifications to mobile
phones, and that allows taking full advantage of network topology and
configuration information available to an operator. The analysis is performed
by the mobile network based on measurement reports delivered by mobile phones
as part of normal operations to maintain the wireless link. We implemented and
validated the system in a lab experiment and a real operator trial. Our

observations suggest that SU Aur is undergoing late infall of material, which
can explain the observed disk structures. SU Aur is the clearest observational
example of this mechanism at work and demonstrates that late accretion events
can still occur in the class II phase, thereby significantly affecting the
evolution of circumstellar disks. Constraining the frequency of such events

full gap feature with energy gap values close to 4.6 meV. This type of spectrum
shows a clean and uniform full gap in space, which indicates the absence of gap
nodes in this superconductor. Quasiparticle interference patterns have also
been measured, which show no scattering patterns between the hole and tiny
electron pockets, but rather an intra-band scattering pattern is observed
possibly due to the hole-like $\alpha$ pocket. The Fermi energy of this band is
only about $24\pm6$ meV as derived from the energy dispersion result.
Meanwhile, impurity induced bound-state peaks can be observed at about $\pm2.2$
meV on some spectra, and the peak value seems to be independent to magnetic
field. On the second type of surface which is rarely obtained, the fully gapped
feature can still be observed on the tunneling spectra, although multiple gaps

properties of compact stars that develop hypernuclear cores with and without an
admixture of $\Delta$-resonances. We work within the covariant density
functional theory with the parameters adjusted to $K$-atomic and kaon-nucleon
scattering data in the kaonic sector. The density-dependent parameters in the
hyperonic sector are adjusted to the data on $\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-$ hypernuclei
data. The $\Delta$-resonance couplings are tuned to the data obtained from
their scattering off nuclei and heavy-ion collision experiments. We find that
(anti)kaon condensate leads to a softening of the equation of state and lower
maximum masses of compact stars than in the absence of the condensate. Both the
$K^-$ and $\bar K^0$-condensations occur through a second-order phase
transition, which implies no mixed-phase formation. For large values of
(anti)kaon and $\Delta$-resonance potentials in symmetric nuclear matter, we
observe that condensation leads to an extinction of $ \Xi^{-,0}$ hyperons. We
also investigate the influence of inclusion of additional hidden-strangeness
$\sigma^{*}$ meson in the functional and find that it leads to a substantial
softening of the equation of state and delay in the onset of (anti)kaons.

machine learning models is one of the final steps of many research projects.
Many of these methods are trained on privacy-sensitive data and there are
several different approaches like $\epsilon$-differential privacy, federated
machine learning and methods based on cryptographic approaches if the datasets
cannot be shared or evaluated jointly at one place. In this setting, it can
also be a problem to compute the global performance measure like an AUC, since
the labels might also contain privacy-sensitive information. There have been
approaches based on $\epsilon$-differential privacy to deal with this problem,
but to the best of our knowledge, no exact privacy preserving solution has been
introduced. In this paper, we propose an MPC-based framework, called \fw{},
with private merging of sorted lists and novel methods for comparing two
secret-shared values, selecting between two secret-shared values, converting
the modulus, and performing division to compute the exact AUC as one could
obtain on the pooled original test samples. With \fw{} computation of the exact
area under precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristic curve
is even possible when ties between prediction confidence values exist. To show
the applicability of \fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict
acute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via
experiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute
exactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving
manner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain.
Our solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of
the servers performing the secure computation.

Collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations. In addition to the simulation, an analytical
energy balance model fed with the simulation data is applied to analyze the
findings further. This work focuses on investigating the ion dynamics in a
plasma with two ion species and a gas mixture as background. By varying the gas
composition and driving voltage of the single-frequency discharge, fundamental
mechanics of the discharge, such as the evolution of the plasma density and the
energy dispersion, are discussed. Thereby, close attention is paid to these
measures' influence on the ion energy distribution functions at the electrode

xenon allows for shifting the distribution function for one ion species from
collisionless to collision dominated. The mixing ratio serves as a control
parameter for the ion flux and the impingement energy of ions at the surfaces.

theory toward better handling many-electron problem. This work mainly focuses
on approximate functionals in HCKS, seeking to gain more insights into
functional development from the comparison between Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT and HCKS.
Unlike KS-DFT, HCKS can handle different correlation effects by resorting to a
set of auxiliary orbitals with dynamically varying fractional occupations.
These orbitals of hierarchical correlation (HCOs) thus contain distinct
electronic information for better considering the exchange-correlation effect
in HCKS. The test on the triplet-singlet gaps shows that HCKS has much better
performance as compared to KS-DFT in use of the same functionals, and the
systematic errors of semi-local functionals can be effectively reduced by
including appropriate amount of the HCO-dependent Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange.
In contrast, KS-DFT shows large systematic errors, which are hardly reduced by
the functionals tested in this work. Therefore, HCKS creates new channels to
address to the strong correlation issue, and further development of functionals
that depend on HCOs and their occupations is necessary for the treatment of
strongly correlated systems.

regionalized) variables due to spatial correlation; and trends caused by
geophysical processes lead to covariate shifts between the domain where the

the use of classical learning methodologies that rely on random samples of the

assessing widely-used methods for estimating generalization error of learning

action in biological agents, in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on
Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior
beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which
constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative
approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small)
probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can
be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We
illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior)
constraints on the generative model, allowing e.g., for a trade-off between
robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Secondly, we
interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework.
Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the
context of ActInf, but also provides a general purpose approach that can
account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint
message updates can then be readily combined with other pre-derived message
update rules, without the need for custom derivations. The proposed
chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for
workable models in general, and can be used to complement message-passing
formulations on generative neural models.

results by means of showing that a randomly chosen object has the desired

tool is the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (the LLL for short), which was introduced by
Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'{a}sz in the mid-1970s. Here we develop a version of the LLL
that can be used to prove the existence of continuous colorings. We then give
several applications in Borel and topological dynamics.
  * Seward and Tucker-Drob showed that every free Borel action $\Gamma
\curvearrowright X$ of a countable group $\Gamma$ admits an equivariant Borel
map $\pi \colon X \to Y$ to a free subshift $Y \subset 2^\Gamma$. We give a new
simple proof of this result.
  * We show that for a countable group $\Gamma$, $\mathrm{Free}(2^\Gamma)$ is
weakly contained, in the sense of Elek, in every free continuous action of
$\Gamma$ on a zero-dimensional Polish space. This fact is analogous to the
theorem of Ab\'{e}rt and Weiss for probability measure-preserving actions and
has a number of consequences in continuous combinatorics. In particular, we
deduce that a coloring problem admits a continuous solution on
$\mathrm{Free}(2^\Gamma)$ if and only if it can be solved on finite subgraphs
of the Cayley graph of $\Gamma$ by an efficient deterministic distributed
algorithm (this fact was also proved independently and using different methods

decision, which means that the amount of information that has been gathered

human performances during navigation through a maze on the computer screen

a collection of $n$ indistinguishable, resource-limited nodes collectively
solve tasks via pairwise interactions. In each interaction, two randomly chosen
neighbors first read each other's states, and then update their local states. A
rich line of research has established tight upper and lower bounds on the
complexity of fundamental tasks, such as majority and leader election, in this

solved fast, i.e., in $n \operatorname{polylog} n$ pairwise interactions, with
high probability, using at most $\operatorname{polylog} n$ states per node.
  In this work, we consider the more general setting where $G$ is an arbitrary
graph, and present a technique for simulating protocols designed for
fully-connected networks in any connected regular graph. Our main result is a
simulation that is efficient on many interesting graph families: roughly, the
simulation overhead is polylogarithmic in the number of nodes, and quadratic in
the conductance of the graph. As a sample application, we show that, in any
regular graph with conductance $\phi$, both leader election and exact majority
can be solved in $\phi^{-2} \cdot n \operatorname{polylog} n$ pairwise
interactions, with high probability, using at most $\phi^{-2} \cdot

space-efficient population protocols for leader election and exact majority on
graphs with good expansion properties. We believe our results will prove
generally useful, as they allow efficient technology transfer between the
well-mixed (clique) case, and the under-explored spatial setting.

foundations. By predicative and constructive, we respectively mean that we do
not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms or excluded middle. Our
work complements existing work on predicative mathematics by exploring what
cannot be done predicatively in univalent foundations. Our first main result is
that nontrivial (directed or bounded) complete posets are necessarily large.
That is, if such a nontrivial poset is small, then weak propositional resizing
holds. It is possible to derive full propositional resizing if we strengthen
nontriviality to positivity. The distinction between nontriviality and
positivity is analogous to the distinction between nonemptiness and
inhabitedness. We prove our results for a general class of posets, which
includes directed complete posets, bounded complete posets and sup-lattices,
using a technical notion of a $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete poset. We also
show that nontrivial locally small $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete posets
necessarily lack decidable equality. Specifically, we derive weak excluded
middle from assuming a nontrivial locally small $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete
poset with decidable equality. Moreover, if we assume positivity instead of
nontriviality, then we can derive full excluded middle. Secondly, we show that
each of Zorn's lemma, Tarski's greatest fixed point theorem and Pataraia's
lemma implies propositional resizing. Hence, these principles are inherently
impredicative and a predicative development of order theory must therefore do
without them. Finally, we clarify, in our predicative setting, the relation
between the traditional definition of sup-lattice that requires suprema for all
subsets and our definition that asks for suprema of all small families.

systems. However, the communication between the agents involves two major
challenges: the limited bandwidth, and the shared communication medium between
the agents, which restricts the number of agents that can simultaneously
exchange information. While both of these issues need to be addressed in
practice, the impact of the latter problem on the performance of the
multi-agent systems has often been neglected. This becomes even more important
when the agents' information or observations have different importance, in
which case the agents require different priorities for accessing the medium and
sharing their information. Representing the agents' priorities by fairness
weights and normalizing each agent's share by the assigned fairness weight, the
goal can be expressed as equalizing the agents' normalized shares of the
communication medium. To achieve this goal, we adopt a queueing theoretic
approach and propose a distributed fair scheduling algorithm for providing
weighted fairness in single-hop networks. Our proposed algorithm guarantees an
upper-bound on the normalized share disparity among any pair of agents. This
can particularly improve the short-term fairness, which is important in
real-time applications. Moreover, our scheduling algorithm adjusts itself
dynamically to achieve a high throughput at the same time. The simulation
results validate our claims and comparisons with the existing methods show our
algorithm's superiority in providing short-term fairness, while achieving a
high throughput.

provide empirical evidence that this configuration is attained in practice and
that reaching a close-to-optimal state typically indicates good generalization
performance. Yet, the two losses show remarkably different optimization
behavior. The number of iterations required to perfectly fit to data scales
superlinearly with the amount of randomly flipped labels for the supervised
contrastive loss. This is in contrast to the approximately linear scaling
previously reported for networks trained with cross-entropy.

that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like

develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and
significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label
hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN),
such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of
granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture
allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g.,
apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting
classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling
at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according
to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are
sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very
uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that

high incidence of these stars in the solar neighbourhood and their importance

difficult, leading to significant discrepancies in the published results. We
compare M dwarf parameters derived by recent high-resolution near-infrared
studies with each other and with fundamental stellar parameters. We also assess
to what extent deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for Fe and
K influence the outcome of these studies. We carry out line formation
calculations based on a modern model atmosphere grid along with a synthetic
spectrum synthesis code that treats formation of atomic and molecular lines in
cool-star atmospheres including departures from LTE. We use near-infrared
spectra collected with the CRIRES instrument at the ESO VLT as reference
observational data. We find that the effective temperatures obtained by the
different studies mostly agree to better than 100 K. We see a much worse
agreement in the surface gravities and metallicities. We demonstrate that
non-LTE effects are negligible for Fe I in M-dwarf atmospheres but are
important for K I. These effects, leading to K abundance and metallicity
corrections on the order of 0.2 dex, may be responsible for some of the
discrepancies in the published analyses. Differences in the
temperature-pressure structures of the atmospheric models may be another factor
contributing to the discrepancies, in particular at low metallicities and high
effective temperatures. In high-resolution spectroscopic studies of M dwarfs
attention should be given to details of the line formation physics as well as
input atomic and molecular data. Collecting high-quality, wide wavelength
coverage spectra of benchmark M dwarfs is an essential future step.

Jovian planets to form around stars with higher metallicities; however, there
is no consensus on a trend for smaller planets. Here, we investigate the
planet-metallicity correlation for rocky planets in single and multi-planet
systems around Kepler M-dwarf and late K-dwarf stars. Due to molecular
blanketing and the dim nature of these low mass stars, it is difficult to make
direct elemental abundance measurements via spectroscopy. We instead use a
combination of accurate and uniformly measured parallaxes and photometry to
obtain relative metallicities and validate this method with a subsample of
spectroscopically determined metallicities. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Anderson-Darling test to compare the compact
multiple planetary systems with single transiting planet systems and systems
with no detected transiting planets. We find that the compact multiple
planetary systems are derived from a statistically more metal-poor population,
with a p-value of 0.015 in the KS test, a p-value of 0.005 in the Mann-Whitney
U test, and a value of 2.574 in the Anderson-Darling test statistic, which
exceeds the derived threshold for significance by a factor of 25. We conclude
that metallicity plays a significant role in determining the architecture of

an abundance pattern midway between the s- and r-processes. These so-called
r/s-stars raise the need for an intermediate neutron capture process
(i-process), which is thought to result from the ingestion of protons in a
convective helium-burning region, but whose astrophysical site is still largely
debated. We investigate whether an i-process during the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) phase of low-metallicity low-mass stars can develop and whether it can
explain the abundances of observed r/s-stars. At the beginning of the AGB
phase, during the third thermal pulse, the helium driven convection zone is
able to penetrate the hydrogen-rich layers. The subsequent proton ingestion
leads to a strong neutron burst with neutron densities of $\approx 4.3 \times
10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the origin of the synthesis of i-process elements. The
nuclear energy released by proton burning in the helium-burning convective
shell strongly affects the internal structure: the thermal pulse splits and
after approximately ten years the upper part of the convection zone merges with
the convective envelope. The surface carbon abundance is enhanced by more than
3 dex. This leads to an increase in the opacity, which triggers a strong mass
loss and prevents any further thermal pulse. We show that specific isotopic
ratios of Ba, Nd, Sm, and Eu can represent good tracers of i-process
nucleosynthesis. Finally, an extended comparison with 14 selected r/s-stars
show that the observed composition patterns can be well reproduced by our
i-process AGB model.

analysing statistical properties of the VoI in the worst case. We also study
the optimal sampling policy to maximise the average information value under the
sampling rate constraint. In simulations, the validity of theoretical results
is verified, and the performance of VoI in Markov and hidden Markov models is
also analysed. Numerical results further illustrate that the proposed VoI
framework can support timely transmission in status update systems, and it can

models of such systems are constructed in a number of approximations, so
questions about how they describe the experimental dynamics qualitatively and
quantitatively, and how the accuracy of the model description depends on the

verification of any model is its reconstruction from the time series obtained
in experiment. If it is possible to fit the model to experimental data and the
resulting parameter values are close to the expected values (calculated from
the first principles), the quantitative correspondence between the model and
the physical object is nearly proved. In this paper, for the first time, the
equations of the PLL model with a bandpass filter are reconstructed from the
experimental signals of the generator in various modes. The reconstruction
showed that the model known in the literature generally describes the
experimental dynamics in regular and chaotic regimes. The relative error of
parameter estimation is between 2% and 50% for different regimes and
parameters. The reconstructed nonlinear function of phase is not harmonic and
highly asymmetric in contrary to the model one.

the STM bias, thus enabling the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction (UNN) to

construct a coupled map lattice of the paradigmatic chaotic logistic map by

its neighbours and in the process of doing so, it pays a cost. The agents
update their strategies (cooperation or defection) by using either a stochastic

what they already have. Among some other interesting results, we find that
beyond a critical coupling strength, that increases with the rewiring

spatiotemporally synchronized regardless of the rewiring probability. Moreover,
we observe that the population does not desynchronize completely -- and hence
finite level of cooperation is sustained -- even when the average degree of the
coupled map lattice is very high. These results are at odds with how a

entities due to the high volatility in residential consumption patterns as well
as a historic focus on aggregated loads from the utility and system feeder
perspective. Large-scale deployment of smart meters has motivated increasing
studies to explore disaggregated daily load patterns, which can reveal
important heterogeneity across different time scales, weather conditions, as
well as within and across individual households. This paper aims to shed light
on the mechanisms by which electricity consumption patterns exhibit variability
and the different constraints that may affect demand-response (DR) flexibility.
We systematically evaluate the relationship between daily time-of-use patterns
and their variability to external and internal influencing factors, including
time scales of interest, meteorological conditions, and household
characteristics by application of an improved version of the adaptive K-means
clustering method to profile ""household-days"" of a summer peaking utility. We
find that for this summer-peaking utility, outdoor temperature is the most
important external driver of the load shape variability relative to seasonality
and day-of-week. The top three consumption patterns represent approximately 50%
of usage on the highest temperature days. The variability in summer load shapes
across customers can be explained by the responsiveness of the households to
outside temperature. Our results suggest that depending on the influencing
factors, not all the consumption variability can be readily translated to
consumption flexibility. Such information needs to be further explored in
segmenting customers for better program targeting and tailoring to meet the
needs of the rapidly evolving electricity grid.

models possessing fixed points so that they may be understood as the attainment
of evolutionary stability, and hence, Nash equilibrium. Any show of periodic or
chaotic solution is many a time perceived as a shortcoming of the corresponding
game dynamic because (Nash) equilibrium play is supposed to be robust and
persistent behaviour, and any other behaviour in nature is deemed transient.
Consequently, there is a lack of attempt to connect the non-fixed point
solutions with the game theoretic concepts. Here we provide a way to render
game theoretic meaning to periodic solutions. To this end, we consider a
replicator map that models Darwinian selection mechanism in unstructured
infinite-sized population whose individuals reproduce asexually forming
non-overlapping generations. This is one of the simplest evolutionary game
dynamic that exhibits periodic solutions giving way to chaotic solutions (as
parameters related to reproductive fitness change) and also obeys the folk
theorems connecting fixed point solutions with Nash equilibrium. Interestingly,
we find that a modified Darwinian fitness -- termed heterogeneity payoff -- in
the corresponding population game must be put forward as (conventional) fitness
times the probability that two arbitrarily chosen individuals of the population
adopt two different strategies. The evolutionary dynamics proceeds as if the
individuals optimize the heterogeneity payoff to reach an evolutionarily stable
orbit, should it exist. We rigorously prove that a locally asymptotically
stable period orbit must be heterogeneity stable orbit -- a generalization of
evolutionarily stable state.

advance this goal by describing successful and reusable configurations of
design problems in which decisions have a moral component, as well as through
facilitating communication in multidisciplinary teams designing HI systems. For
this research, TDPs were developed to describe a set of solutions for two
design problems in a medical HI system: (1) mitigating harmful biases in
machine learning algorithms and (2) sharing health and behavioral patient data
with healthcare professionals and system developers. The Socio-Cognitive
Engineering methodology was employed, integrating operational demands, human

effectiveness, and generalizability. The results showed that TDPs are a useful
method to unambiguously describe solutions for diverse HI design problems with
a moral component on varying abstraction levels, that are usable by a

indicated that the SCE approach and the developed questionnaire are suitable

provides an important opportunity for improving clinical decision-making, the
lack of interpretability is a major barrier to the incorporation of these
black-box models in routine care, limiting their trustworthiness and preventing
further hypothesis-testing investigations. In this study, we propose two
methods, namely, model distillation and variable selection, to untangle hidden
patterns learned by an established deep learning model (BEHRT) for risk
association identification. Due to the clinical importance and diversity of
heart failure as a phenotype, it was used to showcase the merits of the
proposed methods. A cohort with 788,880 (8.3% incident heart failure) patients
was considered for the study. Model distillation identified 598 and 379
diseases that were associated and dissociated with heart failure at the
population level, respectively. While the associations were broadly consistent
with prior knowledge, our method also highlighted several less appreciated
links that are worth further investigation. In addition to these important
population-level insights, we developed an approach to individual-level
interpretation to take account of varying manifestation of heart failure in
clinical practice. This was achieved through variable selection by detecting a
minimal set of encounters that can maximally preserve the accuracy of
prediction for individuals. Our proposed work provides a discovery-enabling
tool to identify risk factors in both population and individual levels from a

  Dataset Release",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large organizations such as social media companies continually release data,
for example user images. At the same time, these organizations leverage their
massive corpora of released data to train proprietary models that give them an
edge over their competitors. These two behaviors can be in conflict as an
organization wants to prevent competitors from using their own data to
replicate the performance of their proprietary models. We solve this problem by
developing a data poisoning method by which publicly released data can be
minimally modified to prevent others from train-ing models on it. Moreover, our
method can be used in an online fashion so that companies can protect their
data in real time as they release it.We demonstrate the success of our approach
onImageNet classification and on facial recognition.

researcher. However, the pressure to maintain productivity and scientific
impact can lead to research group publishing excessively, negatively affecting
the mental health of a researcher. Ph.D. students and early career researchers
are particularly susceptible to this pressure due to the inherent vulnerability
of their positions. At present, there are no resources that concisely summarise
the publication culture of a research group to help the researcher make an
informed decision before joining. In this article, we present the 'Super
Researcher' app, an R Shiny application(app) with a user-friendly interface.
Using text-mining methodology to extract publicly available author data from
Scopus, this pilot app has four fundamental functions to provide snapshot
information that will help researchers grasp the publication culture of a
research group within minutes. The 'Super Researcher' app provides information
on: 1) institution data, 2) author's publication, 3) co-author network plots
and 4) publication journals. The 'Super Researcher' app is built on R shiny
which provides an interactive interface to users. This app utilizes the Big
Data framework Apache Spark to mine relevant information from a huge author
information database. The author's information is stored and manipulated using
both SQL(SQLite) and NoSQL(HBase) databases. Hbase is used for local data
storage and manipulation while SQLite feeds data to the R Shiny interface. In
this paper, we introduce these functionalities and illustrate how this
information can help guide a researcher to select a new Principle Investigator
(PI) with better compatibility in terms of publication attitude using a case
study.

  Gas analysis",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.bio-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Terahertz (THz) Time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a broadband
spectroscopic technique spreading its uses in multiple fields: in science from
material science to biology, in industry where it measures the thickness of a
paint layer during the painting operation. Using such practical commercial
apparatus with broad spectrum for gas spectroscopy could be a major asset for
air quality monitoring and tracking of atmospheric composition. However, gas
spectroscopy needs high resolution and the usual approach in THz-TDS, where the
recorded time trace is Fourier transform, suffers from resolution limitation
due to the size of the delay line in the system. In this letter, we introduce
the concept of constraint reconstruction for super-resolution spectroscopy
based on the modeling of the spectroscopic lines in a sparse spectrum. Light
molecule gas typically shows sparse and narrow lines on a broad spectrum and we
propose an algorithm reconstructing these lines with a resolution improvement
of 10 the ultimate resolution reachable by the apparatus. We envision the
proposed technique to lead to broadband, selective, rapid and cheap gas
monitoring applications.

alternative, efficient and more ethical way to disseminate research through
their versatile environment. This format invites the readers to delve deeper

research results such as for instance equations and figures are reproducible
even for non-expert readers. The codes and methods are available, in a
transparent manner, to interested readers. The methods can be reused and
adapted to answer additional questions in related topics. The codes run on

setup in light of practical challenges. We present Trade Execution using
Reinforcement Learning (TradeR) which aims to address two such practical
challenges of catastrophy and surprise minimization by formulating trading as a
real-world hierarchical RL problem. Through this lens, TradeR makes use of
hierarchical RL to execute trade bids on high frequency real market experiences
comprising of abrupt price variations during the 2019 fiscal year COVID19 stock
market crash. The framework utilizes an energy-based scheme in conjunction with
surprise value function for estimating and minimizing surprise. In a
large-scale study of 35 stock symbols from the S&P500 index, TradeR
demonstrates robustness to abrupt price changes and catastrophic losses while
maintaining profitable outcomes. We hope that our work serves as a motivating
example for application of RL to practical problems.

  Classes",,,,,"math.OC cs.NI math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Utilizing customers' service-time information, we study an easy-to-implement
scheduling policy with two priority classes. By carefully designing the
classes, the two-class priority rule achieves near-optimal performance. In
particular, for a single-server queue, as the traffic intensity approaches 1,
the policy achieves a scaling for the queue length processes that is similar to
the shortest remaining processing time first policy. Our analysis quantifies
how the tail of the service time distribution affects the benefits one can gain
from service-time-based scheduling policies. When the service times are
misspecified, we further quantify how imperfect observation of the service time
affects the performance of the two-class priority rule through both theoretical
and numerical analysis. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the two-class
priority rule. Specifically, even with imperfect service-time information, the
two-class priority rules can still achieve substantial performance improvement
over the first come first served.
