new physics models such as tiny neutrino masses. Detecting the doubly charged
scalar bosons from the doublet field can be a good probe of such models.
However, their collider phenomenology has not been examined sufficiently. We
investigate collider signatures of the doubly and singly charged scalar bosons
at the LHC for the high-luminosity upgraded option (HL-LHC) by looking at
transverse mass distributions etc. With the appropriate kinematical cuts we
demonstrate the background reduction in the minimal model in the following two
cases depending on the mass of the scalar bosons. (1) The main decay mode of
the singly charged scalar bosons is the tau lepton and missing (as well as
charm and strange quarks). (2) That is into a top bottom pair. In the both
cases, we assume that the doubly charged scalar boson is heavier than the
singly charged ones. We conclude that the scalar doublet field with $Y = 3/2$
is expected to be detectable at the HL-LHC unless the mass is too large.

We introduce a special operator on a certain graph obtained by rescaling the

Despite the advantages of $n$-step relabeling, we theoretically and
experimentally prove the off-policy $n$-step bias introduced by $n$-step
relabeling may lead to poor performance in many environments. To address the
above issue, two bias-reduced MHER algorithms, MHER($\lambda$) and Model-based
MHER (MMHER) are presented. MHER($\lambda$) exploits the $\lambda$ return while
MMHER benefits from model-based value expansions. Experimental results on
numerous multi-goal robotic tasks show that our solutions can successfully
alleviate off-policy $n$-step bias and achieve significantly higher sample
efficiency than HER and Curriculum-guided HER with little additional

turbulence is generated by shear and buoyancy processes, constitute the initial
validation space of the new model, and their results are comprehensively
discussed in two subsequent studies. The computations indicate that PANS can
accurately predict the selected flow problems, resolving only a fraction of the
scales of large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation strategies. The
results also reiterate that the physical resolution of the PANS model must
guarantee that the key instabilities and coherent structures of the flow are

predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the

cylindrical hollow annulus. This configuration is compatible with Particle In
Cell simulations of laser plasma interactions. This configuration allows using
a smaller computation box and is therefore computationally more efficient than
the creation of a Bessel-Gauss beam from a wall and models more precisely the
analytical infinite Bessel beam. Zeroth and higher-order Bessel beams with
different cone angles are successfully produced. We investigate the effects of
the injector parameters on the error with respect to the analytical solution.
In all cases, the relative deviation is in the range of 0.01-7.0 percent.

masking, and more recently with contrastive learning objectives. Contrastive
self-supervised training objectives enabled recent successes in image
representation pretraining by learning to contrast input-input pairs of
augmented images as either similar or dissimilar. However, in NLP, automated
creation of text input augmentations is still very challenging because a single

NLP pretraining methods contrast over input-label pairs, rather than over
input-input pairs, using methods from Metric Learning and Energy Based Models.
In this survey, we summarize recent self-supervised and supervised contrastive
NLP pretraining methods and describe where they are used to improve language
modeling, few or zero-shot learning, pretraining data-efficiency and specific
NLP end-tasks. We introduce key contrastive learning concepts with lessons

large number of oscillation modes through which extraordinarily complex time
evolutions arise. The system design is based on assuring the occurrence of a
number of Hopf bifurcations in a set of fixed points of a relatively generic
system of ordinary differential equations, in which the main peculiarity is
that the nonlinearities appear through functions of a linear combination of the
system variables. The paper presents the design procedure and a selection of
numerical simulations with a variety of designed systems whose dynamical
behaviors are really rich and full of unknown features. For concreteness, the
presentation is focused to illustrating the oscillatory mixing effects on the
periodic orbits, through which the harmonic oscillation born in a Hopf
bifurcation becomes successively enriched with the intermittent incorporation
of other oscillation modes of higher frequencies while the orbit remains
periodic and without necessity of bifurcating instabilities. Even in the
absence of a proper mathematical theory covering the nonlinear mixing
mechanisms we find enough evidence to expect that the oscillatory scenario be
truly scalable concerning the phase space dimension, the multiplicity of
involved fixed points and the range of time scales, so that extremely complex

and interpretation tasks. However, the majority of approaches subsample data
volumes and restrict model sizes to minimise computational requirements.
Subsampling the data risks losing vital spatio-temporal information which could
aid training whilst restricting model sizes can impact model performance, or in
some extreme cases, renders more complicated tasks such as segmentation
impossible. This paper illustrates how to tackle the two main issues of
training of large neural networks: memory limitations and impracticably large
training times. Typically, training data is preloaded into memory prior to
training, a particular challenge for seismic applications where data is
typically four times larger than that used for standard image processing tasks
(float32 vs. uint8). Using a microseismic use case, we illustrate how over
750GB of data can be used to train a model by using a data generator approach
which only stores in memory the data required for that training batch.
Furthermore, efficient training over large models is illustrated through the
training of a 7-layer UNet with input data dimensions of 4096X4096. Through a
batch-splitting distributed training approach, training times are reduced by a
factor of four. The combination of data generators and distributed training
removes any necessity of data 1 subsampling or restriction of neural network
sizes, offering the opportunity of utilisation of larger networks,

for ensuring accuracy and fairness in such prediction systems that combine
machine learning model inferences and domain expert predictions. Prior work on
""deferral systems"" in classification settings has focused on the setting of a
pipeline with a single expert and aimed to accommodate the inaccuracies and
biases of this expert to simultaneously learn an inference model and a deferral
system. Our work extends this framework to settings where multiple experts are
available, with each expert having their own domain of expertise and biases. We
propose a framework that simultaneously learns a classifier and a deferral
system, with the deferral system choosing to defer to one or more human experts
in cases of input where the classifier has low confidence. We test our
framework on a synthetic dataset and a content moderation dataset with biased
synthetic experts, and show that it significantly improves the accuracy and
fairness of the final predictions, compared to the baselines. We also collect
crowdsourced labels for the content moderation task to construct a real-world
dataset for the evaluation of hybrid machine-human frameworks and show that our
proposed learning framework outperforms baselines on this real-world dataset as
well.

acting on a particle cancel out: however, both the size and the direction of
the attractive (or repulsive) forces acting on a particle are related to its

analyze the case of t-SNE acting on a single homogeneous cluster (modeled by

derive a mean-field model that leads to interesting questions in classical

intelligence and might form a critical component of more complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we investigate if the surface form of a number has any
influence on how sequence-to-sequence language models learn simple arithmetic
tasks such as addition and subtraction across a wide range of values. We find
that how a number is represented in its surface form has a strong influence on
the model's accuracy. In particular, the model fails to learn addition of
five-digit numbers when using subwords (e.g., ""32""), and it struggles to learn
with character-level representations (e.g., ""3 2""). By introducing position
tokens (e.g., ""3 10e1 2""), the model learns to accurately add and subtract
numbers up to 60 digits. We conclude that modern pretrained language models can
easily learn arithmetic from very few examples, as long as we use the proper
surface representation. This result bolsters evidence that subword tokenizers
and positional encodings are components in current transformer designs that
might need improvement. Moreover, we show that regardless of the number of
parameters and training examples, models cannot learn addition rules that are
independent of the length of the numbers seen during training. Code to

  of Thermal Radiative Transfer","33 pages, 11 figures, 1 table",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations form an integro-differential
system that describes the propagation and collisional interactions of photons.
Computing accurate and efficient numerical solutions TRT are challenging for
several reasons, the first of which is that TRT is defined on a
high-dimensional phase. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the phase
space, classical approaches such as the P$_N$ (spherical harmonics) or the
S$_N$ (discrete ordinates) ansatz are often used in the literature. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach: the hybrid discrete (H$^T_N$)
approximation to the radiative thermal transfer equations. This approach
acquires desirable properties of both P$_N$ and S$_N$, and indeed reduces to
each of these approximations in various limits: H$^1_N$ $\equiv$ P$_N$ and
H$^T_0$ $\equiv$ S$_T$. We prove that H$^T_N$ results in a system of hyperbolic
equations for all $T\ge 1$ and $N\ge 0$. Another challenge in solving the TRT
system is the inherent stiffness due to the large timescale separation between
propagation and collisions, especially in the diffusive (i.e., highly
collisional) regime. This stiffness challenge can be partially overcome via
implicit time integration, although fully implicit methods may become
computationally expensive due to the strong nonlinearity and system size. On
the other hand, explicit time-stepping schemes that are not also
asymptotic-preserving in the highly collisional limit require resolving the
mean-free path between collisions, making such schemes prohibitively expensive.
In this work we develop a numerical method that is based on a nodal
discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space, coupled with a semi-implicit
discretization in time. We conduct several numerical experiments to verify the
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the H$^T_N$ ansatz and the numerical
discretizations.

over a broad $Q^2$ range rather than attempting to directly determine the slope
of $G_E$ at $Q^2 = 0$. This method relates the radius of the proton to its
transverse charge density, which is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of
the Dirac form factor, $F_1(Q^2)$. We apply our method to reanalyze the
extensive data obtained by the A1 Collaboration [J. C. Bernauer et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 105, 242001 (2010)] and extract a radius value, $r_E =
0.889(5)_{\text{stat}}(5)_{\text{syst}}(4)_{\text{model}}~\text{fm}$, that is
consistent with the original result. We also provide new parametrizations for
the Dirac and Pauli form factors and the transverse charge and magnetization
densities of the proton. Our reanalysis shows that the proton radius
discrepancy cannot be explained by issues with fitting and extrapolating the A1
data to $Q^2 = 0$.

The standard MFEnKF uses linear couplings between models, and is statistically
optimal in case of Gaussian probability densities. This work extends MFEnKF to
work with non-linear couplings between the models. Optimal nonlinear projection

games and to reveal software bugs. Manual testing is expensive and
time-consuming, especially when there are many mobile games to test and every
software version requires for extensive testing before being released. Existing
testing frameworks (e.g., Android Monkey) are limited because they adopt no
domain knowledge to play games. Learning-based tools (e.g., Wuji) involve a
huge amount of training data and computation before testing any game. This
paper presents LIT -- our lightweight approach to generalize playtesting
tactics from manual testing, and to adopt the generalized tactics to automate
game testing. LIT consists of two phases. In Phase I, while a human plays an
Android game app G for a short period of time (e.g., eight minutes), \tool
records the user's actions (e.g., swipe) and the scene before each action.
Based on the collected data, LIT generalizes a set of \emph{context-aware,
abstract playtesting tactics} which describe under what circumstances, what
actions can be taken to play the game. In Phase II, LIT tests G based on the
generalized tactics. Namely, given a randomly generated game scene, LIT
searches match for the abstract context of any inferred tactic; if there is a
match, LIT customizes the tactic and generates a feasible event to play the
game. Our evaluation with nine games shows LIT to outperform two
state-of-the-art tools. This implies that by automating playtest, LIT will
significantly reduce manual testing and boost the quality of game apps.

blunt wave-like serrations. Several studies on the effect of tubercles on
isolated airfoils have shown a beneficial effect in the post-stall regime, as
reduced drag and increased lift, leading to a delay of stall. The prospect of
delaying stall is particularly attractive to designers of axial compressors in
gas turbines, as this leads to designs with higher loading and therefore higher
pressure rise with fewer number of stages. In the present study, experiments
were performed on a cascade of airfoils with NACA 65209 profile with different
tubercle geometries. The measurements were made over an exit plane using a
five-hole probe to compare the cascade performance parameters. Additionally,
hot-wire measurements were taken near the blade surface to understand the
nature of the flow in the region close to the tubercles. Oil-flow visualization
on the cascade end wall reveal the flow through the passage of blades with and
without tubercles. For the cascade considered, the estimated stall angle for
the best performing set of blades is found to increase up to 8.6{\deg} from
that of the unmodified blade of 6.0{\deg}. Application of such structures in
axial compressor blades may well lead to suppression of stall in axial
compressors and extend the operating range.

bridge between two extreme modeling tools for PDEs, namely dense neural network
based methods like Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and traditional
mesh-free numerical methods, thereby providing a novel means to develop a new
class of hybrid algorithms that build on the best of both these viewpoints. A
unique feature of the SPINN model that distinguishes it from other neural
network based approximations proposed earlier is that it is (i) interpretable,
in a particular sense made precise in the work, and (ii) sparse in the sense
that it has much fewer connections than typical dense neural networks used for
PDEs. Further, the SPINN algorithm implicitly encodes mesh adaptivity and is
able to handle discontinuities in the solutions. In addition, we demonstrate
that Fourier series representations can also be expressed as a special class of

temperature dependent Urbach energies. These energies quantify the static,
structural disorder causing localized exponential-tail states, and dynamic
disorder from electron-phonon scattering. Applicability of this
exponential-tail model to disordered solids has been long debated. Nonetheless,
exponential fittings are routinely applied to sub-gap absorption analysis of
organic semiconductors. Herein, we elucidate the sub-gap spectral line-shapes
of organic semiconductors and their blends by temperature-dependent quantum
efficiency measurements. We find that sub-gap absorption due to singlet
excitons is universally dominated by thermal broadening at low photon energies
and the associated Urbach energy equals the thermal energy, regardless of
static disorder. This is consistent with absorptions obtained from a
convolution of Gaussian density of excitonic states weighted by Boltzmann-like
thermally activated optical transitions. A simple model is presented that
explains absorption line-shapes of disordered systems, and we also provide a
strategy to determine the excitonic disorder energy. Our findings elaborate the

$(199^{\circ}\leq\lambda_{\odot}\leq 205^{\circ})$ with a mean Sun-centered
geocentric ecliptic radiant of $\lambda_{g}-\lambda_{\odot}=271^{\circ}.04$,
$\beta_{g}=-76^{\circ}.4$, and a geocentric speed of 33.3 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming
a mass index value of $s=2.0$, we compute a peak 24 hour-average flux of 0.029
met. km$^{-2}$ hr$^{-1}$ to a limit of 9th magnitude, which is equivalent to a
zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of 5.7, and comparable to other established showers

typical mass index values, we find that the outburst likely never exceeded a
maximum ZHR of $\sim44$, well below the activity of other strong showers. The

such applications, circuits of various depths and composed of different sets of
gates are run on NISQ devices. Therefore, it is crucial to find practical ways
to capture the general performance of circuits on these devices. Motivated by
this pressing need, we modified the standard Clifford randomized benchmarking
(RB) and interleaved RB schemes targeting them to hardware limitations. Firstly
we remove the requirement for, and assumptions on, the inverse operator, in
Clifford RB by incorporating a tehchnique from quantum verification. This
introduces another figure of merit by which to assess the quality of the NISQ
hardware, namely the acceptance probability of quantum verification. Many
quantum algorithms, that provide an advantage over classical algorithms, demand
the use of Clifford as well as non-Clifford gates. Therefore, as our second
contribution we develop a technique for characterising a variety of
non-Clifford gates, by combining tools from gate synthesis with interleaved RB.
Both of our techniques are most relevant when used in conjunction with RB
schemes that benchmark generators (or native gates) of the Clifford group, and

tree after training or use a custom learning procedure which is not compatible
with new learning techniques, such as those which use neural networks. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) type
for learning decision tree policies: Iterative Bounding MDPs (IBMDPs). An IBMDP
is constructed around a base MDP so each IBMDP policy is guaranteed to
correspond to a decision tree policy for the base MDP when using a
method-agnostic masking procedure. Because of this decision tree equivalence,
any function approximator can be used during training, including a neural
network, while yielding a decision tree policy for the base MDP. We present the
required masking procedure as well as a modified value update step which allows
IBMDPs to be solved using existing algorithms. We apply this procedure to
produce IBMDP variants of recent reinforcement learning methods. We empirically
show the benefits of our approach by solving IBMDPs to produce decision tree

Numerical results show that as strategic substitution increases, the value of
the information disclosure increases. When the objective is to induce

important uncertainties are the sensitivity of the climate system and the

of them is most important, both on the global as well as the regional level.
Here we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with
vastly different climate sensitivities, and find that uncertainty in both
climate sensitivity and economic damage per degree of warming are of similar
importance for the global economic impact. Increasing the climate sensitivity
or the sensitivity of the damage function both increases the economic damages
globally. Yet, at the country-level the effect varies depending on the initial
temperature as well as how much the country warms. Our findings emphasise the
importance of including these uncertainties in estimates of future economic
impacts, as they both are vital for the resulting impacts and thus policy
implications.

The full joint-detection scheme bridges across photonic and trapped-ion based

histograms of photon flight paths within the tissue to obtain tissue
oxygenation, regardless of the changes in the intensity of the source. Our
device is based on a 45ps time-to-digital converter (TDC) which is implemented

grounded on the idea that light-meson exchanges forces could lead to binding.
In analogy to the deuteron, the light-mesons usually considered include the
pion, sigma, rho and omega, but not the axial meson $a_1(1260)$. Though it has
been argued in the past that the coupling of the axial meson to the nucleons is
indeed strong, its mass is considerably heavier than that of the vector mesons
and thus its exchange ends up being suppressed. Yet, this is not necessarily
the case in heavy hadrons molecules: we find that even though the contribution
to binding from the axial meson is modest, it cannot be neglected in the
isovector sector where vector meson exchange cancels out. This might provide a
natural binding mechanism for molecular candidates such as the $Z_c(3900)$,
$Z_c(4020)$ or the more recently observed $Z_{cs}(3985)$. However the
$Z_{cs}(3985)$ is more dependent on a mixture of different factors, which
(besides axial meson exchange) include $\eta$ exchange and the nature of scalar
meson exchange. Together they point towards the existence of two
$Z_{cs}(3985)$-like resonances instead of one, while the observations about the
role of scalar meson exchange in the $Z_{cs}(3985)$ might be relevant for the
$P_{cs}(4459)$. Finally, the combination of axial meson exchange and flavor
symmetry breaking effects indicates that the isovector $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$
$D^*\bar{D}^*$ and the strange $J^P = 2^{+}$ $D^*\bar{D}_s^*$ molecules are the
most attractive configurations and thus the most likely molecular partners of

different, amount of energy. The goal of the exploration problem is for every
edge in the graph to be traversed by at least one agent. The amount of energy
used by an agent to travel distance $x$ is proportional to $x$. In our model,
the agents can {\em share} energy when co-located: when two agents meet, one
can transfer part of its energy to the other.
  For an $n$-node path, we give an $O(n+k)$ time algorithm that either finds an

show that the problem of deciding if exploration is possible by energy-sharing
agents is NP-hard, even for 3-regular graphs. In addition, we show that it is
always possible to find an exploration strategy if the total energy of the

allows us to establish several conjectures for this model: (i) it proves the
contiguity conjecture of Aubin et al. '19 between the planted and unplanted

established by proving that the partition function concentrates on an
exponential scale, under an analytical assumption on a real-valued function.
This left open the contiguity conjecture and the lognormal limit
characterization, which are established here unconditionally, with the
analytical assumption verified. In particular, our proof technique relies on a

examples of repetitive processes; gait cycles in walking, product assembly

Learning Control (ILC), a class of feedforward controllers for repetitive

from the errors of past process cycles. However, the literature is bereft of
ILC syntheses from hybrid models. The main thrust of this dissertation is to
provide a boradly applicable theory of ILC for deterministic, discrete-time

main gaps addressed by this dissertation are (1) the lack of compatibility
between existing hybrid modeling frameworks and ILC synthesis techniques, (2)
the failure of ILC based on Newton's method (NILC) for systems with unstable
inverses, and (3) the lack of inversion and stable inversion theory for
piecewise affine (PWA) systems (a subset of PWD systems). These issues are
addressed by (1) developing a closed-form representation for PWD systems, (2)
developing a new ILC framework informed by NILC but with the new ability to
incorporate stabilizing model inversion techniques, and (3) deriving
conventional and stable model inversion theories for PWA systems.

challenging because the intentions of the surrounding agents are not directly
observable and the environment conditions are continuously changing. Local
trajectory optimization methods, such as model predictive control (MPC), can
deal with those changes but require global guidance, which is not trivial to
obtain in crowded scenarios. This paper proposes to learn, via deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy that provides
long-term guidance to the local planner. In particular, in simulations with
cooperative and non-cooperative agents, we train a deep network to recommend a
subgoal for the MPC planner. The recommended subgoal is expected to help the
robot in making progress towards its goal and accounts for the expected
interaction with other agents. Based on the recommended subgoal, the MPC
planner then optimizes the inputs for the robot satisfying its kinodynamic and
collision avoidance constraints. Our approach is shown to substantially improve
the navigation performance in terms of number of collisions as compared to
prior MPC frameworks, and in terms of both travel time and number of collisions
compared to deep RL methods in cooperative, competitive and mixed multiagent
scenarios.

utility of all such parametric nonlinear optical processes is hampered by
phase-matching requirements. Quasi-phase-matching, birefringent phase matching,
and higher-order-mode phase matching have all been developed to address this
constraint, but the methods demonstrated to date suffer from the inconvenience
of only being phase-matched for a single, specific arrangement of beams,
typically co-propagating, resulting in cumbersome experimental configurations
and large footprints for integrated devices. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate that these phase-matching requirements may be satisfied in a
parametric nonlinear optical process for multiple, if not all, configurations
of input and output beams when using low-index media. Our measurement
constitutes the first experimental observation of direction-independent phase
matching for a medium sufficiently long for phase matching concerns to be
relevant. We demonstrate four-wave mixing from spectrally distinct co- and
counter-propagating pump and probe beams, the backward-generation of a
nonlinear signal, and excitation by an out-of-plane probe beam. These results
explicitly show that the unique properties of low-index media relax traditional
phase-matching constraints, which can be exploited to facilitate nonlinear
interactions and miniaturize nonlinear devices, thus adding to the established
exceptional properties of low-index materials.

"2102.13079","Ping Li","Xiaoyun Li and Ping Li","Quantization Algorithms for Random Fourier Features",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The method of random projection (RP) is the standard technique in machine
learning and many other areas, for dimensionality reduction, approximate near
neighbor search, compressed sensing, etc. Basically, RP provides a simple and
effective scheme for approximating pairwise inner products and Euclidean
distances in massive data. Closely related to RP, the method of random Fourier
features (RFF) has also become popular, for approximating the Gaussian kernel.
RFF applies a specific nonlinear transformation on the projected data from
random projections. In practice, using the (nonlinear) Gaussian kernel often
leads to better performance than the linear kernel (inner product), partly due
to the tuning parameter $(\gamma)$ introduced in the Gaussian kernel. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in studying properties of RFF.
  After random projections, quantization is an important step for efficient
data storage, computation, and transmission. Quantization for RP has also been
extensive studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on developing
quantization algorithms for RFF. The task is in a sense challenging due to the
tuning parameter $\gamma$ in the Gaussian kernel. For example, the quantizer
and the quantized data might be tied to each specific tuning parameter
$\gamma$. Our contribution begins with an interesting discovery, that the
marginal distribution of RFF is actually free of the Gaussian kernel parameter
$\gamma$. This small finding significantly simplifies the design of the
Lloyd-Max (LM) quantization scheme for RFF in that there would be only one LM
quantizer for RFF (regardless of $\gamma$). We also develop a variant named
LM$^2$-RFF quantizer, which in certain cases is more accurate. Experiments
confirm that the proposed quantization schemes perform well.

different areas are reconstructed using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm by
varying the distance parameter $R$. The measurements are performed using jets
with transverse momenta ($p_\mathrm{T}$) greater than 200 GeV and in a
pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|$ $\lt$ 2. To reveal the medium modification of
the jet spectra in PbPb collisions, the properly normalized ratio of spectra
from PbPb and pp data is used to extract jet nuclear modification factors as
functions of the PbPb collision centrality, $p_\mathrm{T}$ and, for the first
time, as a function of $R$ up to 1.0. For the most central collisions, a strong
suppression is observed for high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jets reconstructed with all
distance parameters, implying that a significant amount of jet energy is
scattered to large angles. The dependence of jet suppression on $R$ is expected
to be sensitive to both the jet energy loss mechanism and the medium response,
and so the data are compared to several modern event generators and analytic
calculations. The models considered do not fully reproduce the data.

nonlinear response. However, increased momentum in these media can deteriorate
the overlap between different harmonics which hinders efficient nonlinear
interaction in wavelength-scale resonators in the absence of momentum matching.
Here, we propose an alternative approach for light confinement in anisotropic
particles. The extra degree of freedom in anisotropic media allows us to
control the evanescent waves near the center and the radial momentum away from
the center, independently. This can lead to a strong light confinement as well
as an excellent field overlap between different harmonics which is ideal for
nonlinear wavelength conversion. Controlling the evanescent fields can also
help to surpass the constrains on the radiation bandwidth of isotropic
dielectric antennas. This can improve the light coupling into these particles,
which is crucial for nano-scale nonlinear optics. We estimate the
second-harmonic generation efficiency as well as optical parametric oscillation
threshold in these particles to show the strong nonlinear response in these
particles even away from the center of resonances. Our approach is promising to
be realized experimentally and can be used for many applications, such as
large-scale parallel sensing and computing.

context-free language (CFL) reachability problem on graphs and can be solved in
cubic time. Despite years of efforts, there are no known truly sub-cubic
algorithms for this problem. We study the related certification task: given an
instance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable
certificates for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show
that, in both scenarios, there exist succinct certificates ($O(n^2)$ in the
size of the problem) and these certificates can be checked in subcubic (matrix
multiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression
of paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix
constraints (for negative instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in
nondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic time.
  A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will
lead to faster algorithms for combinatorial problems such as Boolean
satisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification results, we show
that there cannot be a fine-grained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for
a conditional lower bound stronger than $n^\omega$, unless the nondeterministic
strong exponential time hypothesis (NSETH) fails.
  Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown
reachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language
recognition. For example, we describe succinct certificates for pushdown
non-reachability (inductive invariants) and observe that they can be checked in
matrix multiplication time. We also extract a new hardest 2NPDA language,

overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form.
So, how should one go about finding a morphology fit for solving tasks in a
given environment? Current approaches that co-adapt morphology and behavior use
a specific task's reward as a signal for morphology optimization. However, this
often requires expensive policy optimization and results in task-dependent
morphologies that are not built to generalize. In this work, we propose a new
approach, Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution (TAME), to alleviate both of these
issues. Without any task or reward specification, TAME evolves morphologies by
only applying randomly sampled action primitives on a population of agents.
This is accomplished using an information-theoretic objective that efficiently
ranks agents by their ability to reach diverse states in the environment and
the causality of their actions. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that across
2D, 3D, and manipulation environments TAME can evolve morphologies that match
the multi-task performance of those learned with task supervised algorithms.

gravitational potential energy is included in the total energy balance. They
accurately conserve minuscule entropy fluctuations advected in an isentropic
stratification, which enables the methods to reproduce the expected scaling of
convective flow speed with the heating rate. The deviation method also
substantially increases accuracy of maintaining stationary orbital motions in a
Keplerian disk on long timescales. The Cargo-LeRoux method fares substantially

that the RAR is intimately connected with the physics of the quasi-adiabatic
relaxation of dark matter in the presence of baryons in deep potential wells.
This cleanly demonstrates how the mean RAR and its scatter emerge in the
low-acceleration regime ($10^{-12}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}\lesssim a_{\rm
bary}\lesssim10^{-10}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}$) from an interplay between baryonic
feedback processes and the distribution of CDM in dark halos. Our framework
allows us to go further and study both higher and lower accelerations in
detail, using analytical approximations and a realistic mock catalog of
$\sim342,000$ low-redshift central galaxies with $M_r\leq-19$. We show that,
while the RAR in the baryon-dominated, high-acceleration regime ($a_{\rm
bary}\gtrsim10^{-10}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}$) is very sensitive to details of the
relaxation physics, a simple `baryonification' prescription matching the
relaxation results of hydrodynamical CDM simulations is remarkably successful
in reproducing the observed RAR without any tuning. And in the (currently
unobserved) ultra-low-acceleration regime ($a_{\rm bary}\lesssim 10^{-12}\,{\rm
m\,s}^{-2}$), the RAR is sensitive to the abundance of diffuse gas in the halo
outskirts, with our default model predicting a distinctive break from a simple
power-law-like relation for HI-deficient, diffuse gas-rich centrals. Our mocks
also show that the RAR provides more robust, testable predictions of the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm at galactic scales, with implications for alternative
gravity theories, than the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

naturally be associated with a critical class beyond the standard model

dark matter simulation is to rank order the real systems by stellar mass and
the simulated systems by halo mass and then simply assume monotonicity - that
the more massive halos host the more massive galaxies. This has had some
success, but we study here if a better motivated and more accurate matching
scheme is easily constructed by looking carefully at how well one could predict
the simulated IllustrisTNG galaxy sample from its dark matter computations. We
find that using the dark matter rotation curve peak velocity, $v_{max}$, for
normal galaxies reduces the error of the prediction by 30% (18% for central
galaxies and 60% for satellite systems) - following expectations from the
physics of monolithic collapse. For massive systems with halo mass $>$
10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ hierarchical merger driven formation is the better
model and dark matter halo mass remains the best single metric. Using a new
single variable that combines these effects, $\phi$ $=$
$v_{max}$/$v_{max,12.7}$ + M$_{peak}$/(10$^{12.7}$ M$_{\odot}$) allows further
improvement and reduces the error, as compared to ranking by dark matter mass
at $z=0$ by another 6% from $v_{max}$ ranking. Two parameter fits -- including
environmental effects produce only minimal further impact.

between two methods of cluster identification: the standard Matched Filter (MF)
method in SZ cluster finding and a method using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN). We further implement and show results for a `combined' identifier. We
apply the methods to simulated millimeter maps for several observing
frequencies for an SPT-3G-like survey. There are some key differences between
the methods. The MF method requires image pre-processing to remove point
sources and a model for the noise, while the CNN method requires very little
pre-processing of images. Additionally, the CNN requires tuning of
hyperparameters in the model and takes as input, cutout images of the sky.
Specifically, we use the CNN to classify whether or not an 8 arcmin $\times$ 8
arcmin cutout of the sky contains a cluster. We compare differences in purity
and completeness. The MF signal-to-noise ratio depends on both mass and
redshift. Our CNN, trained for a given mass threshold, captures a different set
of clusters than the MF, some of which have SNR below the MF detection
threshold. However, the CNN tends to mis-classify cutouts whose clusters are
located near the edge of the cutout, which can be mitigated with staggered
cutouts. We leverage the complementarity of the two methods, combining the
scores from each method for identification. The purity and completeness of the
MF alone are both 0.61, assuming a standard detection threshold. The purity and
completeness of the CNN alone are 0.59 and 0.61. The combined classification
method yields 0.60 and 0.77, a significant increase for completeness with a
modest decrease in purity. We advocate for combined methods that increase the
confidence of many lower signal-to-noise clusters.

belief is that ERM can interpolate but not extrapolate and that the latter is
considerably more difficult, but these claims are vague and lack formal
justification. In this work, we recast generalization over sub-groups as an
online game between a player minimizing risk and an adversary presenting new
test distributions. Under an existing notion of inter- and extrapolation based
on reweighting of sub-group likelihoods, we rigorously demonstrate that
extrapolation is computationally much harder than interpolation, though their
statistical complexity is not significantly different. Furthermore, we show
that ERM -- or a noisy variant -- is provably minimax-optimal for both tasks.

mapping the input state, computing the output state directly into ramdisk, and
unmapping the input state. The main executable remains unaware of the concept

deep learning framework that can generalize well for pollen grain
aerobiological imagery classification. We develop a convolutional neural
network-based pollen grain classification approach and combine some of the best
practices in deep learning for better generalization. In addition to
commonplace approaches like data-augmentation and weight regularization, we
utilize implicit regularization methods like manifold mixup to allow learning
of smoother decision boundaries. We also make use of proven state-of-the-art

by the success of generative modeling with variational autoencoders, we train
models with a richer learning objective which can allow the model to focus on
the relevant parts of the image. Finally, we create an ensemble of neural
networks, for the robustness of the test set predictions. Based on our

In 2013, it transitioned to its current disk state accompanied by brightening

'low' and 'high' modes. Continuum radio emission, denoting an outflow, is also
present and brightens during the X-ray low modes. Here, we present a
simultaneous optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray campaign comprising Kepler
($400-800$ nm), Hubble Space Telescope ($180-280$ nm), XMM-Newton ($0.3-10$
keV) and NuSTAR ($3 - 79$ keV). We demonstrate that low and high luminosity
modes in the UV band are strictly simultaneous with the X-ray modes and change
the UV brightness by a factor of $\sim25$\% on top of a much brighter
persistent UV component. We find strong evidence for UV pulsations (pulse
fraction of $0.82\pm0.19$\%) in the high-mode, with a similar waveform as the
X-ray pulsations making it the first known UV millisecond pulsar. Lastly, we
find that the optical mode changes occur synchronously with the UV/X-ray mode
changes, but optical modes are inverted compared to the higher frequencies.
There appear to be two broad-band emission components: one from radio to
near-infrared/optical that is brighter when the second component from optical
to hard X-rays is dimmer (and vice-versa). We suggest that these components
trace switches between accretion into the neutron star magnetosphere
(high-energy high-mode) versus ejection of material (low-energy high-mode).
Lastly, we propose that optical/UV/X-ray pulsations can arise from a shocked
accretion flow channeled by the neutron star's magnetic field.

the population of an urban area, provides a promising framework for discovering
commonalities across cities and uncovering dynamics shared by cities across
time and space. Here, we use the urban scaling framework to study an important,
but under-explored feature in this community - income inequality. We propose a
new method to study the scaling of income distributions by analyzing total
income scaling in population percentiles. We show that income in the least
wealthy decile (10%) scales close to linearly with city population, while
income in the most wealthy decile scale with a significantly superlinear
exponent. In contrast to the superlinear scaling of total income with city
population, this decile scaling illustrates that the benefits of larger cities
are increasingly unequally distributed. For the poorest income deciles, cities
have no positive effect over the null expectation of a linear increase. We
repeat our analysis after adjusting income by housing cost, and find similar
results. We then further analyze the shapes of income distributions. First, we
find that mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of income distributions all
increase with city size. Second, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a
city's income distribution and that of the largest city decreases with city
population, suggesting the overall shape of income distribution shifts with
city population. As most urban scaling theories consider densifying
interactions within cities as the fundamental process leading to the
superlinear increase of many features, our results suggest this effect is only
seen in the upper deciles of the cities. Our finding encourages future work to
consider heterogeneous models of interactions to form a more coherent
understanding of urban scaling.

abundances that can serve as an observational basis for estimating X(e-) and

derived the abundances of 14 species (13CO, C18O, HCO+, H13CO+, HC18O+, HCN,

ranges in these clouds, avoiding protostars, HII regions, and outflows. A
statistical analysis is carried out to identify general trends between
different species and with physical parameters. Relations between molecules
reveal strong linear correlations which define three different families: (1)
13CO and C18O; (2) H13CO+, HC18O+, H13CN, and HNC; and (3) the S-bearing
molecules. The abundances of the CO isotopologs increase with the gas kinetic
temperature until TK 15 K. For higher temperatures, the abundance remains
constant with a scatter of a factor of 3. The abundances of H13CO+, HC18O+,
H13CN, and HNC are well correlated with each other, and all of them decrease
with molecular hydrogen density, following the law n(H2)$^{-0.8\pm0.2}$. The
abundances of S-bearing species also decrease with n(H2) at a rate of
(S-bearing/H)gas n(H2)$^{-0.6\pm0.1}$. The abundances of molecules belonging to
groups 2 and 3 do not present any clear trend with gas temperature. At scales
of molecular clouds, the C18O abundance is the quantity that better correlates
with the cloud mass. We discuss the utility of the 13CO/C18O, HCO+/H13CO+, and
H13CO+/H13CN abundance ratios as chemical diagnostics of star formation in

quantify this heterogeneity we bring a novel approach to restart: the
methodology of inequality indices, which is widely applied in economics and in
the social sciences to measure income and wealth disparity. Using this approach
we establish an `inequality roadmap' for the mean-performance of sharp restart:
a whole new set of universal inequality criteria that determine when restart
with sharp timers (i.e. with fixed deterministic timers) decreases/increases
mean completion. The criteria are based on a host of inequality indices
including Bonferroni, Gini, Pietra, and other Lorenz-curve indices; each index
captures a different angle of the restart-inequality interplay. Utilizing the
fact that sharp restart can match the mean-performance of any general restart
protocol, we prove -- with unprecedented precision and resolution -- the
validity of the following statement: restart impedes/expedites mean completion
when the underlying statistical heterogeneity is low/high.

challenge in the quest to reliably produce and manipulate large-scale quantum
entangled states. Recently, quench experiments in Rydberg atom arrays
(Bluvstein et. al., arXiv:2012.12276) demonstrated that coherent revivals
associated with quantum many-body scars can be stabilized by periodic driving,
generating stable subharmonic responses over a wide parameter regime. We
analyze a simple, related model where these phenomena originate from
spatiotemporal ordering in an effective Floquet unitary, corresponding to
discrete time-crystalline (DTC) behavior in a prethermal regime. Unlike
conventional DTC, the subharmonic response exists only for Neel-like initial
states, associated with quantum scars. We predict robustness to perturbations
and identify emergent timescales that could be observed in future experiments.
Our results suggest a route to controlling entanglement in interacting quantum
systems by combining periodic driving with many-body scars.

learned sequences exhibit a common pattern that had not been discovered before,
to our knowledge, but has an meaningful analytical description. We can thus
restrict the searching space based on this control pattern, allowing to search
for longer sequences, ultimately leading to sequences that are robust against

open-world reasoning of ontologies broadens the space of applications of

some cases without increasing the complexity of reasoning tasks. However, in
many cases, solver development is lagging behind. As the result, the only known
method of solving disjunctive hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is based on
guess-and-verify, as formulated by Motik and Rosati in their original work. A
main obstacle is understanding how constraint propagation may be performed by a
solver, which, in the context of ASP, centers around the computation of
\textit{unfounded atoms}, the atoms that are false given a partial
interpretation. In this work, we build towards improving solvers for hybrid
MKNF knowledge bases with disjunctive rules: We formalize a notion of unfounded
sets for these knowledge bases, identify lower complexity bounds, and
demonstrate how we might integrate these developments into a solver. We discuss
challenges introduced by ontologies that are not present in the development of
solvers for disjunctive logic programs, which warrant some deviations from
traditional definitions of unfounded sets. We compare our work with prior
definitions of unfounded sets.

observations of a galaxy at a redshift of z ~ 11 (400 million years after the
Big Bang), a bright signal, named GN-z11-flash, shorter than 245 s was detected
and interpreted as an ultraviolet flash associated with a GRB in this galaxy,
or a shock-breakout in a Population III supernova. Its resulting luminosity
would be consistent with that of other GRBs, but a discussion based on

review the underlying physics of magnetic catalysis from both perspectives. The
quark-meson model is used as a specific example of a model that exhibits
magnetic catalysis. Regularization and renormalization are discussed and we pay
particular attention to a consistent and correct determination of the
parameters of the Lagrangian using the on-shell renormalization scheme. A
straightforward application of the quark-meson model and the NJL model leads to
the prediction that the chiral transition temperature $T_{\chi}$ is increasing
as a function of the magnetic field $B$. This is in disagreement with lattice
results, which show that $T_{\chi}$ is a decreasing function of $B$,
independent of the pion mass. The behavior can be understood in terms of the
so-called valence and sea contributions to the quark condensate and the
competition between them. We critically examine these ideas as well recent
attempts to improve low-energy models using lattice input.

effect of the spin and degree of magnetization (defined through the fluid

characterized by more turbulent dynamics, as the magnetic field lines are

around the spin axis of the remnant Kerr black hole are magnetically dominated,
and the magnetic field strength is increased by a factor $\sim$10$^2$

the accretion rate, as large as $\sim$48\%. As a potential driver for

  amplitudes","Accepted: MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1277",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Several attempts have been made to observe whether solar flares excite
acoustic modes since Charles Wolff suggested this possibility almost fifty
years ago. We look for the impact of flares on the amplitude of solar acoustic
modes and other effects that are also affecting the mode amplitude. Solar
acoustic mode amplitudes are known to be sensitive to magnetic fields. As
flares usually occur in the presence of strong magnetic fields and most likely
are the by-product of magnetic reconnection, we show how the magnetic field in
and around the flaring region affects the mode amplitude. The mode amplitudes
were obtained using ring-diagram analysis, which was first applied to a single
event, the largest flare in the space age (the `Halloween Flare',
SOL2003-10-28T11:00), using MDI data. Then, using HMI data, the analysis was
applied to the regions corresponding to the flares observed during the high
activity phase of cycle 24 and that fall into two groups. These two groups
consist of small (10-60 erg/cm^2/s) and large (>1200 erg/cm^2/s) peak-flux
flares, based on the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK). The first set is
used as a comparison to the results of the strong flares in the second set.
After applying several corrections in order to take into account several
sources of bias, we did not find any amplification in the inferred mode
amplitude due to flaring activity larger than a 10% uncertainty.

vectors $x$ and $y$. Our approach is inductive (as opposed to deductive) in
that it depends on the data generating distribution solely through some
nonparametric properties revealing associations in the data, and does not
require having enough data to fully characterize the true joint distributions
$P_{x, y}$. Specifically, our approach consists of (i) noting that $I\left(y;
x\right) = I\left(u_y; u_x\right)$ where $u_y$ and $u_x$ are the copula-uniform
dual representations of $y$ and $x$ (i.e. their images under the probability
integral transform), and (ii) estimating the copula entropies
$h\left(u_y\right)$, $h\left(u_x\right)$ and $h\left(u_y, u_x\right)$ by
solving a maximum-entropy problem over the space of copula densities under a
constraint of the type $\alpha_m = E\left[\phi_m(u_y, u_x)\right]$. We prove
that, so long as the constraint is feasible, this problem admits a unique
solution, it is in the exponential family, and it can be learned by solving a
convex optimization problem. The resulting estimator, which we denote MIND, is
marginal-invariant, always non-negative, unbounded for any sample size $n$,
consistent, has MSE rate $O(1/n)$, and is more data-efficient than competing
approaches. Beyond mutual information estimation, we illustrate that our
approach may be used to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by maximizing the
entropy of the copula of fake samples, a model we refer to as Copula Entropy
Regularized GAN (CER-GAN).

aims to automatically construct programs that operate by composing calls to
existing APIs. However, prior work has not considered efficient synthesis of
methods with side effects, e.g., web app methods that update a database. In
this paper, we introduce RbSyn, a novel type- and effect-guided synthesis tool
for Ruby. An RbSyn synthesis goal is specified as the type for the target
method and a series of test cases it must pass. RbSyn works by recursively
generating well-typed candidate method bodies whose write effects match the
read effects of the test case assertions. After finding a set of candidates
that separately satisfy each test, RbSyn synthesizes a solution that branches
to execute the correct candidate code under the appropriate conditions. We
formalize RbSyn on a core, object-oriented language $\lambda_{syn}$ and
describe how the key ideas of the model are scaled-up in our implementation for
Ruby. We evaluated RbSyn on 19 benchmarks, 12 of which come from popular,
open-source Ruby apps. We found that RbSyn synthesizes correct solutions for
all benchmarks, with 15 benchmarks synthesizing in under 9 seconds, while the
slowest benchmark takes 83 seconds. Using observed reads to guide synthesize is
effective: using type-guidance alone times out on 10 of 12 app benchmarks. We
also found that using less precise effect annotations leads to worse synthesis
performance. In summary, we believe type- and effect-guided synthesis is an
important step forward in synthesis of effectful methods from test cases.

energy caused by the resistance, the vessel elasticity helps to reduce overall

increasing the time required to respond to changes in the flow boundary
conditions for vessels longer than a critical size. In this regime, dissipation
and response time are found to follow a simple power law scaling relation both

dependent (fast) and contrast independent (slow) spaces defined via multiscale
space decomposition. Using this decomposition, our goal is further
appropriately to introduce time splitting such that the resulting scheme is
stable and can guarantee contrast-independent discretization under some
suitable (reasonable) conditions. In this paper, we propose
contrast-independent partially explicitly scheme for wave equations. The
splitting requires a careful design. We prove that the proposed splitting is
unconditionally stable under some suitable conditions formulated for the second
space (slow). This condition requires some type of non-contrast dependent space
and is easier to satisfy in the ""slow"" space. We present numerical results and
show that the proposed methods provide results similar to implicit methods with
the time step that is independent of the contrast.

enhanced and the temperature of the sample is consequently considerably (~ 63%)
decreased. This concept can be extended to nanoparticles of different shapes

conduct inference on the true mean reward of each arm based on data collected
so far at each step. However, since the arms are adaptively selected--thereby
yielding non-iid data--conducting inference accurately is not straightforward.
In particular, sample averaging, which is used in the family of UCB and
Thompson sampling (TS) algorithms, does not provide a good choice as it suffers
from bias and a lack of good statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic
normality). Our thesis in this paper is that more sophisticated inference
schemes that take into account the adaptive nature of the sequentially
collected data can unlock further performance gains, even though both UCB and
TS type algorithms are optimal in the worst case. In particular, we propose a
variant of TS-style algorithms--which we call doubly adaptive TS--that
leverages recent advances in causal inference and adaptively reweights the
terms of a doubly robust estimator on the true mean reward of each arm. Through
20 synthetic domain experiments and a semi-synthetic experiment based on data
from an A/B test of a web service, we demonstrate that using an adaptive
inferential scheme (while still retaining the exploration efficacy of TS)
provides clear benefits in online decision making: the proposed DATS algorithm
has superior empirical performance to existing baselines (UCB and TS) in terms
of regret and sample complexity in identifying the best arm. In addition, we
also provide a finite-time regret bound of doubly adaptive TS that matches (up
to log factors) those of UCB and TS algorithms, thereby establishing that its
improved practical benefits do not come at the expense of worst-case
suboptimality.

considerations very effectively for the two robot case as well. Unlike the
single robot case, however, the bounded cable length introduces considerations
around coordination (or equivalently, when viewed from the point of view of a

paper has to introduce a rather more involved formalization than prior
single-robot work in order to establish the core theoretical result -- a
theorem permitting the problem to be cast as one of finding paths rather than
trajectories. Once affirmed, the planning problem reduces to a straightforward
graph search with an elegant representation of the connecting cable, demanding
only a few extra ancillary checks that ensure sufficiency of cable to guarantee
feasibility of the solution. We describe our implementation of A${}^\star$

system is degenerate. First, we prove that for $\theta$ in $(1/2,1]$, the
underlying semigroup is not analytic, but is differentiable for $\theta$ in
$(0,1)$; this is in sharp contrast with known results for a single similarly
damped elastic system, where the semigroup is analytic for $\theta$ in

polynomially for $\theta$ in $[-1,0)$. To prove our results, we use the

fact that they exploit such invariance properties. With the objective of
quantifying the gain achieved by invariant architectures, we introduce two

network is focused, where multiple UAVs receive messages from base stations
(BSs) in the down-link, while BSs are serving ground UEs in their cells. For
effectively managing inter-cell interferences (ICIs) among UEs due to intense
reuse of time-frequency resource block (RB) resource, a first $p$-tier based RB
coordination criterion is proposed and adopted. Then, to enhance wireless
transmission quality for UAVs while protecting terrestrial UEs from being
interfered by ground-to-air (G2A) transmissions, a radio resource management
(RRM) problem of joint dynamic RB coordination and time-varying beamforming
design minimizing UAV's ergodic outage duration (EOD) is investigated. To cope
with conventional optimization techniques' inefficiency in solving the
formulated RRM problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is
initiated, where deep double duelling Q network (D3QN) and twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) are invoked to deal with RB coordination in
discrete action domain and beamforming design in continuous action regime,
respectively. The hybrid D3QN-TD3 solution is trained via interacting with the
considered outer and inner environments in an online centralized manner so that
it can then help achieve the suboptimal EOD minimization performance during its
offline decentralized exploitation phase. Simulation results have illustrated

common for deep fully-connected networks and convolutional neural networks

for the existence of spurious local minima: each output neuron of deep
fully-connected networks and CNNs with piecewise linear activations produces a
continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) output, and different pieces of CPWL output
can fit disjoint groups of data samples when minimizing the empirical risk.
Fitting data samples with different CPWL functions usually results in different
levels of empirical risk, leading to prevalence of spurious local minima. This
result is proved in general settings with any continuous loss function. The
main proof technique is to represent a CPWL function as a maximization over
minimization of linear pieces. Deep ReLU networks are then constructed to

The original label space is a logical matrix with entries from the Boolean

of existing methods map the input features to the label space using linear
projections with taking into consideration the label dependencies using logical
label matrix. However, the discriminative features are learned using one-way
projection from the feature representation of an instance into a logical label
space. Given that there is no manifold in the learning space of logical labels,
which limits the potential of learned models. In this work, inspired from a
real-world example in image annotation to reconstruct an image from the label
importance and feature weights. We propose a novel method in multi-label
learning to learn the projection matrix from the feature space to semantic
label space and projects it back to the original feature space using
encoder-decoder deep learning architecture. The key intuition which guides our
method is that the discriminative features are identified due to map the

reconstruct the original features from the label manifold in multi-label

angular-dependent narrowband-to-broadband conversion errors can result in
systematic errors of the estimated radiative fluxes. In this work, focusing on
clear-sky reflected TOA observations, we compare the overlapping views from
Meteosat Second Generation satellites at 0{\deg} and 41.5{\deg}E longitude

data derived from SEVIRI, we identify some of the main sources of

procedure followed by an empirical fit at the pixel-level that takes into

applied to each month of 2017, and gives a quadratic mean of the albedo

month to month, with a 2017 average value of 0.01. Sources of discrepancies
include the difficulty to estimate the flux over the sunglint ocean region

dedicated angular distribution models for the aerosol-over-ocean case, and the
existence of an observer-dependent diurnal-asymmetry artefact affecting the

precision of modern CR experiments. In this work, a Markov chain Monte Carlo
analysis has been implemented to fit the experimental flux ratios between B, Be
and Li and their flux ratios to the primary nuclei C and O. We have fitted the
data using two different parametrizations for the spallation cross sections.
The uncertainties in the evaluation of the spectra of these secondary cosmic
rays, due to spallation cross sections, have been considered by introducing
scale factors as nuisance parameters. We have also tested two different
formulations for the diffusion coefficient, which differ in the origin of the
high energy hardening of cosmic rays. Additionally, two different approaches
are used to scale the cross sections, one based on a combined analysis of all
the species (""combined"" analysis) and the other reproducing the high energy
spectra of the secondary-to-secondary flux ratios of Be/B, Li/B, Li/Be

propagation parameters inferred from the cross sections parametrizations tested

users validate their identity by selecting predetermined points on a
predetermined image. Its primary advantage over the ubiquitous text-based
approach stems from users' superior ability to remember visual information over
textual information, coupled with the authentication process being transformed
to one requiring recognition (instead of recall). Ideally, these
differentiations enable users to create more complex passwords, which
theoretically are more secure. Yet locimetric authentication has one
significant weakness: hot-spots. This term refers to areas of an image that
users gravitate towards, and which consequently have a higher probability of
being selected. Although many strategies have been proposed to counter the
hot-spot problem, one area that has received little attention is that of
resolution. The hypothesis here is that high-resolution images would afford the
user a larger password space, and consequently any hot-spots would dissipate.
We employ an experimental approach, where users generate a series of locimetric
passwords on either low- or high-resolution images. Our research reveals the
presence of hot-spots even in high-resolution images, albeit at a lower level
than that exhibited with low-resolution images. We conclude by reinforcing that
other techniques - such as existing or new software controls or training - need
to be utilized to mitigate the emergence of hot-spots with the locimetric

with atomic objects may lose some of its properties if we replace the atomic
objects that it uses with linearizable objects. It was not known whether the
properties that can be lost include the important property of termination (with
probability 1). In this paper, we first show that, for randomized algorithms,
termination can indeed be lost.
  Golab et al. also introduced strong linearizability, and proved that strongly
linearizable objects can be used as if they were atomic objects, even for
randomized algorithms: they preserve the algorithm's correctness properties,
including termination. Unfortunately, there are important cases where strong
linearizability is impossible to achieve. In particular, Helmi et al. MWMR
registers do not have strongly linearizable implementations from SWMR
registers.
  So we propose a new type of register linearizability, called write
strong-linearizability, that is strictly stronger than linearizability but
strictly weaker than strong linearizability. We prove that some randomized
algorithms that fail to terminate with linearizable registers, work with write
strongly-linearizable ones. In other words, there are cases where
linearizability is not sufficient but write strong-linearizability is. In
contrast to the impossibility result mentioned above, we prove that write
strongly-linearizable MWMR registers are implementable from SWMR registers.
Achieving write strong-linearizability, however, is harder than achieving just
linearizability: we give a simple implementation of MWMR registers from SWMR
registers and we prove that this implementation is linearizable but not write
strongly-linearizable. Finally, we prove that any linearizable implementation
of SWMR registers is necessarily write strongly-linearizable; this holds for
shared-memory, message-passing, and hybrid systems.

methods widely used in practice and implemented as part of standard software
packages for statistical learning. Nevertheless, their convergence is generally
not well understood and so far their good practical performance has not been
explained by existing convergence analyses. In this work, we introduce a new
block coordinate method that applies to the general class of variational
inequality (VI) problems with monotone operators. This class includes composite
convex optimization problems and convex-concave min-max optimization problems
as special cases and has not been addressed by the existing work. The resulting
convergence bounds match the optimal convergence bounds of full gradient
methods, but are provided in terms of a novel gradient Lipschitz condition
w.r.t.~a Mahalanobis norm. For $m$ coordinate blocks, the resulting gradient
Lipschitz constant in our bounds is never larger than a factor $\sqrt{m}$
compared to the traditional Euclidean Lipschitz constant, while it is possible
for it to be much smaller. Further, for the case when the operator in the VI
has finite-sum structure, we propose a variance reduced variant of our method
which further decreases the per-iteration cost and has better convergence rates
in certain regimes. To obtain these results, we use a gradient extrapolation

relevant for multiple inversion problems as the same informed subspace can be
reused. The proposed approach allows controlling the approximation error (in

sampling strategies that exploit the informed subspace to draw efficiently
samples from the exact posterior distribution. The method is successfully
illustrated on two numerical examples: a PDE-based inverse problem with a

classical electromagnetic theory of such structured light beams and pulses have
advanced significantly over the last two decades. However, a framework for the
quantum density of spin and OAM for single-photons remains elusive. Here, we
develop a theoretical framework and put forth the concept of quantum structured
light for space-time wavepackets at the single-photon level. Our work marks a
paradigm shift beyond scalar-field theory as well as the paraxial approximation
and can be utilized to study the quantum properties of the spin and OAM of all
classes of twisted quantum light pulses. We capture the uncertainty in full
three-dimensional (3D) projections of vector spin demonstrating their quantum
behavior beyond the conventional concept of classical polarization. Even in
laser beams with high OAM along the propagation direction, we predict the
existence of large OAM quantum fluctuations in the transverse plane which can
be verified experimentally. We show that the spin density generates modulated
helical texture beyond the paraxial limit and exhibits distinct statistics for
Fock-state vs. coherent-state twisted pulses. We introduce the quantum
correlator of photon spin density to characterize the nonlocal spin noise
providing a rigorous parallel with fermionic spin noise operators. Our work

density map is generated for each image frame using a Deep Neural Network, from
where a binary occupancy map is obtained aiming to overestimate the people's

makes it even harder to estimate the depth near the edge with sudden depth

the robot to understand the crowd and perform proactive and foresighted
behaviors. Deep reinforcement learning is a promising solution to this problem.
However, most previous learning methods incur a tremendous computational
burden. To address these problems, we propose a graph-based deep reinforcement
learning method, SG-DQN, that (i) introduces a social attention mechanism to
extract an efficient graph representation for the crowd-robot state; (ii)
directly evaluates the coarse q-values of the raw state with a learned dueling
deep Q network(DQN); and then (iii) refines the coarse q-values via online
planning on possible future trajectories. The experimental results indicate
that our model can help the robot better understand the crowd and achieve a
high success rate of more than 0.99 in the crowd navigation task. Compared
against previous state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm achieves an
equivalent, if not better, performance while requiring less than half of the
computational cost.

detection of many thoracic diseases. Over the past decade, deep learning, with
a focus on the convolutional neural network (CNN), has become the most powerful
computer-aided diagnosis technology for improving disease identification
performance. However, training an effective and robust deep CNN usually
requires a large amount of data with high annotation quality. For chest X-ray
imaging, annotating large-scale data requires professional domain knowledge and
is time-consuming. Thus, existing public chest X-ray datasets usually adopt
language pattern based methods to automatically mine labels from reports.
However, this results in label uncertainty and inconsistency. In this paper, we
propose many-to-one distribution learning (MODL) and K-nearest neighbor
smoothing (KNNS) methods from two perspectives to improve a single model's
disease identification performance, rather than focusing on an ensemble of
models. MODL integrates multiple models to obtain a soft label distribution for
optimizing the single target model, which can reduce the effects of original
label uncertainty. Moreover, KNNS aims to enhance the robustness of the target
model to provide consistent predictions on images with similar medical
findings. Extensive experiments on the public NIH Chest X-ray and CheXpert
datasets show that our model achieves consistent improvements over the
state-of-the-art methods.

effect, where SC is created by the nonequilibrium spin density, our predicted
spin-polarized current is from direct interactions between light and unique

photocurrent in a prototypical Rashba ferroelectric, {\alpha}-GeTe. The
photo-induced SC is about two orders of magnitude larger than the charge
photocurrent. More importantly, we can conveniently switch the direction of SC
by an applied electric field via inverting the spin textures. These predictions
give hope to generating and controlling light-driven SC via nonvolatile

model is a prevalent approach in multiple scientific domains. A common task is
to infer the underlying tree structure, given only observations of its terminal
nodes. Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which
limits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common
approach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two
steps. First, recover the structure separately of multiple, possibly random
subsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a
full tree. Here, we develop Spectral Top-Down Recovery (STDR), a deterministic
divide-and-conquer approach to infer large latent tree models. Unlike previous
methods, STDR partitions the terminal nodes in a non random way, based on the
Fiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed nodes. We
prove that under certain conditions, this partitioning is consistent with the
tree structure. This, in turn, leads to a significantly simpler merging
procedure of the small subtrees. We prove that STDR is statistically consistent
and bound the number of samples required to accurately recover the tree with
high probability. Using simulated data from several common tree models in
phylogenetics, we demonstrate that STDR has a significant advantage in terms of
runtime, with improved or similar accuracy.

what factors might be driving any perceived changes. This study contributes to
this debate by addressing two questions: (1) what factors are most predictive

This work starts with a physically-based conceptual model of the necessary

those conditions are met. Logistic regression is applied to the historical
flood record to determine which combination of hydroclimatic and riverine
factors best predict IJFs and the uncertainty in those relationships given the

and is not closely related to IJF occurrence. The best logistic regression
model is forced with downscaled climate change scenarios from multiple climate
models to project IJF frequency for a variety of plausible futures. Parametric
uncertainty in the best logistic regression model is propagated into the
projections using a parametric bootstrap to sample many plausible statistical
models. Although there is variability across emissions scenarios and climate
models, all projections indicate that the frequency of Peace River IJFs is
likely to decrease substantially in the coming decades, and that average

statistical model of COVID-19 spread, which could help in the global fight
against the virus. We propose a clustering-segmented autoregressive sigmoid
(CSAS) model to explore the space-time pattern of the log-transformed
infectious count. Four key characteristics are included in this CSAS model,
including unknown clusters, change points, stretched S-curves, and
autoregressive terms, in order to understand how this outbreak is spreading in
time and in space, to understand how the spread is affected by epidemic control
strategies, and to apply the model to updated data from an extended period of
time. We propose a nonparametric graph-based clustering method for discovering
dissimilarity of the curve time series in space, which is justified with
theoretical support to demonstrate how the model works under mild and easily
verified conditions. We propose a very strict purity score that penalizes
overestimation of clusters. Simulations show that our nonparametric graph-based
clustering method is faster and more accurate than the parametric clustering
method regardless of the size of data sets. We provide a Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) to identify multiple change points and calculate a confidence
interval for a mean response. By applying the CSAS model to the collected data,
we can explain the differences between prevention and control policies in China

almost all experimental results related to the micro-world, and has made a
number of predictions for previously unseen particles, most notably the Higgs
scalar boson, that were subsequently discovered. As a result, the SM is
currently universally accepted as the theory of the fundamental particles and
their interactions. However, in spite of its numerous successes, the SM has a
number of apparent shortcomings including: many free parameters that must be
supplied by experimental measurements; no mechanism to produce the dominance of
matter over antimatter in the universe; and no explanations for gravity, the
dark matter in the universe, neutrino masses, the number of particle
generations, etc. Because of these shortcomings, there is considerable
incentive to search for evidence for new, non-SM physics phenomena that might
provide important clues about what a new, beyond the SM theory (BSM) might look
like. Although the center-of-mass energies that BESIII can access are far below
the energy frontier, searches for new, BSM physics are an important component
of its research program. Here we describe ways that BESIII looks for signs of
BSM physics by measuring rates for processes that the SM predicts to be
forbidden or very rare, searching for non-SM particles such as dark photons,
making precision tests of SM predictions, and looking for violations of the
discrete symmetries $C$ and $CP$ in processes for which the SM-expectations are
immeasurably small.

In particular, a micromechanical system offers a great platform to investigate
such non-equilibrium dynamics under measurement-feedback control owing to its
precise controllability of small fluctuations. Although various types of
measurement-feedback protocols have been demonstrated with linear observables
(e.g., displacement and velocity), extending them to the nonlinear regime,
i.e., utilizing nonlinear observables in both measurement and control, retains
non-trivial phenomena in its non-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we demonstrate
measurement-feedback control of a micromechanical resonator by driving the
second-order nonlinearity (i.e., parametric squeezing) and directly measuring
quadratic observables, which are given by the Schwinger representation of
pseudo angular momentum (referred as Schwinger angular momentum). In contrast
to that the parametric divergence occurs when the second-order nonlinearity is
blindly driven, our measurement-feedback protocol enables us to avoid such a
divergence and to achieve a strong noise reduction at the level of $-5.1\pm
0.2$ dB. This strong noise reduction originates in the effective cooling
included in our measurement-feedback protocol, which is unveiled by
investigating entropy production rates in a coarse-grained model. Our results
open up the possibility of not only improving noise-limited sensitivity

recorded data are mapped to spin-glass models with pairwise interactions.
Considering the parameter space of the model, the observed system is generally
near a critical state between two distinct phases. The close proximity to the
criticality is found to be robust against different ways of sampling and
segmentation of the measured data. By independently altering the coupling
distribution and the network structure of the statistical model, the network
structures are found to be vital to maintain the proximity to the critical
state. We further find the observed assignment of the coupling strengths makes
the net coupling at each site more balanced with slight variation, which likely
helps the maintenance of the critical state. Network analysis on the
connectivity obtained by thresholding the coupling strengths find the
connectivity of the networks to be well described by a random network model.
These results are consistent across different experiments, sampling and

  on-the-fly variable SIMD vector-length","Selected in ICASSP 2021 Conference",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Over the last decade the relative latency of access to shared memory by
multicore increased as wire resistance dominated latency and low wire density
layout pushed multiport memories farther away from their ports. Various
techniques were deployed to improve average memory access latencies, such as
speculative pre-fetching and branch-prediction, often leading to high variance
in execution time which is unacceptable in real time systems. Smart DMAs can be
used to directly copy data into a layer1 SRAM, but with overhead. The VLIW
architecture, the de facto signal processing engine, suffers badly from a
breakdown in lockstep execution of scalar and vector instructions. We describe
the Split Latency Adaptive Pipeline (SLAP) VLIW architecture, a cache
performance improvement technology that requires zero change to object code,
while removing smart DMAs and their overhead. SLAP builds on the Decoupled
Access and Execute concept by 1) breaking lockstep execution of functional
units, 2) enabling variable vector length for variable data level parallelism,
and 3) adding a novel triangular load mechanism. We discuss the SLAP
architecture and demonstrate the performance benefits on real traces from a
wireless baseband system (where even the most compute intensive functions
suffer from an Amdahls law limitation due to a mixture of scalar and vector
processing).

each item individually, so as to better model the intra-list positional biases
and item relations. In order to deal with the enormous combinatorial space of
slates, recent work considers a generative solution so that a slate
distribution can be directly modeled. However, we observe that such approaches
-- despite their proved effectiveness in computer vision -- suffer from a
trade-off dilemma in recommender systems: when focusing on reconstruction, they
easily over-fit the data and hardly generate satisfactory recommendations; on
the other hand, when focusing on satisfying the user interests, they get
trapped in a few items and fail to cover the item variation in slates. In this
paper, we propose to enhance the accuracy-based evaluation with slate variation
metrics to estimate the stochastic behavior of generative models. We illustrate
that instead of reaching to one of the two undesirable extreme cases in the
dilemma, a valid generative solution resides in a narrow ""elbow"" region in
between. And we show that item perturbation can enforce slate variation and
mitigate the over-concentration of generated slates, which expand the ""elbow""
performance to an easy-to-find region. We further propose to separate a pivot
selection phase from the generation process so that the model can apply
perturbation before generation. Empirical results show that this simple
modification can provide even better variance with the same level of accuracy
compared to post-generation perturbation methods.

control problems. Due to the existence of state constraints, optimization-based
RHC often suffers the notorious issue of infeasibility, which strongly shrinks
the region of controllable state. This paper proposes a generalized control
barrier function (CBF) to enlarge the feasible region of constrained RHC with
only a one-step constraint on the prediction horizon. This design can reduce
the constrained steps by penalizing the tendency to move towards the constraint
boundary. Additionally, generalized CBF is able to handle high-order equality
or inequality constraints through extending the constrained step to nonadjacent
nodes. We apply this technique on an automated vehicle control task. The
results show that compared to multi-step pointwise constraints, generalized CBF
can effectively avoid the infeasibility issue in a larger partition of the
state space, and the computing efficiency is also improved by 14%-23%.

learns to complete each activity and set optimal thermal settings for maximum

interventions proportional to the last principal component, which focus on
local disagreement. A welfare-maximizing planner optimally works to reduce
local disagreement, bringing the ideal points of neighbors closer together,

to decrease welfare. Such welfare-maximizing/minimizing interventions are very
different from ones that would be done to change some traditional measures of
discord, such as the cross-sectional variation of equilibrium actions. In fact,
an adversary sowing disagreement to maximize her impact on welfare will
minimize her impact on global variation in equilibrium actions, underscoring a
tension between improving welfare and increasing global cohesion of equilibrium

replication to ensure data access to clients over a distributed setting. We
develop, for the first time, an erasure coding-based algorithm called CausalEC
that ensures causal consistency for a collection of read-write objects stored
in a distributed set of nodes over an asynchronous message-passing system.
CausalEC can use an arbitrary linear erasure code for data storage and ensures
liveness, fault-tolerance, and storage properties prescribed by the erasure
code.
  CausalEC retains a key benefit of previous replication-based algorithms -
every write operation is ""local"", that is, a server performs only local actions
before returning to a client that issued a write operation. For servers that
store certain objects in an uncoded manner, read operations to those objects
also return locally. In general, a read operation to an object can be returned
by a server on contacting a small subset of other servers so long as the
underlying erasure code allows for the object to be decoded from that subset.
Notably, unlike previous consistent erasure coding-based algorithms, CausalEC
is compatible with cross-object erasure coding, where nodes encode values
across multiple objects. CausalEC navigates the technical challenges of
cross-object erasure coding, in particular, pertaining to re-encoding when
writes update the values and ensuring that concurrent reads are served in a
non-blocking manner during the transition to storing codeword symbols
corresponding to the updated values.

exotic quantum phases. A recent manifestation of this is the unexpected
observation of magnetic quantum oscillations and metallic thermal transport,
both properties of systems with Fermi surfaces of itinerant quasiparticles, in
the Kondo insulators SmB6 and YbB$_{12}$. To understand these phenomena, it is
informative to study their evolution as the energy gap of the Kondo-Insulator
state is closed by a large magnetic field. We show here that both the
quantum-oscillation frequency and the cyclotron mass display a strong field
dependence in the resulting high-field metallic state in $_{12}$. By tracking
the Fermi-surface area, we conclude that the same quasiparticle band gives rise
to the quantum oscillations in both insulating and metallic states. These data
are understood most simply using a two-fluid picture where unusual
quasiparticles, contributing little or nothing to charge transport, coexist
with conventional fermions. In the metallic state this leads to a heavy-fermion
bad metal with negligible magnetoresistance, relatively high resistivity and a
very large Kadowaki-Woods ratio, underlining the exotic nature of the fermion

synthesized visual features without corresponding training samples in zero-shot

to tackle the problem. The approach consists of three parts, class knowledge
overlay, semi-supervised learning and triplet loss. It applies class knowledge
overlay (CKO) to obtain knowledge not only from the corresponding class but
also from other classes that have the knowledge overlay. It ensures that the
knowledge-to-visual learning process has adequate information to generate
synthesized visual features. The approach also applies a semi-supervised

reinforcing synthesized visual features generation as well as new category

image processing applications. As such, CNNs require fast runtime (forward
propagation) to process high-resolution visual streams in real time. This is
still a challenging task even with state-of-the-art graphics and tensor
processing units. The bottleneck in computational efficiency primarily occurs
in the convolutional layers. Performing operations in the Fourier domain is a
promising way to accelerate forward propagation since it transforms
convolutions into elementwise multiplications, which are considerably faster to
compute for large kernels. Furthermore, such computation could be implemented
using an optical 4f system with orders of magnitude faster operation. However,
a major challenge in using this spectral approach, as well as in an optical
implementation of CNNs, is the inclusion of a nonlinearity between each
convolutional layer, without which CNN performance drops dramatically. Here, we
propose a Spectral CNN Linear Counterpart (SCLC) network architecture and
develop a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach to circumvent the need for a
nonlinearity and successfully train such networks. While the KD approach is
known in machine learning as an effective process for network pruning, we adapt
the approach to transfer the knowledge from a nonlinear network (teacher) to a
linear counterpart (student). We show that the KD approach can achieve
performance that easily surpasses the standard linear version of a CNN and
could approach the performance of the nonlinear network. Our simulations show
that the possibility of increasing the resolution of the input image allows our
proposed 4f optical linear network to perform more efficiently than a nonlinear
network with the same accuracy on two fundamental image processing tasks: (i)
object classification and (ii) semantic segmentation.

addition, it requires that the Dirac points lie close to the Fermi level
allowing to dictate the macroscopic physical properties. Although the material
realization of nodal line semimetals have been theoretically predicted in
numerous compounds, only a few of them have been experimentally verified and
the realization of a genuine nodal line semimetal is particularly rare. Here we
report the realization of a genuine nodal line semimetal in LaSbTe. We
investigated the electronic structure of LaSbTe by band structure calculations
and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements. Taking spin-orbit
coupling into account, our band structure calculations predict that a nodal
line is formed in the boundary surface of the Brillouin zone which is robust
and lies close to the Fermi level. The Dirac nodes along the X-R line in
momentum space are directly observed in our ARPES measurements and the energies
of these Dirac nodes are all close to the Fermi level. These results constitute

index. The strongest flaring activity is found to be in one distinctive HR with
an extremely low HSP compliance of 41% as compared to the mean and standard
deviation of 62% and 7%, respectively, over all HRs. This sole HR shows an
anti-HSP (i.e., less than 50%) and includes the highly flare-productive AR NOAA
12673, however this AR is not uniquely responsible for the HR's low HSP. We
also find that all HRs with the highest flaring activity are located in the

These findings point to the presence of localized regions of the convection

higher flaring rate to some rising magnetic flux tubes.

One of the reasons for the lack of interpretability is random weight

deep multilayer perceptron, which is the most general architecture of NNs,
based on identity initialization (namely, initialization using identity
matrices). The proposed method allows us to analyze the contribution of each
neuron to classification and class likelihood in each hidden layer. As a
property of the identity-initialized perceptron, the weight matrices remain
near the identity matrices even after learning. This property enables us to
treat the change of features from the input to each hidden layer as the
contribution to classification. Furthermore, we can separate the output of each
hidden layer into a contribution map that depicts the contribution to
classification and class likelihood, by adding extra dimensions to each layer
according to the number of classes, thereby allowing the calculation of the
recognition accuracy in each layer and thus revealing the roles of independent

CME flux rope arising from an unwinding blowout jet in a multipolar complex
magnetic system. Based on a multi-band observational analysis, we find that
this whole event starts with a small filament whose eruption occurs at a
coronal geyser site after a series of homologous jets. Aided by magnetic field
extrapolations, it reveals that the coronal geyser site forms above an elongate
opposite-polarity interface, where the emergence-driven photospheric flux
cancellation and repetitive reconnection are responsible for those preceding
recurrent jets and also contribute to the ultimate filament destabilization. By
interacting with overlying fields, the erupting filament breaks one of its legs
and results in an unwinding blowout jet. Our estimation suggests that around
1.4$-$2.0 turns of twist release in its jet spire. This prominent twist
transport in jet spire rapidly creates a newborn larger-scale flux rope from
the jet base to a remote site. Soon after its formation, this large-scale flux
rope erupts towards the outer coronae causing an Earth-directed CME. In its
source region, two sets of distinct post-flare loops form in succession,
indicating this eruption involves two-stage of flare magnetic reconnection.
This work not only reveals a real magnetic coupling process between different

formation in disc galaxies. We investigate the potential physical connection
between the growth of dispersion-supported stellar structures (e.g. classical
bulges) and the position of galaxies on the star-forming main sequence at
$z\sim0$. Combining the might of the SAMI and MaNGA galaxy surveys, we measure
the $\lambda_{Re}$ spin parameter for 3781 galaxies over $9.5 < \log M_{\star}
[\rm{M}_{\odot}] < 12$. At all stellar masses, galaxies at the locus of the
main sequence possess $\lambda_{Re}$ values indicative of intrinsically
flattened discs. However, above $\log M_{\star}[\rm{M}_{\odot}]\sim10.5$ where
the main sequence starts bending, we find tantalising evidence for an increase
in the number of galaxies with dispersion-supported structures, perhaps
suggesting a connection between bulges and the bending of the main sequence.
Moving above the main sequence, we see no evidence of any change in the typical
spin parameter in galaxies once gravitationally-interacting systems are
excluded from the sample. Similarly, up to 1 dex below the main sequence,
$\lambda_{Re}$ remains roughly constant and only at very high stellar masses
($\log M_{\star}[\rm{M}_{\odot}]>11$), do we see a rapid decrease in
$\lambda_{Re}$ once galaxies decline in star formation activity. If this trend
is confirmed, it would be indicative of different quenching mechanisms acting
on high- and low-mass galaxies. The results suggest that while a population of
galaxies possessing some dispersion-supported structure is already present on
the star-forming main sequence, further growth would be required after the
galaxy has quenched to match the kinematic properties observed in passive
galaxies at $z\sim0$.

Economics and Computer Science. GS belongs to the hierarchy of {\em complement
free} valuations introduced by Lehmann, Lehmann and Nisan, along with other
prominent classes: $GS \subsetneq Submodular \subsetneq XOS \subsetneq
Subadditive$. The GS class has always been more enigmatic than its counterpart
classes, both in its definition and in its relation to the other classes. For
example, while it is well understood how closely the Submodular, XOS and
Subadditive classes (point-wise) approximate one another, approximability of
these classes by GS remained wide open.
  Our main result is the existence of a submodular valuation (one that is also
budget additive) that cannot be approximated by GS within a ratio better than
$\Omega(\frac{\log m}{\log\log m})$, where $m$ is the number of items. En
route, we uncover a new symmetrization operation that preserves GS, which may
be of independent interest.
  We show that our main result is tight with respect to budget additive
valuations. Additionally, for a class of submodular functions that we refer to
as {\em concave of Rado} valuations (this class greatly extends budget additive
valuations), we show approximability by GS within an $O(\log^2m)$ factor.

unified variational ansatz with up to two particle-hole(p-h)
excitations(V-2ph). We confirm the existence of a first-order transition in 3D
and 2D Fermi polarons, and show that the nature of such transition lies in an
energy competition between systems with different momenta ${\mathbf Q}=0$ and
$|{\mathbf Q}|=k_F$, here ${\mathbf Q}$ is defined as the momentum of Fermi
polaron system with respect to the Fermi sea of majority fermions (with Fermi
momentum $k_F$). The literally proposed molecule ansatz is identified as an
asymptotic limit of $|{\mathbf Q}|=k_F$ state in strong coupling regime, which
implies a huge $SO(3)$(for 3D) or $SO(2)$ (for 2D) ground state degeneracy in
this regime. The recognization of such degeneracy is crucially important for
evaluating the molecule occupation in realistic systems with finite impurity
density and at finite temperature. To compare with recent experiment of 3D
Fermi polarons, we have calculated various physical quantities under the V-2ph
framework and obtained results that are in good agreements with experimental
data in the weak coupling and near resonance regime. Further, to check the
validity of our conclusion in 2D, we have adopted a different variational
method based on the Gaussian sample of high-order p-h excitations(V-Gph), and
found the same conclusion on the nature of polaron-molecule transition therein.
For 1D system, the V-2ph method predicts no sharp transition and the ground
state is always at ${\mathbf Q}=0$ sector, consistent with exact Bethe ansatz
solution. The presence/absence of polaron-molecule transition is analyzed to be
closely related to the interplay effect of Pauli-blocking and p-h excitations
in different dimensions.

mechanisms of random forests. Although the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is
widely accepted as the most efficient variable importance measure for random
forests, little is known about its statistical properties. In fact, the
definition of MDA varies across the main random forest software. In this
article, our objective is to rigorously analyze the behavior of the main MDA
implementations. Consequently, we mathematically formalize the various
implemented MDA algorithms, and then establish their limits when the sample
size increases. This asymptotic analysis reveals that these MDA versions differ
as importance measures, since they converge towards different quantities. More
importantly, we break down these limits into three components: the first two
terms are related to Sobol indices, which are well-defined measures of a
covariate contribution to the response variance, widely used in the sensitivity
analysis field, as opposed to the third term, whose value increases with
dependence within covariates. Thus, we theoretically demonstrate that the MDA
does not target the right quantity to detect influential covariates in a
dependent setting, a fact that has already been noticed experimentally. To
address this issue, we define a new importance measure for random forests, the
Sobol-MDA, which fixes the flaws of the original MDA, and consistently
estimates the accuracy decrease of the forest retrained without a given
covariate, but with an efficient computational cost. The Sobol-MDA empirically
outperforms its competitors on both simulated and real data for variable
selection. An open source implementation in R and C++ is available online.

The diffusion of volatile species on amorphous solid water ice
affects the chemistry on dust grains in the interstellar medium as well as the
trapping of gases enriching planetary atmospheres or present in cometary
material.
  Aims. The aim of the work is to provide diffusion coefficients of CH$_4$ on
amorphous solid water (ASW), and to understand how they are affected by the ASW
structure.
  Methods. Ice mixtures of H$_2$O and CH$_4$ were grown in different conditions
and the sublimation of CH$_4$ was monitored via infrared spectroscopy or via
the mass loss of a cryogenic quartz crystal microbalance. Diffusion
coefficients were obtained from the experimental data assuming the systems obey
Fick's law of diffusion. Monte Carlo simulations modeled the different
amorphous solid water ice structures investigated and were used to reproduce
and interpret the experimental results.
  Results. Diffusion coefficients of methane on amorphous solid water have been
measured to be between 10$^{-12}$ and 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for
temperatures ranging between 42 K and 60 K. We showed that diffusion can differ
by one order of magnitude depending on the morphology of amorphous solid water.
The porosity within water ice, and the network created by pore coalescence,
enhance the diffusion of species within the pores.The diffusion rates derived
experimentally cannot be used in our Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the
measurements.
  Conclusions. We conclude that Fick's law can be used to describe diffusion at
the macroscopic scale, while Monte Carlo simulations describe the microscopic

potential technique to enhance the spectral efficiency in the sixth-generation

that are assigned to different clusters of users served by non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA), at the expense of additional interference. In this
paper, we analyze the performance of D-OMA in the uplink and develop a
multi-objective optimization framework to maximize the uplink energy efficiency
(EE) in a multi-access point (AP) network enabled by D-OMA. Specifically, we
optimize the sub-channel and transmit power allocations of the users as well as
the overlapping percentage of the spectrum between the adjacent sub-channels.
The formulated problem is a mixed binary non-linear programming problem.
Therefore, to address the challenge we first transform the problem into a
single-objective problem using Tchebycheff method. Then, we apply the monotonic
optimization (MO) to explore the hidden monotonicity of the objective function
and constraints, and reformulate the problem into a standard MO in canonical
form. The reformulated problem is then solved by applying the outer polyblock
approximation method. Our numerical results show that D-OMA outperforms the
conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA) when the adjacent sub-channel overlap and
scheduling are optimized jointly.

cross modality mapping has attracted growing attention in the computer vision
community. Existing methods usually formulate the mapping function as the
similarity measure between the pair of instance features, which are embedded to
a common space. However, we observe that the relationships among the instances
within a single modality (intra relations) and those between the pair of
heterogeneous instances (inter relations) are insufficiently explored in
previous approaches. Motivated by this, we redefine the mapping function with
relational reasoning via graph modeling, and further propose a GCN-based
Relational Reasoning Network (RR-Net) in which inter and intra relations are
efficiently computed to universally resolve the cross modality mapping problem.
Concretely, we first construct two kinds of graph, i.e., Intra Graph and Inter
Graph, to respectively model intra relations and inter relations. Then RR-Net
updates all the node features and edge features in an iterative manner for
learning intra and inter relations simultaneously. Last, RR-Net outputs the
probabilities over the edges which link a pair of heterogeneous instances to
estimate the mapping results. Extensive experiments on three example tasks,
i.e., image classification, social recommendation and sound recognition,
clearly demonstrate the superiority and universality of our proposed model.

phase errors arising from limited quantization levels as well as hardware
impairments at the RIS elements is also discussed. First, the composite channel
containing the direct path plus the product of reflected channels through the
RIS is characterized. Then, the distribution of the received signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is matched to a Gamma random variable whose parameters depend on
the total number of RIS elements, phase errors and the channels' path loss.
Next, by considering the FBL regime, the achievable rate expression and error
probability are identified and the corresponding average rate and average error
probability are elaborated based on the proposed SNR distribution. Furthermore,
the impact of the presence of phase error due to either limited quantization
levels or hardware impairments on the average rate and error probability is
discussed. The numerical results show that Monte Carlo simulations conform to
matched Gamma distribution to received SNR for sufficiently large number of RIS

between Shannon capacity and achievable rate in FBL regime is also discussed.
Additionally, the required number of RIS elements to achieve a desired error

achieving decentralization, security, and scalability in traditional blockchain
systems, which are implemented as replicated state machines relying on atomic
broadcast for consensus on an immutable chain of valid transactions. Sharding
is to be understood broadly as techniques for dynamically partitioning nodes in
a blockchain system into subsets (shards) that perform storage, communication,
and computation tasks without fine-grained synchronization with each other.
Despite much recent research on sharding blockchains, much remains to be
explored in the design space of these systems. Towards that aim, we conduct a
systematic analysis of existing sharding blockchain systems and derive a
conceptual decomposition of their architecture into functional components and
the underlying assumptions about system models and attackers they are built on.
The functional components identified are node selection, epoch randomness, node
assignment, intra-shard consensus, cross-shard transaction processing, shard
reconfiguration, and motivation mechanism. We describe interfaces,
functionality, and properties of each component and show how they compose into
a sharding blockchain system. For each component, we systematically review
existing approaches, identify potential and open problems, and propose future
research directions. We focus on potential security attacks and performance
problems, including system throughput and latency concerns such as confirmation
delays. We believe our modular architectural decomposition and in-depth
analysis of each component, based on a comprehensive literature study, provides
a systematic basis for conceptualizing state-of-the-art sharding blockchain
systems, proving or improving security and performance properties of
components, and developing new sharding blockchain system designs.

entrancing big data owners by offering convenient and real-time search
solutions to them. However, the problem is that individuals and organizations
possessing confidential big data are hesitant to embrace such services due to
valid data privacy concerns. In addition, to offer an intelligent search, these
services access the user search history that further jeopardizes his/her
privacy. To overcome the privacy problem, the main idea of this research is to
separate the intelligence aspect of the search from its pattern matching
aspect. According to this idea, the search intelligence is provided by an
on-premises edge tier and the shared cloud tier only serves as an exhaustive
pattern matching search utility. We propose Smartness At Edge (SAED mechanism
that offers intelligence in the form of semantic and personalized search at the
edge tier while maintaining privacy of the search on the cloud tier. At the
edge tier, SAED uses a knowledge-based lexical database to expand the query and
cover its semantics. SAED personalizes the search via an RNN model that can
learn the user interest. A word embedding model is used to retrieve documents
based on their semantic relevance to the search query. SAED is generic and can
be plugged into existing enterprise search systems and enable them to offer
intelligent and privacy-preserving search without enforcing any change on them.
Evaluation results on two enterprise search systems under real settings and
verified by human users demonstrate that SAED can improve the relevancy of the
retrieved results by on average 24% for plain-text and 75% for encrypted
generic datasets.

dominant morphological type and increase their SMD by $\sim 2.5$ times, while
by contrast, the pure-disk population significantly decreases by $\sim 85\%$.
According to the evolution of both high- and low-mass ends of the SMF, we find
that mergers and in-situ evolution in disks are both present at $z < 1$, and
conclude that double-component galaxies are predominantly being built by the
in-situ evolution in disks (apparent as the growth of the low-mass end with
time), while mergers are likely responsible for the growth of ellipticals
(apparent as the increase of intermediate/high-mass end).

on the recently developed notion of optimal weak transport of mass by Gozlanet
al. (2017) and Backhoff-Veraguas et al. (2020). We provide a theoretical
analysis of this object and discuss its interpretation in the light of convex

averaging the input distributions in a geometric way (as the Wasserstein
barycenter based on classic optimal transport does) weak barycenters extract
common geometric information shared by all the input distributions, encoded as
a latent random variable that underlies all of them. We also provide an
iterative algorithm to compute a weak barycenter for a finite family of input
distributions, and a stochastic algorithm that computes them for arbitrary
populations of laws. The latter approach is particularly well suited for the
streaming setting, i.e., when distributions are observed sequentially. The
notion of weak barycenter and our approaches to compute it are illustrated on
synthetic examples, validated on 2D real-world data and compared to standard

theoretical and computational methods. The most sophisticated method is the ab

equations in a common spatial resolution. This enables us to explore such

electronic motion in the energy band in a unified manner. We also utilize a

the HHG signals are the strongest in films with thicknesses of 2-15 nm, which
is determined by the bulk conductivity of silicon. We also find that the HHG
signals in the reflected and transmitted pulses are identical in such thin

found to correlate with the magnitude of the electric field at the front (back)

governing equations of a power-law fluid and its depth-averaged hyperbolic
simplification. Conditions of roll waves existence for these models are
formulated in terms of Whitham criterion. Numerical calculations of the free
surface evolution and the roll waves development are performed. It is shown
that the roll waves amplitude obtained by the 2D equations is slightly larger

with sliced wavelengths and Bragg edge imaging of the steel sample. A spatial
resolution of 57 {\mu}m was obtained for neutron imaging by using the

the measured wavelength spectrum was identical to that measured by a beam

there is a lack of similar discussion surrounding ethical aspects of doing so.
As students are in a subordinate relationship to their instructors, such a
discussion is needed. Objective: We aim to increase the understanding of
practices and perceptions SE researchers have of ethical issues with student
participation in empirical studies. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping
study of 372 empirical SE studies involving students, following up with a
survey answered by 100 SE researchers regarding their current practices and
opinions regarding student participation. Results: The mapping study shows that
the majority of studies does not report conditions regarding recruitment,
voluntariness, compensation, and ethics approval. In contrast, the majority of
survey participants supports reporting these conditions. The survey further
reveals that less than half of the participants require ethics approval.
Additionally, the majority of participants recruit their own students on a
voluntary basis, and use informed consent with withdrawal options. There is
disagreement among the participants whether course instructors should be
involved in research studies and if should know who participates in a study.
Conclusions: It is a positive sign that mandatory participation is rare, and
that informed consent and withdrawal options are standard. However, we see
immediate need for action, as study conditions are under-reported, and as
opinions on ethical practices differ widely. In particular, there is little
regard in SE on the power relationship between instructors and students.

investigated the evolution of the Weyl nodes and Fermi arcs with chemical

from broad-charmonium resonances has a surprisingly small effect on

cancellations, that can be traced back to the complete dominance of
semi-leptonic operator contributions for high $q^2$ -- at variance with low

potentially valuable probe of short-distance CP-violating effects in the very
same Wilson coefficients that are associated to current $b \to s$

form-factor uncertainties. Interestingly, high $q^2$ is the region where $B^0_s

The latent part of these covariates differ in their state dynamics and thus
capture smoothly evolving or abruptly changing coefficients. To determine which

concerns or needs are expressed in each tweet, known as the information type
(IT) classification task and 2) estimate how critical each tweet is with regard
to emergency response, known as the priority level prediction task. In this
paper, we describe our multi-task transfer learning approach for this
challenge. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art transformer models including
both encoder-based models such as BERT and a sequence-to-sequence based T5 for
joint transfer learning on the two tasks. Based on this approach, we submitted
several runs to the track. The returned evaluation results show that our runs

shows a $40\,\%$ linear decrease from the boundary towards the inside of the
coronal hole. At distances greater than \SI{20}{\arcsecond} ($\approx 15$\,Mm)

uniform. The coronal hole temperature may show a weak solar cycle dependency,

spin polarization is, in turn, intimately linked to the excitation light
polarization, the light polarization state can be determined by a simple
conductivity measurement. This effectively gives the GaAsN epilayer a chiral
photoconductivity capable of discriminating the handedness of an incident
excitation light in addition to its intensity. This approach, removing the need
of any optical elements in front of a non-chiral detector, could offer easier
integration and miniaturisation. This new chiral photodetector could

photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are still largely employed in the clinical
environment. A standard camera for full-body SPECT employs $\sim50$-100 PMTs of
4-8~cm diameter and is shielded by a thick layer of lead, becoming a heavy and
bulky system that can weight a few hundred kilograms. The volume, weight and
cost of a camera can be significantly reduced if the PMTs are replaced by
silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The main obstacle to use SiPMs in full-body
SPECT is the limited size of their sensitive area. A few thousand channels
would be needed to fill a camera if using the largest commercially-available
SiPMs of 6$\times$6~mm$^2$. As a solution, we propose to use Large-Area SiPM
Pixels (LASiPs), built by summing individual currents of several SiPMs into a
single output. We developed a LASiP prototype that has a sensitive area 8 times
larger than a 6$\times$6~mm$^2$ SiPM. We built a proof-of-concept micro-camera
consisting of a 40$\times$40$\times$8~mm$^3$ NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to 4
LASiPs. We evaluated its performance in a central region of
$15\times15$~mm$^2$, where we were able to reconstruct images of a $^{99m}$Tc
capillary with an intrinsic spatial resolution of $\sim2$~mm and an energy
resolution of $\sim11.6$\% at 140 keV. We used these measurements to validate
Geant4 simulations of the system. This can be extended to simulate a larger
camera with more and larger pixels, which could be used to optimize the
implementation of LASiPs in large SPECT cameras. We provide some guidelines

expensive to obtain. When time or budget restrictions prohibit the generation
of additional data, the amount of available samples may be too limited to
provide satisfactory model results. Multi-fidelity methods deal with such
problems by incorporating information from other sources, which are ideally
well-correlated with the high-fidelity data, but can be obtained at a lower
cost. By leveraging correlations between different data sets, multi-fidelity
methods often yield superior generalization when compared to models based
solely on a small amount of high-fidelity data. In this work, we present the
use of artificial neural networks applied to multi-fidelity regression
problems. By elaborating a few existing approaches, we propose new neural
network architectures for multi-fidelity regression. The introduced models are
compared against a traditional multi-fidelity scheme, co-kriging. A collection
of artificial benchmarks are presented to measure the performance of the
analyzed models. The results show that cross-validation in combination with
Bayesian optimization consistently leads to neural network models that
outperform the co-kriging scheme. Additionally, we show an application of
multi-fidelity regression to an engineering problem. The propagation of a
pressure wave into an acoustic horn with parametrized shape and frequency is
considered, and the index of reflection intensity is approximated using the
multi-fidelity models. A finite element model and a reduced basis model are
adopted as the high- and low-fidelity, respectively. It is shown that the
multi-fidelity neural network returns outputs that achieve a comparable
accuracy to those from the expensive, full-order model, using only very few
full-order evaluations combined with a larger amount of inaccurate but cheap
evaluations of a reduced order model.

methods rely on external sensors, such as GPS or motion capture systems, for
state estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this has not yet been achieved
with only onboard sensors. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that
combines fault-tolerant control and onboard vision-based state estimation to
achieve position control of a quadrotor subjected to complete failure of one
rotor. Experimental validations show that our approach is able to accurately
control the position of a quadrotor during a motor failure scenario, without
the aid of any external sensors. The primary challenge to vision-based state
estimation stems from the inevitable high-speed yaw rotation (over 20 rad/s) of
the damaged quadrotor, causing motion blur to cameras, which is detrimental to
visual inertial odometry (VIO). We compare two types of visual inputs to the
vision-based state estimation algorithm: standard frames and events.
Experimental results show the advantage of using an event camera especially in
low light environments due to its inherent high dynamic range and high temporal
resolution. We believe that our approach will render autonomous quadrotors
safer in both GPS denied or degraded environments. We release both our

emotional response of persons when using products and services. Indeed, the
emotional response of users is generally investigated by means of methods
(e.g., surveys) that are not effective for this purpose. In our view, Virtual

for the latter, even deliver them). In this paper, we first provide our

to the power and complexity problems of the modern microprocessors by keeping
their hardware simple. Moreover, they employ several runtime optimizations to
improve the performance. One of the most potent optimizations, vectorization,
has been utilized by modern microprocessors, to exploit the data level
parallelism through SIMD accelerators. Due to their hardware simplicity, these
accelerators have evolved in terms of width from 64-bit vectors in Intel MMX to
512-bit wide vector units in Intel Xeon Phi and AVX-512. Although SIMD
accelerators are simple in terms of hardware design, code generation for them
has always been a challenge. Moreover, increasing vector lengths with each new
generation add to this complexity.
  This paper explores the scalability of SIMD accelerators from the code
generation point of view. We discover that the SIMD accelerators remain
underutilized at higher vector lengths mainly due to: a) reduced dynamic
instruction stream coverage for vectorization and b) increase in permutations.
Both of these factors can be attributed to the rigidness of the SIMD
architecture. We propose a novel SIMD architecture that possesses the
flexibility needed to support higher vector lengths. Furthermore, we propose
Variable Length Vectorization and Selective Writing in a HW/SW co-designed
environment to transparently target the flexibility of the proposed

block Lanczos algorithm. We then approximate the resulting system by narrow
ladder models, which can be investigated using the density-matrix
renormalization group method. In the absence of any direct wire-wire hopping we
find that the substrate can mediate an effective wire-wire coupling so that the
wires could form an effective two-leg ladder with a Mott charge-density-wave
insulating ground state for arbitrarily small nearest-neighbor repulsion. In
other cases the wires remain effectively uncoupled even for strong
wire-substrate hybridizations leading to the possible stabilization of the
Luttinger liquid phase at finite nearest-neighbor repulsion as found previously
for single wires on substrates. These investigations show that it may be
difficult to determine under which conditions the physics of correlated
one-dimensional electrons can be realized in arrays of atomic wires on
semiconducting substrates because they seem to depend on the model (and
consequently material) particulars.

develop a hybrid design framework by incorporating a generalized hold device,

show that such a controller can always be obtained by designing a discrete-time
internal model, a discrete-time washout filter, and a discrete-time output
feedback stabilizer. As a result, the regulation errors are shown to be
globally exponentially convergent to zero, while the sampling period is fixed

for verification of the applicability of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)
model in its canonical version. The need for such verification stems from the
inconsistencies in the shock properties resulting from radio observations
compared to X-ray observations. Aims. In this article we aim to explore how the
presence of a second shock in the vicinity of a relic modifies the spectrum of
accelerated electrons and decipher which of the involved parameters can have a
significant impact on their shape. Methods. We analytically studied DSA of
cosmic rays in two stationary shocks aiming to investigate the change of the
distribution function. The latter eventually leads to spectrum slope deviations
visible in different observations and simulations that do not appear to be
explained by the case wherein cosmic rays interact with a single shock wave.
Results. We obtain a complex distribution function $f(x,p)$ depending on many
parameters (distance between two shocks, compression ratios, spatial diffusion
coefficients, injection value, etc.). This function reveals modifications that
occur because of the coupled acceleration in both shocks. Apparently,
deviations in the particle spectrum from the pure power law depend on a few
parameters such as $Q_{1}/Q_{2} $, $\kappa_{1}/\kappa_{2} $, $r_{1}/r_{2} $,
and $L$. Although we do not verify this idea by taking a particular cluster as
an example, we demonstrate a potential cause of spectral disturbances in radio
relics. In general terms, our findings appear to correlate with results from
the literature when the distance between the shocks is of the order of the
width of a radio relic and $\kappa_{1}/\kappa_{2} \propto 3$.

At last, we show that the binding energy of the Cooper pairs related to the
maximum amplitude of the $d-$ wave superconducting gap at the anti-nodes, does
not follow $T_c$ with pressure. It decreases while $T_c$ increases. In the
particular case of Hg-1201, the binding energy collapses from 10 to 2 $K_B T_c$
as the pressure increases up to 10 GPa. These direct spectroscopic observations
joined to the fact that the binding energy of the Cooper pairs at the

the optimization module which can gradually decrease the accumulative error in

arrangement in such a cluster. Irrespective of cluster size, the local
hysteresis response depends strongly on the corresponding dipolar field acted
on a nanoparticle. In a small k-mer, there is a wide variation in local
hysteresis as a function of nanoparticle position. On the other hand, the local
hysteresis is more uniform for larger k-mer, except for MNPs at the boundary.
In the case of superparamagnetic nanoparticle and weak dipolar interaction, the
local hysteresis loop area Ai is minimal and depends weakly on the k-mer size.
While for ferromagnetic counterpart, Ai is considerably large even for weakly
interacting MNPs. The value of Ai is found to be directly proportional to the
dipolar field acting on the nanoparticle. The dipolar interaction and k-mer
size also enhances the coercivity and remanence. There is always an increase in
Ai with clutser size and dipolar interaction strength. Similarly, the averaged
hysteresis loop area A also depends strongly on the k-mer size, particle size

Strikingly, we find that, in the case of large barrier potentials, the surface
states exhibit pronounced oscillations in the conductance when varying the
magnetic field, in the \textit{absence} of Landau levels or the Aharonov-Bohm
effect. These novel magnetic oscillations are attributed to the emergence of
\textit{super-resonant regimes} by tuning the magnetic field, in which almost
all propagating electrons cross the barrier with perfect transmission. In the
case of small and moderate barrier potentials, we also identify a positive
magnetoconductance which is due to the increase of the Fermi surface by tilting
the surface Dirac cone. Moreover, we show that for weak magnetic fields, the
conductance displays a shifted sinusoidal dependence on the field direction
with period $\pi$ and phase shift determined by the tilting direction with
respect to the field direction. Our predictions can be applied to many
topological insulators, such as HgTe and Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, and provide

associated with the presence of two pairs of high asymmetry regions. The first
pair of peaks with Galactic coordinates $(l, b) = (212^\circ, -21^\circ)$ and
$(32^\circ, 21^\circ)$ is associated with the Northern Galactic Spur and the
direction of the dipole modulation of the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropy.
The other pair ($(l, b)=(332^\circ, -8^\circ)$ and $(152^\circ, 8^\circ)$) is
located within the Galactic plane (the Galactic Cold Spot and its antipodal
partner). Similar asymmetric peaks, but with smaller amplitudes, belong to the
WMAP/Planck Cold Spot and its partner in the Northern Galactic Spur. These
local anomalies increase the odd-multipole power to a level consistent with
Gaussian simulations. In contrast, the deficit of symmetric peaks is
accompanied by a deficit in the even-multipole power and is the source of the
parity asymmetry of the CMB temperature maps at the level of about 3 sigma. We
also evaluate the influence of the quadrupole, which is another source of the
even-multipole deficit. If the low quadrupole is an intrinsic feature of the
theoretical model, it will reduce the significance of the parity asymmetry to
around the 2 sigma level. We also investigate the relationship between the
asymmetry of the power spectrum and the level of the parity asymmetry in the
framework of a model with dipole modulation of a statistically uniform Gaussian
signal. We show that these two anomalies are innately linked to each other.

concerning Bayesian methods, the principal alternative to NHST. We report on
recent work that builds on an approach to inference put forward over 70 years
ago to address the well-known ""Problem of Priors"" in Bayesian analysis, by
reversing the conventional prior-likelihood-posterior (""forward"") use of
Bayes's Theorem. Such Reverse-Bayes analysis allows priors to be deduced from
the likelihood by requiring that the posterior achieve a specified level of
credibility. We summarise the technical underpinning of this approach, and show
how it opens up new approaches to common inferential challenges, such as
assessing the credibility of scientific findings, setting them in appropriate

more insight from NHST while reducing the risk of misinterpretation. We argue
that Reverse-Bayes methods have a key role to play in making Bayesian methods
more accessible and attractive for evidence assessment and research synthesis.

repeated function evaluations as is the case in finite-difference methods.
Instead, a multiobjective trust region approach is used that works similarly to
its well-known scalar pendants. Local surrogate models constructed from

possible descent directions. In contrast to existing multiobjective trust
region algorithms, these surrogates are not polynomial but carefully
constructed radial basis function networks. This has the important advantage
that the number of data points scales linearly with the parameter space

Here we report findings from the search for new SNRs in the eROSITA all-sky
survey data which led to the detection of one of the largest SNRs discovered at
wavelengths other than the radio: G249.5+24.5. This source is located at a
relatively high Galactic latitude, where SNRs are not usually expected to be
found. The remnant, 'Hoinga', has a diameter of about 4.4 degrees and shows a
circular shaped morphology with diffuse X-ray emission filling almost the
entire remnant. Spectral analysis of the remnant emission reveals that an APEC
spectrum from collisionally ionised diffuse gas and a plane-parallel shock
plasma model with non-equilibrium ionisation are both able to provide an
adequate description of the data, suggesting a gas temperature of the order of
kT = 0.1 keV and an absorbing column density of N_H=3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2.

its radio emission in archival data from the Continuum HI Parkes All-Sky Survey

alpha=-0.69 +- 0.08 obtained from these data definitely confirms the SNR nature

different ML tasks, ranging from vision to keyboard predictions. In large-scale
deployments, client heterogeneity is a fact and constitutes a primary problem
for fairness, training performance and accuracy. Although significant efforts
have been made into tackling statistical data heterogeneity, the diversity in
the processing capabilities and network bandwidth of clients, termed as system
heterogeneity, has remained largely unexplored. Current solutions either
disregard a large portion of available devices or set a uniform limit on the
model's capacity, restricted by the least capable participants. In this work,
we introduce Ordered Dropout, a mechanism that achieves an ordered, nested
representation of knowledge in deep neural networks (DNNs) and enables the
extraction of lower footprint submodels without the need of retraining. We
further show that for linear maps our Ordered Dropout is equivalent to SVD. We
employ this technique, along with a self-distillation methodology, in the realm
of FL in a framework called FjORD. FjORD alleviates the problem of client
system heterogeneity by tailoring the model width to the client's capabilities.
Extensive evaluation on both CNNs and RNNs across diverse modalities shows that
FjORD consistently leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining its nested structure.

data (e.g. ratings, likes) to produce accurate recommendations. However, users
experience privacy concerns due to unethical data aggregation and analytical
practices carried out by the Service Providers (SP). Local differential privacy
(LDP) based perturbation mechanisms add noise to users data at user side before
sending it to the SP. The SP then uses the perturbed data to perform
recommendations. Although LDP protects the privacy of users from SP, it causes
a substantial decline in predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose
an LDP-based Matrix Factorization (MF) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (MoG). The
LDP perturbation mechanism, Bounded Laplace (BLP), regulates the effect of
noise by confining the perturbed ratings to a predetermined domain. We derive a
sufficient condition of the scale parameter for BLP to satisfy $\epsilon$ LDP.
At the SP, The MoG model estimates the noise added to perturbed ratings and the
MF algorithm predicts missing ratings. Our proposed LDP based recommendation
system improves the recommendation accuracy without violating LDP principles.
The empirical evaluations carried out on three real world datasets, i.e.,
Movielens, Libimseti and Jester, demonstrate that our method offers a
substantial increase in predictive accuracy under strong privacy guarantee.

equilibrium are then examined through analytical discussion and numerical
examples. As an application of the proposed model, we analyze a simple
time-dependent timetable optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and
reveal that a ""capacity increasing paradox"" exists such that a higher dispatch
frequency can increase the equilibrium cost. Furthermore, insights into the

multiple solutions of a standard elasticity problem, the proposed method can
compute the undeformed configuration by solving only one modified elasticity

The framework is implemented within an open-source pipeline enabling the direct
and inverse deformation simulation directly from imaging data. We use the
high-level Unified Form Language (UFL) of the FEniCS Project to express the
finite element model in variational form and to automatically derive the

  Using Distributed Computing Theory","Corrected typos",,,,"cs.GT cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphical games are a useful framework for modeling the interactions of
(selfish) agents who are connected via an underlying topology and whose
behaviors influence each other. They have wide applications ranging from
computer science to economics and biology. Yet, even though a player's payoff
only depends on the actions of their direct neighbors in graphical games,
computing the Nash equilibria and making statements about the convergence time
of ""natural"" local dynamics in particular can be highly challenging. In this
work, we present a novel approach for classifying complexity of Nash equilibria
in graphical games by establishing a connection to local graph algorithms, a
subfield of distributed computing. In particular, we make the observation that
the equilibria of graphical games are equivalent to locally verifiable
labelings (LVL) in graphs; vertex labelings which are verifiable with a
constant-round local algorithm. This connection allows us to derive novel lower
bounds on the convergence time to equilibrium of best-response dynamics in
graphical games. Since we establish that distributed convergence can sometimes
be provably slow, we also introduce and give bounds on an intuitive notion of
""time-constrained"" inefficiency of best responses. We exemplify how our results
can be used in the implementation of mechanisms that ensure convergence of best
responses to a Nash equilibrium. Our results thus also give insight into the
convergence of strategy-proof algorithms for graphical games, which is still
not well understood.

can no longer depend on Moore's Law to increase computing performance. The only
way to achieve higher performance or lower energy consumption is by building
domain-specific hardware accelerators. To efficiently design and verify those
domain-specific accelerators, we need agile hardware development. One of the
main obstacles when proposing such a modern method is the lack of modern tools
to attack it. To be able to verify a design in such a time-constrained
development method, one needs to have efficient tools both for design and
verification.
  This paper thus proposes ChiselVerify, an open-source tool for verifying
circuits described in any Hardware Description Language. It builds on top of
the Chisel hardware construction language and uses Scala to drive the
verification using a testing strategy inspired by the Universal Verification
Methodology (UVM) and adapted for designs described in Chisel. ChiselVerify is
created based on three key ideas. First, our solution highly increases the
productivity of the verification engineer, by allowing hardware testing to be
done in a modern high-level programming environment. Second, the framework
functions with any hardware description language thanks to the flexibility of
Chisel blackboxes. Finally, the solution is well integrated into the existing
Chisel universe, making it an extension of currently existing testing
libraries.
  We implement ChiselVerify in a way inspired by the functionalities found in
SystemVerilog. This allows one to use functional coverage, constrained-random
verification, bus functional models, transaction-level modeling and much more
during the verification process of a design in a contemporary high-level
programming ecosystem.

asymmetric binary merger GW190814 is a neutron star. We confirm that in any
case, the quark matter phase has to be color superconducting with the
dimensionless diquark coupling approximately fulfilling the Fierz relation
$\eta_D=0.75$ and the most probable solutions exhibiting a proportionality
between $\eta_D$ and $\eta_V$, the coupling of the repulsive vector interaction
that is required for a sufficiently large maximum mass. We used the Bayesian
analysis to investigate with the method of fictitious measurements the
consequences of anticipating different radii for the massive $2~M_\odot$ PSR
J0740+6220 for the most likely equation of state. With the actual outcome of
the NICER radius measurement on PSR J0740+6220 we could conclude that for the
most likely hybrid star EoS would not support a maximum mass as large as
$2.5~M_\odot$ so that the event GW190814 was a binary black hole merger.

  elastically bonded fibers",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been increasing experimental evidence of non-affine elastic
deformation mechanisms in biological soft tissues. These observations call for
novel constitutive models which are able to describe the dominant underlying
micro-structural kinematics aspects, in particular relative motion
characteristics of different phases. This paper proposes a flexible and modular
framework based on a micromorphic continuum encompassing matrix and fiber
phases. It features in addition to the displacement field so-called director
fields which can independently deform and intrinsically carry orientational
information. Accordingly, the fibrous constituents can be naturally associated
with the micromorphic directors and their non-affine motion within the bulk
material can be efficiently captured. Furthermore, constitutive relations can
be formulated based on kinematics quantities specifically linked to the
material response of the matrix, the fibres and their mutual interactions.
Associated stress quantities are naturally derived from a micromorphic
variational principle featuring dedicated governing equations for displacement
and director fields. This aspect of the framework is crucial for the truly
non-affine elastic deformation description. In contrast to conventional
micromorphic approaches, any non-local higher-order material behaviour is
excluded, thus significantly reducing the number of material parameters to a
range typically found in related classical approaches. In the context of
biological soft tissue modeling, the potential and applicability of the
formulation is studied for a number of academic examples featuring anisotropic
fiber-reinforced composite material composition to elucidate the micromorphic
material response as compared with the one obtained using a classical continuum
mechanics approach.

a non-real-time, ofline fashion due to system complexity to reason

compliant with emerging real-world scenarios such as service robots or public

targeting real-time edge computing which addresses both efficiency and
accuracy. It intelligently exploits the temporal coherence between successive
video frames to approximate their CNN features rather than naively extracting
them. It also integrates memory feature aggregation from past video frames to
enhance current detection stability, implicitly modeling long temporal cues
over time. Experiments conducted on the public benchmark datasets UCF-24 and
JHMDB-21 demonstrate that ACDnet, when integrated with the SSD detector, can
robustly achieve detection well above real-time (75 FPS). At the same time, it
retains reasonable accuracy (70.92 and 49.53 frame mAP) compared to other
top-performing methods using far heavier configurations. Codes will be

Hartline (2018) introduce the revelation gap to quantify the loss of the
restriction to truthful mechanisms. We solve a main open question left in Feng
and Hartline (2018); namely, we identify a non-trivial revelation gap for
revenue maximization.
  Our analysis focuses on the canonical problem of selling a single item to a
single agent with only access to a single sample from the agent's valuation
distribution. We identify the sample-bid mechanism (a simple non-truthful
mechanism) and upper-bound its prior-independent approximation ratio by 1.835

truthful mechanism can achieve prior-independent approximation ratio better
than 1.957 (resp. 1.543) for regular (resp. MHR) distributions. Thus, a
non-trivial revelation gap is shown as the sample-bid mechanism outperforms the
optimal prior-independent truthful mechanism. On the hardness side, we prove
that no (possibly non-truthful) mechanism can achieve prior-independent
approximation ratio better than 1.073 even for uniform distributions.

show that the extrinsic curvature governs the ground state configuration on a

to reproduce the co-evolving features of both cosmic ray (CR) nuclei spectra

Galactic plane. This will lead to a dominating anisotropy in perpendicular
direction, which is discrepant with observations. Thus it is necessary to
reboot further investigation into the effect of the solar offset. In this work,
for the first time the combined studies of the solar offset, nuclei spectra and
anisotropy are performed based on the SDP model. As a result, to reproduce CR
spectra and anisotropy, the thickness of the halo $\rm (\xi z_h)$ increases
linearly with the displacement of the Sun. When the offset is $\rm \sim8~pc$ as
estimated from the matter-borne methods, $\rm \xi z_h$ is about 0.9 kpc, which
is a much thicker halo than usually. Moreover, the PeV anisotropy could
estimate the value of diffusion coefficient, thus breaking the degeneracy of
diffusion coefficient and halo thickness. Therefore it is a good messenger to
constrain the halo thickness. On the other hand, the anisotropy in PeV energy
region, as a new probe, might also shed new light to constrain the solar
offset. We hope that the anisotropy at the energies of $\rm \sim TeV$ to $\rm
PeV$ can be finely measured by LHAASO experiment, leading to a better
understanding about the thick halo.

the recent Type IIb SN2019lqo and Type Ib SN2020fkb that occurred in the LIRG
system Arp299 with host extinctions of $A_V=2.1^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$ and
$A_V=0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ mag, respectively. Motivated by the above, we
inspected, for the first time, a sample of 29 CCSNe located within a projected
distance of 2.5 kpc from the host galaxy nuclei in a sample of 16 LIRGs. We
find that, if star formation within these galaxies is modelled assuming a
global starburst episode and normal IMF, there is evidence of a correlation
between the starburst age and the CCSN subtype. We infer that the two subgroups
of 14 H-poor (Type IIb/Ib/Ic/Ibn) and 15 H-rich (Type II/IIn) CCSNe have
different underlying progenitor age distributions, with the H-poor progenitors
being younger at 3$\sigma$ significance. However, we do note that the available
sample sizes of CCSNe and host LIRGs are so far small, and the statistical
comparisons between subgroups do not take into account possible systematic or
model errors related to the estimated starburst ages. (abridged)

model complexity can be further reduced by setting Cholesky parameters beyond
this lag to zero a priori. Cholesky-based multivariate Gaussian regression is

have separate models specifically adapted to these texture classes, instead of
training a single model that tries to learn generic motion. Our results

the practical success of deep learning to the rich regime with complex

always a small number of active parameters which change quite a bit during

that most of the active parameters are in the bottom layers, close to the

study static Layer-Wise Sparse (LWS) SGD, which only updates some subsets of

updates the top layers and occasionally updates the full network. We show that
probabilistic LWS-SGD matches the generalization performance of vanilla SGD and
the back-propagation time can be 2-5 times more efficient.

  Maximization and Scaling",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to extend the
wireless signal coverage and support the high performance communication. By
intelligently adjusting the reflection coefficients of a large number of
passive reflecting elements, the IRS can modify the wireless propagation
environment in favour of signal transmission. Different from most of the prior
works which did not consider any cooperation between IRSs, in this work we
propose and study a cooperative double-IRS aided multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) communication system under the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation channels.
We investigate the capacity maximization problem by jointly optimizing the
transmit covariance matrix and the passive beamforming matrices of the two
cooperative IRSs. Although the above problem is non-convex and difficult to
solve, we transform and simplify the original problem by exploiting a tractable
characterization of the LoS channels. Then we develop a novel low-complexity
algorithm whose complexity is independent of the number of IRS elements.
Moreover, we analyze the capacity scaling orders of the double-IRS aided MIMO
system with respect to an asymptotically large number of IRS elements or
transmit power, which significantly outperform those of the conventional
single-IRS aided MIMO system, thanks to the cooperative passive beamforming
gain brought by the double-reflection link and the spatial multiplexing gain
harvested from the two single-reflection links. Extensive numerical results are
provided to show that by exploiting the LoS channel properties, our proposed
algorithm can achieve a desirable performance with low computational time.
Also, our capacity scaling analysis is validated, and the double-IRS system is
shown to achieve a much higher rate than its single-IRS counterpart as long as
the number of IRS elements or the transmit power is not small.

the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affects individuals' prosocial behavior and
expectations on future outcomes. We conducted an online experiment with British
participants (N=961) when the UK introduced its first lockdown and the outbreak
was on its growing stage. Participants were primed with either the
environmental or economic consequences (i.e., negative primes), or the
environmental or economic benefits (i.e., positive primes) of the pandemic, or
with neutral information. We measured priming effects on an incentivized
take-and-give dictator game and on participants' expectations about future
environmental quality and economic growth. Our results show that primes affect
participants' expectations, but not their prosociality. In particular,
participants primed with environmental consequences hold a more pessimistic
view on future environmental quality, while those primed with economic benefits
are more optimistic about future economic growth. Instead, the positive
environmental prime and the negative economic prime do not influence
expectations. Our results offer insights into how information affects behavior
and expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic.

emissions (CE) requires an accurate assessment of how different technologies
perform on these two fronts. In this regard, the focus in academia is
increasingly shifting from traditional technologies to electricity consuming
alternatives. Calculating and comparing their performance with respect to
traditional technologies requires conversion factors (CFs) like a primary
energy factor and a CO2eq intensity. These reflect the PE and CE associated
with each unit of electricity consumed. Previous work has shown that the
calculation and use of CFs is a contentious and multifaceted issue. However,
this has mostly remained a theoretical discussion. A stock-taking of how CFs
are actually calculated and used in academic literature has so far been
missing, impeding insight into what the contemporary trends and challenges are.
Therefore, we structurally review 65 publications across six methodological
aspects. We find that 72% of the publications consider only a single country,
86% apply a purely retrospective perspective, 54% apply a yearly temporal
resolution, 65% apply a purely operational (instead of a life-cycle)
perspective, 91% make use of average (rather than marginal) CFs, and 75% ignore
electricity imports from surrounding countries. We conclude that there is a
strong need in the literature for a publicly available, transparently
calculated dataset of CFs, which avoids the shortcomings found in the
literature. This would enable more accurate and transparent PE and CE
calculations, and support the development of new building energy performance
assessment methods and smart grid algorithms.

demonstrate feasibility. Following training using 200 cases, we performed
comprehensive evaluations using conventional and clinical metrics on a separate

supported that hydrogen is homogenously substituted for oxygen. A high
self-field $J_{\rm c}$ of over 10 MA/cm$^2$ was recorded at 5 K, which is
likely to be caused by a short London penetration depth. The anisotropic
Ginzburg-Landau scaling for the angle dependence of $J_{\rm c}$ yielded
temperature-dependent scaling parameters $\gamma_{\rm J}$ that decreased from

plane of sky is $71.7\pm14.7$ km s$^{-1}$, with an initial acceleration of
$1.9\pm1.3$ km s$^{-2}$. These blobs normally reach a projected distance of
3--7 Mm from their origin sites. From the transition region images we find an
average projected area of $0.57\pm0.37$ Mm$^{2}$ for the blobs. The blobs were
also detected in multi-passbands of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, but not in

cellular systems. To satisfy strict URLLC requirements for uplink data
transmission, the specifications of 5G systems introduce the grant-free channel
access method. According to this method, a User Equipment (UE) performs packet
transmission without requesting channel resources from a base station (gNB).
With the grant-free channel access, the gNB configures the uplink transmission
parameters in a long-term time scale. Since the channel quality can
significantly change in time and frequency domains, the gNB should select
robust transmission parameters to satisfy the URLLC requirements. Many existing
studies consider fixed robust uplink transmission parameter selection that
allows satisfying the requirements even for UEs with poor channel conditions.
However, the more robust transmission parameters are selected, the lower is the
network capacity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects
the transmission parameters depending on the channel quality based on the
signal-to-noise ratio statistics analysis at the gNB. Simulation results
obtained with NS-3 show that the algorithm allows meeting the URLLC latency and
reliability requirements while reducing the channel resource consumption more

approaches mainly solve the NLVL problem from the perspective of computer
vision by formulating it as ranking, anchor, or regression tasks. These methods
suffer from large performance degradation when localizing on long videos. In
this work, we address the NLVL from a new perspective, i.e., span-based
question answering (QA), by treating the input video as a text passage. We
propose a video span localizing network (VSLNet), on top of the standard
span-based QA framework (named VSLBase), to address NLVL. VSLNet tackles the
differences between NLVL and span-based QA through a simple yet effective
query-guided highlighting (QGH) strategy. QGH guides VSLNet to search for the
matching video span within a highlighted region. To address the performance
degradation on long videos, we further extend VSLNet to VSLNet-L by applying a
multi-scale split-and-concatenation strategy. VSLNet-L first splits the
untrimmed video into short clip segments; then, it predicts which clip segment
contains the target moment and suppresses the importance of other segments.
Finally, the clip segments are concatenated, with different confidences, to
locate the target moment accurately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show that the proposed VSLNet and VSLNet-L outperform the
state-of-the-art methods; VSLNet-L addresses the issue of performance
degradation on long videos. Our study suggests that the span-based QA framework
is an effective strategy to solve the NLVL problem.

chemical, magnetic, dynamical, and optical properties of their environment,
from galaxies down to the interstellar medium, star-forming regions, and
protoplanetary disks. Their coagulation leads to shifts in their size
distribution and ultimately to the formation of planets. However, although the
coagulation process is reasonably uncomplicated to numerically implement by
itself, it is difficult to couple it with multidimensional hydrodynamics
numerical simulations because of its high computational cost. We propose here a
simple method for tracking the coagulation of grains at far lower cost. Given
an initial grain size distribution, the state of the distribution at time t is
solely determined by the value of a single variable integrated along the
trajectory, independently of the specific path taken by the grains. Although
this method cannot account for processes other than coagulation, it is
mathematically exact, fast, inexpensive, and can be used to evaluate the effect
of grain coagulation in most astrophysical contexts. It is applicable to all
coagulation kernels in which local physical conditions and grain properties can
be separated. We also describe another method for calculating the average
electric charge of grains and the density of ions and electrons in environments
that are shielded from radiation fields, given the density and temperature of
the gas, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, and the average mass of the ions. The
equations we provide are fast to integrate numerically and can be used in
multidimensional numerical simulations to self-consistently calculate on the
fly the local resistivities that are required to model nonideal
magnetohydrodynamics.

brain. While the characterization and understanding of brain are still
inadequate. This study tried to build a model of brain from the perspective of
thermodynamics at system level, which brought a new thinking to brain
modelling.
  Approach. Regarding brain regions as systems, voxels as particles, and
intensity of signals as energy of particles, the thermodynamic model of brain
was built based on canonical ensemble theory. Two pairs of activated regions
and two pairs of inactivated brain regions were selected for comparison in this
study, and the analysis on thermodynamic properties based on the model proposed
were performed. In addition, the thermodynamic properties were also extracted
as input features for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.
  Main results. The experiment results verified the assumption that the brain
also follows the thermodynamic laws. It demonstrated the feasibility and
rationality of brain thermodynamic modelling method proposed, indicating that
thermodynamic parameters could be applied to describe the state of neural
system. Meanwhile, the brain thermodynamic model achieved much better accuracy
in detection of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the potential application of
thermodynamic model in auxiliary diagnosis.
  Significance. (1) Instead of applying some thermodynamic parameters to
analyze neural system, a brain model at system level was proposed from
perspective of thermodynamics for the first time in this study. (2) The study
discovered that the neural system also follows the laws of thermodynamics,
which leads to increased internal energy, increased free energy and decreased
entropy when system is activated. (3) The detection of neural disease was
demonstrated to be benefit from thermodynamic model, implying the immense
potential of thermodynamics in auxiliary diagnosis.

three main results. First, speech representations in the brain can be accounted

deep nets to increase their brain similarity. Third, learning to process

Based on the custom dataset with 600 ground-truth images of healthy and

0.874 in the infected bee detection and up to 0.727 in the detection of the
Varroa Destructor mite itself. The results demonstrate the potential of this

  Correlation Mining","accepted by International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE
  2021)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud-based services are surging into popularity in recent years. However,
outages, i.e., severe incidents that always impact multiple services, can
dramatically affect user experience and incur severe economic losses. Locating
the root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of the
outage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In current
industrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner and
largely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outage
is identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually from
service to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found.
Unfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number of
interdependent services. Such a manual root cause analysis is often
time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose COT, the first
outage triage approach that considers the global view of service correlations.
COT mines the correlations among services from outage diagnosis data. After
learning from historical outages, COT can infer the root cause of emerging ones
accurately. We implement COT and evaluate it on a real-world dataset containing
one year of data collected from Microsoft Azure, one of the representative
cloud computing platforms in the world. Our experimental results show that COT
can reach a triage accuracy of 82.1%~83.5%, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art triage approach by 28.0%~29.7%.

Conventional transfer CNN models are usually manually designed based on
intuition. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is applied to select trainable
layers of the transfer model. The filter criterion is constructed by accuracy
and the counts of the trainable layers. The results show that the method is
competent in this task. The system will converge with a precision of 97% in the
classification of Cats and Dogs datasets, in no more than 15 generations.
Moreover, backward inference according the results of the genetic algorithm
shows that our method can capture the gradient features in network layers,
which plays a part on understanding of the transfer AI models.

systems due to the fact that only a few interactions of cold-start users can be
exploited. Recent studies seek to address this challenge from the perspective
of meta learning, and most of them follow a manner of parameter initialization,
where the model parameters can be learned by a few steps of gradient updates.
While these gradient-based meta-learning models achieve promising performances
to some extent, a fundamental problem of them is how to adapt the global
knowledge learned from previous tasks for the recommendations of cold-start
users more effectively. In this paper, we develop a novel meta-learning
recommender called task-adaptive neural process (TaNP). TaNP is a new member of
the neural process family, where making recommendations for each user is
associated with a corresponding stochastic process. TaNP directly maps the
observed interactions of each user to a predictive distribution, sidestepping
some training issues in gradient-based meta-learning models. More importantly,
to balance the trade-off between model capacity and adaptation reliability, we
introduce a novel task-adaptive mechanism. It enables our model to learn the
relevance of different tasks and customize the global knowledge to the
task-related decoder parameters for estimating user preferences. We validate
TaNP on multiple benchmark datasets in different experimental settings.
Empirical results demonstrate that TaNP yields consistent improvements over
several state-of-the-art meta-learning recommenders.

governing equations are expressed as integral form on support and dual-support.
The first example shows that the nonlocal elasticity has the same form as
dual-horizon non-ordinary state-based peridynamics. The derivation is simple
and general and it can convert efficiently many local physical models into
their corresponding nonlocal forms. In addition, a criterion based on the
instability of the nonlocal gradient is proposed for the fracture modelling in
linear elasticity. Several numerical examples are presented to validate
