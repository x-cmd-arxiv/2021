leveraging the information pre-stored in the local caches at the users. The
original single file retrieval setting by Maddah-Ali and Niesen has been
recently extended to general Scalar Linear Function Retrieval (SLFR) by Wan et
al., who proposed a linear scheme that surprisingly achieves the same optimal
load (under the constraint of uncoded cache placement) as in single file
retrieval. This paper's goal is to characterize the conditions under which a
general SLFR linear scheme is optimal and gain practical insights into why the
specific choices made by Wan et al. work. This paper shows that the optimal
decoding coefficients are necessarily the product of two terms, one only
involving the encoding coefficients and the other only the demands. In
addition, the relationships among the encoding coefficients are shown to be
captured by the cycles of certain graphs. Thus, a general linear scheme for
SLFR can be found by solving a spanning tree problem.

  analyses",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has recently been considerable interest in addressing the problem of
unifying distributed statistical analyses into a single coherent inference.
This problem naturally arises in a number of situations, including in big-data
settings, when working under privacy constraints, and in Bayesian model choice.
The majority of existing approaches have relied upon convenient approximations
of the distributed analyses. Although typically being computationally
efficient, and readily scaling with respect to the number of analyses being
unified, approximate approaches can have significant shortcomings -- the
quality of the inference can degrade rapidly with the number of analyses being
unified, and can be substantially biased even when unifying a small number of
analyses that do not concur. In contrast, the recent Fusion approach of Dai et
al. (2019) is a rejection sampling scheme which is readily parallelisable and
is exact (avoiding any form of approximation other than Monte Carlo error),
albeit limited in applicability to unifying a small number of low-dimensional
analyses. In this paper we introduce a practical Bayesian Fusion approach. We
extend the theory underpinning the Fusion methodology and, by embedding it
within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we are able to recover the correct
target distribution. By means of extensive guidance on the implementation of
the approach, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that Bayesian Fusion
is robust to increasing numbers of analyses, and coherently unifying analyses
which do not concur. This is achieved while being computationally competitive
with approximate schemes.

revealed in a first step, in environments where population heterogeneity is not
discrete. We focus on two-step grouped fixed-effects (GFE) estimators, where
individuals are first classified into groups using kmeans clustering, and the
model is then estimated allowing for group-specific heterogeneity. Our
framework relies on two key properties: heterogeneity is a function - possibly
nonlinear and time-varying - of a low-dimensional continuous latent type, and
informative moments are available for classification. We illustrate the method
in a model of wages and labor market participation, and in a probit model with
time-varying heterogeneity. We derive asymptotic expansions of two-step GFE

We propose a data-driven rule for the number of groups, and discuss bias

scans to use its latent state for reinforcement learning of navigation tasks.
To achieve high reconstruction power of our autoencoding pipeline, we propose
an - in the context of autoencoding 2D-lidar scans - novel preprocessing into a
local binary occupancy image. This has no additional requirements, neither
self-localization nor robust mapping, and therefore can be applied in any
setting and easily transferred from simulation in real-world. In a second
stage, we show the usage of the compact state representation generated by our
autoencoding pipeline in a simplistic navigation task and expose the pitfall
that increased reconstruction power will always lead to an improved

datasets are simulated with pybullet as well as recorded using a slamtec

challenged by adversarial examples, the legitimate input added with
imperceptible and well-designed perturbations that can fool DNNs easily in the
DNN testing/deploying stage. Previous adversarial example generation algorithms
for adversarial white-box attacks used Jacobian gradient information to add
perturbations. This information is too imprecise and inexplicit, which will
cause unnecessary perturbations when generating adversarial examples. This
paper aims to address this issue. We first propose to apply a more informative
and distilled gradient information, namely integrated gradient, to generate
adversarial examples. To further make the perturbations more imperceptible, we
propose to employ the restriction combination of $L_0$ and $L_1/L_2$ secondly,
which can restrict the total perturbations and perturbation points
simultaneously. Meanwhile, to address the non-differentiable problem of $L_1$,
we explore a proximal operation of $L_1$ thirdly. Based on these three works,
we propose two Integrated gradient based White-box Adversarial example
generation algorithms (IWA): IFPA and IUA. IFPA is suitable for situations
where there are a determined number of points to be perturbed. IUA is suitable
for situations where no perturbation point number is preset in order to obtain
more adversarial examples. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms on both structured and unstructured datasets, and we compare them
with five baseline generation algorithms. The results show that our proposed
algorithms do craft adversarial examples with more imperceptible perturbations

observation was a CIRS FP3 (600 to 1100cm-1, 9.1 to 16.7 ${\mu}$m) stare of
Helene's trailing hemisphere, where two of the ten FP3 pixels were filled. The
daytime surface temperatures derived from these observations were
83.3${\pm}$0.9 K and 88.8${\pm}$0.8 K at local times 223${\deg}$ to 288${\deg}$

compared to a 1-D thermophysical model only albedos between 0.25 and 0.70 were

All thermal inertias tested between 1 and 2000 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$

observed with FP3, with a typical error between 5 and 10 K. The surface
temperatures derived from FP4 were higher, between 98 and 106 K, but with much
larger errors (between 10 and 30 K) and thus the FP3- and FP4-derived
temperature largely agree within their uncertainty. Dione's disk-integrated
bolometric Bond albedos have been found to be between 0.63${\pm}$0.15 (Howett

darker than Dione, which is the opposite of the trend found at shorter
wavelengths (c.f. Hedman et al., 2020; Royer et al., 2020). However few
conclusions can be drawn since the albedos of Dione and Helene agree within

can be significantly modulated by lipids, the underlying mechanisms have been
primarily studied in model membranes with only a few lipid species. Here we use
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to probe specific binding of
lipids in a complex quasi-neuronal membrane. We ran a total of 50 microseconds
of simulations of a single nAChR in a membrane composed of 36 species of
lipids. Competition between multiple lipid species produces a complex
distribution. We find that overall, cholesterol selects for concave
intersubunit sites and PUFAs select for convex M4 sites, while monounsaturated
and saturated lipids are unenriched in the nAChR boundary. In order to
characterize binding to specific sites, we present a novel approach for
calculating a ""density-threshold affinity"" from continuous density
distributions. We find that affinity for M4 weakens with chain rigidity, which
suggests flexible chains may help relax packing defects caused by the conical
protein shape. For any site, PE headgroups have the strongest affinity of all
phospholipid headgroups, but anionic lipids still yield moderately high
affinities for the M4 sites as expected. We observe cooperative effects between
anionic headgroups and saturated chains at the M4 site in the inner leaflet. We
also analyze affinities for individual anionic headgroups. Combined, these
insights may reconcile several apparently contradictory experiments on the role
of anionic phospholipids in modulating nAChR.

(frequencies up to 1000 T) and high frequency (HF) contributions (several
clusters of frequencies from 7-22 kT). Increased resolution and angle-resolved

  Inference on Embedded Platforms","39 Pages, 40 Figures, Appendix with Supplementary Figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be a powerful
state-of-the-art method for image classification tasks. One drawback however is
the high computational complexity and high memory consumption of CNNs which
makes them unfeasible for execution on embedded platforms which are constrained
on physical resources needed to support CNNs. Quantization has often been used
to efficiently optimize CNNs for memory and computational complexity at the
cost of a loss of prediction accuracy. We therefore propose a method to
optimally quantize the weights, biases and activations of each layer of a
pre-trained CNN while controlling the loss in inference accuracy to enable
quantized inference. We quantize the 32-bit floating-point precision parameters
to low bitwidth fixed-point representations thereby finding optimal bitwidths
and fractional offsets for parameters of each layer of a given CNN. We quantize
parameters of a CNN post-training without re-training it. Our method is
designed to quantize parameters of a CNN taking into account how other
parameters are quantized because ignoring quantization errors due to other
quantized parameters leads to a low precision CNN with accuracy losses of up to
50% which is far beyond what is acceptable. Our final method therefore gives a
low precision CNN with accuracy losses of less than 1%. As compared to a method
used by commercial tools that quantize all parameters to 8-bits, our approach
provides quantized CNN with averages of 53% lower memory consumption and 77.5%
lower cost of executing multiplications for the two CNNs trained on the four
datasets that we tested our work on. We find that layer-wise quantization of
parameters significantly helps in this process.

metallicities derived from MUSE observations (from the Fornax3D survey) to
study these ratios as a function of metallicity, and to study dust-to-metal
ratios, in a sub-sample of nine galaxies. We find that gas-to-dust ratios in
Fornax galaxies are systematically lower than those in field galaxies at fixed
stellar mass/metallicity. This implies that a relatively large fraction of the
metals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly due to
altered chemical evolution as a result of the dense environment. The low ratios
are not only driven by HI deficiencies, but H$_2$-to-dust ratios are also
significantly decreased. This is different in the Virgo cluster, where low
gas-to-dust ratios inside the virial radius are driven by low HI-to-dust
ratios, while H$_2$-to-dust ratios are increased. Resolved observations of
NGC1436 show a radial increase in H$_2$-to-dust ratio, and show that low ratios
are present throughout the disc. We propose various explanations for the low
H$_2$-to-dust ratios in the Fornax cluster, including the more efficient
stripping of H$_2$ compared to dust, more efficient enrichment of dust in the
star formation process, and altered ISM physics in the cluster environment.

  In Part I, we set up the combinatorial framework and showed how graphs
weighted with integer lengths associated to the edges provide tilings of
Euclidean spaces by certain polytopes associated to the graph itself and to its
subgraphs.
  In Part II, we described the arrangements of toric varieties associated to
the tilings of Part I in several ways: using normal fans, as unions of orbits,
by equations and as degenerations of tori.
  In the present Part III, we show how these combinatorial and toric frameworks
allow us to describe all stable limits of a family of line bundles along a
degenerating family of curves. Our main result asserts that the collection of
all these limits is parametrized by a connected 0-dimensional closed substack
of the Artin stack of all torsion-free rank-one sheaves on the limit curve.
Moreover, we thoroughly describe this closed substack and all the closed
substacks that arise in this way as certain torus quotients of the arrangements
of toric varieties of Part II determined by the Voronoi tilings of Euclidean
spaces studied in Part I.

we study the structural, magnetic and electrical transport behavior in
epitaxial SrIrO$_3$ film ($\sim$ 40 nm) grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrate. Opposed
to bulk material, the SrIrO$_3$ film exhibits a ferromagnetic ordering at low
temperature below $\sim$ 20 K. The electrical transport data indicate an
insulating behavior where the nature of charge transport follows Mott's
variable-range-hopping model. A positive magnetoresistance is recorded at 2 K
which has correlation with magnetic moment. We further observe a nonlinear Hall
effect at low temperature ($<$ 20 K) which arises due to an anomalous component
of Hall effect. An anisotropic behavior of both magnetoresistance and Hall
effect has been evidenced at low temperature which coupled with anomalous Hall
effect indicate the development of ferromagnetic ordering. We believe that an
enhanced (local) structural distortion caused by lattice strain at low
temperatures induces ferromagnetic ordering, thus showing structural
instability plays vital role to tune the physical properties in SrIrO$_3$.

this, the representations learned through interaction with the world can be

this, we use a method we call fast concept mapping which uses correlated firing
patterns of neurons to define and detect semantic concepts. This association
works instantaneous with very few labeled examples, similar to what we observe
in humans in a phenomenon called fast mapping. Strikingly, this method already
identifies objects with as little as one labeled example which highlights the

regime between excitons and photons. In planar microcavitites, phenomena such
as superfluidity or Bose-Einstein condensation can be observed. Those systems
have demonstrated to be very efficient in the hydrodynamic generation of
topological excitations, such as vortex-antivortex pairs or dark solitons.
However, the lifetime and motion of those excitations were limited by the
driven dissipative nature of the system. In this thesis, we present a rich
variety of results about the generation and control of such topological
excitations. Taking advantage of the optical bistability present in our system,
we were able to greatly enhanced the propagation length of vortices and
solitons generated in the wake of a structural defect, revealing in the mean
time an unexpected binding mechanism of the solitons which propagate parallel.
This behaviour was recovered in a specifically designed experiment, where we
artificially imprint dark soliton pairs on demand on a polariton superfluid.
The adaptability of our technique allowed for a detailed study of this
phenomenon, that we directly connected to the driven-dissipative nature of our
system. Finally, confined dark solitons were generated within guided intensity
channels on a static polariton fluid. The absence of flow lead to the
development of transverse snake instabilities of which we studied the

observed that the amplitude and width of the DIARWs increase (decrease) with
the negative (positive) ion mass. The implications of the results to laboratory

However, recent experiments have found inertial delay to be important for the
motion of self-propelled particles. A major challenge in the theoretical
description of these effects, which makes the application of standard methods
very difficult, is the fact that orientable particles have both translational
and orientational degrees of freedom which do not necessarily relax on the same
time scale. In this work, we derive the general mathematical form of a field
theory for soft matter systems with two different time scales. This allows to
obtain a phase field crystal model for polar (i.e., nonspherical or active)
particles with translational and orientational memory. Notably, this theory is
of third order in temporal derivatives and can thus be seen as a spatiotemporal
jerky dynamics. We obtain the phase diagram of this model, which shows that,
unlike in the passive case, the linear stability of the liquid state depends on
the damping coefficients. Moreover, we investigate sound waves in active
matter. It is found that, in active fluids, there are two different mechanisms
for sound propagation. For certain parameter values and sufficiently high
frequencies, sound mediated by polarization waves experiences less damping than
usual passive sound mediated by pressure waves of the same frequency. By
combining the different modes, acoustic frequency filters based on active
fluids could be realized.

Predictive Controller (MPC) with constraints. We propose an approach for
learning MPC that explicitly uses the gradient information in the training

optimization MPC solvers can provide both the optimal feedback law from the
state to control input as well as the corresponding gradient. As a proof of
concept, we apply this approach to explicit MPC (eMPC), for which the feedback
law is a piece-wise affine function of the state, but the number of pieces
grows rapidly with the state dimension. Controller identification can here be
used to find an approximate lower complexity functional approximation of the
controller. The eMPC is modelled with a Neural Network (NN) with Rectified
Linear Units (ReLUs), since such NN can represent any piece-wise affine
function. A motivation is to replace on-line solvers with neural networks to
implement MPC and to simplify the evaluation of the function in larger input
dimensions. We also study experimental design and model evaluation in this
framework, and propose a hit and run sampling algorithm for input design. The
proposed algorithm are illustrated and numerically evaluated on a second order

the server is to do this using as few transmissions as possible. This work
presents a hypergraph coloring approach to the scalar PICOD problem. A
\textit{conflict-free coloring} of a hypergraph is known from literature as an
assignment of colors to its vertices so that each hyperedge of the graph
contains one uniquely colored vertex. For a given PICOD problem represented by
a hypergraph consisting of messages as vertices and request-sets as hyperedges,
we present achievable PICOD schemes using conflict-free colorings of the PICOD
hypergraph. Various graph theoretic parameters arising out of such colorings
(and some new coloring variants) then give a number of upper bounds on the
optimal PICOD length, which we study in this work. Suppose the PICOD hypergraph
has $m$ vertices and $n$ hyperedges, where every hyperedge overlaps with at
most $\Gamma$ other hyperedges. We show easy to implement randomized algorithms
for the following: (a) For the single request case, we give a PICOD of length
$O(\log^2\Gamma)$. This result improves over known achievability results for
some parameter ranges, (b) For the $t$-request case, we give an MDS code of
length $\max(O(\log \Gamma \log m), O(t \log m))$. Further if the hyperedges
(request sets) are sufficiently large, we give a PICOD of the same length as
above, which is not based on MDS construction. In general, this gives an
improvement over prior achievability results. Our codes are of near-optimal
length (up to a multiplicative factor of $\log t$).

methods to establish such tendencies in lexicons have suffered from several
methodological shortcomings that leave open the question of whether this high

artefact of the incremental nature of recognition. In this paper, we point out
the confounds in existing methods for comparing the informativeness of segments

decay relies on input from nuclear theory. Cirigliano et al. recently showed
that, for the light Majorana exchange formalism, effective field theory
calculations require a $nn\to pp e^- e^-$ contact term at leading order. They
estimated the size of this contribution by relating it to measured
charge-independence-breaking (CIB) nucleon-nucleon interactions and making an
assumption about the relative sizes of CIB operators. We show that the
assumptions underlying this approximation are justified in the limit of the
number of colors $N_c$ being large. We also obtain a large-$N_c$ hierarchy
among CIB nucleon-nucleon interactions that is in agreement with
phenomenological results.

supernova (CCSN) explosions as they contribute to both lepton number and/or
four-momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter, and thus act as the agent
for neutrino-driven explosions. Due to the multiscale nature of neutrino
transport in CCSN simulations, an implicit treatment of neutrino-matter
interactions is desired, which requires solutions of coupled nonlinear systems
in each step of the time integration scheme. In this paper we design and
compare nonlinear iterative solvers for implicit systems with energy coupling
neutrino-matter interactions commonly used in CCSN simulations. Specifically,
we consider electron neutrinos and antineutrinos, which interact with static
matter configurations through the Bruenn~85 opacity set. The implicit systems
arise from the discretization of a non-relativistic two-moment model for
neutrino transport, which employs the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for
phase-space discretization and an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration
scheme. In the context of this DG-IMEX scheme, we propose two approaches to
formulate the nonlinear systems -- a coupled approach and a nested approach.
For each approach, the resulting systems are solved with Anderson-accelerated
fixed-point iteration and Newton's method. The performance of these four
iterative solvers has been compared on relaxation problems with various degree
of collisionality, as well as proto-neutron star deleptonization problems with
several matter profiles adopted from spherically symmetric CCSN simulations.
Numerical results suggest that the nested Anderson-accelerated fixed-point
solver is more efficient than other tested solvers for solving implicit
nonlinear systems with energy coupling neutrino-matter interactions.

one-shot simultaneous decoder for sending quantum information over a k-sender

achieved by this decoder is the natural one-shot quantum analogue of the
pentagonal classical rate region. Assuming a simultaneous smoothing conjecture,
this one-shot rate region approaches the optimal rate region of Yard, Dein the

random projection that transforms a (high-dimensional) Euclidean vector $v$ to
a vector of dimension $(2t-1) s$, where $t, s > 0$ are integer parameters. It
is known that even for $t=1$, a CountSketch allows estimating coordinates of
$v$ with variance bounded by $\|v\|_2^2/s$. For $t > 1$, the estimator takes
the median of $2t-1$ independent estimates, and the probability that the
estimate is off by more than $2 \|v\|_2/\sqrt{s}$ is exponentially small in
$t$. This suggests choosing $t$ to be logarithmic in a desired inverse failure
probability. However, implementations of CountSketch often use a small,
constant $t$. Previous work only predicts a constant factor improvement in this
setting.
  Our main contribution is a new analysis of Count-Sketch, showing an
improvement in variance to $O(\min\{\|v\|_1^2/s^2,\|v\|_2^2/s\})$ when $t > 1$.
That is, the variance decreases proportionally to $s^{-2}$, asymptotically for
large enough $s$. We also study the variance in the setting where an inner
product is to be estimated from two CountSketches. This finding suggests that
the Feature Hashing method, which is essentially identical to CountSketch but
does not make use of the median estimator, can be made more reliable at a small
cost in settings where using a median estimator is possible.
  We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments and thereby help justify
why a small constant number of estimates often suffice in practice. Our
improved variance bounds are based on new general theorems about the variance
and higher moments of the median of i.i.d. random variables that may be of
independent interest.

recently-developed techniques of quantum signal processing can be modified to

group quantum hypothesis testing (G-QHT), intuitively encode discrete
properties of the channel set in SU(2) and improve query complexity at least
quadratically in $n$, the size of the channel set and group, compared to
na\""ive repetition of binary hypothesis testing. Intriguingly, performance is
completely defined by explicit group homomorphisms; these in turn inform simple
constraints on polynomials embedded in unitary matrices. These constructions
demonstrate a flexible technique for mapping questions in quantum inference to
the well-understood subfields of functional approximation and discrete algebra.
Extensions to larger groups and noisy settings are discussed, as well as paths

'spectroscopic ruler' to measure fluctuations in macromolecules because of the
strong dependence of the rate on the separation (R) between the donor (D) and
acceptor (A). However, the well-known Forster rate expression that predicts an
$R^{-6}$ dependence, is limited by several approximations. Notable among them
is the neglect of the vibronic relaxation in the reactant (donor) and product
(acceptor) manifolds. Vibronic relaxation can play an important role when the
energy transfer rate is faster than the vibronic relaxation rate. Under such
conditions, donor to acceptor energy transfer can occur from the excited
vibronic states. This phenomenon is not captured by the usual formulation based
on the overlap of donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra. Here, we
attempt to eliminate this lacuna, by allowing relaxation in the vibronic energy
levels and adopting a relaxation model to account for vibronic cascading down
in the donor manifold. We develop a Green's function based generalized
formalism and provide an exact solution for the excited state population
relaxation and the rate of energy transfer in the presence of vibronic
relaxation. We find and verify that the neglect of vibronic relaxations can
significantly alter the energy transfer rate and overestimates the distance

relying solely on examples of task inputs and outputs, these approaches use
valuable additional data for improving model correctness and aligning learned
models with human priors. Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence suggests that
some language models can (1) store a large amount of knowledge in their
parameters, and (2) perform inference over tasks in textual inputs at test
time. These results raise the possibility that, for some tasks, humans cannot
explain to a model any more about the task than it already knows or could infer
on its own. In this paper, we study the circumstances under which explanations
of individual data points can (or cannot) improve modeling performance. In
order to carefully control important properties of the data and explanations,
we introduce a synthetic dataset for experiments, and we also make use of three
existing datasets with explanations: e-SNLI, TACRED, and SemEval. We first give
a formal framework for the available modeling approaches, in which explanation
data can be used as model inputs, as targets, or as a prior. After arguing that
the most promising role for explanation data is as model inputs, we propose to
use a retrieval-based method and show that it solves our synthetic task with
accuracies upwards of 95%, while baselines without explanation data achieve
below 65% accuracy. We then identify properties of datasets for which
retrieval-based modeling fails. With the three existing datasets, we find no

only low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate
several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence
and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the
evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a
morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly
selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late
in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of
their descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments,
this result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured
morphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic
basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological
intelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically
stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.

galaxies (Milky Way and above) produces cold gas or stars in excess of that
observed. Previous work suggested that AGN jets are likely required, but the
form of jet energy required to quench remains unclear. This is particularly
challenging for galaxy simulations, in which the resolution is orders of
magnitude coarser than necessary to form and evolve the jet. On such scales,
the uncertain parameters include: jet energy form (kinetic, thermal, and cosmic
ray (CR) energy), energy, momentum, and mass flux, magnetic field strength and
geometry, jet precession angle and period, opening-angle, and duty cycle. We
investigate all of these parameters in a $10^{14}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ halo using
high-resolution non-cosmological MHD simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In
Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, conduction, and viscosity. We
explore which scenarios match observational constraints and show that
CR-dominated jets can most efficiently quench the central galaxy through a
combination of CR pressure support and a modification of the thermal
instability. Jets with most energy in mildly relativistic ($\sim$ MeV or
$\sim10^{10}$ K) thermal plasma work, but require a factor $\sim 10$ larger
energy input. For a fixed energy flux, jets with higher specific energy (longer
cooling times) quench more effectively. For this halo size, kinetic jets are
less efficient in quenching unless they have wide opening or precession angles.
Magnetic fields play a minor role except when the magnetic flux reaches
$\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in a kinetic jet model, which causes the jet
cocoon to significantly widen, and the quenching to become explosive. We
conclude that the criteria for a successful jet model are an optimal energy
flux and a sufficiently wide jet cocoon with long enough cooling time at the
cooling radius.

complementary tool based on stellar kinematic predictors derived from the same
simulation suite. We design mock stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps
to mimic the specifications of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
(MaNGA) integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey and utilize an LDA to create a
classification based on a linear combination of 11 kinematic predictors. The
classification varies significantly with mass ratio; the major (minor) merger
classifications have a mean statistical accuracy of 80% (70%), a precision of
90% (85%), and a recall of 75% (60%). The major mergers are best identified by
predictors that trace global kinematic features, while the minor mergers rely
on local features that trace a secondary stellar component. While the kinematic
classification is less accurate than the imaging classification, the kinematic
predictors are better at identifying post-coalescence mergers. A combined
imaging + kinematic classification has the potential to reveal more complete
merger samples from imaging and IFS surveys like MaNGA. We note that since the
suite of simulations used to train the classifier covers a limited range of
galaxy properties (i.e., the galaxies are intermediate mass and
disk-dominated), the results may not be applicable to all MaNGA galaxies.

suggested that, at the magic angle, the Dirac velocity vanishes and the entire

contradicts experimental studies that reveal a finite Dirac velocity as well as
bandwidths significantly larger than predicted. Here we use spatially resolved
spectroscopy in finite and zero magnetic fields to examine the electronic
structure of moir\'e bands and their intricate connection to correlated phases.
By following the relative shifts of Landau levels in finite fields, we detect
filling-dependent band flattening, that unexpectedly starts already at ~1.3
degrees, well above the magic angle and hence nominally in the weakly
correlated regime. We further show that, as the twist angle is reduced, the
moir\'e bands become maximally flat at progressively lower doping levels.
Surprisingly, when the twist angles reach values for which the maximal
flattening occurs at approximate filling of $-2$, $+1$,$+2$,$+3$ electrons per
moir\'e unit cell, the corresponding zero-field correlated phases start to
emerge. Our observations are corroborated by calculations that incorporate an
interplay between the Coulomb charging energy and exchange interactions;
together these effects produce band flattening and hence a significant
density-of-states enhancement that facilitates the observed symmetry-breaking
cascade transitions. Besides emerging phases pinned to integer fillings, we
also experimentally identify a series of pronounced correlation-driven band
deformations and soft gaps in a wider doping range around $\pm 2$ filling where
superconductivity is expected. Our results highlight the role of
interaction-driven band-flattening in forming robust correlated phases in TBG.

mass of the Milky Way, understanding the dark matter velocity distribution, and

introduced a strategy to robustly measure the escape velocity. Our approach
takes into account the presence of kinematic substructures by modeling the tail
of the stellar distribution with multiple components, including the stellar
halo and the debris flow called the Gaia Sausage (Enceladus). In doing so, we
can test the robustness of the escape velocity measurement for different
definitions of the ""tail"" of the velocity distribution, and the consistency of
the data with different underlying models. In this paper, we apply this method
to the second data release of Gaia and find that a model with at least two
components is preferred. Based on a fit with three bound components to account
for the disk, relaxed halo, and the Gaia Sausage, we find the escape velocity
of the Milky Way at the solar position to be $v_{\rm{esc}}=
484.6^{+17.8}_{-7.4}$ km/s. Assuming a Navarro-Frenck-White dark matter
profile, and taken in conjunction with a recent measurement of the circular

which are evolved using a conservative finite volume approach for both

transport of photons and interactions between gas and radiation are calculated
implicitly together. An efficient Jacobi-like iteration scheme is used to solve
the implicit equations. This removes any time step constrain due to the speed
of light in RT. We evolve the specific intensities in the lab frame to simplify
the transport step. The lab-frame specific intensities are transformed to the
co-moving frame via Lorentz transformation when the source term is calculated.
Therefore, the scheme does not need any expansion in terms of $v/c$. The
radiation energy and momentum source terms for the gas are calculated via
direct quadrature in the angular space. The time step for the whole scheme is
determined by the normal Courant -- Friedrichs -- Lewy condition in the MHD
module. We provide a variety of test problems for this algorithm including both
optically thick and thin regimes, and for both gas and radiation pressure

systematically investigate the characteristics of zero-bias conductance peaks

low-energy Andreev bound states arising from smooth potential variations, and
disorder-induced subgap bound states. Our focus is on the conductance peak

robustness (plateau- or spike-like) against the tuning parameters (e.g., the
magnetic field and tunneling gate voltage) for zero-bias peaks arising from the
different mechanisms. We find that for Majoranas and quasi-Majoranas, the
zero-bias peak values are no more than $2e^2/h$, and a quantized conductance
plateau forms generically as a function of parameters. By contrast, for
conductance peaks due to low-energy Andreev bound states or disorder-induced

(ETNOs) effectively avoid direct gravitational perturbations from the four
giant planets, yet their orbital eccentricities are in the range between
0.69-0.97. Solar system dynamics studies show that such high values of the
eccentricity can be produced via close encounters or secular perturbations. In
both cases, the presence of yet-to-be-discovered trans-Plutonian planets is
required.
  Aims. If the high eccentricities of the known ETNOs are the result of
relatively recent close encounters with putative planets, the mutual nodal
distances of sizeable groups of ETNOs with their assumed perturber may still be
small enough to be identifiable geometrically. In order to confirm or reject
this possibility, we used Monte Carlo random search techniques.
  Methods. Two arbitrary orbits may lead to close encounters when their mutual
nodal distance is sufficiently small. We generated billions of random planetary
orbits with parameters within the relevant ranges and computed the mutual nodal
distances with a set of randomly generated orbits with parameters consistent
with those of the known ETNOs and their uncertainties. We monitored which
planetary orbits had the maximum number of potential close encounters with
synthetic ETNOs and we studied the resulting distributions.
  Results. We provide narrow ranges for the orbital parameters of putative
planets that may have experienced orbit-changing encounters with known ETNOs.
  Conclusions. Our calculations suggest that more than one perturber is
required if scattering is the main source of orbital modification for the known
ETNOs. Perturbers might not be located farther than 600 AU and they have to
follow moderately eccentric and inclined orbits to be capable of experiencing
close encounters with multiple known ETNOs.

reflecting the spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetry.
Here, we propose accessible signatures of these modes in harmonically trapped
spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates, where supersolidity appears in
the form of stripes. By suddenly changing the trapping frequency, an axial
breathing oscillation is generated, whose behavior changes drastically at the
critical Raman coupling. Above the transition, a single mode of hybridized
density and spin nature is excited, while below it, we predict a beating effect
signaling the excitation of a Goldstone spin-dipole mode. We further provide
evidence for the Goldstone mode associated with the translational motion of
stripes. Our results open up new perspectives for probing supersolid properties
in experimentally relevant configurations with both symmetric as well as highly
asymmetric intraspecies interactions.

spectroscopic follow-up also reveals a long-term radial velocity trend for
TOI-559, indicating a long-period companion. The statistically significant
orbital eccentricity measured for each system suggests that these planets
migrated to their current location through dynamical interactions.
Interestingly, both planets are also massive ($>3\ M_{\rm J}$), adding to the
population of massive giant planets identified by TESS. Prompted by these new
detections of high-mass planets, we analyzed the known mass distribution of hot

TESS should provide a near magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters,
allowing for future detailed population studies.

equally successful in fitting the observed electromagnetic spectral energy

and dissipation model. To this purpose, we compute the neutrino production for
a benchmark high-luminosity GRB in the internal shock model, including a
dissipative photosphere as well as three emission components, in the jet model
invoking internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence
(ICMART), in the case of a magnetic jet with gradual dissipation, and in a jet
with dominant proton synchrotron radiation. We find that the expected neutrino
fluence can vary up to three orders of magnitude in amplitude and peak at
energies ranging from $10^4$ to $10^8$ GeV. For our benchmark input parameters,
none of the explored GRB models is excluded by the targeted searches carried
out by the IceCube and ANTARES Collaborations. However, our work highlights the
potential of high-energy neutrinos of pinpointing the underlying GRB emission
mechanism and the importance of relying on different jet models for unbiased
stacking searches.

WISH targeted ~80 sources along the two axes of luminosity and evolutionary

protoplanetary disks. Lines of H2O, HDO, OH, CO and [O I] were observed with
the HIFI and PACS instruments, complemented by molecules that probe UV, X-ray
or grain chemistry. Most of the far-infrared water emission from protostars is
found to be compact, originating from warm outflowing and shocked gas at high
density and temperature in at least two physical components. This gas is not
probed by low-J CO lines, only by J>14. Water is a significant, but not
dominant, coolant. Its abundance is universally low, of order H2O/H2=2E-6,
pointing to shock and outflow cavity models that include UV radiation at
100-1000 times the ISRF. In cold quiescent pre-stellar cores and envelopes, the
water abundance structure is accurately probed through velocity-resolved line
profiles, confirming basic chemistry networks. The gaseous HDO/H2O ratio of
0.025, much higher than that of bulk ice, is representative of the outer
photodesorbed ice layers and cold chemistry. Water abundances in the inner hot
cores are high, but with variations from 5E-6 to 2E-4. Combined analyses of
water gas and ice show that up to 50% of the oxygen budget may be missing, with
possible explanations discussed. Water vapor emission from disks is weak,
indicating that water ice is locked up in larger pebbles early on and that
these pebbles have settled and drifted inward by the Class II stage.
Quantitatively, many oceans of water ice are available. Extragalactic low-J H2O
emission is mostly compact and collisionally excited. Prospects for future mid-

Hall viscoelastic response of 3D crystals. We show that for systems with
tetrahedral symmetries, there exist new, intrinsically 3D Hall viscosity

study these coefficients, we specialize to a theoretically and experimentally

interest that hosts both chiral magnets and topological semimetals (TSMs).
Using the Kubo formula for viscosity, we compute two forms of the Hall
viscosity, phonon and ``momentum'' (conventional) and show that for the
tight-binding model we consider, both forms realize the novel cubic Hall
viscosity. We conclude by discussing the implication of our results for
transport in 2D magnetic metals and discuss some candidate materials in which
these effects may be observed.

following neutron star (NS) mergers, where the main input parameters are
binary-based properties measurable by gravitational wave detectors (chirp mass
and mass ratio, orbital inclination) and properties dependent on the nuclear
equation of state (tidal deformability, maximum NS mass). This enables
synthesis of a kilonova sample for any NS source population, or determination
of the observing depth needed to detect a live kilonova given gravitational
wave source parameters in low latency. We validate this code, implemented in
the public MOSFiT package, by fitting it to GW170817. A Bayes factor analysis
overwhelmingly ($B>10^{10}$) favours the inclusion of an additional luminosity
source in addition to lanthanide-poor dynamical ejecta during the first day.
This is well fit by a shock-heated cocoon model, though differences in the
ejecta structure, opacity or nuclear heating rate cannot be ruled out as
alternatives. The emission thereafter is dominated by a lanthanide-rich viscous
wind. We find the mass ratio of the binary is $q=0.92\pm0.07$ (90% credible
interval). We place tight constraints on the maximum stable NS mass, $M_{\rm
TOV}=2.17^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ M$_\odot$. For a uniform prior in tidal
deformability, the radius of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS is $R_{1.4}\sim 10.7$ km.
Re-weighting with a prior based on equations of state that support our credible
range in $M_{\rm TOV}$, we derive a final measurement
$R_{1.4}=11.06^{+1.01}_{-0.98}$ km. Applying our code to the second
gravitationally-detected neutron star merger, GW190425, we estimate that an
associated kilonova would have been fainter (by $\sim0.7$ mag at one day
post-merger) and declined faster than GW170817, underlining the importance of
tuning follow-up strategies individually for each GW-detected NS merger.

breaking have been experimentally observed in one dimension. Here, we find that
non-Bloch PT symmetry in two and higher dimensions exhibits drastically

PT breaking and one-dimensional non-Bloch PT breaking generally have nonzero
thresholds in the large-size limit, the threshold of two and higher-dimensional
non-Bloch PT breaking universally approaches zero as the system size increases.
A product measure, namely the product of bare non-Hermiticity and system size,
is introduced to quantify the PT breaking tendency. This product being small is
required for the perturbation theory to be valid, thus its growth with system
size causes the breakdown of perturbation theory, which underlies the universal
threshold. That the universal behaviors emerge only in two and higher
dimensions indicates an unexpected interplay among PT symmetry, non-Hermitian
skin effect, and spatial dimensionality. Our predictions can be confirmed on

presence of a large macroalgal farm using a Large Eddy Simulation method. The
wave-current interactions are modelled by solving the wave-averaged equations.
The hydrodynamic process over the farm is found to drive a persistent flow
pattern similar to Langmuir circulations but is locked in space across the
farm. These secondary circulations are generated because the cross-stream shear
produced by the rows of canopy elements leads to a steady vertical vorticity
field, which is then rotated to the downstream direction under the effect of
vortex force. Since the driving mechanism is similar to the CraikLeibovich type
2 instability theory, these secondary circulations are also termed as attached
Langmuir circulations. We then apply a triple decomposition on the flow field
to unveil the underlying kinematics and energy transfer between the mean flow,
the secondary flow resulting from the farm drag, and the transient eddies. Flow
visualizations and statistics suggest that the attached Langmuir circulations
result from the adjustment of the upper ocean mixed layer to the macroalgal
farm, and they will weaken (if not disappear) when the flow reaches an
equilibrium state within the farm. The tripledecomposed energy budgets reveal
that the energy of the secondary flow is transferred from the mean flow under
the action of canopy drag, while the transient eddies feed on wave energy
transferred by the Stokes drift and energy conversion from the secondary flow.

way the late-time dynamics of scalar coupled $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity.
Particularly, we consider a Gauss-Bonnet term coupled to the scalar field
coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, and we study three types of models, one with
$f(R)$ terms that are known to provide a viable late-time phenomenology, and
two Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet types of models. Our aim is to write the Friedmann
equation in terms of appropriate statefinder quantities frequently used in the
literature, and we numerically solve it by using physically motivated initial
conditions. In the case that $f(R)$ gravity terms are present, the contribution
of the Gauss-Bonnet related terms is minor, as we actually expected. This
result is robust against changes in the initial conditions of the scalar field,
and the reason is the dominating parts of the $f(R)$ gravity sector at late
times. In the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet type of models, we examine two distinct
scenarios, firstly by choosing freely the scalar potential and the scalar
Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\xi(\phi)$, in which case the resulting phenomenology is
compatible with the latest Planck data and mimics the
$\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. In the second case, since there is no
fundamental particle physics reason for the graviton to change its mass, we
assume that primordially the tensor perturbations propagate with the speed
equal to that of light's, and thus this constraint restricts the functional
form of the scalar coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, which must satisfy the
differential equation $\ddot{\xi}=H\dot{\xi}$.

relieve the issue of rigid data structures present in relational databases, by
introducing semi-structured and flexible schema design. As current data
generated by different sources and devices, especially from IoT sensors and
actuators, use either XML or JSON format, depending on the application,
database technologies that store and query semi-structured data in XML format
are needed. Thus, Native XML Databases, which were initially designed to
manipulate XML data using standardized querying languages, i.e., XQuery and
XPath, were rebranded as NoSQL Document-Oriented Databases Systems. Currently,
the majority of these solutions have been replaced with the more modern JSON
based Database Management Systems. However, we believe that XML-based solutions
can still deliver performance in executing complex queries on heterogeneous
collections. Unfortunately nowadays, research lacks a clear comparison of the
scalability and performance for database technologies that store and query
documents in XML versus the more modern JSON format. Moreover, to the best of
our knowledge, there are no Big Data-compliant benchmarks for such database
technologies. In this paper, we present a comparison for selected
Document-Oriented Database Systems that either use the XML format to encode
documents, i.e., BaseX, eXist-db, and Sedna, or the JSON format, i.e., MongoDB,
CouchDB, and Couchbase. To underline the performance differences we also
propose a benchmark that uses a heterogeneous complex schema on a large DBLP

clusters is now well established, but their detailed origin remains unclear.
Cosmic ray protons are also expected to accumulate during the formation of
clusters and would lead to gamma-ray emission through hadronic interactions
within the thermal gas. Recently, the detection of gamma-ray emission has been
reported toward the Coma cluster with Fermi-LAT. Assuming that this gamma-ray
emission arises from hadronic interactions in the ICM, we aim at exploring the
implication of this signal on the cosmic ray content of the Coma cluster. We
use the MINOT software to build a physical model of the cluster and apply it to
the Fermi-LAT data. We also consider contamination from compact sources and the
impact of various systematic effects. We confirm that a significant gamma-ray
signal is observed within the characteristic radius $\theta_{500}$ of the Coma
cluster, with a test statistic TS~27 for our baseline model. The presence of a
possible point source may account for most of the observed signal. However,
this source could also correspond to the peak of the diffuse emission of the
cluster itself and extended models match the data better. We constrain the
cosmic ray to thermal energy ratio within $R_{500}$ to $X_{\rm
CRp}=1.79^{+1.11}_{-0.30}$\% and the slope of the energy spectrum of cosmic
rays to $\alpha=2.80^{+0.67}_{-0.13}$. Finally, we compute the synchrotron
emission associated with the secondary electrons produced in hadronic
interactions assuming steady state. This emission is about four times lower
than the overall observed radio signal, so that primary cosmic ray electrons or
reacceleration of secondary electrons is necessary to explain the total
emission. Assuming an hadronic origin of the signal, our results provide the
first quantitative measurement of the cosmic ray proton content in a
cluster.[Abridged]

been a challenge, in particular because the ""normal"" state from which it
evolves is unprecedented. Now, after three and a half decades of research,
involving a wide range of experimental characterizations, it is possible to
delineate a clear and consistent cuprate story. It starts with doping holes
into a charge-transfer insulator, resulting in in-gap states. These states
exhibit a pseudogap resulting from the competition between antiferromagnetic
superexchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor Cu atoms (a real-space interaction)
and the kinetic energy of the doped holes, which, in the absence of
interactions, would lead to extended Bloch-wave states whose occupancy is
characterized in reciprocal space. To develop some degree of coherence on
cooling, the spin and charge correlations must self-organize in a cooperative
fashion. A specific example of resulting emergent order is that of spin and
charge stripes, as observed in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$. While stripe order
frustrates bulk superconductivity, it nevertheless develops pairing and
superconducting order of an unusual character. The antiphase order of the spin
stripes decouples them from the charge stripes, which can be viewed as
hole-doped, two-leg, spin-$\frac12$ ladders. To achieve superconducting order,
the pair correlations in neighboring ladders must develop phase order. In the
presence of spin stripe order, antiphase Josephson coupling can lead to
pair-density-wave superconductivity. Alternatively, in-phase superconductivity
requires that the spin stripes have an energy gap, which empirically limits the
coherent superconducting gap. Hence, superconducting order in the cuprates
involves a compromise between the pairing scale, which is maximized at
$x\sim\frac18$, and phase coherence, which is optimized at $x\sim0.2$.

Heterogeneity is modeled as quenched disorders in the parameters of the car

low densities, the relaxation to stationary state from a homogeneous initial
state is governed by the same power laws as derived by E. Ben-Naim et al.,
Kinetics of clustering in traffic flow, Phys. Rev. E 50, 822 (1994). The
stationary state, at low densities, is a single giant platoon of vehicles with
the slowest vehicle being the leader. We observed formation of spontaneous jams
inside the giant platoon which move upstream as stop-go waves and dissipate at
its tail. The transition happens when the head of the giant platoon interacts
with its tail, stable stop-go waves form, which circulate in the ring without
dissipating. We observed that the system behaves differently when the
transition density is approached from above that it does when approached from
below. When the transition density is approached from below, the gap
distribution behind the leader has a double peak and is fat-tailed but has a
bounded support and thus the maximum gap in the system and the variance of the
gap distribution tend to size-independent values. When the transition density
is approached from above, the gap distribution becomes a power law and,
consequently, the maximum gap in the system and the variance in the gaps
diverge as a power law, thereby creating a discontinuity at the transition.
Thus, we observe a phase transition of unusual kind in which both a
discontinuity and a power law are observed at the transition density. These
unusual features vanish in the absence of reaction time (e.g., automated
driving).

have so far prevented their direct experimental reconstruction. In high-order
sideband generation [2-9], electrons and holes generated in semiconductors by a
near-infrared laser are accelerated to a high kinetic energy by a strong
terahertz field, and recollide to emit near-infrared sidebands before they are
scattered. Here we reconstruct the Bloch wavefunctions of two types of hole in
gallium arsenide at wavelengths much longer than the spacing between atoms by
experimentally measuring sideband polarizations and introducing an elegant
theory that ties those polarizations to quantum interference between different
recollision pathways. These Bloch wavefunctions are compactly visualized on the
surface of a sphere. High-order sideband generation can, in principle, be
observed from any direct-gap semiconductor or insulator. We thus expect that
the method introduced here can be used to reconstruct low-energy Bloch
wavefunctions in many of these materials, enabling important insights into the

First, we show that the stability and performance of a polynomial dynamical

activation functions (e.g., ReLU) can be certified by convex semidefinite
programming. The result is based on the fact that the semialgebraic

establish a converse result on the existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function

conditioned on information only observed by them. On the other hand, humans
readily form beliefs about the knowledge possessed by their peers and leverage
beliefs to inform decision-making. Such abilities underlie individual success
in a wide range of Markov games, from bluffing in Poker to conditional
cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, to convention-building in Bridge.
Classical methods are usually not applicable to complex domains due to the
intractable nature of hierarchical beliefs (i.e. beliefs of other agents'
beliefs). We propose a scalable method to approximate these belief structures
using recursive deep generative models, and to use the belief models to obtain
representations useful to acting in complex tasks. Our agents trained with
belief models outperform model-free baselines with equivalent representational
capacity using common training paradigms. We also show that higher-order belief
models outperform agents with lower-order models.

approach for large-eddy simulations. In particular, we consider a
multi-dimensional upwind scheme for the vorticity transport equations and
establish its properties in the under-resolved regime. The asymptotic behavior
of key turbulence statistics of velocity gradients, vorticity, and invariants
is studied in detail. Modified equation analysis indicates that dissipation can
be controlled locally via non-linear limiting of the gradient employed for the
vorticity reconstruction on the cell face such that low numerical diffusion is
obtained in well-resolved regimes and high numerical diffusion is realized in
under-resolved regions. The enstrophy budget highlights the remarkable ability
of the truncation terms to mimic the true sub-grid scale dissipation and
diffusion. The modified equation also reveals diffusive terms that are similar
to several commonly employed sub-grid scale models including tensor-gradient
and hyper-viscosity models. Investigations on several canonical turbulence flow
cases show that large-scale features are adequately represented and remain
consistent in terms of spectral energy over a range of grid resolutions.
Numerical dissipation in under-resolved simulations is consistent and can be
characterized by diffusion terms discovered in the modified equation analysis.
A minimum state of scale separation necessary to obtain asymptotic behavior is
characterized using metrics such as effective Reynolds number and effective
grid spacing. Temporally-evolving jet simulations, characterized by large-scale
vortical structures, demonstrate that high Reynolds number vortex-dominated
flows are captured when criteria is met and necessitate diffusive non-linear
limiting of vorticity reconstruction be employed to realize accuracy in
under-resolved simulations.

original performances and a test set containing tempo-scaled versions rendered

generalises nearly perfectly to unseen tempi (F-measure of 0.89 on both

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. The level of contamination
caused by these systematics is often linked to the scan strategy, and scan
strategies for satellite experiments can significantly mitigate these
systematics. However, no detailed study has been performed for ground-based
experiments. Here we show that under the assumption of constant elevation scans
(CESs), the ability of the scan strategy to mitigate these systematics is
strongly limited, irrespective of the detailed structure of the scan strategy.
We calculate typical values and maps of the quantities coupling the scan to the
systematics, and show how these quantities vary with the choice of observing
elevations. These values and maps can be used to calculate and forecast the
magnitude of different instrumental systematics without requiring detailed scan
strategy simulations. As a reference point, we show that inclusion of even a
single boresight rotation angle significantly improves over sky rotation alone
for mitigating these systematics. A standard metric for evaluating
cross-linking is related to one of the parameters studied in this work, so a
corollary of our work is that the cross-linking will suffer from the same CES
limitations and therefore upcoming CMB surveys will unavoidably have poorly
cross-linked regions if they use CESs, regardless of detailed scheduling
choices. Our results are also relevant for non-CMB surveys that perform
constant elevation scans and may have scan-coupled systematics, such as

  A propensity score approach","30 pages, 5 figures and 1 table",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Subgroup analyses are frequently conducted in randomized clinical
trials to assess evidence of heterogeneous treatment effect across patient
subpopulations. Although randomization balances covariates within subgroups in
expectation, chance imbalance may be amplified in small subgroups and harm the
precision. Covariate adjustment in overall analysis of RCT is often conducted,
via either ANCOVA or propensity score weighting, but for subgroup analysis has
been rarely discussed. In this article, we develop propensity score weighting
methodology for covariate adjustment to improve the precision and power of
subgroup analyses in RCTs. Methods: We extend the propensity score weighting
methodology to subgroup analyses by fitting a logistic propensity model with
pre-specified covariate-subgroup interactions. We show that, by construction,
overlap weighting exactly balances the covariates with interaction terms in
each subgroup. Extensive simulations were performed to compare the operating
characteristics of unadjusted, different propensity score weighting and the
ANCOVA estimator. We apply these methods to the HF-ACTION trial to evaluate the
effect of exercise training on 6-minute walk test in pre-specified subgroups.
Results: Standard errors of the adjusted estimators are smaller than those of
the unadjusted estimator. The propensity score weighting estimator is as
efficient as ANCOVA, and is often more efficient when subgroup sample size is
small (e.g.<125), and/or when outcome model is misspecified. The weighting
estimators with full-interaction propensity model consistently outperform the
standard main-effect propensity model. Conclusion: Propensity score weighting
is a transparent and objective method to adjust chance imbalance of important
covariates in subgroup analyses of RCTs. It is crucial to include the full
covariate-subgroup interactions in the propensity score model.

scenario of large stau mixing. Here we study the performance of such search

decays of both the CP-even and CP-odd heavy Higgs bosons contribute to the
production of $\widetilde{\tau}_1\widetilde{\tau}_2^{*} \;+\; c.c$ pairs.
Again, we focus on final states with two opposite-sign tau leptons and large
missing transverse energy. We find that our proposed search strategy, although
optimized for the large stau mixing scenario, is still quite sensitive to the
complementary mixing pattern. For instance, with a total integrated luminosity
of only 100 fb$^{-1}$ we are able to exclude heavy Higgs masses above 850 GeV
for average stau masses higher than 290 GeV. We also extend the results
reported in the preceding work for the large mixing scenario by including now
the exclusion limits at 100 fb$^{-1}$ and the prospects both for exclusion and
discovery in a potential high luminosity phase of the LHC (1000 fb$^{-1}$).
Finally, we discuss the possibility to distinguish the two mixing scenarios

reliability, which is defined as the invariability of the service attributes.
Preventive measures taken during planning can reduce risks of unreliability
throughout operations. In order to tackle reliability during the service
planning phase, a key piece of information is the long-term prediction of the
density of the travel time, which conveys the uncertainty of travel times. We
introduce a reliable approach to one of the problems of service planning in
public transport, namely the Multiple Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MDVSP),
which takes as input a set of trips and the probability density function
(p.d.f.) of the travel time of each trip in order to output delay-tolerant
vehicle schedules. This work empirically compares probabilistic models for the
prediction of the conditional p.d.f. of the travel time, as a first step
towards reliable MDVSP solutions. Two types of probabilistic models, namely
similarity-based density estimation models and a smoothed Logistic Regression
for probabilistic classification model, are compared on a dataset of more than
41,000 trips and 50 bus routes of the city of Montr\'eal. The result of a vast

that high quality embeddings can be produced without the popular step-wise

our algorithm is that a node should be similar to its neighbors, without
explicitly pushing disconnected nodes apart. The objective is achieved by
iterative weighted averaging of node neigbors' embeddings, followed by
normalization across dimensions. Thanks to the averaging operation the
algorithm makes rapid strides across the embedding space and usually reaches
optimal embeddings in just a few iterations. Cleora runs faster than other
state-of-the-art CPU algorithms and produces embeddings of competitive quality

and ejected at speeds exceeding the impact velocity. Jetting is an important
process for producing melt during relatively low velocity impacts. How impact
angle affects the jetting process has yet to be fully understood. Here, we
simulate jetting during oblique impacts using the iSALE shock physics code.
Assuming both the target and impactor have the same composition (dunite), we
examine the jetted material which exceeds the impact velocity. Our results show
that oblique impacts always produce more jetted ejecta than vertical impacts,
except for grazing impacts with impact angles $< 15^{\circ}$. A 45$^{\circ}$
impact with an impact velocity of 3 km/s produces jetted material equal to
$\sim$ 7 \% of the impactor mass. This is 6 times the jetted mass produced by a
vertical impact with similar impact conditions. We also find that the origin of
jetted ejecta depends on impact angle; for impact angles less than
45$^{\circ}$, most of the jet is composed of impactor material, while at higher
impact angles the jet is dominated by target material. Our findings are
consistent with previous experimental work. In all cases, jetted materials are
preferentially distributed downrange of the impactor.

low observability. One key concept that facilitates human coordination in such

the learning dynamics and emergence of temporal conventions, focusing on
common-pool resources. Extra emphasis was given in designing a realistic

their own history, and (c) we run large-scale simulations (up to 64 agents).

the number of agents grow, the probability of taking a correct gradient
direction decreases exponentially. By introducing an arbitrary common signal
(e.g., date, time, or any periodic set of numbers) as a means to couple the
learning process, we show that temporal conventions can emerge and agents reach
sustainable harvesting strategies. The introduction of the signal consistently

Consequently, verification time dominates implementation time. The gold
standard in hardware Design Verification (DV) is concentrated at two extremes:
random dynamic verification and formal verification. Both struggle to root out
the subtle flaws in complex hardware that often manifest as security
vulnerabilities. The root problem with random verification is its undirected
nature, making it inefficient, while formal verification is constrained by the
state-space explosion problem, making it infeasible against complex designs.
What is needed is a solution that is directed, yet under-constrained.
  Instead of making incremental improvements to existing DV approaches, we
leverage the observation that existing software fuzzers already provide such a
solution, and adapt them for hardware DV. Specifically, we translate RTL
hardware to a software model and fuzz that model. The central challenge we
address is how best to mitigate the differences between the hardware execution

than that of the CMB, we consider two different reionization histories for our

bias on the inferred parameter means and 1-$\sigma$ credible intervals can be
substantially reduced by using the isosceles bispectrum (calculated for a wide

simplifying assumption of a Gaussian likelihood with a diagonal covariance

a wide set of problem cases. This inspired dozens of variations of his
definition of actual causation, the most prominent of which are due to Halpern
& Pearl. Yet all of them ignore Pearl's first strategy, and the second strategy
taken by itself is unable to deliver a consensus. This paper offers a way out
by going back to the first strategy: it offers six formal definitions of causal
sufficiency and two interpretations of necessity. Combining the two gives
twelve new definitions of actual causation. Several interesting results about
these definitions and their relation to the various Halpern & Pearl definitions
are presented. Afterwards the second strategy is evaluated as well. In order to
maximize neutrality, the paper relies mostly on the examples and intuitions of
Halpern & Pearl. One definition comes out as being superior to all others, and
is therefore suggested as a new definition of actual causation.

that involves the interplay of the unique counterflow heat-transfer mode, the
emission of second-sound waves, and the creation of quantized vortices. Many
past researches focused on homogeneous heat transfer of He II in a uniform
channel driven by a planar heater. In this paper, we report our systematic
study of He II transient heat transfer in nonhomogeneous geometries that are
pertinent to emergent applications. By solving the He II two-fluid equation of
motion coupled with the Vinen's equation for vortex-density evolution, we
examine and compare the characteristics of transient heat transfer from planar,
cylindrical, and spherical heaters in He II. Our results show that as the
heater turns on, an outgoing second-sound pulse emerges, in which the vortex
density grows rapidly. These vortices attenuate the second sound and result in
a heated He II layer in front of the heater, i.e., the thermal layer. In the
planar case where the vortices are created throughout the space, the
second-sound pulse is continuously attenuated, leading to a strong thermal
layer that diffusively spreads following the heat pulse. On the contrary, in
the cylindrical and the spherical heater cases, vortices are created mainly in
a thin thermal layer near the heater surface. As the heat pulse ends, a
rarefaction tail develops following the second-sound pulse, in which the
temperature drops. This rarefaction tail can promptly suppress the thermal
layer and take away all the thermal energy deposited in it. The effects of the
heater size, heat flux, pulse duration, and temperature on the thermal-layer
dynamics are discussed. We also show how the peak heat flux for the onset of
boiling in He II can be studied in our model.

autonomous racing, where technological development is accelerated by the high
speeds and competitive environment of motorsport. A particular challenge for an
autonomous vehicle is that of identifying a target trajectory - or, in the case
of a competition vehicle, the racing line. Many existing approaches to finding
the racing line are either not time-optimal solutions, or are computationally
expensive - rendering them unsuitable for real-time application using on-board
processing hardware. This study describes a machine learning approach to
generating an accurate prediction of the racing line in real-time on desktop
processing hardware. The proposed algorithm is a feed-forward neural network,
trained using a dataset comprising racing lines for a large number of circuits
calculated via traditional optimal control lap time simulation. The network
predicts the racing line with a mean absolute error of +/-0.27m, and just
+/-0.11m at corner apex - comparable to human drivers, and autonomous vehicle
control subsystems. The approach generates predictions within 33ms, making it
over 9,000 times faster than traditional methods of finding the optimal
trajectory. Results suggest that for certain applications data-driven
approaches to find near-optimal racing lines may be favourable to traditional
computational methods.

are critical for benchmarking progress in fair computer vision, and often
employ broad racial categories as population groups for measuring group
fairness. Similarly, diversity is often measured in computer vision datasets by
ascribing and counting categorical race labels. However, racial categories are
ill-defined, unstable temporally and geographically, and have a problematic
history of scientific use. Although the racial categories used across datasets
are superficially similar, the complexity of human race perception suggests the
racial system encoded by one dataset may be substantially inconsistent with
another. Using the insight that a classifier can learn the racial system
encoded by a dataset, we conduct an empirical study of computer vision datasets
supplying categorical race labels for face images to determine the
cross-dataset consistency and generalization of racial categories. We find that
each dataset encodes a substantially unique racial system, despite nominally
equivalent racial categories, and some racial categories are systemically less
consistent than others across datasets. We find evidence that racial categories
encode stereotypes, and exclude ethnic groups from categories on the basis of
nonconformity to stereotypes. Representing a billion humans under one racial
category may obscure disparities and create new ones by encoding stereotypes of
racial systems. The difficulty of adequately converting the abstract concept of
race into a tool for measuring fairness underscores the need for a method more
flexible and culturally aware than racial categories.

relative error approximation of the optimum? While this problem has been
extensively studied for least squares regression, little is known for other
losses. An important example is least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$
regression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers compared to least
squares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling methods
in regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity of
least absolute deviation regression is $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ up to logarithmic
factors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query
complexity for any $\ell_p$ loss with $p\in(1,2)$. As a key novelty in our
analysis, we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new
approximation guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform
convergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a
correction term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This can be
viewed as a new connection between statistical learning theory and variance
reduction techniques in stochastic optimization, which should be of independent
interest.

learning methods can be applied to model and understand financial products. We
focus on residential mortgage backed securities, resMBS, which were at the
heart of the 2008 US financial crisis. These securities are contained within a
prospectus and have a complex waterfall payoff structure. Multiple financial
institutions form a supply chain to create prospectuses. To model this supply
chain, we use unsupervised probabilistic methods, particularly dynamic topics
models (DTM), to extract a set of features (topics) reflecting community
formation and temporal evolution along the chain. We then provide insight into
the performance of the resMBS securities and the impact of the supply chain
through a series of increasingly comprehensive models. First, models at the
security level directly identify salient features of resMBS securities that
impact their performance. We then extend the model to include prospectus level
features and demonstrate that the composition of the prospectus is significant.
Our model also shows that communities along the supply chain that are
associated with the generation of the prospectuses and securities have an
impact on performance. We are the first to show that toxic communities that are
closely linked to financial institutions that played a key role in the subprime
crisis can increase the risk of failure of resMBS securities.

Lambda platform. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) a key enabler of serverless
computing allows an application to be decomposed into simple, standalone
functions that are executed on a FaaS platform. The FaaS platform is
responsible for deploying and facilitating resources to the functions. Several
of today's cloud applications spread over heterogeneous connected computing
resources and are highly dynamic in their structure and resource requirements.
However, FaaS platforms are limited to homogeneous clusters and homogeneous
functions and do not account for the data access behavior of functions before
scheduling.
  We introduce an extension of FaaS to heterogeneous clusters and to support
heterogeneous functions through a network of distributed heterogeneous target
platforms called Function Delivery Network (FDN). A target platform is a
combination of a cluster of homogeneous nodes and a FaaS platform on top of it.
FDN provides Function-Delivery-as-a-Service (FDaaS), delivering the function to
the right target platform. We showcase the opportunities such as varied target
platform's characteristics, possibility of collaborative execution between
multiple target platforms, and localization of data that the FDN offers in
fulfilling two objectives: Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements and
energy efficiency when scheduling functions by evaluating over five distributed
target platforms using the FDNInspector, a tool developed by us for
benchmarking distributed target platforms. Scheduling functions on an edge
target platform in our evaluation reduced the overall energy consumption by 17x
without violating the SLO requirements in comparison to scheduling on a
high-end target platform.

$f(q,p,t)$, the expected phase-space density of particles. The distribution
function evolves according to the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the high
Knudsen number limit. Fluid dynamics is an alternative description of the gas
using hydrodynamic variables that are functions of position and time only.
These hydrodynamic variables evolve according to the compressible Euler
equations in the inviscid limit. Both systems are noncanonical Hamiltonian
systems. Each configuration space is an infinite-dimensional Poisson manifold,
and the dynamics is the flow generated by a Hamiltonian functional via a
Poisson bracket. We construct a map $\mathcal{J}_1$ from the space of
distribution functions to the space of hydrodynamic variables that respects the
Poisson brackets on the two spaces i.e. a Poisson map. It maps the $p$-integral
of the Boltzmann entropy $f\log f$ to the hydrodynamic entropy density. This
map belongs to a family of Poisson maps to spaces that include generalised
entropy densities as additional hydrodynamic variables. The whole family can be
generated from the Taylor expansion of a further Poisson map that depends on a
formal parameter. If the kinetic-theory Hamiltonian factors through the Poisson
map $\mathcal{J}_1$, an exact reduction of kinetic theory to fluid dynamics is
possible. This is not the case, but by ignoring the relative entropy of $f$ to
its local Maxwellian, we can construct an approximate Hamiltonian that factors
through the map. The resulting reduced Hamiltonian generates the compressible
Euler equations. We can thus derive the compressible Euler equations as a
Hamiltonian approximation to kinetic theory. We also give an analogous
Hamiltonian derivation of the compressible Euler--Poisson equations with
non-constant entropy, starting from the Vlasov--Poisson equation.

side effects. While the anti and proarrhythmic potential of a Na+ channel
blocker is thought to depend on the characteristics of its rate-dependent
block, the mechanisms linking these two attributes are unclear. Furthermore,
how specific properties of rate-dependent block arise from the binding kinetics
of a particular drug is poorly understood. Here, we examine the rate-dependent
effects of the Na+ channel blocker lidocaine by constructing and analyzing a
novel drug-channel interaction model. First, we identify the predominant mode
of lidocaine binding in a 24 variable Markov model for lidocaine-Na+ channel
interaction by Moreno et al. We then develop a novel 3-variable lidocaine-Na+
channel interaction model that incorporates only the predominant mode of drug
binding. Our low-dimensional model replicates the extensive voltage-clamp data
used to parameterize the Moreno et al. model. Furthermore, the effects of
lidocaine on action potential upstroke velocity and conduction velocity in our
model are similar to those predicted by the Moreno et al. model. By exploiting
the low-dimensionality of our model, we derive an algebraic expression for
level of rate-dependent block as a function of pacing frequency, restitution
properties, diastolic and plateau potentials, and drug binding rate constants.
Our model predicts that the level of rate-dependent block is sensitive to
alterations in restitution properties and increases in diastolic potential, but
it is insensitive to variations in the shape of the action potential waveform

study briefly the quantum Taub models when an $e^{ \phi}$ potential and aligned

that our aligned electromagnetic field, depending on how strong it is, can
create or destroy geometric states in our 'excited' state wave functions that
quantum Bianchi IX universes can tunnel in and out of. This creation of a state
is somewhat similar to how non-commutativity in the minisuperspace variables
can cause new quantum states to emerge in the quantum Kantowski-Sachs and
Bianchi I models. Our results further show the utility of the

  Coal Mines: An Appraisal",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coalbed methane embedded in coal seams, is an unconventional energy resource
as well as a hazardous gas existing in mining industries, which attracts lots
of global attention. As the largest coal producer, the mining industry in China
had to deal with many hazards induced by methane for decades. To solve this
issue, underground methane extraction is commonly used in underground coal
mines. However, underground methane extraction is hampered by low production
rate and low efficiency because of slow gas emission from coal primarily
controlled by gas desorption and permeability. It is well known that
temperature has a great impact on gas sorption. The higher the temperature the
larger the desorption rate. As the depth of coal mines increases beyond 1000m
coal mines suffer elevated air temperatures caused by the natural geothermal
gradient. The elevated temperature in such mines provides a potential
economical way for geothermal energy extraction and utilization in deep coal
mines which can largely cut the expenses of installation and operation
maintenance. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to enhance underground
methane extraction by deep heat stimulation. This paper mainly presents an
assessment of previous and ongoing research in the related field and provides a
first feasibility analysis of this method applied in the underground
environment. The technique proposed in this early appraisal is deemed
significant for coalbed methane drainage enhancing the productivity of deep
coal mines by geothermal technology and can also be extended for many
applications in relevant areas such as shale gas, and tight oil.

inhomogeneous superconductivity, where the Cooper pairs have finite
center-of-mass momenta. Recently, the high-field SC phase was observed in FeSe,
and it was deemed to originate from the FFLO state. Here, we synthesize FeSe
single crystals with different levels of disorder. The level of disorder is
expressed by the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length and ranges
between 35 and 1.2. The upper critical field \textit{B}$_{\rm{c}2}$ was
obtained by both resistivity and magnetic torque measurements over a wide range
of temperatures, which went as low as $\sim$0.5 K, and magnetic fields, which
went up to $\sim$38 T along the \textit{c} axis and in the \textit{ab} plane.
In the high-field region parallel to the \textit{ab} plane, an unusual SC phase
was confirmed in all the crystals, and the phase was found to be robust against

scope of these works by: (i) including $40$ cation- and anion-$\pi$ complexes,
a fundamentally important class of non-covalent interactions (NCIs) that are
found throughout nature and pose a substantial challenge to theory, and (ii)
systematically sampling all $141$ intermolecular potential energy surfaces
(PES) by simultaneously varying the intermolecular distance and intermolecular

in NENCI-2021 were generated by sampling seven intermolecular distances along
each PES (ranging from $0.7\times\mathrm{-}1.1\times$ the equilibrium
separation) as well as nine intermolecular angles per distance (five for each

distances are also present in NENCI-2021, where close intermolecular contacts
involving atoms that are located within the so-called van der Waals envelope
are prevalent -- these interactions in particular pose an enormous challenge

Bounded Model Checking (BMC) techniques can detect security vulnerabilities in
the early stages of development processes. However, this technique struggles to
scale up and verify large software commonly found on computer-based systems.
Here, we develop and evaluate a pragmatic approach to verify large software
systems using a state-of-the-art bounded model checker. In particular, we
pre-process the input source-code files and then guide the model checker to
explore the code systematically. We also present a multi-core implementation of
the k-induction proof algorithm to verify and falsify large software systems
iteratively. Our experimental results using the Efficient SMT-based Model
Checker (ESBMC) show that our approach can guide ESBMC to efficiently verify
large software systems. We evaluate our approach using the PuTTY application to
verify 136 files and 2803 functions in less than 86 minutes, and the SlimGuard
allocator, where we have found real security vulnerabilities confirmed by the
developers. We conclude that our approach can successfully guide a bounded
model checker to verify large software systems systematically.

challenging task. This is usually overcome by assuming an idealized Hamiltonian

recently, however, few of them have applications in games. Current game
character customization systems either require players to manually adjust
considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited
freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic
character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from
a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games.
Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D
faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the
meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods
require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such
datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected
under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations.
To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition
method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM
mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction
networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game
characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence
of lighting and occlusions. Experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods used in games.

Carlo methods with SurVAE Flows to sample from discrete distributions using a

continuous embedding of the discrete space using a surjective map and
subsequently learns a bijective transformation from the continuous space to an
approximately Gaussian distributed latent variable. Sampling proceeds by
simulating MCMC chains in the latent space and mapping these samples to the
target discrete space via the learned transformations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our algorithm on a range of examples from statistics, computational

on electrostatic models in one dimension. We describe kernel density estimation
for continuous values of the spatial variable, $x$, and compute the covariance
matrix for uniform true density. The band width of the covariance matrix is
related to the width of the kernel. We find the presence of constant negative
terms in the elements of the covariance matrix both on and off-diagonal. These
negative correlations are related to the fact that the total number of
particles is fixed at each time step. The effect of these negative correlations
on the electric field, computed by Gauss's law, is that the noise in the
electric field is related to a process called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge.
  For non-constant density still with continuous $x$, we analyze the total
error in the density estimation and discuss it in terms of bias-variance
optimization (BVO). For some characteristic length $l$ and kernel width $h$,
having too few particles within $h$ leads to too much variance; for $h$ large
relative to $l$, there is too much smoothing of the density. The optimum
between these two limits is found by BVO.
  We repeat the analysis for $x$ discretized on a grid, connecting particle
shapes and estimation kernels. If the particle shape satisfies a sum rule, the
charge deposited on the grid is conserved exactly. Particle shapes expressed as
the convolution of a kernel with another kernel that satisfies the sum rule
also obey the sum rule. This property holds for kernels of arbitrary width,
including widths that are not integer multiples of the grid spacing.
  We show good agreement with numerical computations.

and quantile transformation of data without local information. These are core
techniques that can serve as building blocks for applications that require
specifying the sample distribution of a given set of data. Histogram
specification is best known for its image enhancement applications, whereas
quantile transformation is typically employed in data preprocessing for data
normalization. In signal processing, methods often require temporal or spatial
information; in data preprocessing, methods work by interpolation or by
approximation, drawing from results in computational statistics, and have a
trade-off between speed and quality. It is nontrivial to accommodate for cases
that do not have local information (e.g., tabular data) while also providing a
fast, exact solution. For that, we take up a concept in image processing called
group mapping law and propose an extension. The proposed extension allows us to
formulate a convex functional where we look for the best approximation between
the output unique values and the reference histogram. Then, we apply the
ordered assignment solution, a result in optimal transport, to reconstruct the
output from the optimal unique values. Two sets of results show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms when compared to traditional and
state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithms are fast, exact, and least

from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to
household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G

(e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream
parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits
between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more
palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these
inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective
of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why
Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of
non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why
targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable

to modulate the interfacial tension of gallium-based alloys. These alloys,
which are liquid at ambient conditions, have the largest interfacial tension of
any liquid at room temperature. The ability to modulate the tension offers the
possibility to create forces that change the shape and position of the metal.
It has been known since the late 1800s that electrocapillarity-the use of
potential to modulate the electric double layer on the surface of metals in
electrolyte-lowers the interfacial tension of liquid metal. Yet, this
phenomenon can only achieve modest changes in interfacial tension since it is
limited to potential windows that avoid reactions. A recent discovery suggests
that reactions driven by the electrochemical oxidation of gallium alloys cause
the interfacial tension to decrease from ~500 mN/m at 0 V to ~0 mN/m at ~0.8 V,
a change in tension that goes well beyond what is possible via conventional
electrocapillarity or surfactants. The changes in tension are reversible;
reductive potentials return the metal back to a state of high interfacial
tension. This report aims to summarize key work and introduce beginners to this
field by including electrochemistry basics while addressing misconceptions. We
discuss applications that utilize modulations in interfacial tension of liquid
metal and conclude with remaining opportunities and challenges that need
further investigation.

change of agents' opinions with the bounded confidence threshold $\varepsilon$.
To consider the heterogeneity of agents in characteristics, we study the HK
model on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks by introducing a kind of smart
agent. Different from the averaging rule in opinion update of HK model, smart
agents will consider, in updating their opinions, the environmental influence
following the fact that an agent's behavior is often coupled with environmental
changes. The environment is characterized by a parameter that represents the
biased resource allocation between different cliques. We focus on the critical
behavior of the underlying system. A phase transition point separating a
complete consensus from the coexistence of different opinions is identified,
which occurs at a critical value $\varepsilon_c$ for the bounded confidence
threshold. We state analytically that $\varepsilon_c$ can take only one of two
possible values, depending on the behavior of the average degree $k_a$ of a
social graph, when agents are homogeneous in characteristics. Results also
suggest that the phase transition point weakly depends on the network structure
but is strongly correlated with the fraction of smart agents and the
environmental parameter. We finally establish the finite size scaling law that
stresses the role that the system size has in the underlying opinion dynamics.
Meanwhile, introducing smart agents does not change the functional dependence
between the time to reach a complete consensus and the system size. However, it
can drive a complete consensus to be reached faster, for homogeneous networks
that are far from the mean field limit.

described by the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) Hamiltonian with nearest
neighbour hopping, undergoes metal to insulator transition (MIT) at a critical
strength of the quasi-periodic potential. This transition is related to the
self-duality of the AAH Hamiltonian. Interestingly, at the critical point,
which is also known as the self-dual point, all the single particle wave
functions are multifractal or non-ergodic in nature, while they are ergodic and
delocalized (localized) below (above) the critical point. In this work, we have
studied the one dimensional quasi-periodic AAH Hamiltonian in the presence of
spin-orbit (SO) coupling of Rashba type, which introduces an additional spin
conserving complex hopping and a spin-flip hopping. We have found that,
although the self-dual nature of AAH Hamiltonian remains unaltered, the
self-dual point gets affected significantly. Moreover, the effect of the
complex and spin-flip hoppings are identical in nature. We have extended the
idea of Kohn's localization tensor calculations for quasi-particles and
detected the critical point very accurately. These calculations are followed by
detailed multifractal analysis along with the computation of inverse
participation ratio and von Neumann entropy, which clearly demonstrate that the
quasi-particle eigenstates are indeed multifractal and non-ergodic at the
critical point. Finally, we mapped out the phase diagram in the parameter space
of quasi-periodic potential and SO coupling strength.

fields. However, the ubiquitous classical force fields cannot describe reactive

but these force fields require substantial effort to construct and are highly
specific to a given chemical composition and application. A significant
limitation of machine learning models is the use of element-specific features,
leading to models that scale poorly with the number of elements. This work
introduces the Gaussian multipole (GMP) featurization scheme that utilizes
physically-relevant multipole expansions of the electron density around atoms
to yield feature vectors that interpolate between element types and have a
fixed dimension regardless of the number of elements present. We combine GMP
with neural networks to directly compare it to the widely used Behler-Parinello

accuracy and computational efficiency. Further, we demonstrate that GMP-based
models can achieve chemical accuracy for the QM9 dataset, and their accuracy
remains reasonable even when extrapolating to new elements. Finally, we test
GMP-based models for the Open Catalysis Project (OCP) dataset, revealing
comparable performance to graph convolutional deep learning models. The results

logical paradoxes in quantum and post-quantum theories. These research areas
are highly relevant for the foundations of physics as well as the development
of quantum technologies. In the first part, focussing on causality, we develop
techniques for using generalised entropies to analyse distinctions between
classical and non-classical causal structures. We derive new properties of
Tsallis entropies of systems that follow from the relevant causal structure,
and apply these to obtain new necessary constraints for classicality in the
Triangle causal structure. Supplementing the method with the post-selection
technique, we provide evidence that Shannon and Tsallis entropic constraints
are insufficient for detecting non-classicality in Bell scenarios with
non-binary outcomes. This points to the need for better methods of
characterising correlations in non-classical causal structures. Further, we
investigate the relationships between causality and space-time by developing a
framework for modelling cyclic and fine-tuned influences in non-classical
theories. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such causal models
to be compatible with a space-time structure and for ruling out operationally
detectable causal loops. In particular, this provides an operational framework
for analysing post-quantum theories admitting jamming non-local correlations.
In the second part, we investigate multi-agent logical paradoxes such as the
Frauchiger-Renner paradox and develop a framework for analysing such paradoxes
in arbitrary physical theories. Applying this to box world, a post-quantum
theory, we derive a stronger paradox that does not rely on post-selection. Our
results reveal that reversible evolution of agents' memories is not necessary
for deriving multi-agent paradoxes, and that certain forms of contextuality
might be.

dynamically selecting optimal values during fuzzing. Thus the fuzzer can easily

for solving low-rank matrix completion. Recent progress in structured

descent under certain statistical assumptions on the low-rank matrix and the
sampling set. However, while the theory suggests gradient descent enjoys fast
linear convergence to a global solution of the problem, the universal nature of
the bounding technique prevents it from obtaining an accurate estimate of the
rate of convergence. In this paper, we perform a local analysis of the exact
linear convergence rate of gradient descent for factorization-based matrix
completion for symmetric matrices. Without any additional assumptions on the
underlying model, we identify the deterministic condition for local convergence
of gradient descent, which only depends on the solution matrix and the sampling
set. More crucially, our analysis provides a closed-form expression of the
asymptotic rate of convergence that matches exactly with the linear convergence
observed in practice. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one
that offers the exact rate of convergence of gradient descent for matrix
factorization in Euclidean space for matrix completion.

attacks such backdooring more convenient considering that existing anomaly
detection methods mostly require access to plaintext local models. This paper
proposes SAFELearning which supports backdoor detection for secure aggregation.
We achieve this through two new primitives - \emph{oblivious random grouping

participants into one-time random subgroups with group configurations oblivious
to participants; PPD allows secure partial disclosure of aggregated subgroup
models for anomaly detection without leaking individual model privacy.
SAFELearning can significantly reduce backdoor model accuracy without

cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of communication delays. The
delays are categorized into two types - namely, an inter-layer delay for
passing state and control information between the physical layer and the cyber
layer, and an intra-layer delay that operates between the computing agents,
referred to here as control nodes (CNs), within the cyber-layer. Our objective
is to minimize the closed-loop H2-norm of the physical system by co-designing
an optimal combination of these two delays and a sparse state-feedback
controller while respecting a given bandwidth cost constraint. We propose a
two-loop optimization algorithm for this. Based on the alternating directions
method of multipliers (ADMM), the inner loop handles the conflicting directions
between the decreasing H2-norm and the increasing sparsity level of the
controller. The outer loop comprises a semidefinite program (SDP)-based
relaxation of non-convex inequalities necessary for closed-loop stability.
Moreover, for CPSs where the state and control information assigned to the CNs
are not private, we derive an additional algorithm that further sparsifies the
communication topology by modifying the row and column structures of the
obtained controller, resulting in reassigning the communication map between the
cyber and physical layers, and determining which physical agent should send its
state information to which CN. Proofs for closed-loop stability and optimality

the Neural Tangent Kernel regime where neurons don't move much, or require an
enormous number of neurons. In practice, when the data is generated using a
teacher neural network, even mildly over-parameterized neural networks can
achieve 0 loss and recover the directions of teacher neurons. In this paper we
develop a local convergence theory for mildly over-parameterized two-layer

(polynomial in relevant parameters), all student neurons in an
over-parameterized two-layer neural network will converge to one of teacher
neurons, and the loss will go to 0. Our result holds for any number of student
neurons as long as it is at least as large as the number of teacher neurons,
and our convergence rate is independent of the number of student neurons. A key
component of our analysis is the new characterization of local optimization
landscape -- we show the gradient satisfies a special case of Lojasiewicz

to reporting good performance for sarcomere segmentation and tracking with
little to no parameter tuning and a short runtime, we introduce two novel

the network distance between each sarcomere (i.e., the number of connecting
sarcomeres separating each sarcomere pair) straightforward. Second, we treat

  Impact of Feedback Delay",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Narrow beams are key to wireless communications in millimeter wave frequency
bands. Beam alignment (BA) allows the base station (BS) to adjust the direction
and width of the beam used for communication. During BA, the BS transmits a
number of scanning beams covering different angular regions. The goal is to
minimize the expected width of the uncertainty region (UR) that includes the
angle of departure of the user. Conventionally, in interactive BA, it is
assumed that the feedback corresponding to each scanning packet is received
prior to transmission of the next one. However, in practice, the feedback delay
could be larger because of propagation or system constraints. This paper
investigates BA strategies that operate under arbitrary fixed feedback delays.
This problem is analyzed through a source coding prospective where the feedback
sequences are viewed as source codewords. It is shown that these codewords form
a codebook with a particular characteristic which is used to define a new class
of codes called d-unimodal codes. By analyzing the properties of these codes, a
lower bound on the minimum achievable expected beamwidth is provided. The
results reveal potential performance improvements in terms of the BA duration
it takes to achieve a fixed expected width of the UR over the state-of-the-art
BA methods which do not consider the effect of delay.

spectral fits with the TCAF model. Low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations
are also observed in the Swift/XRT and AstroSat/LAXPC data. From the nature of
the variation of the spectral and temporal properties, we find the source

other states which makes this event a `failed' outburst. An absence of the
softer spectral states is consistent with the class of short orbital period

problems poses a nontrivial challenge. Because the irreversibility of the
system dynamics is a result of quantum thermal activation and dissipation
caused by the surrounding environment, it is necessary to include infinite
environmental degrees of freedom in the simulation. Because the capabilities of
full quantum dynamics simulations that include the surrounding molecular
degrees of freedom are limited, employing a system-bath model is a practical
approach. In such a model, the dynamics of excitons or electrons are described
by a system Hamiltonian, while the other degrees of freedom that arise from the
environmental molecules are described by a harmonic oscillator bath (HOB) and
system-bath interaction parameters. By extending on a previous study of
molecular liquids [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 2099], here we construct a
system-bath model for exciton and electron transfer problems by means of a

reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS)-assisted downlink system. The channel
state information (CSI) is usually difficult to be estimated at the base
station (BS) when the RIS is not equipped with radio frequency chains. In this
paper, we propose a downlink transmission framework with unknown CSI via
Bayesian optimization. Since the CSI is not available at the BS, we treat the
unknown objective function as the black-box function and take the beamformer,
the phase shift, and the receiving filter as the input. Then the objective
function is decomposed as the sum of low-dimension subfunctions to reduce the
complexity. By re-expressing the power constraint of the BS in spherical
coordinates, the original constraint problem is converted into an equivalent
unconstrained problem. The users estimate the sum MSE of the training symbols
as the objective value and feed it back to the BS. We assume a Gaussian prior
of the feedback samples and the next query point is updated by minimizing the
constructed acquisition function. Furthermore, this framework can also be
applied to the power transfer system and fairness problems. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed transmission scheme in the downlink

analysis of the information, no much work has been done by exploring the
community structures that also play an important role in determining how people
get exposed to it. In this paper we base our idea on Computational Trust in

community, we propose novel evaluation metrics to quantify the vulnerability of
nodes (individual-level) and communities (group-level) to spreading false
information. Our model hypothesizes that if the boundary nodes trust the
neighbor nodes of a community who are spreaders, the densely-connected core
nodes of the community are highly likely to become spreaders. We test our model
with communities generated using three popular community detection algorithms
based on two new datasets of information spreading networks collected from
Twitter. Our experimental results show that the proposed metrics perform
clearly better on the networks spreading false information than on those
spreading true ones, indicating our community health assessment model is
effective.

the complexity of selection predicates and the number of join predicates
increase, two problems arise. First, statistics cannot be incrementally
composed to effectively estimate the cost of the sub-plans generated in plan
enumeration. Second, small errors are propagated exponentially through join
operators, which can lead to severely sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we
introduce COMPASS, a novel query optimization paradigm for in-memory databases
based on a single type of statistics -- Fast-AGMS sketches. In COMPASS, query
optimization and execution are intertwined. Selection predicates and sketch
updates are pushed-down and evaluated online during query optimization. This
allows Fast-AGMS sketches to be computed only over the relevant tuples -- which
enhances cardinality estimation accuracy. Plan enumeration is performed over
the query join graph by incrementally composing attribute-level sketches -- not
by building a separate sketch for every sub-plan. We prototype COMPASS in MapD
-- an open-source parallel database -- and perform extensive experiments over
the complete JOB benchmark. The results prove that COMPASS generates better
execution plans -- both in terms of cardinality and runtime -- compared to four
other database systems. Overall, COMPASS achieves a speedup ranging from 1.35X

distance exhibits favorable properties in the local geometry problem. To this
regard, Euclidean distance can be applied under short-term disease with
low-variation outcome observation. Moreover, when presenting to highly variant
chronic disease, it is preferable to use cosine distance. These different
geometric properties lead to different submanifolds in the original embedded
space, and hence, to different optimizing nonlinear kernel embedding
frameworks. We first established the geometric properties that we needed in
these frameworks. From these properties interpreted their differences in
certain perspectives. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale electronic

to observationally derive accurate assembly histories through a self-consistent
combined stellar dynamical and population galaxy model. We present this
approach for three edge-on lenticular galaxies from the Fornax3D project -- FCC
153, FCC 170, and FCC 177 -- in order to infer their mass assembly histories
individually and in the context of the Fornax cluster. The method was tested on
mock data from simulations to quantify its reliability. We find that the
galaxies studied here have all been able to form dynamically-cold (intrinsic
vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_z \lesssim 50\ {\rm km}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$)
stellar disks after cluster infall. Moreover, the pre-existing (old) high
angular momentum components have retained their angular momentum (orbital
circularity $\lambda_z > 0.8$) through to the present day. Comparing the
derived assembly histories with a comparable galaxy in a low-density
environment -- NGC 3115 -- we find evidence for cluster-driven suppression of
stellar accretion and merging. We measured the intrinsic stellar
age--velocity-dispersion relation and find that the shape of the relation is
consistent with galaxies in the literature across redshift. There is tentative
evidence for enhancement in the luminosity-weighted intrinsic vertical velocity
dispersion due to the cluster environment. But importantly, there is an
indication that metallicity may be a key driver of this relation. We finally
speculate that the cluster environment is responsible for the S0 morphology of
these galaxies via the gradual external perturbations, or `harassment',
generated within the cluster.

reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer a reward function from demonstrations
before performing RL on the learned reward function. However, most existing
reward extrapolation methods require massive demonstrations, making it
difficult to be applied in tasks of limited training data. To address this
problem, one simple solution is to perform data augmentation to artificially
generate more training data, which may incur severe inductive bias and policy
performance loss. In this paper, we propose a novel meta learning-based reward
extrapolation (MLRE) algorithm, which can effectively approximate the
ground-truth rewards using limited demonstrations. More specifically, MLRE
first learns an initial reward function from a set of tasks that have abundant
training data. Then the learned reward function will be fine-tuned using data
of the target task. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that the proposed
MLRE can achieve impressive performance improvement as compared to other
similar BDIL algorithms.

originate from the intrinsic material's ability to undergo local lattice
transformations beyond tensile yield points, as well as from relatively facile
activation of lattice slip. Additional simulations, carried out to follow the

secure storage of biometric information is necessary in order to protect the

key requirements of biometric information protection enabling a
privacy-preserving storage and comparison of biometric data.
  This work investigates the application of a well-known biometric
cryptosystem, i.e. the improved fuzzy vault scheme, to facial feature vectors
extracted through deep convolutional neural networks. To this end, a feature
transformation method is introduced which maps fixed-length real-valued deep
feature vectors to integer-valued feature sets. As part of said feature
transformation, a detailed analysis of different feature quantisation and
binarisation techniques is conducted. At key binding, obtained feature sets are
locked in an unlinkable improved fuzzy vault. For key retrieval, the efficiency
of different polynomial reconstruction techniques is investigated. The proposed
feature transformation method and template protection scheme are agnostic of
the biometric characteristic. In experiments, an unlinkable improved deep face
fuzzy vault-based template protection scheme is constructed employing features
extracted with a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network trained
with the additive angular margin loss (ArcFace). For the best configuration, a
false non-match rate below 1% at a false match rate of 0.01%, is achieved in

study, a new deep neural network, referred to as DIFFnet, is developed to
function as a generalized reconstruction tool of the diffusion-weighted signals
for various gradient schemes and b-values. For generalization, diffusion
signals are normalized in a q-space and then projected and quantized, producing
a matrix (Qmatrix) as an input for the network. To demonstrate the validity of
this approach, DIFFnet is evaluated for diffusion tensor imaging (DIFFnetDTI)
and for neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (DIFFnetNODDI). In
each model, two datasets with different gradient schemes and b-values are
tested. The results demonstrate accurate reconstruction of the diffusion
parameters at substantially reduced processing time (approximately 8.7 times

NODDI, respectively; less than 4% mean normalized root-mean-square errors
(NRMSE) in DTI and less than 8% in NODDI). The generalization capability of the
networks was further validated using reduced numbers of diffusion signals from
the datasets. Different from previously proposed deep neural networks, DIFFnet
does not require any specific gradient scheme and b-value for its input. As a
result, it can be adopted as an online reconstruction tool for various complex

noise can be effectively suppressed even beyond the shot-noise limit. Both the
decrease on amplification strength and the increase on input squeezing strength
can give rise to a decrease in the suppressed average quantum noise. Our
results not only show the feasibility of manipulating the output quantum noise
of random amplifying media, but also indicate potential applications in quantum
information processing in complex environments, such as, quantum imaging,
quantum communication, and quantum key distribution.

Unfortunately, these works are still not fully-fledged solutions for mobile

which is a lightweight developer-friendly TEE solution for mobile Apps. LEAP
enables isolated codes to execute in parallel and access peripheral (e.g.,

workloads, and offers the auto DevOps tool to help developers prepare the codes
running on it. We implement the LEAP prototype on the off-the-shelf ARM

that Apps can be adapted to run with LEAP easily and efficiently. Compared to
the state-of-the-art work along this research line, LEAP can achieve an average

that the rising time of the radio emission is much longer than that of the

some magnetic fields due to the induced field of vortex flow, when its
contribution is strong enough to reverse the field direction. In this work, we
use modified TDGL equations which couple an externally applied current, and
also incorporate normal-state and flux-flow Hall effects. We obtain the profile
of Hall angle as a function of applied magnetic field for four different sizes

provides an insight into several anomalous features including signchange of
Hall angle, and leads us to the precise transient behavior of order parameter
responsible for them.

  Roll Deflection During the Austenitic Stainless Steel 316L Strip Rolling","11 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  During the strip rolling process, a considerable amount of the forces of the
material pressure cause elastic deformation on the work-roll, i.e., the
deflection process. The uncontrollable amount of the work-roll deflection leads
to the high deviations in the permissible thickness of the plate along its
width. In the context of the Austenitic Stainless Steels (ASS), due to the
instability of the Austenite phase in a cold temperature, cold deformation
leads to the production of Strain-Induced Martensite (SIM), which improves the
mechanical properties. It leads to the hardening of the ASS 316L during the
cold deformation, which causes the Strain-Stress curve of the ASS 316L to
behave non-linearly, which distinguishes it from other categories of steels. To
account for this phenomenon, we propose to utilize a Machine Learning (ML)
method to predict more accurately the flow stress of the ASS 316L during the
cold rolling. Furthermore, we conduct various mechanical tensile tests in order
to obtain the required dataset, Stress316L, for training the neural network.
Moreover, instead of using a constant value of flow stress during the
multi-pass rolling process, we use a Finite Difference (FD) formulation of the
equilibrium equation in order to account for the dynamic behavior of the flow
stress, which leads to the estimation of the mean pressure, which the strip
enforces to the rolls during deformation. Finally, using the Finite Element
Analysis (FEA), the deflection of the work-roll tools will be calculated. As a
result, we end up with a generalized model for the calculation of the roll
deflection, specific to the ASS 316L. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model for ASS 316L which considers dynamic flow stress and SIM of the
rolled plate, using FEM and an ML approach, which could contribute to the
better design of the tolls.

undoped GaN spacer, we demonstrate highly effective gating of graphene at low
bias rendering this type of structure very promising for potential
applications. An observed Raman G band position shift larger than 8.5 cm-1
corresponds to an increase in carrier concentration of about 1.2x10^13 cm-2.
The presence of a distinct G band splitting together with a narrow symmetric 2D
band indicates turbostratic layer stacking and suggests the presence of a high
potential gradient near the Schottky junction even at zero bias. The subbands
characterized by the highest Raman energies correspond to the largest
concentration of electrons. An analysis based on electroreflectance
measurements and a modified Richardson equation confirmed that graphene on
n-GaN separated by an undoped GaN spacer behaves like a capacitor at reverse
bias. At least 60% of G subband position shifts occur at forward bias, which is
related to a rapid reduction of electric field near the Schottky junction.
Raman micromapping shows a high uniformity of gating efficiency on the surface.
Therefore, our studies demonstrate the usefulness of few layer turbostratic
graphene deposited on GaN for tracing electron-phonon coupling in graphene.
Multilayer graphene also provides uniform and stable electric contacts.
Moreover, the observed bias sensitive G band splitting can be used as an
indicator of charge transfer in sensor applications in the low bias regime.

cause spontaneous disintegration of micro-particles of these lipids, dispersed
in aqueous solutions of appropriate surfactants, into nanometer particles/drops
using a simple cooling/heating cycle of the lipid dispersion (Cholakova et al.

process"" is observed also with natural oils of high practical interest, incl.
coconut oil, palm kernel oil and cocoa butter. Mean drop diameters of ca. 50 to
100 nm were achieved with some of the studied oils. From the results of
dedicated model experiments we conclude that intensive nano-fragmentation is
observed when the following requirements are met: (1) The three phase contact
angle at the air-water-solid lipid interface is below ca. 30 degrees; (2) The
equilibrium surface tension of the surfactant solution is below ca. 30 mN/m and
the dynamic surface tension decreases rapidly. (3) The surfactant solution
contains non-spherical surfactant micelles. e.g. ellipsoidal micelles or bigger
supramolecular aggregates; (4) The three phase contact angle measured at the
contact line (frozen oil-melted oil-surfactant solution) is also relatively
low. The mechanism(s) of the particle bursting process is revealed and, on this

as deblurring and super-resolution. In recent years, solutions that are based
on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great promise. Yet,
most of these techniques, which train CNNs using external data, are restricted
to the observation models that have been used in the training phase. A recent
alternative that does not have this drawback relies on learning the target
image using internal learning. One such prominent example is the Deep Image
Prior (DIP) technique that trains a network directly on the input image with a
least-squares loss. In this paper, we propose a new image restoration framework
that is based on minimizing a loss function that includes a ""projected-version""
of the Generalized SteinUnbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE) and parameterization of
the latent image by a CNN. We demonstrate two ways to use our framework. In the
first one, where no explicit prior is used, we show that the proposed approach
outperforms other internal learning methods, such as DIP. In the second one, we
show that our GSURE-based loss leads to improved performance when used within a
plug-and-play priors scheme.

pre-processing, object identification as well as pose estimation. In this work,
we elaborate a methodical workflow, which starts with the digitalization of
large-scale indoor environments and ends with the generation of a static
environment or simulation model. The object identification step is realized
using a Bayesian neural network capable of point cloud segmentation. We
elaborate how the information on network uncertainty generated by a Bayesian
segmentation framework can be used in order to build up a more accurate
environment model. The steps of data collection and point cloud segmentation as
well as the resulting model accuracy are evaluated on a real-world data set
collected at the assembly line of a large-scale automotive production plant.
The segmentation network is further evaluated on the publicly available

a given simple model approximation from which image observations can be

simple model state from observations of the complex system online. We then use
data from the complex system to fit the parameters of the simple model and
learn where this model is inaccurate, also online. Finally, we use Model
Predictive Control and bias the controller away from regions where the simple
model is inaccurate and thus where the controller is less reliable. We evaluate
LVSPC on two tasks; manipulating a tethered mass and a rope. We find that our

the Zeeman broadening in the RbI line is also studied. The LTE analysis results
in a Rb deficiency in giant stars smaller than that obtained in M dwarfs, but
the NLTE [Rb/Fe] ratios are very close to solar in the full metallicity range.
This contrasts with the figure found in M dwarfs. We investigate the effect of
gravitational settling and magnetic activity as possible causes of the Rb

impact on the surface Rb abundance, the existence of an average magnetic field

is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from a population of
particles that have cooled on a timescale comparable to the dynamic time to
energies that are still much higher than their rest mass energy (marginally
fast cooling regime). We consider a hadronic scenario and investigate if the
prompt emission of these GRBs can originate from relativistic protons that
radiate synchrotron in the marginally fast cooling regime. Using
semi-analytical methods, we derive the source parameters, such as magnetic
field strength and proton luminosity, and calculate the high-energy neutrino
emission expected in this scenario. We also investigate how the emission of
secondary pairs produced by photopion interactions and $\gamma\gamma$ pair
production affect the broadband photon spectrum. We support our findings with
detailed numerical calculations. Strong modification of the photon spectrum
below the break energy due to the synchrotron emission of secondary pairs is
found, unless the bulk Lorentz factor is very large ($\Gamma \gtrsim 10^3$).
Moreover, this scenario predicts unreasonably high Poynting luminosities

the incomplete proton cooling. Our results strongly disfavour marginally fast

scenario, and we propose a meta-strategy to learn these parameters from past
tasks. Our strategy is based on the minimization of a regret bound. It allows
to learn the initialization and the step size in OGA with guarantees. It also
allows to learn the prior or the learning rate in EWA. We provide a regret
analysis of the strategy. It allows to identify settings where meta-learning
indeed improves on learning each task in isolation.

compact data structure that supports efficient pattern matching queries.
Typical queries include existential queries (decide if the pattern occurs in
S), reporting queries (return all positions where the pattern occurs), and
counting queries (return the number of occurrences of the pattern). In this
paper we consider a variant of string indexing, where the goal is to compactly
represent the string such that given two patterns P1 and P2 and a gap range
[\alpha,\beta] we can quickly find the consecutive occurrences of P1 and P2
with distance in [\alpha,\beta], i.e., pairs of occurrences immediately
following each other and with distance within the range. We present data
structures that use \~O(n) space and query time \~O(|P1|+|P2|+n^(2/3)) for
existence and counting and \~O(|P1|+|P2|+n^(2/3)*occ^(1/3)) for reporting. We
complement this with a conditional lower bound based on the set intersection
problem showing that any solution using \~O(n) space must use
\tilde{\Omega}}(|P1|+|P2|+\sqrt{n}) query time. To obtain our results we
develop new techniques and ideas of independent interest including a new suffix
tree decomposition and hardness of a variant of the set intersection problem.

their interior. Experiments demonstrate that the complex, crowded cellular

behavior, we here construct a theoretical description of droplets growing in an
elastic matrix, which is motivated by experiments in synthetic systems where
monodisperse emulsions form during a temperature decrease. We show that large
droplets only form when they break the surrounding matrix in a cavitation
event. The energy barrier associated with cavitation stabilizes small droplets
on the order of the mesh size and diminishes the stochastic effects of
nucleation. Consequently, the cavitated droplets have similar sizes and highly
correlated positions. In particular, we predict the density of cavitated
droplets, which increases with faster cooling, as in the experiments. Our model
also suggests how adjusting the cooling protocol and the density of nucleation
sites affects the droplet size distribution. In summary, our theory explains
how elastic matrices affect droplets in the synthetic system and it provides a
framework for understanding the biological case.

different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics
influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The
findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work
domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the
country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of
their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the
data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to
NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note
that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly
modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases
constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries
with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often

from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics

quantum information from the servers. The QPIR problem has been treated by Song

over $[n,k]$ maximum distance separable (MDS) coded servers was recently
considered by Allaix et al., but the collusion was essentially restricted to
$t=n-k$ servers in the sense that a smaller $t$ would not improve the retrieval

high rate for any number of colluding servers $t$ with $1 \leq t \leq n-k$.
Similarly to the previous cases, the rates achieved are better than those known

considering the stabilizer formalism and weakly self-dual generalized

accelerate computation, we remove the Hessian from the calculation and prove
that, under moderate conditions, the approximation error is bounded.
Corroborating this theoretical claim, empirical results indicate the error is

side information at the server, our scheme jointly exploits the correlation
between clients' data and server' s side information, and also between data of
different clients. We derive an upper bound of the estimation error of the

to choose input parameters for the estimator. Finally, parameter regions in
which our estimator is better than the previous one are characterized.

use more realistic host metallicity, dust corrected where available, in
generating the host absorption model, assuming that the host intrinsic hydrogen
column density is equal to the measured ionisation corrected intrinsic neutral
column from UV spectra ($\textit{N}\textsc{h}\/\ \textsc{i,ic}$). We find that
the IGM property results are similar, regardless of whether the model assumes
all PIE or CIE. The $\mathit{N}\textsc{hxigm}$ scales as $(1 + z)^{1.0\/\ -\/\

1.8^{+1.5}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-7}$ cm$^{-3}$. The metallicity ranges from
$\sim0.1Z\sun$ at $z \sim 2$ to $\sim0.001Z\sun$ at redshift $z > 4$. The PIE
model implies a less rapid decline in average metallicity with redshift
compared to CIE. Under CIE, the temperature ranges between $5.0 <$
log$(T/$K$)<\/\ 7.1$. For PIE the ionisation parameter ranges between $0.1 <$
log$(\xi) < 2.9$. Using our model, we conclude that the IGM contributes
substantially to the total absorption seen in GRB spectra and that this

a partial magnetic disorder in the system of the decoupled 2D ferromagnets,
whose magnetizations point randomly along the third direction. Furthermore, due
to a weak interlayer exchange coupling, these materials can be field-driven

techniques and using numerically exact matrix product state methods. We show
that for ideal bosons coupled to the cavity multiple steady states exist and in
each symmetry sector a dissipative phase transition occurs at a different
critical point. This implies that phases of very different nature can coexist.
We find that the introduction of a slight breaking of the strong symmetry by a
small interaction term leads to a direct transition from multiple steady states
to a unique steady state. We point out the phenomenon of dissipative freezing,
the breaking of the conservation law at the level of individual realizations in
the presence of the strong symmetry. For a small breaking of the strong
symmetry we see that the behavior of the individual trajectories still shows
some signs of this dissipative freezing before it fades out for a larger

forces can be so strong to break the neutron star crust (causing a starquake),
thus producing a quadrupole moment responsible for the continuous emission of
GWs. At equilibrium, the angular momentum gained by accretion and lost via GWs
emission should balance each other, stopping the stellar spin-up.
  We hereinafter investigate the above physical picture within the framework of
a Newtonian model describing compressible, non-magnetized, and self-gravitating
NSs. In particular, we calculate the rotational frequency need to break the
stellar crust of an accreting pulsar and we estimate the upper limit for the

transmitter, if the joint distribution of the channel gains follows certain

requiring retransmissions. Based on a systematic copula approach, we show that
there exists a set of dependency structures for which positive ZOCs can be
achieved for both maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC).
We characterize the maximum ZOC within a finite number of bits. The results are

large-$N_c$ approach, as had been proposed and developed by 't Hooft, to the
case of tetraquark states, which are a category of the general class of exotic
states, also called multiquark states, whose internal valence-quark structure
does not match with that of ordinary hadrons, and which have received, in
recent years, many experimental confirmations. The primary question of
describing, or probing, on theoretical grounds, multiquark states is first
examined. The signature of such states inside Feynman diagrams in relation with
their singularities is highlighted. The main mechanisms of formation of
tetraquark states, provided by the diquark model and the molecular scheme, are
considered together with their specific implications. The properties of
tetraquark states at large $N_c$ are analyzed through the Feynman diagrams that
describe two-meson scattering amplitudes. It turns out that, in that limit, the
possible formation of tetraquark states is mainly due to the mutual
interactions of their internal mesonic clusters. These essentially arise from
the quark-rearrangement, or quark-interchange, mechanism. In coupled-channel
meson-meson scattering amplitudes, one may expect the occurrence of two
independent tetraquark states, each having priviledged couplings with the two
mesons of their dominant channel. The question of the energy balance of various
schemes in the static limit is also analyzed. The clarification of the
mechanisms that are at work in the formation of tetraquarks is the main outcome
from the large-$N_c$ approach to this problem.

systems with the same number of unknowns and equations (where these techniques
have exponential complexity). Here we show that they are able to solve the
problem in polynomial time up to the Sudan radius. Moreover, beyond this radius
these techniques recover automatically polynomial identities that are at the
heart of improvements of the power decoding approach for reaching the Johnson

be used to derive new algebraic decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes. We
provide numerical evidence that this sometimes allows to correct efficiently

For the case of the linear chain, the exact analytic solution for the boundary
resistance is derived for arbitrary linear time-independent conservative
inclusion or defect. A simple case of isolated isotopic defects is explored in
more detail. Contrary to the bulk conductivity in the linear chain, the Kapitza
resistance is finite. However, the universal thermodynamic limit does not exist
in this case. In other terms, the exact value of the resistance is not uniquely
defined and depends on the way of approaching the infinite lengths of the chain
fragments. For this reason, and also due to the explicit dependence on the
parameters of the thermostats, the resistance cannot be considered as a local
property of the defect. Asymptotic scaling behavior of the heat flux in the
case of very heavy defect is explored and compared to the nonlinear
counterparts; similarities in the scaling behavior are revealed. For the
lightweight isotopic defect in the linear chain, one encounters a typical dip
of the temperature profile, related to weak excitation of the localized mode in
the attenuation zone. If the nonlinear interactions are included, this dip can
still appear at a relatively short time scale, with subsequent elimination due
to the nonlinear interactions. This observation implies that even in the
nonlinear chains, the linear dynamics can predict the main features of the
short-time evolution of the thermal profile if the temperature is low enough.

the deformation radius) plays an important role for the heat exchange with the
atmosphere and for oceanic biogeochemistry. Its dynamics should strongly depend
on the seasonal cycle and the associated mixed-layer instabilities. The latter
are particularly relevant in winter and are responsible for the formation of
energetic small scales that extend over the whole depth of the mixed layer. The
knowledge of the transport properties of oceanic flows at depth, which is
essential to understand the coupling between surface and interior dynamics,
however, is still limited. By means of numerical simulations, we explore the
Lagrangian dispersion properties of turbulent flows in a quasi-geostrophic
model system allowing for both thermocline and mixed-layer instabilities. The
results indicate that, when mixed-layer instabilities are present, the
dispersion regime is local from the surface down to depths comparable with that
of the interface with the thermocline, while in their absence dispersion
quickly becomes nonlocal versus depth. We then identify the origin of such
behavior in the existence of fine-scale energetic structures due to mixed-layer
instabilities. We further discuss the effect of vertical shear on the
Lagrangian particle spreading and address the correlation between the
dispersion properties at the surface and at depth, which is relevant to assess
the possibility of inferring the dynamical features of deeper flows from the
more accessible surface ones.

presenting a first-of-its-kind holistic risk assessment of different inference

namely, membership inference, model inversion, attribute inference, and model
stealing -- and establish a threat model taxonomy.
  Our extensive experimental evaluation, run on five model architectures and
four image datasets, shows that the complexity of the training dataset plays an
important role with respect to the attack's performance, while the
effectiveness of model stealing and membership inference attacks are negatively
correlated. We also show that defenses like DP-SGD and Knowledge Distillation

of the elastic stress with concentration in these glassy systems. We apply this
method to a simple 2D model system where a test particle is placed on a plane

Two striking differences between wire frame and rod suspensions are found: 1)
The linear elasticity per particle for wire frames is very large, scaling like
$\nu^2 L^4$, whereas for rods it much smaller and independent of concentration.
2) Rods always shear thin but wire frames shear harden for densities less than
$\sim \sqrt{K/k_B T L^4}$, where $K$ is the bending modulus of the particles.
The deformation of wire frames is found to be important even for small strains,
with the proportion of deformed particles at a particular strain, $\gamma$,
being given by $(\nu L^2)^2 \gamma^2$. Our results agree well with a simple

of length $L$ and their number density, $\rho$, is such that $\rho L^3 \gg 1$.
We specifically compare rigid rods to L-shapes made of two equal length rods
joined at right angles. The behaviour of wire frames is found to be strikingly
different from that of rods. The linear elasticity scales like $\rho^3 L^6$ for
L-shaped particles, whereas it scales proportional to $\rho$ for rods and the
non-linear response shows a transition from shear hardening to shear softening
at a critical density $\rho_c \sim \sqrt{K / k_B T L^6}$, where $K$ is the
bending modulus of the particles. For realistic particles made of double
stranded DNA, this transition occurs at densities of about $\rho L^3 \sim 10$.
The reason for these differences is that wire frames can be forced to bend by
the entanglements with their surroundings, whereas rods always remain straight.
This is found to be very important even for small strains, with most particles
being bent above a critical strain $\gamma_c \sim (\rho L^3)^{-1}$.

being shifted by magnetic activity effects. The measured shifts depend on a
complex relationship involving the mode type, the field strength and spatial
distribution of activity, as well as the inclination angle of the star.
Evidence of these shifts is also present in frequency separation ratios which
are often used when inferring global properties of stars in order to avoid
surface effects. However, one assumption when using frequency ratios for this
purpose is that there are no near-surface perturbations that are
non-spherically symmetric. In this work, we studied the impact on inferred
stellar properties when using frequency ratios that are influenced by
non-homogeneous activity distributions. We generate several sets of artificial
oscillation frequencies with various amounts of shift and determine stellar
properties using two separate pipelines. We find that for asteroseismic
observations of Sun-like targets we can expect magnetic activity to affect mode
frequencies which will bias the results from stellar modelling analysis.
Although for most stellar properties this offset should be small, typically
less than 0.5% in mass, estimates of age and central hydrogen content can have
an error of up to 5% and 3% respectively. We expect a larger frequency shift
and therefore larger bias for more active stars. We also warn that for stars
with very high or low inclination angles, the response of modes to activity is
more easily observable in the separation ratios and hence will incur a larger
bias.

exploiting the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS),
which are capable of `reconfiguring' the wireless propagation environments,
hence enhancing the offloading links. The benefits of RISs can be maximized by
jointly optimizing both the RISs as well as the communications and computing
resource allocations of MEC systems. Unfortunately, this joint optimization
imposes new research challenges on the system design. Against this background,
this article provides an overview of RIS-assisted MEC systems and highlights
their four use cases as well as their design challenges and solutions. Finally,
their performance is characterized with the aid of a specific case study,

that magnonic frequency comb (MFC) can be generated above a threshold of
driving amplitude, where the nonlinear scattering process involving three
magnons prevails. The mode-spacing of the MFC is equal to the breathing-mode
frequency of skyrmion and is thus tunable by either electric or magnetic means.
The theoretical prediction is verified by micromagnetic simulations and the

substantially with modern neural networks. At test time they typically employ
beam search to avoid locally optimal but globally suboptimal predictions.
However, due to model errors, a larger beam size can lead to deteriorating
performance according to the evaluation metric. For this reason, it is common
to rerank the output of beam search, but this relies on beam search to produce
a good set of hypotheses, which limits the potential gains. Other alternatives
to beam search require changes to the training of the model, which restricts
their applicability compared to beam search. This paper proposes incremental
beam manipulation, i.e. reranking the hypotheses in the beam during decoding
instead of only at the end. This way, hypotheses that are unlikely to lead to a
good final output are discarded, and in their place hypotheses that would have
been ignored will be considered instead. Applying incremental beam manipulation
leads to an improvement of 1.93 and 5.82 BLEU points over vanilla beam search

of two types of supernovae (SNe), either electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) or
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), depending on their previous evolution. Either
of the associated progenitors retain extended and massive hydrogen-rich
envelopes, the observables of these SNe are, therefore, expected to be similar.
In this study we explore the differences in these two types of SNe.
Specifically, we investigate three different progenitor models: a
solar-metallicity ECSN progenitor with an initial mass of 8.8 solar masses, a
zero-metallicity progenitor with 9.6 solar masses, and a solar-metallicity
progenitor with 9 solar masses, carrying out radiative transfer simulations for
these progenitors. We present the resulting light curves for these models. The
models exhibit very low photospheric velocity variations of about 2000 km/s,
therefore, this may serve as a convenient indicator of low-mass SNe. The ECSN
has very unique light curves in broad bands, especially the U band, and does
not resemble any currently observed SN. This ECSN progenitor being part of a
binary will lose its envelope for which reason the light curve becomes short
and undetectable. The SN from the 9.6 solar masses progenitor exhibits also
quite an unusual light curve, explained by the absence of metals in the initial
composition. The artificially iron polluted 9.6 solar masses model demonstrates
light curves closer to normal SNe IIP. The SN from the 9 solar masses
progenitor remains the best candidate for so-called low-luminosity SNe IIP like
SN 1999br and SN 2005cs.

a highdimensional factor component. The conventional approach to retrieving the
smooth function from the raw data is through various smoothing techniques.
However, the smoothing model is not adequate to recover the smooth curve or
capture the data variation in some situations. These include cases where there
is a large amount of measurement error, the smoothing basis functions are
incorrectly identified, or the step jumps in the functional mean levels are
neglected. To address these challenges, a factor-augmented smoothing model is
proposed, and an iterative numerical estimation approach is implemented in
practice. Including the factor model component in the proposed method solves
the aforementioned problems since a few common factors often drive the
variation that cannot be captured by the smoothing model. Asymptotic theorems
are also established to demonstrate the effects of including factor structures
on the smoothing results. Specifically, we show that the smoothing coefficients
projected on the complement space of the factor loading matrix is
asymptotically normal. As a byproduct of independent interest, an estimator for
the population covariance matrix of the raw data is presented based on the
proposed model. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that these factor
adjustments are essential in improving estimation accuracy and avoiding the
curse of dimensionality. The superiority of our model is also shown in modeling

happen in the next admission about a patient by mining electronic health record
(EHR) data can provide granular readmission predictions to assist clinical
decision making. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and point process models are
usually employed in modelling temporal sequential data. Simple RNN models
assume that sequences of hospital visits follow strict causal dependencies
between consecutive visits. However, in the real-world, a patient may have
multiple co-existing chronic medical conditions, i.e., multimorbidity, which
results in a cascade of visits where a non-immediate historical visit can be
most influential to the next visit. Although a point process (e.g., Hawkes
process) is able to model a cascade temporal relationship, it strongly relies
on a prior generative process assumption. We propose a novel model, MEDCAS, to
address these challenges. MEDCAS combines the strengths of RNN-based models and
point processes by integrating point processes in modelling visit types and
time gaps into an attention-based sequence-to-sequence learning model, which is
able to capture the temporal cascade relationships. To supplement the patients
with short visit sequences, a structural modelling technique with graph-based
methods is used to construct the markers of the point process in MEDCAS.
Extensive experiments on three real-world EHR datasets have been performed and
the results demonstrate that \texttt{MEDCAS} outperforms state-of-the-art
models in both tasks.

Hubble Space Telescope images of all the cluster galaxies (based on redshifts),
and classified them as a function of their likeliness to be jellyfish galaxies,
and give catalogues of jellyfish candidates with positions, redshifts,
magnitudes, and projected distance to the respective cluster centre. We found
81 jellyfish candidates in the extended region around MACS0717, and 97 in 22
other clusters. Jellyfish galaxy candidates in MACS0717 tend to avoid the
densest regions of the cluster, while this does not appear to be the case in
the other clusters. For 79 galaxies in MACS0717 and 31 in other clusters, we
computed the best stellar population fits with LePhare through the GAZPAR
interface. We find that jellyfish candidates tend to be star forming objects,
with blue colours, young ages, high star formation rates and specific star
formation rates. In a SFR versus stellar mass diagram, jellyfish galaxy
candidates appear to have somewhat larger SFRs than non-jellyfish star forming
galaxies Based on several arguments, the jellyfish candidates identified in
MACS0717 seem to have fallen rather recently into the cluster. A very rough
estimate of the proportions of jellyfish galaxies in the studied clusters is
about 10%.

selection of time profiles was a slow, continuous flux decay without
significant new bursts. The obtained averaged time profiles were fitted with
analytical templates, using different time intervals, that consisted of a
combination of two independent exponents or a broken power law. The average
flare profile observed in the 1700~{\AA} channel decayed more slowly than the
average flare profile observed on the M4 dwarf. As the 1700~{\AA} emission is
associated with a similar temperature to that usually ascribed to M dwarf
flares, this implies that the M dwarf flare emission comes from a more dense
layer than solar flare emission in the 1700~{\AA} band. The cooling processes
in solar flares were best described by the two exponents model, fitted over the
intervals t1=[0, 0.5]$t_{1/2}$ and t2=[3, 10]$t_{1/2}$ where $t_{1/2}$ is time
taken for the profile to decay to half the maximum value. The broken power law
model provided a good fit to the first decay phase, as it was able to account

how background vehicles (BVs) drive directly influences the AV's driving
behavior and further impacts the testing result. Existing simulation platforms
use either pre-determined trajectories or deterministic driving models to model
the BVs' behaviors. However, pre-determined BV trajectories can not react to
the AV's maneuvers, and deterministic models are different from real human
drivers due to the lack of stochastic components and errors. Both methods lead
to unrealistic traffic scenarios. This paper presents a learning-based
stochastic driving model that meets the unique needs of AV testing, i.e.
interactive and human-like. The model is built based on the
long-short-term-memory (LSTM) architecture. By incorporating the concept of
quantile-regression to the loss function of the model, the stochastic behaviors
are reproduced without any prior assumption of human drivers. The model is
trained with the large-scale naturalistic driving data (NDD) from the Safety
Pilot Model Deployment(SPMD) project and then compared with a stochastic
intelligent driving model (IDM). Analysis of individual trajectories shows that
the proposed model can reproduce more similar trajectories to human drivers
than IDM. To validate the ability of the proposed model in generating a
naturalistic driving environment, traffic simulation experiments are
implemented. The results show that the traffic flow parameters such as speed,
range, and headway distribution match closely with the NDD, which is of
significant importance for AV testing and evaluation.

reconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed
the issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy
regions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial and temporal
correlations. In this paper, an adaptive Spatio-Temporal Tensor Completion
method (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time
series in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional
spatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a
highly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the
spatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in
order to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank
tensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then
implemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was
tested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in
the region of Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces

These control laws are based on a decentralized control barrier function

have cross-matched the XRB catalogues of Liu et al. (2006, 2007) to the results
of Gaia Data Release 2. We identify 86 X-ray binaries with a Gaia candidate
counterpart, of which 32 are low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and 54 are
high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Distances to Gaia candidate counterparts are,
on average, consistent with those measured by Hipparcos and radio parallaxes.
When compared to distances measured by Gaia candidate counterparts, distances
measured using Type I X-ray bursts are systematically larger, suggesting that
these bursts reach only 50% of the Eddington limit. However, these results are
strongly dependent on the prior assumptions used for estimating distance from
the Gaia parallax measurements. Comparing positions of Gaia candidate
counterparts for XRBs in our sample to positions of spiral arms in the Milky
Way, we find that HMXBs exhibit mild preference for being closer to spiral
arms; LMXBs exhibit mild preference for being closer to inter-arm regions.
LMXBs do not exhibit any preference for leading or trailing their closest
spiral arm. HMXBs exhibit a mild preference for trailing their closest spiral
arm. The lack of a strong correlation between HMXBs and spiral arms may be
explained by star formation occurring closer to the midpoint of the arms, or a
time delay between star formation and HMXB formation manifesting as a spatial
separation between HMXBs and the spiral arm where they formed.

monotone and obeys a certain growth condition and the lower order term is
non-monotone. The state equation is discretized implicitly in time with

backpropagation algorithms involved in deep learning. Besides, the proposed DCM
is based on a feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and differs from most
previous applications of deep learning for mechanical problems. First, batches
of randomly distributed collocation points are initially generated inside the
domain and along the boundaries. A loss function is built with the aim that the
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) of Kirchhoff plate bending
problems, and the boundary/initial conditions are minimised at those
collocation points. A combination of optimizers is adopted in the
backpropagation process to minimize the loss function so as to obtain the
optimal hyperparameters. In Kirchhoff plate bending problems, the C1 continuity
requirement poses significant difficulties in traditional mesh-based methods.
This can be solved by the proposed DCM, which uses a deep neural network to
approximate the continuous transversal deflection, and is proved to be suitable
to the bending analysis of Kirchhoff plate of various geometries.

Malherbe-Powell proposal optimises the hyperparameters of all data descriptors
most efficiently. We calculate the increase in test AUROC and the amount of
overfitting as a function of the number of hyperparameter evaluations. After 50
evaluations, ALP and SVM significantly outperform LOF, NND and LNND, and LOF

can be optimised more efficiently so constitutes a good default choice.
Alternatively, using validation AUROC as a selection criterion between ALP or

are ubiquitous in nature. Measuring the microscopic structure of such systems
is a formidable challenge, often met by particle knockout scattering
experiments. While such measurements are fundamental for mapping the structure
of atomic nuclei, their interpretation is often challenged by quantum
mechanical initial- and final-state interactions (ISI/FSI) of the incoming and
scattered particles. Here we overcome this fundamental limitation by measuring
the quasi-free scattering of 48 GeV/c 12C ions from hydrogen. The distribution
of single protons is studied by detecting two protons at large angles in
coincidence with an intact 11B nucleus. The 11B detection is shown to select
the transparent part of the reaction and exclude the otherwise large ISI/FSI
that would break the 11B apart. By further detecting residual 10B and 10Be
nuclei, we also identified short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon-nucleon pairs,
and provide direct experimental evidence for the separation of the pair
wave-function from that of the residual many-body nuclear system. All measured
reactions are well described by theoretical calculations that do not contain
ISI/FSI distortions. Our results thus showcase a new ability to study the
short-distance structure of short-lived radioactive atomic nuclei at the
forthcoming FAIR and FRIB facilities. These studies will be pivotal for
developing a ground-breaking microscopic understanding of the structure and
properties of nuclei far from stability and the formation of visible matter in
the universe.

the subtle details in some of them lead to long reviewing processes, and
occasionally to errors being found in published proofs. In this work, we take a
published proof of Turing completeness of a choreographic language and
formalise it in Coq. Our development includes formalising the choreographic
language and its basic properties, Kleene's theory of partial recursive
functions, the encoding of these functions as choreographies, and proving this
encoding correct.
  With this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in
the field of choreographic languages: besides the added degree of confidence
that we get from a mechanised proof, the formalisation process led us to a
significant simplification of the underlying theory. Our results offer a
foundation for the future formal development of choreographic languages.

constant speed $v$ on a two--dimensional space and, in a single step of the
dynamics, each particle adopts the direction of motion of a randomly chosen
neighboring particle, with the addition of a perturbation of amplitude $\eta$
(noise). We investigate how the global level of particles' alignment (order) is
affected by their motion and the noise amplitude $\eta$. In the static case
scenario $v=0$ where particles are fixed at the sites of a square lattice and
interact with their first neighbors, we find that for any noise $\eta_c>0$ the
system reaches a steady state of complete disorder in the thermodynamic limit,
while for $\eta=0$ full order is eventually achieved for a system with any
number of particles $N$. Therefore, the model displays a transition at zero
noise when particles are static, and thus there are no ordered steady states
for a finite noise ($\eta>0$). We show that the finite-size transition noise
vanishes with $N$ as $\eta_c^{1D} \sim N^{-1}$ and $\eta_c^{2D} \sim \left(N
\ln N \right)^{-1/2}$ in one and two--dimensional lattices, respectively, which
is linked to known results on the behavior of a type of noisy voter model for
catalytic reactions. When particles are allowed to move in the space at a
finite speed $v>0$, an ordered phase emerges, characterized by a fraction of
particles moving in a similar direction. The system exhibits an order-disorder
phase transition at a noise amplitude $\eta_c>0$ that is proportional to $v$,
and that scales approximately as $\eta_c \sim v \, (-\ln v)^{-1/2}$ for $v \ll
1$. These results show that the motion of particles is able to sustain a state
of global order in a system with voter-like interactions.

of how they arise from quarks and gluons, the fundamental building blocks of
nuclear matter. At long distances the coupling constant of the strong
interaction becomes large, requiring non-perturbative methods to calculate
quantum chromodynamics processes, such as lattice gauge theory or effective
field theories. Here we report proton spin structure measurements from
scattering a polarized electron beam off polarized protons. The spin-dependent
cross-sections were measured at large distances, corresponding to the region of
low momentum transfer squared between 0.012 and 1.0 GeV$^2$. This kinematic
range provides unique tests of chiral effective field theory predictions. Our
results show that a complete description of the nucleon spin remains elusive,
and call for further theoretical works, e.g. in lattice quantum chromodynamics.
Finally, our data extrapolated to the photon point agree with the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule, a fundamental prediction of quantum field
theory that relates the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton to its
integrated spin-dependent cross-sections.

users. However, independent of the amount being sent, public blockchain-based
cryptocurrencies suffer from high transaction waiting times and fees. These
drawbacks hinder the wide use of cryptocurrencies by masses. To address these
challenges, payment channel network concept is touted as the most viable
solution to be used for micro-payments. The idea is exchanging the ownership of
money by keeping the state of the accounts locally. The users inform the
blockchain rarely, which decreases the load on the blockchain. Specifically,
payment channel networks can provide transaction approvals in seconds by
charging a nominal fee proportional to the payment amount. Such attraction on
payment channel networks inspired many recent studies which focus on how to
design them and allocate channels such that the transactions will be secure and
efficient. However, as payment channel networks are emerging and reaching large
number of users, privacy issues are becoming more relevant that raise concerns
about exposing not only individual habits but also businesses' revenues. In
this paper, we first propose a categorization of the existing payment networks
formed on top of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies. After discussing several
emerging attacks on user/business privacy in these payment channel networks, we
qualitatively evaluate them based on a number of privacy metrics that relate to
our case. Based on the discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of the
approaches, we offer possible directions for research for the future of privacy
based payment channel networks.

by placing inertial sensors on segments that are connected by rotational
joints, the motion of that kinematic chain can be tracked accurately. These
methods specifically avoid using magnetometer measurements, which are known to
be unreliable since the magnetic field at the different sensor locations is
typically different. They rely on the assumption that the motion of the
kinematic chain is sufficiently rich to assure observability of the relative
pose. However, a formal investigation of this crucial requirement has not yet
been presented, and no specific conditions for observability have so far been
given. In this work, we present an observability analysis and show that the
relative pose of the body segments is indeed observable under a very mild
condition on the motion. We support our results by simulation studies, in which
we employ a state estimator that neither uses magnetometer measurements nor
additional sensors and does not impose assumptions on the accelerometer to
measure only the direction of gravity, nor on the range of motion or degrees of
freedom of the joints. We investigate the effect of the amount of excitation
and of stationary periods in the data on the accuracy of the estimates. We then
use experimental data from two mechanical joints as well as from a human gait
experiment to validate the observability criterion in practice and to show that
small excitation levels are sufficient for obtaining accurate estimates even in
the presence of time periods during which the motion is not observable.

distribution grid along with a large population of Electric Vehicles (EV) are
here taken as the case-study. We suggest and analyse three operational
strategies (in terms of control of charge scheduling fleet of EV) for the
Distribution System Operator (DSO): (a) uncoordinated/dumb charge scheduling,
(b) coordinated charge scheduling with the objective of energy
cost-minimisation without operational constraints of the grid, and (c)
coordinated charge scheduling with the objective of energy cost-minimisation
along with the operational constraints of the grid. The results demonstrate
that the uncoordinated charging would lead to: 1) overloading of lines and
transformers when the share of EVs is above 20%, and 2) higher operational
costs than the proposed control strategies of (b) and (c). In strategy (b)
operational line/transformer limits are violated when the populations of EVs
are growing above 36%. This implies that current market design must be altered
to allow active control of a large proportion of DERs within grid operational
limits to achieve cost minimization at system level. To our knowledge, the work
presented in this paper is the first ever attempt to do a comprehensive
analysis of the impact of EV charging demand on a real Norwegian distribution
grid. Moreover, the inference of the analysis says that the Norwegian
distribution networks are more prone to congestion problems than the voltage
problems for the EV demand which includes a smart charging scheme accounting

they are often located near the edges of molecular clouds. This finding may
suggest that WCCC is promoted in star-forming cores exposed to radiation from
the interstellar medium. We aim to investigate the chemistry of carbon chains
in such a core. A chemical simulation of a gas parcel in a low-mass
star-forming core with a full level of irradiation by interstellar photons and
cosmic rays was compared to a simulation of a core receiving only one-tenth of
such irradiation. In the full irradiation model, the abundances of carbon
chains were found to be higher by a factor of few to few hundred, compared to
the model with low irradiation. Higher carbon-chain abundances in the
prestellar stage and, presumably, in the extended circumstellar envelope, arise
because of irradiation of gas and dust by interstellar photons and cosmic rays.
A full standard rate of cosmic-ray induced ionization is essential for a high
carbon-chain abundance peak to occur in the circumstellar envelope, which is
heated by the protostar (the ""true"" WCCC phenomenon). The full irradiation
model has lower abundances of complex organic molecules than the
low-irradiation model. We conclude that WCCC can be caused by exposure of a
star-forming core to interstellar radiation, or even just to cosmic rays. The
Appendix describes an updated accurate approach for calculating the rate of
cosmic-ray induced desorption.

the degrees of instability. In this paper, we study variation of
stratifications coming from the group actions in the GIT quotient construction
for projective toric varieties. Cox showed that each projective toric variety
is a GIT quotient of an affine space by a diagonalizable group with respect to
linearizations that come from ample divisors on the toric variety. We provide a
sufficient conditions for two ample divisors to induce the same stratification
and formulate two types of walls in the ample cone that completely capture two
kinds of variations. We also prove that the variation is intrinsic to the
primitive collections and the relations among ray generators of the fans.

interest, such as organs and lesions. Currently, deep learning is the state of
the art for automatic segmentation, but is usually limited by the need for
supervised training with large datasets that have been manually segmented by
trained clinicians. The goal of semi-superised and unsupervised image
segmentation is to greatly reduce, or even eliminate, the need for training
data and therefore to minimze the burden on clinicians when training
segmentation models. To this end we introduce a novel network architecture for
capable of unsupervised and semi-supervised image segmentation called
TricycleGAN. This approach uses three generative models to learn translations
between medical images and segmentation maps using edge maps as an intermediate
step. Distinct from other approaches based on generative networks, TricycleGAN
relies on shape priors rather than colour and texture priors. As such, it is
particularly well-suited for several domains of medical imaging, such as
ultrasound imaging, where commonly used visual cues may be absent. We present
experiments with TricycleGAN on a clinical dataset of kidney ultrasound images

radiotherapy based on compact accelerator neutron sources requiring an
epithermal neutron field for tumour irradiations. Neutrons of 10 keV are
considered as the maximum optimised energy to treat deep-seated tumours. We
investigated, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the epithermal range from 10
eV to 10 keV in order to optimise the maximum epithermal neutron energy as a
function of the tumour depth.
  Methods: A Snyder head phantom was simulated and mono-energetic neutrons with
4 different incident energies were used: 10 eV, 100 eV, 1 keV and 10 keV.
$^{10}$B capture rates and absorbed dose composition on every tissue were
calculated to describe and compare the effects of lowering the maximum
epithermal energy. The Therapeutic Gain (TG) was estimated considering the
whole brain volume.
  Results: For tumours seated at 4 cm depth, 10 eV, 100 eV and 1 keV neutrons
provided respectively 54 $\%$, 36 $\%$ and 18 $\%$ increase on the TG compared
to 10 keV neutrons. Neutrons with energies between 10 eV and 1 keV provided
higher TG than 10 keV neutrons for tumours seated up to 6.4 cm depth inside the
head. The size of the tumour does not change these results.
  Conclusions: Using lower epithermal energy neutrons for AB-BNCT tumour
irradiation could improve treatment efficacy, delivering more therapeutic dose
while reducing the dose in healthy tissues. This could lead to new Beam Shape
Assembly designs in order to optimise the BNCT irradiation.

the cotangent models a model for the prequantum line bundle. These
singularities are generic in the sense that are given by Morse-type functions
and include elliptic, hyperbolic and focus-focus singularities. Examples of

oscillators, the spherical pendulum or the reduction of the Euler's equations
of the rigid body on $T^*(SO(3))$ to a sphere. Our geometric quantization
formulation coincides with the previous models away from the singularities and
corrects former models for hyperbolic and focus-focus singularities cancelling
out the infinite dimensional contributions obtained by former approaches. The
geometric quantization models provided here match the classical physical
methods for mechanical systems such as the spherical pendulum. Our cotangent

way to study them is take local data, the number of solutions modulo $p$, and
create an $L$-function. The behavior of this global object is related to two of
the seven Clay Millennial Problems: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. We study one-parameter families over
$\mathbb{Q}(T)$, which are of the form $y^2=x^3+A(T)x+B(T)$, with non-constant
$j$-invariant. We define the r-th moment of an elliptic curve to be $A_{r,E}(p)
:= \frac1{p} \sum_{t \bmod p} a_t(p)^r$, where $a_t(p)$ is $p$ minus the number
of solutions to $y^2 = x^3 + A(t)x + B(t) \bmod p$. Rosen and Silverman showed
biases in the first moment equal the rank of the Mordell-Weil group of rational
solutions.
  Michel proved that $pA_{2,E}(p)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$. Based on several special
families where computations can be done in closed form, Miller in his thesis
conjectured that the largest lower-order term in the second moment that does
not average to $0$ is on average negative. He further showed that such a
negative bias has implications in the distribution of zeros of the elliptic
curve $L$-function near the central point. To date, evidence for this
conjecture is limited to special families. In addition to studying some
additional families where the calculations can be done in closed form, we also
systematically investigate families of various rank. These are the first
general tests of the conjecture; while we cannot in general obtain closed form
solutions, we discuss computations which support or contradict the conjecture.
We then generalize to higher moments, and see evidence that the bias continues
in the even moments.

such as word and database embeddings, we observe that floating point exponent
values cluster around a few unique values, permitting entropy based data
compression. Entropy coding compresses fixed-length values with variable-length
codes, encoding most probable values with fewer bits. We propose the EFloat
compressed floating point number format that uses a variable field boundary
between the exponent and significand fields. EFloat uses entropy coding on
exponent values and signs to minimize the average width of the exponent and
sign fields, while preserving the original FP32 exponent range unchanged. Saved
bits become part of the significand field increasing the EFloat numeric
precision by 4.3 bits on average compared to other reduced-precision floating
point formats. EFloat makes 8-bit and even smaller floats practical without
sacrificing the exponent range of a 32-bit floating point representation. We
currently use the EFloat format for saving memory capacity and bandwidth
consumption of large vector embedding models such as those used for database
embeddings. Using the RMS error as metric, we demonstrate that EFloat provides
higher accuracy than other floating point formats with equal bit budget. The
EF12 format with 12-bit budget has less end-to-end application error than the
16-bit BFloat16. EF16 with 16-bit budget has an RMS-error 17 to 35 times less
than BF16 RMS-error for a diverse set of embedding models. When making
similarity and dissimilarity queries, using the NDCG ranking metric, EFloat
matches the result quality of prior floating point representations with larger
bit budgets.

theorem to the optical geometry of asymptotically flat black holes and apply
the Gibbons-Werner technique to achieve the deflection angle of photons in weak
field limits. Subsequently, we manifest the influence of plasma medium on
deflection of photons by asymptotically flat black holes in the context of
Horndeski theory. We also examine the graphical impact of deflection angle on
asymptotically flat black holes in the background of Horndeski theory in plasma
medium as well as non-plasma medium.

predicted to be approximately 0.15% by end-of-bombardment (EOB).
Superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters offer high
resolution energy spectroscopy using the normal-to-superconducting phase
transition to measure small change in temperature. By embedding 225Ac
production samples in a gold foil thermally coupled to a TES microcalorimeter
we can measure the decay energies of the radionuclides embedded with high
resolution and efficiency. This technique, known as decay energy spectroscopy
(DES), collapses several peaks from alpha decays into single Q-value peaks. In
practice there are more complex factors in the interpretation of data using
DES, which we will discuss herein. Using this technique we measured the EOB
227Ac impurity to be (0.142 +/- 0.005)% for a single production sample. This
demonstration has shown that DES can distinguish closely related isotopic

multiscale Bayesian inference approach is introduced based on deep
probabilistic generative models. Such generative models provide a flexible
representation by inferring on each scale a low-dimensional latent encoding
while allowing hierarchical parameter generation from coarse- to fine-scales.
Combining the multiscale generative model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
inference across scales is achieved enabling us to efficiently obtain posterior
parameter samples at various scales. The estimation of coarse-scale parameters
using a low-dimensional latent embedding captures global and notable parameter
features using an inexpensive but inaccurate solver. MCMC sampling of the
fine-scale parameters is enabled by utilizing the posterior information in the
immediate coarser-scale. In this way, the global features are identified in the
coarse-scale with inference of low-dimensional variables and inexpensive
forward computation, and the local features are refined and corrected in the
fine-scale. The developed method is demonstrated with two types of permeability
estimation for flow in heterogeneous media. One is a Gaussian random field
(GRF) with uncertain length scales, and the other is channelized permeability
with the two regions defined by different GRFs. The obtained results indicate
that the method allows high-dimensional parameter estimation while exhibiting
stability, efficiency and accuracy.

adherence of each of these signals with respect to a reference set of

those discrete signals found to be adjustable, it becomes possible to obtain a
respective transition network that can be not only used to study the properties

determinants and COVID-19 disease through a predictive value of R2 = .916,

poverty variable as the main risk factor related to the high rates of infection
in Republican states and a high positive correlation between the population not
insured with a medical plan and high levels of virus contagion in the states of

  operations",,,,,"q-fin.GN math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper aspects related to handling of intraday imbalances for hydro
and wind power are addressed. The definition of imbalance cost is established
and used to describe the potential benefits of shifting from plant-specific
schedules to a common load requirement for wind and hydropower units in the
same price area. The Nordpool intraday pay-as-bid market has been the basis for
evaluation of imbalances, and some main characteristics for this market has
been described. We consider how internal handling of complementary imbalances
within the same river system with high inflow uncertainty and constrained
reservoirs can reduce volatility in short-term marginal cost and risk compared
to trading in the intraday market. We have also shown the the imbalance cost
for a power producer with both wind and hydropower assets can be reduced by
internal balancing in combination with sales and purchase in a pay-as-bid
intraday market

demonstrated. LiNbO3-silica hybrid waveguide is adopted to maintain low optical
loss for an electrode spacing as narrow as 3 {\mu}m, resulting in a record low
half-wave-voltage length product of only 1.7 V*cm. Capacitively loaded
traveling-wave electrodes (CL-TWEs) are employed to reduce the microwave loss,
while quartz substrate is used in place of silicon substrate to achieve
velocity matching. The fabricated TFLN modulator with a 5-mm-long modulation
region exhibits a half-wave-voltage of 3.4 V and merely 1.3 dB roll-off in
electro-optic response up to 67 GHz, and a 3-dB modulation bandwidth over 110
GHz is predicted.

"2105.05681","Asher Yahalom PhD","Shailendra Rajput and Asher Yahalom","Newton's Third Law in the Framework of Special Relativity for Charged
  Bodies","32 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:2004.14169",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Newton's third law states that any action is countered by a reaction of equal
magnitude but opposite direction. The total force in a system not affected by
external forces is thus zero. However, according to the principles of
relativity, a signal cannot propagate at speeds exceeding the speed of light.
Hence the action and reaction cannot be generated at the same time due to the
relativity of simultaneity. Thus, the total force cannot be null at a given
time. In a previous paper \cite{MTAY1}, we have shown that Newt\-on'n third law
cannot strictly hold in a distributed system, where the different parts are at
a finite distance from each other. This is due to the finite speed of signal
propagation, which cannot exceed the speed of light in the vacuum. A specific
example of two current loops with time dependent currents demonstrated that the
summing of the total force in the system does not add up to zero. This analysis
led to the suggestion of a relativistic engine \cite{MTAY3,AY1}. As the system
is affected by a total force for a finite period, the system acquires
mechanical momentum and energy. Now the question then arises how can we
accommodate the law of momentum and energy conservation. The subject of
momentum conversation was discussed in \cite{MTAY4}, while preliminary results
regarding energy conservation were discussed in \cite{AY2,RY,RY2}. Previous
analysis relied on the fact that the bodies were macroscopically natural, which
means that the number of electrons and ions is equal in every volume element.
Here we relax this assumption and study charged bodies, thus analyzing the
consequences on a possible electric relativistic engine.

graphs. The model produces new molecular structures from a single-node graph by
recursively splitting every node into two. All operations are invertible and
can be used as plug-and-play modules. The hierarchical nature of the latent
codes allows for precise changes in the resulting graph: perturbations in the
top layer cause global structural changes, while perturbations in the
consequent layers change the resulting molecule marginally. The proposed model
outperforms existing generative graph models on the distribution learning task.
We also show successful experiments on global and constrained optimization of
chemical properties using latent codes of the model.
