investigated the control problem of optimizing dividends when limiting capital
injections stopped upon bankruptcy. The first paper works under the spectrally
negative L\'evy model; the second works under the Cram\'er-Lundberg model with
exponential jumps, where the results are considerably more explicit. The
current paper has three purposes. First, it illustrates the fact that quite
reasonable approximations of the general problem may be obtained using the
particular exponential case studied in Avram-Goreac-Li-Wu(2020). Secondly, it
extends the results to the case when a final penalty $P$ is taken into
consideration as well besides a proportional cost $k>1$ for capital injections.
This requires amending the ""scale and Gerber-Shiu functions"" already introduced
in Gajek-Kucinsky(2017). Thirdly, in the exponential case, the results will be
made even more explicit by employing the Lambert-W function. This tool has
particular importance in computational aspects and can be employed in
theoretical aspects such as asymptotics.

that involve rare events, such as in extreme quantile estimation, running crude
Monte Carlo can be prohibitively inefficient. To address this issue, importance
sampling can be employed to drive down the sampling error to a desirable level.
However, selecting a good importance sampler requires knowledge of the solution
to the problem at hand, which is the goal to begin with and thus forms a
circular challenge. We investigate the use of adaptive importance sampling to
untie this circularity. Our procedure sequentially updates the importance
sampler to reach the optimal sampler and the optimal solution simultaneously,
and can be embedded in both sample average approximation and stochastic
approximation-type algorithms. Our theoretical analysis establishes strong
consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. We also
demonstrate, via a minimax perspective, the key role of using adaptivity in
controlling asymptotic errors. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our
approach via numerical experiments.

potential ways of recovering the attacked data without paying the ransom demand

of the categorization, in increasing severity from CAT1 through to CAT5, show
that many ransomwares exhibit flaws in their implementation of encryption and
deletion attack structures which make data recovery possible without paying the

exploiting encryption essentials while CAT3 can be effectively mitigated via
reverse engineering. CAT1 and CAT2 are not common and are easily mitigated

a mobile base station (UAV-BS) to stream videos from other flying UAV-users

is important to determine the optimal movements and transmission powers for

the area of medical imaging using artificial intelligence and deep learning.
Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results
using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the
non-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding
high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas
of research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image
super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved
by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a
customized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to
convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain
using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned
transformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef
convolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the
transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the
Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and
low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution
simplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the
quality of Covid based medical images. It is shown that our architecture
enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better
image quality that helps in clinical diagnosis. Experimental results obtained
using the proposed Tchebichef transform domain super-resolution (TTDSR)
architecture provides competitive results when compared with most of the deep
learning methods employed using a fewer number of trainable parameters.

fluids, with a vortex situated on it. We show how surface tension causes
vorticity generation at a general curved interface. This creates a velocity
jump across the interface which increases quadratically in time, and causes the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Surface tension thus acts as a destabiliser by
vorticity creation, winning over its own tendency to stabilize by smoothing out
interfacial perturbations to reduce surface energy. We further show that this
instability is manifested within the vortex core at times larger than $\sim (k
We)^{1/4}$ for a Weber number $We$ and perturbation wavenumber $k$, destroying
the flow structure. The vorticity peels off into small-scale structures away
from the interface. Using energy balance we provide the growth with time in
total interface length. A density difference between the fluids produces
additional instabilities outside the vortex core due to centrifugal effects. We
demonstrate the importance of this mechanism in two-dimensional turbulence
simulations with a prescribed initial interface. We show an increase in kinetic
energy at large wave numbers due to the creation of small-scale vortices by the

(VPD), representing the human arterial system, for the primary purpose of
studying the affects of arterial disease on haemodynamics. A low dimensional
representation of an anatomically detailed arterial network is outlined, and a
physiologically realistic posterior distribution for its parameters is
constructed through a Bayesian approach. This approach combines both
physiological/geometrical constraints and the available measurements reported
in the literature. A key contribution of this work is to present a framework
for including all such available information for the creation of virtual
patients (VPs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to sample
random VPs from this posterior distribution, and the pressure and flow-rate
profiles associated with the VPs are computed through a model of pulse wave
propagation. This combination of the arterial network parameters (representing
the VPs) and the haemodynamics waveforms of pressure and flow-rates at various
locations (representing functional response of the VPs) makes up the VPD. While
75,000 VPs are sampled from the posterior distribution, 10,000 are discarded as
the initial burn-in period. A further 12,857 VPs are subsequently removed due
to the presence of negative average flow-rate. Due to an undesirable behaviour
observed in some VPs -- asymmetric under- and over-damped pressure and
flow-rate profiles in the left and right sides of the arterial system -- a
filter is proposed for their removal. The final VPD has 28,868 subjects. It is
shown that the methodology is appropriate by comparing the VPD statistics to
those reported in literature across real populations. A good agreement between
the two is found while respecting physiological/geometrical constraints. The

Imaginary Time Method and is found to strongly depend on the sign of the quark

probability for the negative charges is larger than for the positive ones at

adopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate
performance. However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the
convolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies
in the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage
self-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn
representations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore
Transformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using
Transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks.
Majority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for
vision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However,
compared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the
number of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently
train transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated
Axial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing
an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to
train the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global
training strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically,
we operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features,
respectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three
different medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves
better performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based
architectures. Code: https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/Medical-Transformer

coming from views of possibly different images through the use of patient

interpretation including requiring them to be from the same patient, imaging
study or laterality. We evaluate downstream task performance by fine-tuning the
linear layer on 1% of the labeled dataset for pleural effusion classification.
Our best performing positive pair selection strategy, which involves using
images from the same patient from the same study across all lateralities,
achieves a performance increase of 14.4% in mean AUC from the ImageNet
pretrained baseline. Our controlled experiments show that the keys to improving
downstream performance on disease classification are (1) using patient metadata
to appropriately create positive pairs from different images with the same
underlying pathologies, and (2) maximizing the number of different images used
in query pairing. In addition, we explore leveraging patient metadata to select
hard negative pairs for contrastive learning, but do not find improvement over
baselines that do not use metadata. Our method is broadly applicable to medical
image interpretation and allows flexibility for incorporating medical insights

However, this desirable feature is achieved only if stability is also

preventing NECs generally becomes an intractable problem as the number of

trade-off between local and group shrinkage in a data adaptive fashion. A
special case of the GIGG prior is the group horseshoe prior, whose shrinkage
profile is correlated within-group such that the regression coefficients

least two major goals, that of finding the correct model or predicting well. In
this work we discuss through a study of well-known model selection methods like
Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC),
deviance information criterion (DIC) and Bayesian evidence, how these different
goals are pursued in each paradigm. We also apply another method for model
selection which less seen in cosmological literature, the Cross-validation
method. Using these methods we will compare two different scenarios in
cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM model and dynamical dark energy. We show that each of
the methods tends to different results in model selection. While BIC and
Bayesian evidence overrule the dynamical dark energy scenarios with 2 or 3
extra degree of freedom, the DIC and cross-validation method prefer these
dynamical models to $\Lambda$CDM model. Assuming the numerical results of
different analysis and combining cosmological and statistical aspects of the
subject, we propose cross-validation as an interesting method for model
selection in cosmology that can lead to different results in comparison with
usual methods of model selection.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2101.09790",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the information bottleneck (IB) problem of a Rayleigh
fading multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) channel with an oblivious relay. The
relay is constrained to operate without knowledge of the codebooks, i.e., it
performs oblivious processing. Moreover, due to the bottleneck constraint, it
is impossible for the relay to inform the destination node of the perfect
channel state information (CSI) in each channel realization. To evaluate the
bottleneck rate, we first provide an upper bound by assuming that the
destination node can get the perfect CSI at no cost. Then, we provide four
achievable schemes where each scheme satisfies the bottleneck constraint and
gives a lower bound to the bottleneck rate. In the first and second schemes,
the relay splits the capacity of the relay-destination link into two parts, and
conveys both the CSI and its observation to the destination node. Due to CSI
transmission, the performance of these two schemes is sensitive to the MIMO
channel dimension, especially the channel input dimension. To ensure that it
still performs well when the channel dimension grows large, in the third and
fourth achievable schemes, the relay only transmits compressed observation to
the destination node. Numerical results show that with simple symbol-by-symbol
oblivious relay processing and compression, the proposed achievable schemes
work well and can demonstrate lower bounds coming quite close to the upper
bound on a wide range of relevant system parameters.

high energy electrodynamics. We argue that on the temperatures comparable to
the electroweak scale, characteristic for the early Universe and objects like
neutron stars, the description of electromagnetic fields in conductive plasmas
needs to be extended to include the effects of chiral anomaly. It is
demonstrated that chiral effects can have a significant influence on the
evolution of magnetic fields, tending to produce exponential amplification,
creation of magnetic helicity from initially non-helical fields, and can lead
to an inverse energy transfer. We further discuss the modified
magnetohydrodynamic equations around the electroweak transition. The obtained
solutions demonstrate that the asymmetry between right-handed and left-handed
charged fermions of negligible mass typically grows with time when approaching
the electroweak crossover from higher temperatures, until it undergoes a fast
decrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower
temperatures in the broken phase. At the same time, the dissipation of magnetic
fields gets slower due to the chiral effects. We furthermore report some first
analytical attempts in the study of chiral magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.
Using the analysis of simplified regimes and qualitative arguments, it is shown
that anomalous effects can strongly support turbulent inverse cascade and lead
to a faster growth of the correlation length, when compared to the evolution
predicted by the non-chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Finally, the discussion of
relaxation towards minimal energy states in the chiral magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence is also presented.

defined clinical purposes--generates images of great similarity in anatomy
across patients and yields sophisticated anatomical patterns across images,
which are associated with rich semantics about human anatomy and which are
natural visual words. We show that these visual words can be automatically
harvested according to anatomical consistency via self-discovery, and that the
self-discovered visual words can serve as strong yet free supervision signals
for deep models to learn semantics-enriched generic image representation via
self-supervision (self-classification and self-restoration). Our extensive
experiments demonstrate the annotation efficiency of TransVW by offering higher
performance and faster convergence with reduced annotation cost in several
applications. Our TransVW has several important advantages, including (1)
TransVW is a fully autodidactic scheme, which exploits the semantics of visual
words for self-supervised learning, requiring no expert annotation; (2) visual
word learning is an add-on strategy, which complements existing self-supervised
methods, boosting their performance; and (3) the learned image representation
is semantics-enriched models, which have proven to be more robust and
generalizable, saving annotation efforts for a variety of applications through
transfer learning. Our code, pre-trained models, and curated visual words are

are highly sensitive to model initialisation, imprecise keypoint localisations

approach for shape-aware 3D vehicle reconstruction from stereo images that
leverages the outputs of a novel multi-task CNN. Specifically, we train a CNN
that outputs probability distributions for the vehicle's orientation and for
both, vehicle keypoints and wireframe edges. Together with 3D stereo

reduces the sensitivity to keypoint localisation errors. We show that our

terms of one-dimensional automorphic representations in the setup of mod p
Hodge-type Shimura varieties with hyperspecial level at p, mirroring the well
known analogue for complex Shimura varieties. As an application, we obtain a
completely new approach to two geometric questions. (See Sect. 1.5 for a
comparison with independent results by van Hoften and Xiao via a different
approach.) Firstly, we verify the discrete part of the Hecke orbit conjecture,
which amounts to irreducibility of central leaves, generalizing preceding works
by Chai, Oort, Yu, et al. Secondly, we deduce irreducibility of Igusa towers
and its generalization to non-basic Igusa varieties in the same generality,
extending previous results by Igusa, Ribet, Faltings--Chai, Hida, and others.
Our proof is based on a Langlands--Kottwitz-type formula for Igusa varieties
due to Mack-Crane, an asymptotic study of the trace formula, and an estimate
for unitary representations and their Jacquet modules in representation theory
of $p$-adic groups due to Howe--Moore and Casselman.

systems are often found in expensive smart homes, government and academic
conference rooms, yachts, and smart private offices. However, while there has
been plenty of research on the topic of commodity systems, no current study
exists that provides a complete picture of E-IoT systems, their components, and

popularity and use to an increasing number of applications. Very recent works,
however, demonstrate that modern day deep networks suffer from
irreproducibility (also referred to as nondeterminism or underspecification).
Two or more models that are identical in architecture, structure, training
hyper-parameters, and parameters, and that are trained on exactly the same
training data, yield different predictions on individual previously unseen
examples. Thus, a model that performs well on controlled test data, may perform
in unexpected ways when deployed in the real world, whose data is expected to
be similar to the test data. We study simple synthetic models and data to
understand the origins of these problems. We show that even with a single
nonlinearity and for very simple data and models, irreproducibility occurs. Our
study demonstrates the effects of randomness in initialization, training data
shuffling window size, and activation functions on prediction
irreproducibility, even under very controlled synthetic data. While, as one
would expect, randomness in initialization and in shuffling the training
examples exacerbates the phenomenon, we show that model complexity and the
choice of nonlinearity also play significant roles in making deep models
irreproducible.

forms we observe are branching rods and entrapping spheres on the 100micron

hydroxy-glycine, Fe, O and Li. The other, we term hemoglycin of mass 1494Da is
of glycine, hydroxy-glycine, Fe and O. Hemoglycin is connected covalently in
triplets by silicon to form a triskelion. Analysis of the complete spectrum of
isotopes associated with each molecular fragment shows very high 2H enhancement

magnitude constraints is utilized in the proposed two-stage stochastic DA

of the LAC-OPF approach which decreases the computational burden, and (ii)
obtain LAC-OPF pre-defined parameters adaptively so that the accuracy of
LAC-OPF approach is increased as a result of reducing artificial losses.
Furthermore, as the CAES efficiency depends on its thermodynamic and
operational conditions, the proposed two-stage stochastic DA scheduling model
is developed by considering its thermodynamic characteristics to obtain a more
realistic market decision at the first place. The proposed model is applied to
IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus test systems using GAMS software, and is compared with
three traditional approaches, i.e., AC-OPF, DC-OPF, and LAC-OPF. Simulation

  Avoidance from Human Player",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a sensor-level mapless collision avoidance algorithm for
use in mobile robots that map raw sensor data to linear and angular velocities
and navigate in an unknown environment without a map. An efficient training
strategy is proposed to allow a robot to learn from both human experience data
and self-exploratory data. A game format simulation framework is designed to
allow the human player to tele-operate the mobile robot to a goal and human
action is also scored using the reward function. Both human player data and
self-playing data are sampled using prioritized experience replay algorithm.
The proposed algorithm and training strategy have been evaluated in two
different experimental configurations: \textit{Environment 1}, a simulated
cluttered environment, and \textit{Environment 2}, a simulated corridor
environment, to investigate the performance. It was demonstrated that the
proposed method achieved the same level of reward using only 16\% of the
training steps required by the standard Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) method in Environment 1 and 20\% of that in Environment 2. In the
evaluation of 20 random missions, the proposed method achieved no collision in
less than 2~h and 2.5~h of training time in the two Gazebo environments
respectively. The method also generated smoother trajectories than DDPG. The
proposed method has also been implemented on a real robot in the real-world
environment for performance evaluation. We can confirm that the trained model
with the simulation software can be directly applied into the real-world
scenario without further fine-tuning, further demonstrating its higher
robustness than DDPG. The video and code are available:

the solution of a stochastic filtering problem. In contrast to conventional
particle filters, the Bayesian update step in FPF is implemented via a
mean-field type feedback control law.
  The objective for this paper is to situate the development of FPF and related
controlled interacting particle system algorithms within the framework of
optimal transportation theory. Starting from the simplest setting of the Bayes'
update formula, a coupling viewpoint is introduced to construct particle
filters. It is shown that the conventional importance sampling resampling
particle filter implements an independent coupling. Design of optimal couplings
is introduced first for the simple Gaussian settings and subsequently extended
to derive the FPF algorithm. The final half of the paper provides a review of
some of the salient aspects of the FPF algorithm including the feedback
structure, algorithms for gain function design, and comparison with
conventional particle filters. The comparison serves to illustrate the benefit
of feedback in particle filtering.

illuminates a large egg-shaped photodissociation (PDR) cavity. The PDR is
restricted to the west and south-west by the dense molecular Rho Oph A ridge,
expanding more freely into the diffuse low density cloud to the north-east. We
analyze new SOFIA GREAT, GMRT and APEX data together with archival data from
Herschel/PACS, JCMT/HARPS to study the properties of the photo-irradiated

micron, [O I] at 63 and 145 micron, J=6-5 transitions of CO and 13CO, HCO+
(4-3), radio continuum at 610 and 1420 MHz and HI at 21 cm. The PDR emission is
strongly red-shifted to the south-east of the nebula, and primarily
blue-shifted on the north western side. The [C II] and and [O I]63 spectra are
strongly self-absorbed over most of the PDR. By using the optically thin
counterparts, [13C II] and [O I]145 respectively, we conclude that the
self-absorption is dominated by the warm (>80 K) foreground PDR gas and not by
the surrounding cold molecular cloud. We estimate the column densities of C+
and O of the PDR to be 3e18 and 2e19 cm^-2, respectively. Comparison of stellar
far-ultraviolet flux and reprocessed infrared radiation suggest enhanced
clumpiness of the gas to the north-west. Analysis of the emission from the PDR
gas suggests the presence of at least three density components consisting of
high density (10^6 cm^-3) clumps, medium density (10^4 cm^-3) and diffuse (10^3
cm^-3) interclump medium. The medium density component primarily contributes to
the thermal pressure of the PDR gas which is in pressure equilibrium with the
molecular cloud to the west. We find that the PDR is tilted and warped with the
south-eastern side of the cavity being denser on the front and the
north-western side being denser on the rear.

their low saturation magnetization (i.e. smaller stray field). However, we show
by performing rigorous micromagnetic simulation that such scaling of skyrmion
size by lowering saturation magnetization while applicable in infinite films or
where the skyrmion size is very small compared to the film's lateral dimension,
does not hold in confined geometries. We also found in confined geometries,
where skyrmion occupies the whole volume of a nanodot, high saturation
magnetization helps form stable skyrmions. Specifically, such skyrmions can be
formed in 20 nm lateral dimension nanodots with high saturation magnetization
(1.6-1.71 MA/m) and moderate DMI (3 mJ/m2). This result could stimulate
experiments on implementation of highly dense skyrmion devices. In particular,
we show that Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) based switching
mediated by an intermediate skyrmion state can be achieved in the soft layer of
a ferromagnetic p-MTJ of lateral dimensions 20 nm with sub 1fJ/bit energy in

ceases to be flat over compact Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ in the base. These

three-form cohomology for $g>0$. In F-/M-theory these sectors are to be
interpreted as compactifications of six/five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$
superconformal matter theories. The three-form cohomology leads to additional
chiral singlets proportional to the dimension of five dimensional Coulomb
branch of those sectors. We construct explicit examples for E-string theories
as well as higher rank cases. For the E-string theories we further investigate
conifold transitions that remove those non-flat fibers. First, we show how
non-flat fibers can be deformed from curves down to isolated points in the
base. This removes the chiral singlet of the three-forms and leads to
non-perturbative four-point couplings among matter fields which can be
understood as remnants of the former E-string. Alternatively, the non-flat
fibers can be avoided by performing birational base changes, analogous to 6D
tensor branches. For compact bases these transitions alternate all Hodge

the case for the use of spin-dependent density functional (so-called sDFT$+U$).
Unlike some of the previous studies, our results show that CrOX monolayers are
antiferromagnetic as in the bulk. It is also consistent with our magnetic force
linear response calculation of exchange couplings $J_{\rm ex}$. The result of
orbital-decomposed $J_{\rm ex}$ calculations shows that the Cr
$t_\textrm{2g}$-$t_\textrm{2g}$ component mainly contributes to the
antiferromagnetic order in both bulk and monolayer. Our result and analysis
show that taking the correct Hund's physics into account is of key importance
to construct the magnetic phase diagram and to describe the electronic
structure.

The latter suggests that such Keplerian disc models thus could be consistent

recommendation accuracy and ease in online penalization and thus is favored by
the industrial recommender systems. ICF recommends items to a target user based
on their similarities to the previously interacted items of the user. Great
progresses have been achieved for ICF in recent years by applying advanced
machine learning techniques (e.g., deep neural networks) to learn the item
similarity from data. The early methods simply treat all the historical items
equally and recently proposed methods attempt to distinguish the different
importance of historical items when recommending a target item. Despite the
progress, we argue that those ICF models neglect the diverse intents of users
on adopting items (e.g., watching a movie because of the director, leading
actors, or the visual effects). As a result, they fail to estimate the item
similarity on a finer-grained level to predict the user's preference to an
item, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose a
general feature-level attention method for ICF models. The key of our method is
to distinguish the importance of different factors when computing the item
similarity for a prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we
design a light attention neural network to integrate both item-level and
feature-level attention for neural ICF models. It is model-agnostic and
easy-to-implement. We apply it to two baseline ICF models and evaluate its
effectiveness on six public datasets. Extensive experiments show the
feature-level attention enhanced models consistently outperform their
counterparts, demonstrating the potential of differentiating user intents on
the feature-level for ICF recommendation models.

millimeter-wave (mmWave) large-scale hybrid arrays, due to beam squint and much
fewer radio frequency (RF) chains than antennas. This paper presents a novel
joint delay and angle estimation approach for wideband mmWave fully-connected
hybrid uniform cylindrical arrays. We first design a new hybrid beamformer to
reduce the dimension of received signals on the horizontal plane by exploiting
the convergence of the Bessel function, and to reduce the active beams in the
vertical direction through preselection. The important recurrence relationship
of the received signals needed for subspace-based angle and delay estimation is
preserved, even with substantially fewer RF chains than antennas. Then, linear
interpolation is generalized to reconstruct the received signals of the hybrid
beamformer, so that the signals can be coherently combined across the whole
band to suppress the beam squint. As a result, efficient subspace-based
algorithm algorithms can be developed to estimate the angles and delays of
multipath components. The estimated delays and angles are further matched and
correctly associated with different paths in the presence of non-negligible
noises, by putting forth perturbation operations. Simulations show that the
proposed approach can approach the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the
estimation with a significantly lower computational complexity than existing

from galaxies to characterise early phases of the inside-out quenching by
massive black holes (BHs). The BH feedback is thought to quench star formation
by evacuating the ambient gas. In order to quantify the feedback effect on the
gas density in the galactic centres, we utilise the outputs of IllustrisTNG and
Illustris simulations, which implement different BH feedback models. We devise
a physical model of H$_{\rm ~II}$ regions and compute the intensities of
[O$_{\rm ~III}$] $52$ and $88~{\rm \mu m}$ lines. The line intensity ratio is
sensitive to the local electron density, and thus can be used to measure the
strength and physical extent of the BH quenching. If the BH feedback abruptly
operates and expel the gas when it grows to a certain mass, as modelled in
IllustrisTNG, the low-density gas yields relatively weak [O$_{\rm ~III}$] $52$
line with respect to $88~{\rm \mu m}$. In contrast, if the feedback strength
and hence the local gas density are not strongly correlated with the BH mass,
as in Illustris, the line ratio is not expected to vary significantly among
galaxies with different evolutionary stages. We find these features are
reproduced in the simulations. We also show that the line ratios are not
sensitive to the aperture size for measurement, and thus observations do not
need to resolve the galactic centres. We argue that the integrated line ratios
can be used to capture the onset of the inside-out quenching by BHs.

rather than relying on experimental data that could take several days to

exchange process, the Thomas model was picked for its simplicity and better
accuracy when compared to other models. The Thomas model contains two
parameters, the constant (KT) and the maximum resin capacity (qm), which are
empirically calculated. Unfortunately, the model demonstrated large parameter
fluctuations with no correlation to varying contact times or inlet chromate
concentrations. Therefore, fixing both parameters will lead to failed model
predictive behavior. By fixing the value of qm and proposing a linear
relationship of KT with resin contact time and inlet chromate concentration,
the accuracy of the model was improved five-fold, demonstrating its potential

quantum phase transition extend to finite-temperatures and terminate at a
thermal critical point, beyond which the nFL and the insulator become the same
phase, similar to that of the liquid-gas and metal-insulator transition in real
materials. We determine the pairing phase boundary and the location of the
thermal critical point via combined analytic and quantum Monte Carlo numeric

a challenge due to the lack of suitable material platforms. Here, we report an
observation of excitons coupled to zigzag antiferromagnetic order in the
layered antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3 using both photoluminescence (PL) and
optical reflection spectroscopy. The exciton exhibits a linewidth as narrow as
~350 ueV with near unity linear polarization in the PL spectrum. As the
thicknesses of samples is reduced from five layers to bilayers, the PL
intensity is drastically suppressed and eventually vanishes in monolayers,
consistent with the calculated bandgap being highly indirect for both bilayer
and monolayer. We observed strong linear dichroism (LD) over a broad spectra
range, which shares the same optical anisotropy axis, being locked to the
zigzag direction, as the exciton PL. Both LD and the degree of linear
polarization in the exciton PL decrease as the temperature increases and become
negligible above the Neel temperature. These observations suggest both optical
quantities are probes of the symmetry breaking magnetic order parameter. In
addition, a sharp resonance in the LD spectrum is observed with an energy near
the exciton PL. There exist over ten exciton-A1g phonon bound states on its
high energy side, which likely result from the strong modulation of the
ligand-to-metal charge transfer energy by strong electron-lattice interactions.

members remain hidden inside the network. The current study focuses on hiding
such sensitive communities so that the community affiliation of the targeted
nodes can be concealed. This leads to the problem of community deception which
investigates the avenues of minimally rewiring nodes in a network so that a
given target community maximally hides from a community detection algorithm. We
formalize the problem of community deception and introduce NEURAL, a novel
method that greedily optimizes a node-centric objective function to determine
the rewiring strategy. Theoretical settings pose a restriction on the number of
strategies that can be employed to optimize the objective function, which in
turn reduces the overhead of choosing the best strategy from multiple options.
We also show that our objective function is submodular and monotone. When
tested on both synthetic and 7 real-world networks, NEURAL is able to deceive 6
widely used community detection algorithms. We benchmark its performance with
respect to 4 state-of-the-art methods on 4 evaluation metrics. Additionally,
our qualitative analysis of 3 other attributed real-world networks reveals that
NEURAL, quite strikingly, captures important meta-information about edges that
otherwise could not be inferred by observing only their topological structures.

2 models; M1 and M2. M1 is a task agnostic embedding generator whose output
feeds into M2 which is a task specific label generator. We pre-train M1 on a

our unsupervised meta training regime is able to acquire a learning algorithm

pre-hoc approach that require computing the segmentation map of the glioma

time. However, the training of the segmentation methods require ground truth
segmentation labels which are tedious and expensive to obtain. Given that most
of the large-scale data sets available from hospitals are unlikely to contain
such precise segmentation, those SOTA methods have limited applicability. In
this paper, we introduce a new post-hoc method for OS time prediction that does
not require segmentation map annotation for training. Our model uses medical
image and patient demographics (represented by age) as inputs to estimate the
OS time and to estimate a saliency map that localizes the tumor as a way to
explain the OS time prediction in a post-hoc manner. It is worth emphasizing
that although our model can localize tumors, it uses only the ground truth OS
time as training signal, i.e., no segmentation labels are needed. We evaluate
our post-hoc method on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge

However, due to its NP-hardness and the explosive growth of graph data, it is
challenging to compute subgraph matching, especially in large graphs. In this
paper, we aim at scaling up subgraph matching on a single machine using FPGAs.
Specifically, we propose a CPU-FPGA co-designed framework. On the CPU side, we
first develop a novel auxiliary data structure called candidate search tree
(CST) which serves as a complete search space of subgraph matching. CST can be
partitioned and fully loaded into FPGAs' on-chip memory. Then, a workload
estimation technique is proposed to balance the load between the CPU and FPGA.
On the FPGA side, we design and implement the first FPGA-based subgraph
matching algorithm, called FAST. To take full advantage of the pipeline
mechanism on FPGAs, task parallelism optimization and task generator separation
strategy are proposed for FAST, achieving massive parallelism. Moreover, we
carefully develop a BRAM-only matching process to fully utilize FPGA's on-chip
memory, which avoids the expensive intermediate data transfer between FPGA's
BRAM and DRAM. Comprehensive experiments show that FAST achieves up to 462.0x
and 150.0x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm DAF and CECI,
respectively. In addition, FAST is the only algorithm that can handle the
billion-scale graph using one machine in our experiments.

relaxation utilizes a new equality on Moore-Penrose inverses that convexifies
the non-convex objective function while coinciding with the original objective
on all feasible binary points. This allows us to solve the problem
significantly more efficiently and to provable optimality using a cutting
plane-type algorithm. We develop a highly optimized implementation of such

complexity of a straightforward implementation. We further develop a heuristic
method that is guaranteed to produce a feasible solution and, as we empirically
illustrate, generates high quality warm-start solutions for the binary
optimization problem. We show, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, that
the resulting algorithm outperforms competing formulations in comparable times
across a variety of metrics including out-of-sample predictive performance,

stochastically dominates the control, for example). We develop a novel

Specifically, the notions of active detection time (ADT) and active detection

multiple times within one coherence time. By taking sporadic user traffic and
short packet features into consideration, we model the joint active user
detection and channel estimation issue into a dynamic compressive sensing (CS)

Numerical results show that the proposed S-AMP algorithm enhances active user

practice, demonstrating difficulty in generalization beyond training data.
Recently, knowledge distillation has been used to successfully regularize the
student by transferring knowledge from the teacher. However, the teacher and
the student are trained on the same dataset and tend to learn similar feature
representations, whereas the most general knowledge should be found through
differences. The finding of general knowledge is further hindered by the
unidirectional distillation, as the student should obey the teacher and may
discard some knowledge that is truly general but refuted by the teacher. To
this end, we propose a novel training framework, where the learning of general
knowledge is more in line with the idea of reaching consensus, i.e., finding
common knowledge that is beneficial to different yet all datasets through
diversified learning partners. Concretely, the training task is divided into a
group of subtasks with the same number of students. Each student assigned to
one subtask not only is optimized on the allocated subtask but also imitates
multi-view feature representation aggregated from other students (i.e., student
peers), which induces students to capture common knowledge among different
subtasks and alleviates the over-fitting of students on the allocated subtasks.
To further enhance generalization, we extend the unidirectional distillation to
the bidirectional distillation that encourages the student and its student
peers to co-evolve by exchanging complementary knowledge with each other.
Empirical results and analysis demonstrate that our training framework
effectively improves the model generalization without sacrificing training
efficiency.

QFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an
alternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific

as predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually
consistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms
of L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal
distributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) using
L-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of
digital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

of communication system is able to outperform the classical communication

adversarial network (GAN) based training scheme has been recently proposed to
imitate the real channel. However, the gradient vanishing and overfitting

residual aided GAN (RA-GAN) based training scheme in this paper. Particularly,
inspired by the idea of residual learning, we propose a residual generator to
mitigate the gradient vanishing problem by realizing a more robust gradient
backpropagation. Moreover, to cope with the overfitting problem, we reconstruct
the loss function for training by adding a regularizer, which limits the
representation ability of RA-GAN. Simulation results show that the trained
residual generator has better generation performance than the conventional
generator, and the proposed RA-GAN based training scheme can achieve the
near-optimal block error rate (BLER) performance with a negligible
computational complexity increase in both the theoretical channel model and the
ray-tracing based channel dataset.

However, presence of water changes not only energetics, but also the dynamic

evacuation. These dynamics can create challenges for achieving strong
underwater adhesion/friction, which affects diverse fields including soft
robotics, bio-locomotion and tire traction. Closer investigation, requiring
sufficiently precise resolution of film evacuation while simultaneously
controlling surface wettability has been lacking. We perform high resolution
in-situ frustrated total internal reflection imaging to track underwater
contact evolution between soft-elastic hemispheres of varying stiffness and
smooth-hard surfaces of varying wettability. Surprisingly, we find exponential
rate of water evacuation from hydrophobic-hydrophobic (adhesive) contact is 3
orders of magnitude lower than that from hydrophobic-hydrophilic (non-adhesive)
contact. The trend of decreasing rate with decreasing wettability of glass
sharply changes about a point where thermodynamic adhesion crosses zero,
suggesting a transition in mode of evacuation, which is illuminated by
3-Dimensional spatiotemporal heightmaps. Adhesive contact is characterized by
the early localization of sealed puddles, whereas non-adhesive contact remains
smooth, with film-wise evacuation from one central puddle. Measurements with a
human thumb and alternatively hydrophobic/hydrophilic glass surface demonstrate
practical consequences of the same dynamics: adhesive interactions cause
instability in valleys and lead to a state of more trapped water and less

handle the pedestrian detection and identification sub-tasks using a single
network. There are two major challenges in the current one-step approaches. One
is the mutual interference between the optimization objectives of multiple
sub-tasks. The other is the sub-optimal identification feature learning caused
by small batch size when end-to-end training. To overcome these problems, we
propose a decoupled and memory-reinforced network (DMRNet). Specifically, to
reconcile the conflicts of multiple objectives, we simplify the standard
tightly coupled pipelines and establish a deeply decoupled multi-task learning
framework. Further, we build a memory-reinforced mechanism to boost the
identification feature learning. By queuing the identification features of
recently accessed instances into a memory bank, the mechanism augments the
similarity pair construction for pairwise metric learning. For better encoding
consistency of the stored features, a slow-moving average of the network is
applied for extracting these features. In this way, the dual networks reinforce
each other and converge to robust solution states. Experimentally, the proposed
method obtains 93.2% and 46.9% mAP on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets, which exceeds

Secondly, the decrease of the hybridization between the Ce-4$f$ and conduction
electrons in the surface layer leads to a weaker Kondo resonance peak and the
shift of spin-orbit bands. Thirdly, the variation of crystal electric field
around surface Ce atoms affects the splitting of Kondo resonance peaks, and
also pushes down the lower-Hubbard bands of surface 4$f$ electrons. Moreover,
we find the characteristic of bulk's lower-Hubbard bands, which was overlooked

of continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named as Neural Delay
Differential Equations (NDDEs), and, for computing the corresponding gradients,
we use the adjoint sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the
adjoint. Since the differential equations with delays are usually seen as
dynamical systems of infinite dimension possessing more fruitful dynamics, the
NDDEs, compared to the NODEs, own a stronger capacity of nonlinear
representations. Indeed, we analytically validate that the NDDEs are of
universal approximators, and further articulate an extension of the NDDEs,
where the initial function of the NDDEs is supposed to satisfy ODEs. More
importantly, we use several illustrative examples to demonstrate the
outstanding capacities of the NDDEs and the NDDEs with ODEs' initial value.
Specifically, (1) we successfully model the delayed dynamics where the
trajectories in the lower-dimensional phase space could be mutually
intersected, while the traditional NODEs without any argumentation are not
directly applicable for such modeling, and (2) we achieve lower loss and higher
accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models but
also for the real-world image datasets, i.e., CIFAR10, MNIST, and SVHN. Our
results on the NDDEs reveal that appropriately articulating the elements of
dynamical systems into the network design is truly beneficial to promoting the

controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems that are guaranteed to satisfy
safety and liveness (e.g., reach-avoid) properties. Our approach is to combine
model-based design methodologies for dynamical systems with data-driven
approaches to achieve this target. We confine our attention to NNs with
Rectifier Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity which are known to represent
Continuous Piece-Wise Affine (CPWA) functions. Given a mathematical model of
the dynamical system, we compute a finite-state abstract model that captures
the closed-loop behavior under all possible CPWA controllers. Using this
finite-state abstract model, our framework identifies a family of CPWA
functions guaranteed to satisfy the safety requirements. We augment the
learning algorithm with a NN weight projection operator during training that
enforces the resulting NN to represent a CPWA function from the provably safe
family of CPWA functions. Moreover, the proposed framework uses the
finite-state abstract model to identify candidate CPWA functions that may
satisfy the liveness properties. Using such candidate CPWA functions, the
proposed framework biases the NN training to achieve the liveness
specification. We show the efficacy of the proposed framework both in
simulation and on an actual robotic vehicle.

Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as
box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic

re-insert, and delete), ikd-Tree actively monitors the tree structure and
partially re-balances the tree, which enables efficient nearest point search in

accurately measure the reliability on average across the entire population.
However, it is in general impossible to measure the reliability of an
individual prediction. In this work, we propose the local calibration error
(LCE) to span the gap between average and individual reliability. For each
individual prediction, the LCE measures the average reliability of a set of

pretrained feature space and by a binning scheme over predicted model
confidences. We show theoretically that the LCE can be estimated
sample-efficiently from data, and empirically find that it reveals
miscalibration modes that are more fine-grained than the ECE can detect. Our
key result is a novel local recalibration method LoRe, to improve confidence

that our recalibration method produces more accurate confidence scores, which
improves downstream fairness and decision making on classification tasks with

Standard approaches for Robot-to-human communication face difficulties in
industry settings, e.g., because of high noise levels or certain visibility
requirements. Therefore, this paper presents zoomorphic gestures based on dog
body language as a possible alternative for communicating the state of
appearance-constrained cobots. For this purpose, we conduct a visual
communication benchmark comparing zoomorphic gestures, abstract gestures, and
light displays. We investigate the modalities regarding intuitive
understanding, user experience, and user preference. In a first user study (n =
93), we evaluate our proposed design guidelines for all visual modalities. A
second user study (n = 214) constituting the benchmark indicates that intuitive
understanding and user experience are highest for both gesture-based
modalities. Furthermore, zoomorphic gestures are considerably preferred over
other modalities. These findings indicate that zoomorphic gestures with their
playful nature are especially suitable for novel users and may decrease initial
inhibitions.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework named LightCAKE for

introducing redundant trainable parameters, and uses an iterative aggregation

high upper critical fields and low electromagnetic anisotropy, making them
particularly attractive for high-field applications, especially in particle
accelerator magnets, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, medical magnetic
resonance imaging systems and nuclear fusion reactors. Herein, through an
industrially scalable and cost-effective manufacturing strategy, a practical
level critical current density up to 1.1x10^5 A/cm2 at 4.2 K in an external
magnetic field of 10 T was achieved in Cu/Ag composite sheathed Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2

grain texture and a subsequent hot-isostatic-pressing densification. By varying
the parameters of rolling, the degree of grain texture was engineered. It is
found that the transport properties of the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 tapes can be enhanced
by applying a large amount of deformation during rolling, which can be
attributed to the improved degree of c-axis texture. Microstructure
characterizations on the highest-performance tape demonstrate that the
Ba1-xKxFe2As2 phase has a uniform element distribution and small grains with
good connectivity. Grain boundary pinning is consequently enhanced as proved by
large currents circulating through the sample even at 25 K. Our work proves
that Cu/Ag composite sheathed Ba1-xKxFe2As2 superconducting tapes can be a
promising competitor for practical high-field applications in terms of the
viable, scalable and cost-effective fabrication strategy applied and the high

single input linear time invariant (LTI) system to the origin is considered.
The input is assumed to be bounded. Since, the optimal control is bang-off-bang
in nature, it is characterized by sequences of +1 , 0 and -1 and the
corresponding switching time instants. All (candidate) sequences satisfying the
Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) necessary conditions are characterized.
The number of candidate sequences is obtained as a function of the order of
system and a method to list all candidate sequences is derived. Corresponding
to each candidate sequence, switching time instants are computed by solving a
static optimization problem. Since the candidate control input is a piece-wise
constant function, the time-fuel cost functional is converted to a linear
function in switching time instants. By using a simple substitution of
variables, reachability constraints are converted to polynomial equations and
inequalities. Such a static optimization problem can be solved separately for
each candidate sequence. Finally, the optimal control input is obtained from
candidate sequences which gives the least cost. For each sequence, optimization
problem can be solved by converting it to a generalized moment problem (GMP)
and then solving a hierachical sequence of semidefinite relaxations to
approximate the minima and minimizer [1]. Lastly, a numerical example is
presented for demonstration of method.

time $T$ corresponds to the large deviation theory for the information per unit
time of the trajectories probabilities. The microcanonical analysis consists in
evaluating the exponential growth in $T$ of the number of trajectories with a
given information per unit time, while the canonical analysis amounts to
analyze the appropriate non-conserved $\beta$-deformed dynamics in order to
obtain the scaled cumulant generating function of the information, the first
cumulant being the famous Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. This framework is described
in detail for discrete-time Markov chains and for continuous-time Markov jump
processes converging towards some steady-state, where one can also construct
the Doob generator of the associated $\beta$-conditioned process. The
application to the Directed Random Trap model on a ring of $L$ sites allows to
illustrate this general framework via explicit results for all the introduced
notions. In particular, the glassy phase is characterized by anomalous scaling
laws with the size $L$ and by non-self-averaging properties of the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and of the higher cumulants of the trajectory
information.

modeling over millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies in an unmanned aerial

is developed to collect mmWave channel information allowing each UAV to train a
local channel model via a generative adversarial network (GAN). Next, in order
to share the channel information between UAVs in a privacy-preserving manner, a
cooperative framework, based on a distributed GAN architecture, is developed to
enable each UAV to learn the mmWave channel distribution from the entire
dataset in a fully distributed approach. The necessary and sufficient
conditions for the optimal network structure that maximizes the learning rate
for information sharing in the distributed network are derived. Simulation
results show that the learning rate of the proposed GAN approach will increase
by sharing more generated channel samples at each learning iteration, but
decrease given more UAVs in the network. The results also show that the
proposed GAN method yields a higher learning accuracy, compared with a
standalone GAN, and improves the average rate for UAV downlink communications

\mathcal{Q}$) is also evaluated. We show that the correction does not exceed
14\% and %is gets the highest with $\beta=-\sqrt{3}$. The contribution of
dipole moment to the energy loss rate is small compared to the contribution of
new natural gauge boson $Z'$ and this sets constraints for the mass of Z'
$m_{Z'} \leq 4000$ GeV. This mass range is within the searching range for $Z'$
boson at LHC.

statistics, signal/image processing and machine learning. This has led to the
birth of many iterative algorithms to solve them. A powerful strategy to boost
the performance of these algorithms is known as safe screening: it allows the
early identification of zero coordinates in the solution, which can then be
eliminated to reduce the problem's size and accelerate convergence. In this
work, we extend the existing Gap Safe screening framework by relaxing the
global strong-concavity assumption on the dual cost function. Instead, we
exploit local regularity properties, that is, strong concavity on well-chosen
subsets of the domain. The non-negativity constraint is also integrated to the
existing framework. Besides making safe screening possible to a broader class
of functions that includes beta-divergences (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler
divergence), the proposed approach also improves upon the existing Gap Safe
screening rules on previously applicable cases (e.g., logistic regression). The
proposed general framework is exemplified by some notable particular cases:
logistic function, beta = 1.5 and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed screening rules with different
solvers (coordinate descent, multiplicative-update and proximal gradient
algorithms) and different data sets (binary classification, hyperspectral and
count data).

  communications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1704.08572 by other
  authors",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems typically employ hybrid mixed signal processing to avoid expensive
hardware and high training overheads. {However, the lack of fully digital
beamforming at mmWave bands imposes additional challenges in channel
estimation. Prior art on hybrid architectures has mainly focused on greedy
optimization algorithms to estimate frequency-flat narrowband mmWave channels,
despite the fact that in practice, the large bandwidth associated with mmWave
channels results in frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we consider a
frequency-selective wideband mmWave system and propose two deep learning (DL)
compressive sensing (CS) based algorithms for channel estimation.} The proposed
algorithms learn critical apriori information from training data to provide
highly accurate channel estimates with low training overhead. In the first
approach, a DL-CS based algorithm simultaneously estimates the channel supports
in the frequency domain, which are then used for channel reconstruction. The
second approach exploits the estimated supports to apply a low-complexity
multi-resolution fine-tuning method to further enhance the estimation
performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based schemes
significantly outperform conventional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
techniques in terms of the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), computational
complexity, and spectral efficiency, particularly in the low signal-to-noise
ratio regime. When compared to OMP approaches that achieve an NMSE gap of
\$\unit[\{4-10\}]{dB}\$ with respect to the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the
proposed algorithms reduce the CRLB gap to only \$\unit[\{1-1.5\}]{dB}\$, while
significantly reducing complexity by two orders of magnitude.

the processes with the increased use of robots. As a result, sensing and
localization of the surrounding environment becomes a crucial factor for these
robots to operate. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has emerged as an
appropriate method of sensing due to its capability of generating detail-rich
information with high accuracy. However, LiDARs are power hungry devices that
generate a lot of data, and these characteristics limit their use as on-board
sensors in robots. In this paper, we present a novel approach on the
methodology of generating an enhanced 3D map with improved field-of-view using
multiple LiDAR sensors. We utilize an inherent property of LiDAR point clouds;
rings and data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) embedded in the sensor
for registration of the point clouds. The generated 3D map has an accuracy of
10 cm when compared to the real-world measurements. We also carry out the
practical implementation of the proposed method using two LiDAR sensors.
Furthermore, we develop an application to utilize the generated map where a
robot navigates through the mapped environment with minimal support from the
sensors on-board. The LiDARs are fixed in the infrastructure at elevated
positions. Thus this is applicable to vehicular and factory scenarios. Our
results further validate the idea of using multiple elevated LiDARs as a part
of the infrastructure for various applications.

cope with this problem, we draw on the idea of contour matching based on

loss. Contour loss is designed to specifically optimize the contour parts of
the predicted masks, thus can assure more accurate instance segmentation. In
order to make the proposed contour loss to be jointly trained under modern

transformation image calculation module, which can approximately compute
truncated distance transformation images of the predicted mask and
corresponding ground-truth mask online. The proposed contour loss can be
integrated into existing instance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN, and
combined with their original loss functions without modification of the
inference network structures, thus has strong versatility. Experimental results
on COCO show that contour loss is effective, which can further improve instance

quantum"" relation with no analogue in the classical limit where $\hbar \to 0$.
However, this formulation of the classical limit is problematic for many
reasons, one of which is dimensional analysis. Since $\hbar$ is a dimensionful
constant, we may always work in natural units in which $\hbar = 1$. Dimensional
analysis teaches us that all physical laws can be expressed purely in terms of
dimensionless quantities. This indicates that the existence of a dimensionally
consistent constraint on $\Delta x \Delta p$ requires the existence of a
dimensionful parameter with units of action, and that any definition of the
classical limit must be formulated in terms of dimensionless quantities (such
as quantum numbers). Therefore, bounds on classical uncertainty (formulated in
terms of statistical ensembles) can only be written in terms of dimensionful
scales of the system under consideration, and can be readily compared to their
quantum counterparts after being non-dimensionalized. We compare the
uncertainty of certain coupled classical systems and their quantum counterparts
(such as harmonic oscillators and particles in a box), and show that they
converge in the classical limit. We find that since these systems feature
additional dimensionful scales, the uncertainty bounds are dependent on
multiple dimensionless parameters, in accordance with dimensional
considerations.

flare arcades that formed during five well-known eruptive flares. We show that
the arcades have a common saddle-like shape. The saddles occur despite the fact
that the flares were of different classes (C to X), occurred in different
magnetic environments, and were observed in various projections. The saddles
are related to the presence of longer, relatively-higher, and inclined flare
loops, consistently observed at the ends of the arcades, which we term
`cantles'. Our observations indicate that cantles typically join straight
portions of flare ribbons with hooked extensions of the conjugate ribbons. The
origin of the cantles is investigated in stereoscopic observations of the 2011
May 9 eruptive flare carried out by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and
Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI). The mutual separation of the instruments led
to ideal observational conditions allowing for simultaneous analysis of the
evolving cantle and the underlying ribbon hook. Based on our analysis we
suggest that the formation of one of the cantles can be explained by magnetic
reconnection between the erupting structure and its overlying arcades. We
propose that the morphology of flare arcades can provide information about the
reconnection geometries in which the individual flare loops originate.

leading to new ideas for securing voice transmission. This paper refers to a
relatively new concept of sending encrypted data or speech as pseudo-speech in
the audio domain over existing voice communication infrastructures, like 3G
cellular network and Voice over IP (VoIP). The distinctive characteristic of
such a communication system is that it relies on the robust transmission of
binary information in the form of audio signal. This work presents a novel Data
over Voice (DoV) technique based on codebooks of short harmonic waveforms. The
technique provides a sufficiently fast and reliable data rate over cellular
networks and many VoIP applications. The new method relies on general
principles of Linear Predictive Coding for voice compression (LPC voice coding)
and is more versatile compared to solutions trained on exact channel models.
The technique gives by design a high control over the desired rate of
transmission and provides robustness to channel distortion. In addition, an
efficient codebook design approach inspired by quaternary error correcting
codes is proposed. The usability of the proposed DoV technique for secure voice
communication over cellular networks and VoIP has been successfully validated

seismogenic faults remains largely unclear. Combining classical nucleation
theory and concepts borrowed from condensed matter physics, we propose a
comprehensive analytical framework that predicts the influence of
heterogeneities of weakening rate on the nucleation length $L_c$ for linearly
slip-dependent friction laws. Model predictions are compared to nucleation
lengths measured from 2D dynamic simulations of earthquake nucleation along
heterogeneous faults. Our results show that the interplay between frictional

(local, extremal, and homogenized), each related to different nucleation
scenarios, and that the influence of heterogeneities at a scale far lower than
the nucleation length can be averaged.

achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This ambitious and bold commitment was
well received by the global community. However, the technology and pathway are
not so clear. Here, we conducted an extensive review covering more than 200
published papers and summarized the key technologies to achieve carbon
neutrality. We projected sectoral CO2 emissions for 2020-2050 based on our
previous studies and published scenarios. We applied a medium sink scenario for
terrestrial sinks due to the potential resource competition and included an
ocean sink, which has generally not been included in previous estimates. We
analyzed and revisited China's historical terrestrial carbon sink capacity from
1980-2020 based on multiple models and a literature review. To achieve
neutrality, it is necessary to increase sink capacity and decrease emissions
from many sources. On the one hand, critical measures to reduce emissions
include decreasing the use of fossil fuels; substantially increasing the
proportion of the renewable energy and nuclear energy. On the other hand, the
capacity of future carbon sinks is projected to decrease due to the natural
evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, and anthropogenic management practices are
needed to increase sink capacity, including increasing the forest sinks through
national ecological restoration projects and large-scale land greening
campaigns; increasing wood harvesting and storage; and developing CCUS. This
paper provides basic source and sink data,and established and promising new
technologies for decreasing emissions and increasing sinks for use by the
scientific community and policy makers.

construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient
visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data
structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be
sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear
dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from
loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input
dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized
autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by
penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable,
thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent
dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix
factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We
compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders
and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the
algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and
parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional
representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate
reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the
original and reconstructed spaces.

We focus on randomized classifiers (\emph{i.e.} classifiers that output random
variables) and provide a thorough analysis of their behavior through the lens
of statistical learning theory and information theory. To this aim, we
introduce a new notion of robustness for randomized classifiers, enforcing
local Lipschitzness using probability metrics. Equipped with this definition,
we make two new contributions. The first one consists in devising a new upper
bound on the adversarial generalization gap of randomized classifiers. More
precisely, we devise bounds on the generalization gap and the adversarial gap
(\emph{i.e.} the gap between the risk and the worst-case risk under attack) of
randomized classifiers. The second contribution presents a yet simple but
efficient noise injection method to design robust randomized classifiers. We
show that our results are applicable to a wide range of machine learning models
under mild hypotheses. We further corroborate our findings with experimental
results using deep neural networks on standard image datasets, namely CIFAR-10

state-of-the-art accuracy (over $0.82$ clean accuracy on CIFAR-10) and enjoy
\emph{guaranteed} robust accuracy bounds ($0.45$ against $\ell_2$ adversaries

property that, for any $Aut(G;C)$-invariant normal set of generators for $G$,
if we remove from it all the elements of $\Phi(G;C)$, then the remaining set is
still an $Aut(G;C)$-invariant normal generating set for $G$. The subgroup
$\Phi(G;C)$ contains the Frattini subgroup $\Phi(G)$ but the inclusion may be
proper. The Cayley graph $Cay(G,C)$ is normal edge-transitive if $Aut(G;C)$
acts transitively on the pairs $\{c,c^{-1}\}$ from $C$. We show that, for a
normal edge-transitive Cayley graph $Cay(G,C)$, its quotient modulo $\Phi(G;C)$
is the unique largest normal quotient which is isomorphic to a subdirect

In particular, we may therefore view normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs of

Cayley graphs whenever the subgroup $\Phi(G;C)$ is trivial. We explore several
questions which these results raise, some concerned with the set of all

surface (IRS) aided wireless communication. As the number of IRS reflecting
elements or IRS-aided users increases, the channel training overhead becomes
excessively high, which results in long delay and low throughput in data
transmission. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new
anchor-assisted channel estimation approach, where two anchor nodes, namely A1
and A2, are deployed near the IRS for facilitating its aided base station (BS)
in acquiring the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels required for data transmission.
Specifically, in the first scheme, the partial channel state information (CSI)
on the element-wise channel gain square of the common BS-IRS link for all users
is first obtained at the BS via the anchor-assisted training and feedback.
Then, by leveraging such partial CSI, the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels are
efficiently resolved at the BS with additional training by the users. While in
the second scheme, the BS-IRS-A1 and A1-IRS-A2 channels are first estimated via
the training by A1. Then, with additional training by A2, all users estimate
their individual cascaded A2-IRS-user channels simultaneously. Based on the CSI
fed back from A2 and all users, the BS resolves the cascaded BS-IRS-user
channels efficiently. In both schemes, the quasi-static channels among the
fixed BS, IRS, and two anchors are estimated off-line only, which greatly
reduces the real-time training overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that
our proposed anchor-assisted channel estimation schemes achieve superior
performance as compared to existing IRS channel estimation schemes, under
various practical setups. In addition, the first proposed scheme outperforms
the second one when the number of antennas at the BS is sufficiently large, and
vice versa.

EEP violation model could be regarded as one of the cases of this Lagrangian.
Within the geometrical optical approximation, we find that the dispersion
relation of photons is modified: for photons moving in circular orbit, the
dispersion relation simplifies, and behaves such that photons with different
linear polarizations perceive different gravitational potentials. This makes
the size of black hole photon ring depend on polarization. Further assuming
that the EEP violation is small, we derive an approximate analytic expression
for spherical black holes showing that the change in size of the photon ring is
proportional to the violation parameters. We also discuss several cases of this
analytic expression for specific models. Finally, we explore the effects of
black hole rotation and derive a modified proportionality relation between the
change in size of photon ring and the violation parameters. The numerical and
analytic results show that the influence of black hole rotation on the
constraints of EEP violation is relatively weak for small magnitude of EEP
violation and small rotation speed of black holes.

method applicable to superfluid open-shell nuclei, the so-called Bogoliubov
in-medium similarity renormalization group (BIMSRG) theory, is formulated. This
generalization of standard single-reference IMSRG theory for closed-shell
systems parallels the recent extensions of coupled cluster, self-consistent
Green's function or many-body perturbation theory. Within the realm of IMSRG
theories, BIMSRG provides an interesting alternative to the already existing
multi-reference IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) method applicable to open-shell nuclei.
  The algebraic equations for low-order approximations, i.e., BIMSRG(1) and
BIMSRG(2), can be derived manually without much difficulty. However, such a
methodology becomes already impractical and error prone for the derivation of
the BIMSRG(3) equations, which are eventually needed to reach high accuracy.
Based on a diagrammatic formulation of BIMSRG theory, the second objective of
the present paper is thus to describe the third version (v3.0.0) of the ADG
code that automatically (1) generates all valid BIMSRG(n) diagrams and (2)
evaluates their algebraic expressions in a matter of seconds. This is achieved
in such a way that equations can easily be retrieved for both the flow equation
and the Magnus expansion formulations of BIMSRG.
  Expanding on this work, the first future objective is to numerically
implement BIMSRG(2) (eventually BIMSRG(3)) equations and perform ab initio
calculations of mid-mass open-shell nuclei.

The speeds were in the range of 0.03 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ to 0.3 $\rm km~s^{-1}$,
with a median value of 0.16 $\rm km~s^{-1}$, being consistent with the
gravitational free-fall speeds from pressure-free envelopes. The mass infall

important with the ever-growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in
our daily life. To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between
different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable.
Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer
from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing
distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic
signal-based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic
channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency
response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys.
InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its
performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system
in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works,
InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3-145 times, extends pairing
distance by 3.2-44 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by
2.5-16 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to
a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern

size of the giant cluster. This order parameter reveals the non trivial effect
of the network topology on the steady states of the dynamics, overlooked by
previous works, which concentrated on the onset of unanimity, and allows to
detect regions of polarization between the fragmented and the consensus phases.
While the previous results on unanimity are confirmed, the consensus threshold
shifts in the opposite direction compared to the threshold for unanimity. A
detailed finite size scaling analysis shows that, in general, consensus is
easier to obtain in networks than in mixed populations. At a difference with
previous studies, we show that the network topology is relevant beyond the
finitness of the average degree with increasing system size. In particular, in
pure random networks (either uniform random graphs or scale free networks), the
consensus threshold seems to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. A detailed
analysis of the time evolution of the dynamics reveals the role of bridges in
the network, which allow for the interaction between agents belonging to
clusters of very different opinions, after several repeated interaction steps.
These bridges are at the origin of the shift of the confidence threshold to
lower values in networks as compared to lattices or the mixed population.

observe and quantify, plays a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of galaxies.
Using the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we present a thorough
exploration of the physical properties of gas accreting onto haloes -- namely,
its spatial characteristics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Classifying
accretion as ``hot'' or `` cold'' based on a temperature cut of $10^{5.5}{\rm
K}$, we find that the covering fraction ($f_{\rm cov}$) of cold-mode accreting
gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with $z=0$ $f_{\rm cov}$ values
of $\approx 50\%$ and $\approx 80\%$ respectively. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
feedback in EAGLE reduces inflow $f_{\rm cov}$ values by $\approx 10\%$, with
outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows. Classifying
inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall onto a halo is
metal-depleted by $\approx 2$~dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find
to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content. We also
show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with
metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and that variation in
halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the
enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low
($\lesssim10^{9}M_{\odot}$) and high ($\gtrsim10^{10}M_{\odot}$) stellar
masses. Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and
galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in
order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in
CGM observations.

has reached satisfactory performance ready for clinical application. However,
deep learning-based nodule malignancy evaluation depends on heuristic inference
from low-dose computed tomography volume to malignant probability, which lacks
clinical cognition. Methods:In this paper, we propose a joint radiology
analysis and malignancy evaluation network (R2MNet) to evaluate the pulmonary
nodule malignancy via radiology characteristics analysis. Radiological features
are extracted as channel descriptor to highlight specific regions of the input
volume that are critical for nodule malignancy evaluation. In addition, for
model explanations, we propose channel-dependent activation mapping to
visualize the features and shed light on the decision process of deep neural
network. Results:Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that
the proposed method achieved area under curve of 96.27% on nodule radiology
analysis and AUC of 97.52% on nodule malignancy evaluation. In addition,
explanations of CDAM features proved that the shape and density of nodule
regions were two critical factors that influence a nodule to be inferred as
malignant, which conforms with the diagnosis cognition of experienced
radiologists. Conclusion:Incorporating radiology analysis with nodule malignant
evaluation, the network inference process conforms to the diagnostic procedure
of radiologists and increases the confidence of evaluation results. Besides,
model interpretation with CDAM features shed light on the regions which DNNs

segmentation, especially for video sequences captured with such non-static
cameras, called MOSNET. While other approaches focus on spatial or temporal
context only, the proposed approach uses 3D convolutions as a key technology to
factor in, spatio-temporal features in cohesive video frames. This is done by
capturing temporal information in features with a low and also with a high
level of abstraction. The lean network architecture with about 21k trainable
parameters is mainly based on a pre-trained VGG-16 network. The MOSNET uses a
new feature map fusion technique, which enables the network to focus on the
appropriate level of abstraction, resolution, and the appropriate size of the
receptive field regarding the input. Furthermore, the end-to-end deep learning
based approach can be extended by feature based image alignment as a
pre-processing step, which brings a gain in performance for some scenes.
Evaluating the end-to-end deep learning based MOSNET network in a scene
independent manner leads to an overall F-measure of 0.803 on the CDNet2014
dataset. A small temporal window of five input frames, without the need of any
initialization is used to obtain this result. Therefore the network is able to
perform well on scenes captured with non-static cameras where the image content

aim to prevent software from exposing the microarchitectural state changes of
transient execution. The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which
simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become
non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy.
However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to
regain some of the delay. However, the problem cannot be solved by simply
introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads
have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes
non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious
core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result
is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss. In this paper, our
insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by
providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative
side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely,
non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the
outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value
via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for
data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to
reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper,
we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the
Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show
that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured
baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what
even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.

these existing approaches simulate the test conditions too strictly during the

Besides, these approaches mainly focus on the foreground-background target
class segmentation setting. They only utilize binary mask labels for training.
In this paper, we propose to leverage the multi-class label information during
the episodic training. It will encourage the network to generate more
semantically meaningful features for each category. After integrating the
target class cues into the query features, we then propose a pyramid feature
fusion module to mine the fused features for the final classifier. Furthermore,
to take more advantage of the support image-mask pair, we propose a
self-prototype guidance branch to support image segmentation. It can constrain
the network for generating more compact features and a robust prototype for
each semantic class. For inference, we propose a fused prototype guidance
branch for the segmentation of the query image. Specifically, we leverage the
prediction of the query image to extract the pseudo-prototype and combine it
with the initial prototype. Then we utilize the fused prototype to guide the
final segmentation of the query image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed approach.

knowledge of the structure and separation of these two clusters ($\sim 24$ pc)
provides a unique view for studying the dynamics of a galactic central zone
hosting massive clusters. Varying some of the unknown clusters orbital
parameters, we carry out several $N$-body simulations showing that the future

interaction, a proper consideration of the dynamical friction braking would
shorten the merging times up to few Myr. We also investigate the possibility to
form a massive NSC in the center of the galaxy by this process. Our analysis

universal relation is presented between $n_{\rm t}$ and $L$, by employing the
full expression and dynamical approach. The crustal moment of inertia is very
sensitive to the location of the transition while the effects are moderated
concerning the critical angular velocity of the $r$-mode instability and
minimum mass configuration. The effect on the tidal deformability is less but
not negligible. In any case, the use of the parabolic approximation leads to
the overestimation of $n_{\rm t}$ and $P_{\rm t}$ and consequently, on
inaccurate predictions. Moreover, in some cases, even the matching process at
the interface may affect considerably the predictions, introducing errors of
the same order with the one due to the employed method.

assessing the robustness and reliability of the explanations is key for their

proposes various strategies to address this problem, the challenges of working
with data in the wild is often overlooked. For instance, in image
classification, distortions to images can not only affect the predictions
assigned by the model, but also the explanation. Given a clean and a distorted
version of an image, even if the prediction probabilities are similar, the
explanation may still be different. In this paper we propose a methodology to
evaluate the effect of distortions in explanations by embedding perceptual
distances that tailor the neighbourhoods used to training surrogate explainers.
We also show that by operating in this way, we can make the explanations more
robust to distortions. We generate explanations for images in the Imagenet-C

performed to evaluate the spatial distribution by the assessment of the full

magnetic fields from 4 to 10 mT. Experimental results demonstrate that
reconstructed images have a spatial resolution of 1.6 and 1.5 mm for a gradient
field of 2.2 T/m and 4.4 T/m in x- and z-direction, respectively, at an

of 0.5 mm are resolved. With increasing the excitation magnetic field to 10 mT,
the spatial resolution gets worse to 2.4 and 2.0 mm in x- and z-direction,

detection of 53 microgram (Fe)/mL (500 ng Fe weight) using perimag SPIONs. In

the likelihood has a tractable expression, which enables either direct
optimization of the log-likelihood using a quasi-Newton method, or generalized

silicon nanofilms and nanostructures has been crucial to recent advances in
electronics and photonics. A precise definition of the crystal growth location,
however, requires elaborate pre-epitaxy processes for substrate patterning. Our
molecular dynamics simulations reveal that homoepitaxial silicon nanofilms can
be directly deposited by a crystalline silicon tip rubbing against the
substrate, thus enabling geometrically controlled crystal growth with no need
for substrate pre-patterning. We name this solid-phase epitaxial growth
triboepitaxy as it solely relies on shear-induced amorphization and
recrystallization that occur even at low temperature at the sliding interface
between two silicon crystals. The interplay between the two concomitant,
shear-induced processes is responsible for the formation of an amorphous
sliding interface with constant nanometric thickness. If the two elastically
anisotropic crystals slide along different crystallographic orientations, the
amorphous layer can move unidirectionally perpendicular to the sliding plane,
causing the crystal with lowest elastic energy per atom to grow at the expenses
of the other crystal. As triboepitaxial growth is governed by the shear elastic
response of the two crystals along the sliding direction, it can be implemented
as a mechanical scanning-probe lithography method in which epitaxial growth is
controlled by tuning the crystallographic misorientation between tip and
substrate, the tip's size or the normal force. These results suggest a
radically new way to conceive nanofabrication techniques that are based on
tribologically induced materials transformations.

gerbes. Double Field Theory is T-duality covariant formulation of the
supergravity limit of String Theory, which generalises Kaluza-Klein theory by
unifying metric and Kalb-Ramond field on a doubled-dimensional space. In light
of the proposed correspondence, this doubled geometry is interpreted as an
atlas description of the higher geometry of bundle gerbes. In this sense,
Double Field Theory can be interpreted as a field theory living on the total
space of the bundle gerbe, just like Kaluza-Klein theory is set on the total
space of a principal bundle. This correspondence provides a higher geometric
interpretation for para-Hermitian geometry which opens the door to its
generalisation to the other Extended Field Theories. This review is based on,

during the epidemic can effectively delay the arrival of infection peak and
reduce the prevalence, and finally lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission

localization methods for locating a radiating source from range difference
measurements, or equivalently, time-difference-of-arrival measurements from the
perspective of least squares (LS). In particular, we focus on the spherical LS
error model, where the error function is defined as the difference between the
squared true distance from a signal receiver (sensor) to the source and its
squared measured value, and the resulting spherical LS estimation problem. This
problem has been known to be challenging due to the non-convex nature of the
hyperbolic measurement model. First of all, we prove that the existence of
least-square solutions is universal and that solutions are bounded under some
assumption on the geometry of the sensor placement. Then a necessary and
sufficient condition is presented for the solution characterization based on
the method of Lagrange multipliers. Next, we derive a characterization for the
uniqueness of the solutions incorporating a second-order optimality condition.
The solution structures for some special cases are also established,
contributing to insights on the effects of the Lagrangian multipliers on global
solutions. These findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the
localizability with range-difference measurements, which are also illustrated

extend the analysis of this phenomenon to cover the whole of the Horndeski
family. We find that the phenomenon is absent in the K-essence and/or Kinetic
Gravity Braiding theories, where the anisotropies grow as one approaches the
singularity. The anisotropies are damped at early times only in more general
Horndeski models whose Lagrangian includes terms quadratic and cubic in second
derivatives of the scalar field. Such theories are often considered as being
inconsistent with the observations because they predict a non-constant speed of
gravitational waves. However, the predicted value of the speed at present can
be close to the speed of light with any required precision, hence the theories
actually agree with the present time observations. We consider two different
examples of such theories, both characterized by a late self-acceleration and
an early inflation driven by the non-minimal coupling. Their anisotropies show
a maximum at intermediate times and approach zero at early and late times. The
early inflationary stage exhibits an instability with respect to inhomogeneous
perturbations, suggesting that the initial state of the universe should be
inhomogeneous. However, more general Horndeski models may probably be stable.

that momentum emerges as a good quantum number, and can be exploited for
labeling excitations on top of MPS ground states. We apply our method to the

personalized interests with the heterogeneous user information, which has been
shown effective in contributing to personalized recommendation. In this paper,
we propose a method to enhance pre-trained models with heterogeneous user

Specifically, UPRec leverages the user attributes andstructured social graphs
to construct self-supervised objectives in the pre-training stage and proposes
two user-aware pre-training tasks. Comprehensive experimental results on
several real-world large-scale recommendation datasets demonstrate that UPRec

single vector field. We verify that dendritic solidification in binary alloys
follows the well-established quantitative behavior in the thin interface limit.
In addition, it is shown that grain boundary energy and solute back-diffusion
are quantitatively consistent with earlier theoretical work, with grain
boundary energy being controlled through a simple solid-solid interaction

coarsening, we show that the kinetics follow the expected parabolic growth law.

bibliometrics including disciplinary differences among journals, what source
materials are used, time windows for the inclusion of works to measure, and
skewness of citation distributions (Lariviere & Sugimoto, 2019). However,
despite various attempts to remediate these in newly proposed indicators such
as SJR, SNIP, and Eigenfactor (Walters, 2017) indicators still remain based on
citation counts and fail to acknowledge the critical differences that the type
of citation made, whether it's supporting or disputing a work when quantifying
journal impact. While various programs have been suggested to apply and
encompass citation content analysis within bibliometrics projects, citation
content analysis has not been done at the scale needed in order to supplement
quantitate journal citation analysis until the scite citation index was
produced. Using this citation index containing citation types based on citation

the statistical characterization of citations to journals based on citation
function. We also present initial results of characterizing the ratio of
supports and disputes received by a journal as a potential indicator of quality

correlate with total citations and that the distribution of this ratio is not
skewed showing a normal distribution. We conclude with a proposal for future
research using citation analysis qualified by citation function as well as the
implications of performing bibliometrics tasks such as research evaluation and

curve (ROC) evaluates the separation between patients and nonpatients or
discrimination. For risk prediction models these risk distributions can be
derived from the population risk distribution so are not independent as in
diagnosis. A ROC curve AUC formula based on the underlying population risk
distribution clarifies how discrimination is defined mathematically and that
generation of the equivalent c-statistic effects a Monte Carlo integration of
the formula. For a selection of continuous risk distributions, exact analytic
formulas or numerical results for the ROC curve AUC and overlap measure are
presented and demonstrate a linear or near-linear dependence on their standard
deviation. The ROC curve AUC is also shown to be highly dependent on the mean
population risk, a distinction from the independence from disease prevalence
for diagnostic tests. The converse of discrimination, overlap, has been
quantified by the overlap measure, which appears to provide equivalent
information. As achieving wider population risk distributions is the goal of
risk prediction modeling for clinical risk stratification, interpreting the ROC
curve AUC as a measure of dispersion, rather than discrimination, when
comparing risk prediction models may be more relevant.

flame burning natural gas/air, is investigated using ANSYS FLUENT by
considering two different approaches for soot inception. In the first approach
soot inception is based on the formation rate of acetylene, while the second
approach considers the formation rate of two and three-ringed aromatics to
describe the soot inception [1]. Transport equations are solved for soot mass
fraction and radical nuclei concentration to describe inception, coagulation,
surface growth, and oxidation processes. The turbulent-chemistry interactions
and soot precursors are described by the steady laminar flamelet model (SLFM).
Two chemical mechanisms GRI 3.0 [2] and POLIMI [3] are used to represent the
effect of species concentration on soot formation. The radiative properties of
the medium are included based on the non-gray modeling approach by considering
four factious gases; the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGGM) approach is used to
model the absorption coefficient. The effect of soot on radiative transfer is
modeled in terms of effective absorption coefficient of the medium. A beta
probability density function (\b{eta}-PDF) in terms of normalized temperature
is used to describe the effect of turbulence on soot formation. The results
clearly elucidate the strong effect of radiation and species concentration on
soot volume fraction predictions. Due to increase in radiative heat loss with
soot, flame temperature decreases slightly. The inclusion of ethylene has less
synergic effect than that of both benzene and ethylene. Both cases have less
impact on the nucleation of soot. The increase in soot volume fraction with
soot-turbulence interaction is in consistence with the DNS predictions.

(PDF) modeling approach. Two burners which imitate MILD combustion are
considered for the current study: one is Adelaide Jet-in-Hot-Coflow (JHC)
burner and the other one is Delft-Jet-In-Hot-Coflow (DJHC) burner. 2D RANS
simulations have been carried out using Multi-environment Eulerian Probability
Density Function (MEPDF) approach along with the
Interaction-by-Exchange-with-Mean (IEM) micro-mixing model. A quantitative
comparison is made to assess the accuracy and predictive capability of the
MEPDF model in the MILD combustion regime. The computations are performed for
two different jet speeds corresponding to Reynolds numbers of Re=4100 and
Re=8800 for DJHC burner, while Re=10000 is considered for the Adelaide burner.
In the case of DJHC burner, for Re=4100, it has been observed that the mean
axial velocity profiles and the turbulent kinetic energy profiles are in good
agreement with the experimental database while the temperature profiles are
slightly over-predicted in the downstream region. For the higher Reynolds
number case (Re=8800), the accuracy of the predictions is found to be reduced.
Whereas in the case of Adelaide burner, the computed profiles of temperature
and the mass fraction of major species (CH4, H2, N2, O2) are found to be in
excellent agreement with the measurements while the discrepancies are observed
in the mass fraction profiles of CO2 and H2O. In addition, the effects of
differential diffusion are observed due to the presence of H2 in the fuel
mixture.

posterior and the true posterior. In this paper, we show how to remove this gap
asymptotically by deriving bits-back coding algorithms from tighter variational

require more initial bits than the standard bits-back coder, but we show how to
drastically reduce this additional cost with couplings in the latent space.
When parallel architectures can be exploited, our coders can achieve better

lossless compression rates in a variety of settings, especially in
out-of-distribution or sequential data compression.

ideal LDPC code decoder is to have correct bit decisions, a dynamic decoding
schedule should be variable node (VN)-centric and be able to find the VNs with
probable incorrect decisions and having a good chance to be corrected if chosen
for update. We propose a novel and effective metric called conditional
innovation (CI) which serves this design goal well. To make the most of dynamic
scheduling which produces high-reliability bit decisions, we limit our search
for the candidate VNs to those related to the latest updated nodes only.
  Based on the CI metric and the new search guideline separately or in
combination, we develop several highly efficient decoding schedules. To reduce
decoding latency, we introduce multi-edge updating versions which offer extra
latency-performance tradeoffs. Numerical results show that both single-edge and
multi-edge algorithms provide better decoding performance against most dynamic
schedules and the CI-based algorithms are particularly impressive at the first
few decoding iterations.

these materials are uncommon because these excitations in electronic systems
are usually broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and normally far from the Fermi
level. Unlike the case in electronic systems, the phonon systems with
negligible SOC effect, not constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle,
provide a feasible platform to realize these excitations in a wide frequency

symmetry analysis that perfect 3-, 4-, 6-fold excitations appear in the phonon
dispersion rather than the band structures of Zr3Ni3Sb4, which is a well-known
indirect-gap semiconductor with an Y3Au3Sb4-type structure. This material
features 3-fold quadratic contact triple-point phonon, 4-fold Dirac point

images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However,
considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with
deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by
the hyper-planes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing
approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and
overlook the uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when
dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel

capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile,
MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract
discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally,
MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate
uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the
data.

high stopping power for X-rays and massive particles in an energy range up to
several tens of keV. This motivates their use in a wide range of applications
in fields as particle physics, atomic and molecular physics. Present detector
systems consist of MMC arrays read out by 32 two-stage SQUID read-out channels.
In contrast to the design of the detector array and consequently the design of
the front-end SQUIDs, which need to be optimised for the physics case and the
particles to be detected in a given experiment, the read-out chain can be
standardised. We present our new standardised 32-channel parallel read-out for
the operation of MMC arrays to be operated in a dilution refrigerator. The
read-out system consists of a detector module, whose design depends on the
particular application, an amplifier module, ribbon cables from room
temperature to the millikelvin platform and a data acquisition system. In
particular, we describe the realisation of the read-out system prepared for the
ECHo-1k experiment for the operation of two 64-pixel arrays. The same read-out
concept is also used for the maXs detector systems, developed for the study of
the de-excitation of highly charged heavy ions by X-rays, as well as for the
MOCCA system, developed for the energy and position sensitive detection of
neutral molecular fragments for the study of fragmentation when molecular ions
recombine with electrons. The choice of standard modular components for the
operation of 32-channel MMC arrays offer the flexibility to upgrade detector
modules without the need of any changes in the read-out system and the
possibility to individually exchange parts in case of damages or failures.

simulations. We present magnetohydrodynamical simulations of solar mass stars
with rotation periods of 8.3, 1.2, and 0.8 days and perform a detailed analysis
of the magnetic and quadrupole moment using spherical harmonic decomposition.
The extrema of $Q_{xx}$ are associated with changes in the magnetic field
structure. This is evident in the simulation with a rotation period of 1.2
days. Its magnetic field has a more complex behavior than in the other models,
as the large-scale nonaxisymmetric field dominates throughout the simulation
and the axisymmetric component is predominantly hemispheric. This triggers
variations in the density field that follow the magnetic field asymmetry with
respect to the equator, affecting the $zz$ component of the inertia tensor, and
thus modulating $Q_{xx}$. The magnetic field of the two other runs are less
variable in time and more symmetric with respect to the equator, such that the
variations in the density are weaker, and therefore only small variations in
$Q_{xx}$ are seen. If interpreted via the classical Applegate mechanism (tidal
locking), the quadrupole moment variations obtained in the current simulations
are about two orders of magnitude below those deduced from observations of
post-common-envelope binaries. However, if no tidal locking is assumed, our
results are compatible with the observed ETVs.

regularization method to automatically detect spatial clusters of the
underlying contamination risk from the currently available private well arsenic
testing data in the USA, Iowa. This approach allows us to develop a sampling
design method that is adaptive to the changes in the contamination risk across
the identified clusters.
  We provide the spatially adaptive sample size calculation and sampling
location determination at different acceptance precision and confidence levels
for each cluster. The spatially adaptive sampling approach may effectively
mitigate the arsenic risk from the resource management perspectives. The model
presents a framework that can be widely used for other environmental
contaminant monitoring and sampling for public and environmental health.

problem in which the cost incurred in moving a server is the distance traveled
times the weight of the server. Even after almost three decades since the
seminal work of Fiat and Ricklin (1994), the competitive ratio of this problem
remains poorly understood, even on the simplest class of metric spaces -- the
uniform metric spaces. In particular, in the case of randomized algorithms
against the oblivious adversary, neither a better upper bound that the doubly
exponential deterministic upper bound, nor a better lower bound than the
logarithmic lower bound of unweighted $k$-server, is known. In this article, we
make significant progress towards understanding the randomized competitive
ratio of weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics. We cut down the triply
exponential gap between the upper and lower bound to a singly exponential gap
by proving that the competitive ratio is at least exponential in $k$,
substantially improving on the previously known lower bound of about $\ln k$.

technique capable of controlling complex nonlinear systems while respecting
system constraints and ensuring safe operation. The MPC's capabilities come at
the cost of a high online computational complexity, the requirement of an
accurate model of the system dynamics, and the necessity of tuning its
parameters to the specific control application. The main tunable parameter
affecting the computational complexity is the prediction horizon length,
controlling how far into the future the MPC predicts the system response and
thus evaluates the optimality of its computed trajectory. A longer horizon
generally increases the control performance, but requires an increasingly
powerful computing platform, excluding certain control applications.The
performance sensitivity to the prediction horizon length varies over the state
space, and this motivated the adaptive horizon model predictive control
(AHMPC), which adapts the prediction horizon according to some criteria. In
this paper we propose to learn the optimal prediction horizon as a function of
the state using reinforcement learning (RL). We show how the RL learning
problem can be formulated and test our method on two control tasks, showing
clear improvements over the fixed horizon MPC scheme, while requiring only
minutes of learning.

events in epidemiological studies, especially observational ones. Concretely,
the inclusion of individuals that were already at risk before the effective
initiation in a cohort study, may cause the unawareness of prior episodes that
have already been experienced, and this will easily lead to biased and
inefficient estimates. The objective of this paper is to propose a statistical
method that performs successfully in these circumstances. Our proposal is based
on the use of models with specific baseline hazard, imputing the number of
prior episodes when unknown, with a stratified model depending on whether the
individual had or had not previously been at risk, and the use of a frailty
term. The performance is examined in different scenarios through a
comprehensive simulation study.The proposed method achieves notable performance
even when the percentage of subjects at risk before the beginning of the
follow-up is very elevated, with biases that are often under 10\% and coverages
of around 95\%, sometimes somewhat conservative. If the baseline hazard is
constant, it seems to be that the ``Gap Time'' approach is better; if it is not
constant, the ``Counting Process'' seems to be a better choice. Because of the
lack of knowledge of the prior episodes that have been experienced by a part
(or all) of subjects, the use of common baseline methods is not advised. Our
proposal seems to perform acceptably in the majority of the scenarios proposed,
becoming an interesting alternative in this context.

depends on the convolution function. The asymptotic form of this BH solution
depends on the gravitational mass of the system and on extra terms that lead to

noise, so that the orbit will definitely escape from Q in an unpredictable
number of iterations. Thus, the goal of the algorithm is to control in a
predictable manner when to escape. While partial control has been used as a way
to avoid escapes, here we want to adapt it to force the escape in a controlled
manner. We have introduced new tools such as escape functions and escape sets
that once computed makes the control of the orbit straightforward. We have
applied the new idea to three different cases in order to illustrate the
various application possibilities of this new algorithm.

concluded that the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility increase with
external magnetic field strength and different values of the non-uniformity
parameter, $\alpha$, in the low temperature region, while the mentioned
quantities are decreased in high temperature regions due to increasing the
occupied levels at these regions. The non-uniformity parameter has the same

from positive to negative magnetic susceptibility depends on the values of

pandemic, fighting Life-threatening diseases have found greater focus than
ever. The first step in fighting a disease is to diagnose it at the right time.
Diabetes has been affecting people for a long time and is growing among people
faster than ever. The number of people who have Diabetes reached 422 million in
2018, as reported by WHO, and the global prevalence of diabetes among adults
above the age of 18 has risen to 8.5%. Now Diabetes is a disease that shows no
or very few symptoms among the people affected by it for a long time, and even
in some cases, people realize they have it when they have lost any chance of
controlling it. So getting Diabetes diagnosed at an early stage can make a huge
difference in how one can approach curing it. Moving in this direction in this
paper, we have designed a liquid machine learning approach to detect Diabetes
with no cost using deep learning. In this work, we have used a dataset of 520
instances. Our approach shows a significant improvement in the previous
state-of-the-art results. Its power to generalize well on small dataset deals
with the critical problem of lesser data in medical sciences.

age. Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular,
it was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in
children protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an
inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try
to reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not
monotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that
depends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with
most existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked
for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the
protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The
negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not
paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation
that predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus
propagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to
protect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low
ACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the
inflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the
angiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation
triggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its
many post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome
of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower
ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the
alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the
anti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.

grid wherein each cube has eight distinct unit cell types or phases. When all
phases are present, the domain resembles a densely connected ground structure.
The cross-section area of beam segments in lattice units, modelled using
Timoshenko beam theory, are the design variables. All beam segments in a
particular lattice phase have the same area of cross-section to keep the number
of design variables low. The optimization problem is formulated for stiff
structures and is solved using the optimality criteria algorithm. We present a
case study to show the superiority of topology-optimized heterogeneous
structures over uniform lattices of a single phase. In order to interpret the
phase composition, we perform four basic load tests on single phases, namely,
tension or compression, shear, bending, and torsion. The phases are ranked
based on the stiffness corresponding to individual loading conditions. The
results show that in the optimized structure, the local internal load
configuration drives the selection of phases. We also note that micropolar
elasticity captures the bulk behaviour of heterogeneous lattice structures, and
helps not only to interpret the optimality of phases but also to improve the
computational efficiency of the proposed optimization technique.

requires searching for the nearest neighbors of all observations. This presents
a computational bottleneck in statistical manifold learning when observations

for approximation in statistical manifold learning. The novelty of our
approximation is the strongly consistent distance estimators based on
independent and identically distributed samples from probability distributions.
By exploiting the connection between Hellinger/total variation distance for
discrete distributions and the L2/L1 norm, we demonstrate that the proposed
distance estimators, combined with approximate nearest neighbor searching,
could largely improve the computational efficiency with little to no loss in
the accuracy of manifold embedding. The result is robust to different manifold
learning algorithms and different approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. The
proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds of electricity
usage. This application demonstrates how underlying structures in high
dimensional data, including anomalies, can be visualized and identified, in a
way that is scalable to large datasets.

motion are examined. A specific regime is found with comparable strong field
quantum parameters of the beams, when the electron trajectory exhibits
ultrashort spike-like features, which bears great significance to the
corresponding radiation properties. An analytical expression for the spectral
distribution of spontaneous radiation is derived in the framework of the
Baier-Katkov semiclassical approximation based on the classical trajectory. All
the analytical results are further validated by exact numerical calculations.
We consider a non-resonant regime of interaction, when the laser frequencies in

Special attention is devoted to settings when the description of radiation via
the local constant field approximation fails and to corresponding spectral
features. Periodic and non-periodic regimes are considered, when lab
frequencies of the laser waves are always commensurate. The sensitivity of
