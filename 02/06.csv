to the Sun, opens new avenues for the remote observations of the atmosphere and
surface of an exoplanet, Proxima b. To date, three-dimensional (3D) General
Circulation Models (GCMs) are the best available tools to investigate the
properties of the exo-atmospheres, waiting for the next generation of space and
groundbased telescopes. In this work, we use the PlanetSimulator (PlaSim), an
intermediate complexity 3D GCM, a flexible and fast model, suited to handle all
the orbital and physical parameters of a planet and to study the dynamics of
its atmosphere. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere and a 1:1 spin/orbit
configuration (tidal locking), our simulations of Proxima b are consistent with
a day-side open ocean planet with a superrotating atmosphere. Moreover, because
of the limited representation of the radiative transfer in PlaSim, we compute
the spectrum of the exoplanet with an offline Radiative Transfer Code with a
spectral resolution of 1 nm. This spectrum is used to derive the thermal phase
curves for different orbital inclination angles. In combination with
instrumental detection sensitivities, the different thermal phase curves are
used to evaluate observation conditions at ground level (e.g., ELT) or in space
(e.g., JWST). We estimated the exposure time to detect Proxima b (assuming an
Earth-like atmosphere) thermal phase curve in the FIR with JWST with
signal-to-noise ratio $\simeq$1. Under the hypothesis of total noise dominated
by shot noise, neglecting other possible extra contribution producing a noise
floor, the exposure time is equal to 5 hours for each orbital epoch.

from inverting its direction of motion. This allows for a non-zero average
velocity of chaotic trajectories without breaking the well-known symmetries
commonly responsible for directed transport. Within our chosen normalized
units, the resulting average transport velocity is constant and does not change
significantly with the driving amplitude. A very similar effect is found in
case of the circularly polarized field and low driving amplitudes. Furthermore,
when driving with a circularly polarized field, we unravel a second mechanism
of the split-up of the chaotic phase space region for very large driving

the data set includes disorder or contamination. The robustness property of
M-estimators for the parameters is examined. Fisher information matrices based
on the derivative of score functions from $\log$, $\log_q$ and distorted
log-likelihoods are proposed by use of Tsallis $q$-entropy in order to have
variances of M-estimators. It is shown that matrices derived by score functions
are positive semidefinite if conditions are satisfied. Information criteria
inspired by Akaike and Bayesian are arranged by taking the absolute value of
score functions. Fitting performances of score functions from estimating
equations and objective functions are tested by applying volume, information

assess the fitting competence of the proposed functions. Applications from

still fall short of delivering satisfactory results on single image dehazing,
especially in terms of faithful recovery of fine texture details. In this
paper, we argue that the inadequacy of conventional CNN-based dehazing methods
can be attributed to the fact that the domain of hazy images is too far away
from that of clear images, rendering it difficult to train a CNN for learning
direct domain shift through an end-to-end manner and recovering texture details

learning, the proposed mechanism shifts and narrows the candidate region for
the estimation output via multiple confident neighborhoods. Therefore, it is
capable of consolidating the expressibility of different architectures,
resulting in a more accurate indirect domain shift (IDS) from the hazy images
to that of clear images. We also propose two different training schemes,
including hard IDS and soft IDS, which further reveal the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Our extensive experimental results indicate that the dehazing

  Expertise","Submitted to ICML 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Causal discovery methods seek to identify causal relations between random
variables from purely observational data, as opposed to actively collected
experimental data where an experimenter intervenes on a subset of correlates.
One of the seminal works in this area is the Inferred Causation algorithm,
which guarantees successful causal discovery under the assumption of a
conditional independence (CI) oracle: an oracle that can states whether two
random variables are conditionally independent given another set of random
variables. Practical implementations of this algorithm incorporate statistical
tests for conditional independence, in place of a CI oracle. In this paper, we
analyze the sample complexity of causal discovery algorithms without a CI
oracle: given a certain level of confidence, how many data points are needed
for a causal discovery algorithm to identify a causal structure? Furthermore,
our methods allow us to quantify the value of domain expertise in terms of data
samples. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of these sample rates with
numerical examples, and quantify the benefits of sparsity priors and known
causal directions.

trained to maximize the likelihood of the desired outputs by using unbiased
estimates of the log-likelihood gradients. While prior work used single-sample
estimators obtained from a single run of the network, this paper proposes to
leverage multiple compartments that sample independent spiking signals while
sharing synaptic weights. The key idea is to use these signals to obtain more

expectation-maximization (GEM), which optimizes a tighter approximation of the
log-likelihood using importance sampling. The derived online learning algorithm
implements a three-factor rule with global per-compartment learning signals.
Experimental results on a classification task on the neuromorphic MNIST-DVS

clinical challenge, even with current gold standard diagnostic approaches.
However, it has been shown that certain dementias show specific structural
characteristics in the brain. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple
system atrophy (MSA) are prototypical examples of this phenomenon, as they
often present with characteristic brainstem atrophy. More detailed
characterization of brain atrophy due to individual diseases is urgently
required to select biomarkers and therapeutic targets that are meaningful to

deep-learning-based segmentation method for fast and robust parcellation of the
brainstem into its four sub-structures, i.e., the midbrain, pons, medulla, and
superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP), that in turn can provide detailed

The method may also benefit other neurodegenerative diseases, such as
Parkinson's disease; a condition which is often considered in the differential

evaluated on ground truth manual segmentations demonstrate that our method is
significantly faster than prior methods as well as showing improvement in

various configurations of graphene-graphene and graphene-diamond and

revealing the important role of graphene in achieving high-performance

to evaluate defect prediction techniques and to empirically investigate when,
how, and by whom bugs are introduced. Over the years, researchers have proposed
several heuristics to improve the SZZ accuracy, providing various
implementations of SZZ. However, fairly evaluating those implementations on a
reliable oracle is an open problem: SZZ evaluations usually rely on (i) the
manual analysis of the SZZ output to classify the identified bug-inducing
commits as true or false positives; or (ii) a golden set linking bug-fixing and
bug-inducing commits. In both cases, these manual evaluations are performed by
researchers with limited knowledge of the studied subject systems. Ideally,
there should be a golden set created by the original developers of the studied
systems.
  We propose a methodology to build a ""developer-informed"" oracle for the
evaluation of SZZ variants. We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
identify bug-fixing commits in which developers explicitly reference the
commit(s) that introduced a fixed bug. This was followed by a manual filtering
step aimed at ensuring the quality and accuracy of the oracle. Once built, we
used the oracle to evaluate several variants of the SZZ algorithm in terms of
their accuracy. Our evaluation helped us to distill a set of lessons learned to
further improve the SZZ algorithm.

focus on the transmission of the magnetic fluctuations across the shock and
analyze the characteristic wave modes of solar wind turbulence near the shock
observed by both spacecraft. The ICME event is characterized by a magnetic
helicity based technique. The shock normal is determined by magnetic
coplanarity method for Solar Orbiter and using a mixed coplanarity approach for
Wind. The power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations are generated by
applying both a fast Fourier transform and Morlet wavelet analysis. To
understand the nature of waves observed near the shock, we use the normalized
magnetic helicity as a diagnostic parameter. The wavelet reconstructed magnetic
field fluctuation hodograms are used to further study the polarization
properties of waves. We find that the ICME-driven shock observed by Solar
Orbiter and Wind is a fast forward oblique shock with a more perpendicular
shock angle at 1 AU. After the shock crossing, the magnetic field fluctuation
power increases. Most of the magnetic field fluctuation power resides in the
transverse fluctuations. In the vicinity of the shock, both spacecraft observe
right-hand polarized waves in the spacecraft frame. The upstream wave
signatures fall in a relatively broad and low-frequency band, which might be
attributed to low-frequency MHD waves excited by the streaming particles. For
the downstream magnetic wave activity, we find oblique kinetic Alfven waves
with frequencies near the proton cyclotron frequency in the spacecraft frame.
The frequency of the downstream waves increases by a factor of 7-10 due to the
shock compression and the Doppler effect.

self-supervised graph neural networks only use adjacency matrix as the input
topology information of graph and cannot obtain too high-order information

are too many layers, the phenomenon of over smoothing will appear. Therefore
how to obtain and fuse high-order information of graph by a shallow graph
neural network is an important problem. In this paper, a deep graph embedding
algorithm with self-supervised mechanism for community discovery is proposed.
The proposed algorithm uses self-supervised mechanism and different high-order

The outputs of multiple graph convolution neural networks are fused to extract
the representations of nodes which include the attribute and structure
information of a graph. In addition, data augmentation and negative sampling
are introduced into the training process to facilitate the improvement of

problematic, if not outright impossible, to publish or share it. As a result,
several initiatives have been launched to experiment with synthetic genomic
data, e.g., using generative models to learn the underlying distribution of the
real data and generate artificial datasets that preserve its salient
characteristics without exposing it. This paper provides the first evaluation
of both utility and privacy protection of six state-of-the-art models for
generating synthetic genomic data. We assess the performance of the synthetic
data on several common tasks, such as allele population statistics and linkage
disequilibrium. We then measure privacy through the lens of membership
inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether a record was part of the training
data. Our experiments show that no single approach to generate synthetic
genomic data yields both high utility and strong privacy across the board.
Also, the size and nature of the training dataset matter. Moreover, while some
combinations of datasets and models produce synthetic data with distributions
close to the real data, there often are target data points that are vulnerable
to membership inference. Looking forward, our techniques can be used by
practitioners to assess the risks of deploying synthetic genomic data in the
wild and serve as a benchmark for future work.

have calculated the properties of wind, such as its mass flux and velocity.
However, that paper focuses only on a non-spinning black hole and SANE
(standard and normal accretion). In the present paper, we extend the third
paper by including cases of a rapidly rotating black hole and MAD (magnetically
arrested disk). We focus on investigating the effect of spin and magnetic field
on the properties of wind and jet. It is found that a larger spin and stronger
magnetic field usually enhance the wind and jet. The formulae describing the
mass flux, poloidal velocity, and fluxes of momentum, kinetic energy, and total
energy of wind and jet are presented. One interesting finding, among others, is
that even in the case of very rapidly spinning black hole where the jet is
supposed to be the strongest, the momentum flux of jet is smaller than that of
wind, while the total energy flux of jet is larger than that of wind by at most
a factor of 10. This result suggests that wind potentially plays a more
important role than jet at least for some problems in active galactic nuclei

the electron temperature gradient terms, along with the ohmic term. The same
applies for the electron power absorption. At both 10 and 100 mTorr the

the same, while the ambipolar term contributes to power absorption and the

applies at 10 mTorr. At 100 mTorr the discharge is weekly electronegative, and
electron power absorption is mainly due to sheath expansion while at 10 mTorr
it is strongly electronegative, and the electron power absorption occurs mainly
within the electronegative core and drift-ambipolar mode dominates. The
agreement between the calculated values and the simulations is good for both

optical communications to biosensors, LIDAR, and data center fiber
interconnects. There is strong evidence that these integrated technologies will
play a key role in quantum systems as they grow from few-qubit prototypes to
tens of thousands of qubits. The underlying laser and optical quantum
technologies, with the required functionality and performance, can only be
realized through the integration of these components onto quantum photonic
integrated circuits (QPICs) with accompanying electronics. In the last decade,
remarkable advances in quantum photonic integration and a dramatic reduction in
optical losses have enabled benchtop experiments to be scaled down to prototype
chips with improvements in efficiency, robustness, and key performance metrics.
The reduction in size, weight, power, and improvement in stability that will be
enabled by QPICs will play a key role in increasing the degree of complexity
and scale in quantum demonstrations. In the next decade, with sustained
research, development, and investment in the quantum photonic ecosystem (i.e.
PIC-based platforms, devices and circuits, fabrication and integration
processes, packaging, and testing and benchmarking), we will witness the
transition from single- and few-function prototypes to the large-scale
integration of multi-functional and reconfigurable QPICs that will define how
information is processed, stored, transmitted, and utilized for quantum
computing, communications, metrology, and sensing. This roadmap highlights the
current progress in the field of integrated quantum photonics, future
challenges, and advances in science and technology needed to meet these
challenges.

a popular approach for Bayesian Optimisation (BO). A novel approximation is
proposed for the information gain -- an information-theoretic quantity central
to solving a range of BO problems, including noisy, multi-fidelity and batch
optimisations across both continuous and highly-structured discrete spaces.
Previously, these problems have been tackled separately within
information-theoretic BO, each requiring a different sophisticated
approximation scheme, except for batch BO, for which no
computationally-lightweight information-theoretic approach has previously been
proposed. GIBBON (General-purpose Information-Based Bayesian OptimisatioN)
provides a single principled framework suitable for all the above,
out-performing existing approaches whilst incurring substantially lower
computational overheads. In addition, GIBBON does not require the problem's
search space to be Euclidean and so is the first high-performance yet
computationally light-weight acquisition function that supports batch BO over
general highly structured input spaces like molecular search and gene design.
Moreover, our principled derivation of GIBBON yields a natural interpretation
of a popular batch BO heuristic based on determinantal point processes.
Finally, we analyse GIBBON across a suite of synthetic benchmark tasks, a
molecular search loop, and as part of a challenging batch multi-fidelity
framework for problems with controllable experimental noise.

networks. First, we introduce RoadSeg, a new convolutional architecture that is
optimized for road detection in LIDAR scans. RoadSeg is used to classify
individual LIDAR points as either belonging to the road, or not. Yet, such
point-level classification results need to be converted into a dense
representation, that can be used by an autonomous vehicle. We thus secondly
present an evidential road mapping algorithm, that fuses consecutive road
detection results. We benefitted from a reinterpretation of logistic
classifiers, which can be seen as generating a collection of simple evidential
mass functions. An evidential grid map that depicts the road can then be
obtained, by projecting the classification results from RoadSeg into grid
cells, and by handling moving objects via conflict analysis. The system was
trained and evaluated on real-life data. A python implementation maintains a 10
Hz framerate. Since road labels were needed for training, a soft labelling
procedure, relying lane-level HD maps, was used to generate coarse training and
validation sets. An additional test set was manually labelled for evaluation
purposes. So as to reach satisfactory results, the system fuses road detection
results obtained from three variants of RoadSeg, processing different LIDAR
features.

oscillations being excited through a self-sustaining process, caused by
Alfv\'{e}nic vortex shedding from strong background flows interacting with
coronal loops. We show for the first time in 3D simulations that vortex
shedding can generate transverse oscillations in coronal loops, in the
direction perpendicular to the flow due to periodic ""pushing"" by the vortices.
By plotting the power spectral density we identify the excited frequencies of
these oscillations. We see that these frequencies are dependent both on the
speed of the flow, as well as the characteristics of the oscillating loop.
This, in addition to the fact that the background flow is constant and not
periodic, makes us treat this as a self-oscillating process. Finally, the
amplitudes of the excited oscillations are near constant in amplitude, and are
comparable with the observations of decay-less oscillations. This makes the
mechanism under consideration a possible interpretation of these undamped waves

minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the

  Prognosis of Epilepsy: A Review",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in medical image
analysis, spawning new advances in the clinical application of neuroimaging.
There have been some reviews on machine learning and epilepsy before, and they
mainly focused on electrophysiological signals such as electroencephalography
(EEG) and stereo electroencephalography (SEEG), while neglecting the potential
of neuroimaging in epilepsy research. Neuroimaging has its important advantages
in confirming the range of the epileptic region, which is essential in
presurgical evaluation and assessment after surgery. However, it is difficult
for EEG to locate the accurate epilepsy lesion region in the brain. In this
review, we emphasize the interaction between neuroimaging and machine learning
in the context of epilepsy diagnosis and prognosis. We start with an overview
of epilepsy and typical neuroimaging modalities used in epilepsy clinics, MRI,
DWI, fMRI, and PET. Then, we elaborate two approaches in applying machine
learning methods to neuroimaging data: i) the conventional machine learning
approach combining manual feature engineering and classifiers, ii) the deep
learning approach, such as the convolutional neural networks and autoencoders.
Subsequently, the application of machine learning on epilepsy neuroimaging,
such as segmentation, localization, and lateralization tasks, as well as tasks
directly related to diagnosis and prognosis are looked into in detail. Finally,
we discuss the current achievements, challenges, and potential future
directions in this field, hoping to pave the way for computer-aided diagnosis
and prognosis of epilepsy.

new wavelength dimension to the optical information available at the American
Association of Variable Star Observers International Variable Star Index
(VSX-AAVSO) catalogue to test the VVV survey near-infrared photometry to better
characterise these objects. Methods. We cross-matched the VVV and the VSX-AAVSO
catalogues along with Gaia Data Release 2 photometry and parallax. Results. We
present a catalogue that includes accurate individual coordinates,
near-infrared magnitudes (ZY JHKs), extinctions Aks, and distances based on
Gaia parallaxes. We also show the near-infrared CMDs and spatial distributions
for the different VSX types of variable stars, including important distance
indicators, such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and Miras. By analysing the photometric
flags in our catalogue, we found that about 20% of the stars with measured and
verified variability are flagged as non-stellar sources, even when they are
outside of the saturation and/or noise regimes. Additionally, we pair-matched
our sample with the VIVA catalogue and found that more than half of our sources
are missing from the VVV variability list, mostly due to observations with low
signal-to-noise ratio or photometric problems with a low percentage due to
failures in the selection process. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the
current knowledge of the variability in the Galaxy is biased to nearby stars

instantaneous luminosity by at least a factor of five, resulting in a higher
muon flux rate in the forward region, which will overwhelm the current trigger
system of the CMS experiment. The ME0, a gas electron multiplier detector, is
proposed for the Phase-2 Muon System Upgrade to help increase the muon
acceptance and to control the Level 1 muon trigger rate. To lower the
probability of HV discharges, the ME0 was designed with GEM foils that are
segmented on both sides. Initial testing of the ME0 showed substantial
crosstalk between readout sectors. Here, we investigate, characterize, and
quantify the crosstalk in the detector, and estimate the performance of the
chamber as a result of this crosstalk via simulation of the detector dead time,
efficiency loss, and frontend electronics response. The results of crosstalk
via signals produced by applying a square voltage pulse directly on the readout
strips of the detector with a pulser are summarized, and the efficacy of
various mitigation strategies are presented. The crosstalk is a result of
capacitive coupling between the readout strips on the readout board and between
the readout strips and the bottom of GEM3. The crosstalk also generally follows
a pattern where the largest magnitude of crosstalk is within the same azimuthal
readout segment in the detector and in the nearest horizontal segments. The use
of bypass capacitors and larger HV segments successfully reduce the crosstalk:
we observe a maximum decrease of crosstalk in sectors previously experiencing
crosstalk from $(1.66\pm0.03)\%$ to $(1.11\pm0.02)\%$ with all HV segments
connected in parallel on the bottom of GEM3, with an HV low-pass filter, and an
HV divider. These mitigation strategies slightly increase crosstalk

practice, such randomness can cause {\em churn} -- for the same input,
disagreements between predictions of the two models independently trained by
the same algorithm, contributing to the `reproducibility challenges' in modern

factors that cause it, and propose two simple means of mitigating it. We first
demonstrate that churn is indeed an issue, even for standard image

  for Recovering Internet Traffics from Link Measurements",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  It is challenging to recover the large-scale internet traffic data purely
from the link measurements. With the rapid growth of the problem scale, it will
be extremely difficult to sustain the recovery accuracy and the computational
cost. In this work, we propose a new Sparsity Low-Rank Recovery (SLRR) model
and its Schur Complement Based semi-proximal Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (SCB-spADMM) solver. Our approach distinguishes itself mainly for
the following two aspects. First, we fully exploit the spatial low-rank
property and the sparsity of traffic data, which are barely considered in the
literature. Our model can be divided into a series of subproblems, which only
relate to the traffics in a certain individual time interval. Thus, the model
scale is significantly reduced. Second, we establish a globally convergent
ADMM-type algorithm inspired by [Li et al., Math. Program., 155(2016)] to solve
the SLRR model. In each iteration, all the intermediate variables' optimums can
be calculated analytically, which makes the algorithm fast and accurate.
Besides, due to the separability of the SLRR model, it is possible to design a
parallel algorithm to further reduce computational time. According to the
numerical results on the classic datasets Abilene and GEANT, our method
achieves the best accuracy with a low computational cost. Moreover, in our
newly released large-scale Huawei Origin-Destination (HOD) network traffics,
our method perfectly reaches the seconds-level feedback, which meets the
essential requirement for practical scenarios.

significance for the economic operation and stability analysis of integrated

model cooling, heating, and power load curves based on a generative moment
matching networks (GMMN) where an auto-encoder transforms high-dimensional load
curves into low-dimensional latent variables and the maximum mean discrepancy
represents the similarity metrics between the generated samples and the real
samples. After training the model, the new scenarios are generated by feeding
Gaussian noises to the scenario generator of the GMMN. Unlike the explicit
density models, the proposed GMMN does not need to artificially assume the
probability distribution of the load curves, which leads to stronger
universality. The simulation results show that the GMMN not only fits the
probability distribution of multi-class load curves well, but also accurately
captures the shape (e.g., large peaks, fast ramps, and fluctuation),
frequency-domain characteristics, and temporal-spatial correlations of cooling,
heating, and power loads. Furthermore, the energy consumption of generated
samples closely resembles that of real samples.

emission observations from SOFIA/HAWC+ and a potential field extrapolation
commonly used in solar physics. We modified the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method to account for the large-scale flow and the turbulent field. Results
show that the observed magnetic fields arise from the combination of a
large-scale ordered potential field associated with the outflow and a
small-scale turbulent field associated with bow-shock-like features. Within the
central $900$ pc radius, the large-scale field accounts for $53\pm4$% of the
observed turbulent magnetic energy with a median field strength of $305\pm15$
$\mu$G, while small-scale turbulent magnetic fields account for the remaining
$40\pm5$% with a median field strength of $222\pm19$ $\mu$G. We estimate that
the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energies are in close
equipartition up to $\sim2$ kpc (measured), while the turbulent kinetic energy
dominates at $\sim7$ kpc (extrapolated). We conclude that the fields are frozen
into the ionized outflowing medium and driven away kinetically. The magnetic
field lines in the galactic wind of M82 are `open,' providing a direct channel
between the starburst core and the intergalactic medium. Our novel approach

form of matter in the visible Universe but also because they can generate
B-fields ten orders of magnitude larger than those currently constructed on
Earth. The combination of extreme gravity with the enormous electromagnetic
(EM) fields gives rise to spectacular phenomena like those observed on August
2017 with the merger of a binary neutron star (NSNS) system, an event that
generated a gravitational wave (GW) signal, a short $\gamma$-ray burst (sGRB),
and a kilonova. This event serves as the highlight so far of the era of
multimessenger astronomy. In this review, we present the current state of our
theoretical understanding of compact binary mergers containing NSs as gleaned
from the latest general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Such
mergers can lead to events like the one on August 2017, GW170817, and its EM
counterparts, GRB 170817 and AT 2017gfo. In addition to exploring the GW
emission from binary black hole-neutron star and NSNS mergers, we also focus on
their counterpart EM signals. In particular, we are interested in identifying
the conditions under which a relativistic jet can be launched following these
mergers. Such a jet is an essential feature of most sGRB models and provides
the main conduit of energy from the central object to the outer radiation
regions. Jet properties, including their lifetimes and Poynting luminosities,
the effects of the initial B-field geometries and spins of the coalescing NSs,
as well as their governing equation of state, are discussed. Lastly, we present
our current understanding of how the Blandford-Znajek mechanism arises from
merger remnants as the trigger for launching jets, if, when and how a horizon
is necessary for this mechanism, and the possibility that it can turn on in
magnetized neutron ergostars, which contain ergoregions, but no horizons.

history of the r-process enrichment in the early stage of star formation in a
galaxy. Currently, various types of astrophysical sites including neutron star
mergers, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, are suggested as the
origin of r-process elements. The time delay between the star formation and the
production of r-process elements is the key to distinguish these scenarios with
the caveat that the diffusion of r-process elements in the interstellar medium
may induce the delay in r-process enrichment because r-process events are rare.
Here we study the observed Ba abundance data of very metal-poor stars as the
tracer of the early enrichment history of r-process elements. We find that the
gradual increase of [Ba/Mg] with [Fe/H], which is remarkably similar among the
Milky Way and classical dwarfs, requires a significant time delay (100 Myr -- 1
Gyr) of r-process events from star formation rather than the diffusion-induced
delay. We stress that this conclusion is robust to the assumption regarding
s-process contamination in the Ba abundances because the sources with no delay
would overproduce Ba at very low metallicities even without the contribution
from the s-process. Therefore we conclude that sources with a delay, possibly
neutron star mergers, are the origins of r-process elements.

Way (MW) originate primarily from mergers of lower-mass galaxies. A common
expectation is therefore that metal-poor stars should have isotropic,
dispersion-dominated orbits that do not correlate strongly with the MW disk.
However, recent observations of stars in the MW show that metal-poor ([Fe/H] <
-2) stars are preferentially on prograde orbits with respect to the disk. Using
the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW/M31-mass galaxies,
we investigate the prevalence and origin of prograde metal-poor stars. Almost
all (11 of 12) of our simulations have metal-poor stars on preferentially
prograde orbits today and throughout most of their history: we thus predict
that this is a generic feature of MW/M31-mass galaxies. The typical
prograde-to-retrograde ratio is ~2:1, which depends weakly on stellar
metallicity at Fe/H] < -1. These trends predicted by our simulations agree well
with MW observations. Prograde metal-poor stars originate largely from a single
LMC/SMC-mass gas-rich merger 7 - 12.5 Gyr ago, which deposited existing
metal-poor stars and significant gas on an orbital vector that sparked the
formation of and/or shaped the orientation of a long-lived stellar disk, giving
rise to a prograde bias for all low-metallicity stars. We find sub-dominant
contributions from in-situ stars formed in the host galaxy before this merger,
and in some cases, additional massive mergers. We find few clear correlations
between any properties of our MW/M31-mass galaxies at z = 0 and the degree of
this prograde bias as a result of diverse merger scenarios.

Majorana neutrinos. Our approach is based on the representation of the
amplitude as the momentum integral of a known kernel (proportional to the
neutrino propagator) times the generalized forward Compton scattering amplitude
$n(p_1) n(p_2) W^+ (k) \to p(p_1^\prime) p(p_2^\prime) W^- (k)$, in analogy to
the Cottingham formula for the electromagnetic contribution to hadron masses.
We construct model-independent representations of the integrand in the low- and
high-momentum regions, through chiral EFT and the operator product expansion,
respectively. We then construct a model for the full amplitude by interpolating
between these two regions, using appropriate nucleon factors for the weak
currents and information on nucleon-nucleon ($N\! N$) scattering in the $^1S_0$
channel away from threshold. By matching the amplitude obtained in this way to
the LO chiral EFT amplitude we obtain the relevant LO contact term and discuss
various sources of uncertainty. We validate the approach by computing the
analog $I = 2$ $N\! N$ contact term and by reproducing, within uncertainties,
the charge-independence-breaking contribution to the $^1S_0$ $N\! N$ scattering
lengths. While our analysis is performed in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, we
express our final result in terms of the scheme-independent renormalized
amplitude ${\cal A}_\nu(|{\bf p}|,|{\bf p}^\prime|)$ at a set of kinematic
points near threshold. We illustrate for two cutoff schemes how, using our
synthetic data for ${\cal A}_\nu$, one can determine the contact-term
contribution in any regularization scheme, in particular the ones employed in
nuclear-structure calculations for isotopes of experimental interest.

the conventional HRD, with the differences being largest for the most massive

should carefully review how it dealt with the first wave of outbreak. Lessons
from the first experience should be useful to avoid indiscriminate closures
and, above all, to determine universal (understandable) parameters to guide the
introduction of containment measures to reduce the spreading of the virus. The
use of few (effective) parameters is indeed of extreme importance to create a
link between authorities and population, allowing the latter to understand the
reason for some restrictions and, consequently, to allow an active
participation in the fight against the pandemic.
  Testing strategies, fitting skew parameters (as mean, mode, standard
deviation, and skewness), mortality rates, and weekly CoViD-19 spreading data,
as more people are getting infected, were used to compare the first wave of the
outbreak in the Italian regions and to determine which parameters have to be
checked before introducing restrictive containment measures. We propose few
\textit{universal} parameters that, once appropriately weighed, could be useful
to correctly differentiate the pandemic situation in the national territory and
to rapidly assign the properly pandemic risk to each region.

in quantum systems in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic
fraction of the many body system breaks time translation symmetry. We study
BTC's in collective $d$-level systems, focusing in the cases with $d=2$, $3$
and $4$. We find that BTC's appear in different forms for the different cases.
We first consider the model with collective $d=2$-level systems [presented in
Phys. Rev. Lett. $121$, $035301$ ($2018$)], whose dynamics is described by a
Lindblad master equation, and perform a throughout analysis of its phase
diagram and Jacobian stability for different interacting terms in the coherent
Hamiltonian. In particular, using perturbation theory for general (non
Hermitian) matrices we obtain analytically how a specific $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry breaking Hamiltonian term destroys the BTC phase in the model. Based
on these results we define a $d=4$ model composed of a pair of collective
$2$-level systems interacting with each other. We show that this model support
richer dynamical phases, ranging from limit-cycles, period-doubling
bifurcations and a route to chaotic dynamics. The BTC phase is more robust in
this case, not annihilated by the former symmetry breaking Hamiltonian terms.
The model with collective $d=3$-level systems is defined similarly, as
competing pairs of levels, but sharing a common collective level. The dynamics
can deviate significantly from the previous cases, supporting phases with the
coexistence of multiple limit-cycles, closed orbits and a full degeneracy of
zero Lyapunov exponents.

a mystery. At the phenomenological level, no superconducting order parameter
proposed thus far seems able to coherently account for all essential
experimental signatures. Among the latter is the prominent polar Kerr effect,
which implies a nonzero ac anomalous Hall conductivity. Assuming the Kerr
effect is intrinsic, it can be accounted for by a bulk chiral Cooper pairing
with nonzero orbital angular momentum, such as $p+ip$ or $d+id$, which,
however, has difficulties in being reconciled with other experimental results.
Given the situation, in this paper, we propose alternative possibilities with
complex mixtures of distinct helical p-wave order parameters, namely,
$A_{1u}+iA_{2u}$ and $B_{1u}+iB_{2u}$ in the group theory nomenclature. These
states essentially consist of two copies of chiral p-wave pairings with
opposite chirality and different pairing amplitudes, and therefore support
intrinsic Hall and Kerr effects. We further show that these states exhibit
salient features that may explain several other key observations in this
material, including the absence of spontaneous edge current, a substantial
Knight shift drop, and possibly signatures in uniaxial strain and ultrasound
measurements.

momentum loss determine how the solar wind changes from sub-Alfv\'enic to
super-Alfv\'enic and how the Sun spins down. We present an approach to
determining the solar wind angular momentum flux based on observations from
Parker Solar Probe (PSP). A flux of about $0.15\times10^{30}$ dyn cm sr$^{-1}$
near the ecliptic plane and 0.7:1 partition of that flux between the particles
and magnetic field are obtained by averaging data from the first four
encounters within 0.3 au from the Sun. The angular momentum flux and its
particle component decrease with the solar wind speed, while the flux in the
field is remarkably constant. A speed dependence in the Alfv\'en radius is also
observed, which suggests a ""rugged"" Alfv\'en surface around the Sun.
Substantial diving below the Alfv\'en surface seems plausible only for
relatively slow solar wind given the orbital design of PSP. Uncertainties are
evaluated based on the acceleration profiles of the same solar wind streams
observed at PSP and a radially aligned spacecraft near 1 au. We illustrate that
the ""angular momentum paradox"" raised by R\'eville et al. can be removed by
taking into account the contribution of the alpha particles. The large proton
transverse velocity observed by PSP is perhaps inherent in the solar wind
acceleration process, where an opposite transverse velocity is produced for the
alphas with the angular momentum conserved. Preliminary analysis of some
recovered alpha parameters tends to agree with the results.

Previous studies have used giant stars in the Kepler field to map the

solar circle. Consistent with prior work, we find that stars with high
[Alpha/Fe] have distinct, older ages in comparison to stars with low
[Alpha/Fe]. We provide age estimates for red giant branch (RGB) stars in the
Kepler field, which support and build upon previous age estimates by taking
into account the effect of alpha-enrichment on opacity. Including this effect
for [Alpha/Fe]-rich stars results in up to 10% older ages for low-mass stars
relative to corrected solar mixture calculations. This is a significant effect
that Galactic archaeology studies should take into account. Looking beyond the
Kepler field, we estimate ages for 735 red giant branch stars from the K2
mission, mapping age trends as a function of the line of sight. We find that
the age distributions for low- and high-[Alpha/Fe] stars converge with
increasing distance from the Galactic plane, in agreement with suggestions from
earlier work. We find that K2 stars with high [Alpha/Fe] appear to be younger
than their counterparts in the Kepler field, overlapping more significantly
with a similarly aged low-[Alpha/Fe] population. This observation may suggest
that star formation or radial migration proceeds unevenly in the Galaxy.

the robust accuracy against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) can achieve nearby

a novel Fast Gradient Sign Method with PGD Regularization (FGSMPR) to boost the
efficiency of adversarial training without catastrophic overfitting. Our core
idea is that single-step adversarial training can not learn robust internal
representations of FGSM and PGD adversarial examples. Therefore, we design a
PGD regularization term to encourage similar embeddings of FGSM and PGD
adversarial examples. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can
train a robust deep network for L$_\infty$-perturbations with FGSM adversarial
training and reduce the gap to multi-step adversarial training.

Many parents do not believe that these apps are available and designed for

novel risk in the VPA ecosystem: confounding utterances, or voice commands
shared by multiple apps that may cause a user to interact with a different app

boosted DM interacting with leptons, data taken on-axis leads to marginally
stronger exclusion limits. Searches for heavy neutral leptons perform equally
well in both configurations.

histograms is a fundamental task in machine learning. One of the popular
solution methods for this task is to compute the barycenter of the probability
measures under the Wasserstein metric. However, approximating the Wasserstein
barycenter is numerically challenging because of the curse of dimensionality.
This paper proposes the projection robust Wasserstein barycenter (PRWB) that
has the potential to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Since PRWB is
numerically very challenging to solve, we further propose a relaxed PRWB
(RPRWB) model, which is more tractable. The RPRWB projects the probability
measures onto a lower-dimensional subspace that maximizes the Wasserstein
barycenter objective. The resulting problem is a max-min problem over the
Stiefel manifold. By combining the iterative Bregman projection algorithm and
Riemannian optimization, we propose two new algorithms for computing the RPRWB.
The complexity of arithmetic operations of the proposed algorithms for
obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary solution is analyzed. We incorporate the
RPRWB into a discrete distribution clustering algorithm, and the numerical
results on real text datasets confirm that our RPRWB model helps improve the
clustering performance significantly.

scanning electron microscope images is non-trivial because of noise, imaging
artifacts, variation in pixel grayscale values across images, and overlaps in
grayscale values among different physical features such as silt grains, clay
grains, and pores in an image, which make their identification difficult.
Moreover, because grains and pores often have overlapping grayscale values,
direct application of threshold-based segmentation techniques is not
sufficient. Recent advances in the field of computer vision have made it easier
and faster to segment images and identify multiple occurrences of such features
in an image, provided that ground-truth data for training the algorithm is
available. Here, we propose a deep learning SEM image segmentation model,
MudrockNet based on Google's DeepLab-v3+ architecture implemented with the
TensorFlow library. The ground-truth data was obtained from an image-processing
workflow applied to scanning electron microscope images of uncemented muds from
the Kumano Basin offshore Japan at depths < 1.1 km. The trained deep learning
model obtained a pixel-accuracy about 90%, and predictions for the test data
obtained a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.6591 for silt grains and
0.6642 for pores. We also compared our model with the random forest classifier
using trainable Weka segmentation in ImageJ, and it was observed that
MudrockNet gave better predictions for both silt grains and pores. The size,
concentration, and spatial arrangement of the silt and clay grains can affect
the petrophysical properties of a mudrock, and an automated method to
accurately identify the different grains and pores in mudrocks can help improve
reservoir and seal characterization for petroleum exploration and anthropogenic
waste sequestration.

that the sSFR offsets in the outskirts of the paired galaxies are dependent on
whether the galaxy is the more massive or less massive companion in the pair.
The more massive companion experiences zero to a positive sSFR enhancement

the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local

proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels,
as well as the unbalanced and nonindependent and identically distributed data

incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL
convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show
that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV

show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to
popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated

it maintains the privacy of the patients' genomic data. Third, to facilitate

Roughly, the model is as follows. Each neuron is represented by its membrane
potential, which takes non-negative integer values. Neurons spike at Poisson
rate 1, provided they have strictly positive membrane potential. When a spike
occurs, the potential of the spiking neuron changes to 0, and all neurons
connected to it receive a positive amount of potential. Moreover, between
successive spikes and without receiving any spiking inputs from other neurons,
each neuron's potential behaves independently as a pure death process with
death rate $\gamma \geq 0$. In this article, we show that if the number $d$ of
connections is large enough, then the process exhibits at least two phase
transitions depending on the choice of rate $\gamma$: For large values of

investigate a particular migration theory in which a warm Jupiter is coupled to
a perturbing companion planet that excites secular eccentricity oscillations in
the warm Jupiter, leading to periodic close stellar passages that can tidally
shrink and circularize its orbit. If such companions exist in warm Jupiter
systems, they are likely to be massive and close-in, making them potentially
detectable. We generate a set of warm Jupiter-perturber populations capable of
engaging in high-eccentricity tidal migration and calculate the detectability
of the perturbers through a variety of observational metrics. We show that a
small percentage of these perturbers should be detectable in the Kepler light
curves, but most should be detectable with precise radial velocity measurements

to the assumptions made for the perturber parameter distributions. If a
high-precision radial velocity search for companions to warm Jupiters does not
find evidence of a significant number of massive companions over a 3-month

network parameter or the invariants of the model, can be asked. In this paper
we focus on finding the invariants of the Cavendar-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model on
level-1 phylogenetic networks. We do this by reducing the problem to finding
invariants of sunlet networks, which are level-1 networks consisting of a
single cycle with leaves at each vertex. We then determine all quadratic
invariants in the sunlet network ideal which we conjecture generate the full
ideal.

popularity recently in the machine learning community due to its robustness and

extension of the Gaussian-process framework. We are proposing advanced kernel
designs that only allow for functions with certain desirable characteristics to
be elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that underlies all
kernel methods and serves as the sample space for Gaussian process regression.
These desirable characteristics reflect the underlying physics; two obvious
examples are symmetry and periodicity constraints. In addition, non-stationary
kernel designs can be defined in the same framework to yield flexible
multi-task Gaussian processes. We will show the impact of advanced kernel
designs on Gaussian processes using several synthetic and two scientific data

advanced kernel designs, has a significant impact on the accuracy and relevance

DkS as minimizing a submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint.
Exploiting the fact that submodular functions possess a convex, continuous

Although the Lov\'asz extension of a submodular function does not admit an

these simulations, we also compare our Bayesian method with the frequentist
Filtered Fusion method that has been already used in WMAP data and in the
\emph{Planck} mission. We find that the Bayesian method allows us to decrease
the threshold for a feasible estimation of $P$ to levels below $\sim 100$ mJy
(as compared to $\sim 500$ mJy that was the equivalent threshold for the
frequentist Filtered Fusion). We compare the bias introduced by the Bayesian
method and find it to be small in absolute terms. Finally, we test the
robustness of the Bayesian estimator against uncertainties in the prior and in

and radiative neutron capture can be determined from a combination of surrogate
reaction data and theory. For the fission case, it was shown that
Weisskopf-Ewing approximation, which significantly simplifies the
implementation of the surrogate method, can be employed. Capture cross sections
cannot be obtained, and require a detailed description of the surrogate
reaction process. In this paper we examine the validity of the Weisskopf-Ewing
approximation for determining unknown $(n,n^{\prime})$ and $(n,2n)$ cross
sections from surrogate data.
  We find that peak cross sections can be estimated using the Weisskopf-Ewing
approximation, but the shape of the $(n,n^{\prime})$ and $(n,2n)$ cross
sections, especially for low neutron energies, cannot be reliably determined
without accounting for the angular-momentum differences between the
neutron-induced and surrogate reaction.
  To obtain reliable $(n,n^{\prime})$ and $(n,2n)$ cross sections from
surrogate reaction data, a detailed description of the surrogate reaction
mechanisms is required. To do so for the compound-nucleus energies and decay
channels relevant to these reactions, it becomes necessary to extend current
modeling capabilities.

against the inhalation of hazardous fumes and particles. They also offer an
effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against
air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for
its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution
for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and
positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms
can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and
other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application
scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The
inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing
sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably
low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain
on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address
these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for
correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is
implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.
Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling
multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.
When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is
reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an
accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.
To maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,
skin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their
ability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the
Grad-CAM approach.

field equations where the energy--momentum tensor has a null divergence i.e.,
it conserves, there exists a considerable number of extended theories of
gravity allowing departures from the usual conservative framework. Many of
these theories became popular in the last few years, aiming to describe the
phenomenology behind dark matter and dark energy. However, within these
scenarios, it is common to see attempts to preserve the conservative property
of the energy--momentum tensor. Most of the time, it is done by means of some
additional constraint that ensures the validity of the standard conservation
law, as long as this option is available in the theory. However, if no such
extra constraint is available, the theory will inevitably carry a non-trivial
conservation law as part of its structure. In this work, we review some of such
proposals discussing the theoretical construction leading to the
non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor.

been extensively studied and resolved using several heuristics. However, these
works usually fail to address how an external party can target different types
of fair behaviour or do not take into account how limited information can shape
this complex interplay. Here, we consider the well-known Ultimatum game in a
spatial setting and propose a hierarchy of interference mechanisms based on the
amount of information available to an external decision-maker and desired
standards of fairness. Our analysis reveals that monitoring the population at a
macroscopic level requires more strict information gathering in order to obtain
an optimal outcome and that local observations can mediate this requirement.
Moreover, we identify the conditions which must be met for an individual to be
eligible for investment in order to avoid unnecessary spending. We further
explore the effects of varying mutation or behavioural exploration rates on the
choice of investment strategy and total accumulated costs to the investor.
Overall, our analysis provides new insights about efficient heuristics for
cost-efficient promotion of fairness in societies. Finally, we discuss the
differences between our findings and previous work done on the PD and present
our suggestions for promoting fairness as an external decision-maker.

this resolution. This paper presents detailed simulations of relatively thin (1

150 $\mu$m. The simulations account for the non-negligible spatial extent of
the deposition of the energy of the incident photon, and include detailed

we recover the class of $K$-quasiregular mappings when $\sigma \equiv 0$, the
theory of arbitrary solutions is significantly more complicated, partly due to
the unavailability of a robust degree theory for non-quasiregular solutions.
Nonetheless, we obtain a Liouville-type theorem and the sharp H\""older

structure of complex networks. Therefore, a strategy used to assess this task
must be able to avoid biased and incorrect results that might invalidate
further analyses or applications that rely on such communities. Two widely used
strategies to assess this task are generally known as structural and
functional. The structural strategy basically consists in detecting and
assessing such communities by using multiple methods and structural metrics. On
the other hand, the functional strategy might be used when ground truth data
are available to assess the detected communities. However, the evaluation of
communities based on such strategies is usually done in experimental
configurations that are largely susceptible to biases, a situation that is
inherent to algorithms, metrics and network data used in this task.
Furthermore, such strategies are not systematically combined in a way that
allows for the identification and mitigation of bias in the algorithms, metrics
or network data to converge into more consistent results. In this context, the
main contribution of this article is an approach that supports a robust quality
evaluation when detecting communities in real-world networks. In our approach,
we measure the quality of a community by applying the structural and functional
strategies, and the combination of both, to obtain different pieces of
evidence. Then, we consider the divergences and the consensus among the pieces
of evidence to identify and overcome possible sources of bias in community
detection algorithms, evaluation metrics, and network data. Experiments
conducted with several real and synthetic networks provided results that show
the effectiveness of our approach to obtain more consistent conclusions about
the quality of the detected communities.

galaxy to wander in the nucleus region. A situation is supposed in which the
central black hole tends to move by the gravitational attractions from the
nearby molecular clouds in a nuclear bulge but is braked via the dynamical
frictions by the ambient stars there. We estimate the approximate kinetic
energy of the black hole in an equilibrium between the energy gain rate through
the gravitational attractions and the energy loss rate through the dynamical
frictions, in a nuclear bulge composed of a nuclear stellar disk and a nuclear
stellar cluster as observed from our Galaxy. The wandering distance of the
black hole in the gravitational potential of the nuclear bulge is evaluated to
get as large as several 10 pc, when the black hole mass is relatively small.
The distance, however, shrinks as the black hole mass increases and the
equilibrium solution between the energy gain and loss disappears when the black
hole mass exceeds an upper limit. As a result, we can expect the following
scenario for the evolution of the black hole mass: When the black hole mass is
smaller than the upper limit, mass accretion of the interstellar matter in the
circum-nuclear region, causing the AGN activities, makes the black hole mass
larger. However, when the mass gets to the upper limit, the black hole loses
the balancing force against the dynamical friction and starts spiraling
downward to the gravity center. From simple parameter scaling, the upper mass
limit of the black hole is found to be proportional to the bulge mass and this
could explain the observed correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge
mass.

the composition and thermal structure of the atmosphere. At the same time,
these aerosols also interfere with our probes of atmospheric composition and

understanding of exoplanet atmospheres as a whole. Here we review the current
state of knowledge of exoplanet aerosols as determined from observations,
modeling, and laboratory experiments. Measurements of the transmission spectra,
dayside emission, and phase curves of transiting exoplanets, as well as the
emission spectrum and light curves of directly imaged exoplanets and brown
dwarfs have shown that aerosols are distributed inhomogeneously in exoplanet
atmospheres, with aerosol distributions varying significantly with planet
equilibrium temperature and gravity. Parameterized and microphysical models
predict that these aerosols are likely composed of oxidized minerals like
silicates for the hottest exoplanets, while at lower temperatures the dominant
aerosols may be composed of alkali salts and sulfides. Particles originating
from photochemical processes are also likely at low temperatures, though their
formation process is highly complex, as revealed by laboratory work. In the
years to come, new ground- and space-based observatories will have the
capability to assess the composition of exoplanet aerosols, while new modeling

interestingly they have hitherto been studied independently. A recent
adversarial training (AT) study showed that the number of projected gradient
descent (PGD) steps to successfully attack a point (i.e., find an adversarial
example in its proximity) is an effective measure of the robustness of this
point. Given that natural data are clean, this measure reveals an intrinsic
geometric property -- how far a point is from its class boundary. Based on this
breakthrough, in this paper, we figure out how AT would interact with NL.
Firstly, we find if a point is too close to its noisy-class boundary (e.g., one
step is enough to attack it), this point is likely to be mislabeled, which
suggests to adopt the number of PGD steps as a new criterion for sample
selection for correcting NL. Secondly, we confirm AT with strong smoothing
effects suffers less from NL (without NL corrections) than standard training
(ST), which suggests AT itself is an NL correction. Hence, AT with NL is
helpful for improving even the natural accuracy, which again illustrates the
superiority of AT as a general-purpose robust learning criterion.

Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). To comprehensively evaluate the
performance of CAVs, it is of necessity to test the CAVs in safety-critical
scenarios, which rarely happen in naturalistic driving environment. Therefore,
how to purposely and systematically generate these corner cases becomes an
important problem. Most existing studies focus on generating adversarial
examples for perception systems of CAVs, whereas limited efforts have been put
on the decision-making systems, which is the highlight of this paper. As the
CAVs need to interact with numerous background vehicles (BVs) for a long
duration, variables that define the corner cases are usually high dimensional,
which makes the generation a challenging problem. In this paper, a unified
framework is proposed to generate corner cases for the decision-making systems.
To address the challenge brought by high dimensionality, the driving
environment is formulated based on Markov Decision Process, and the deep
reinforcement learning techniques are applied to learn the behavior policy of
BVs. With the learned policy, BVs will behave and interact with the CAVs more
aggressively, resulting in more corner cases. To further analyze the generated
corner cases, the techniques of feature extraction and clustering are utilized.
By selecting representative cases of each cluster and outliers, the valuable
corner cases can be identified from all generated corner cases. Simulation
results of a highway driving environment show that the proposed methods can
effectively generate and identify the valuable corner cases.

transfer between the emitters of a small-atom dimer can be obviously
nonreciprocal by introducing between them a coherent coupling channel with
nontrivial coupling phase. We prove that for dimer models the nonreciprocity
cannot coexist with the decoherence-free giant-atom structure although the
latter markedly lengthens the lifetime of the emitters. In view of this, we
further propose a giant-atom trimer which supports both nonreciprocal transfer
(directional circulation) of the excitation and greatly lengthened lifetime.
Such a trimer model also exhibits incommensurate emitter-waveguide entanglement
for different initial states in which case the excitation transfer is however
reciprocal. We believe that the proposals in this paper are of potential
applications in large-scale quantum networks and quantum information

detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. To
efficiently solve the problem, this paper designs a novel iterative algorithm
with low complexity in the regime where the device activity pattern is sparse
$\unicode{x2013}$ a key feature that existing algorithmic designs have not
previously exploited for reducing complexity. Specifically, at each iteration,
the proposed algorithm focuses on only a small subset of all potential
sequences, namely the active set, which contains a few most likely active
sequences (i.e., transmitted sequences by all active devices), and performs the
detection for the sequences in the active set. The active set is carefully
selected at each iteration based on the current detection result and the
first-order optimality condition of the MLE problem. Simulation results show
that the proposed active set algorithm enjoys significantly better
computational efficiency (in terms of the CPU time) than the state-of-the-art

terms of the Wilson coefficients of dimension-five and -seven operators in
SMEFT and hadronic low energy constants. These Wilson coefficients involve the
first and second generations of quarks and all generations of leptons and thus
cannot be explored in low energy processes such as nuclear neutrinoless double

on the branching ratios are too weak to set useful constraints on those

branching ratios are well below the current experimental bounds. We also
estimate hadronic uncertainties incurred in applying $\chi$PT to $\tau$ decays
by computing one-loop chiral logarithms and attempt to improve convergence of
chiral perturbation by employing dispersion relations in the short-distance

Then, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities of two interfaces driven by the
generated cylindrically converging shock wave and the associated fluids' mixing
behaviors are numerically studied. The results show that the instability of the
interface is characterized by the growth of perturbation amplitude before
re-shock. However, the mixing of fluids is enhanced dramatically after
re-shock, which is manifested not only by the evolutions of flow structures but
also by the temporal behaviors of mixing parameters. Further investigation
shows that, although these two cases are of different initial perturbations,
their evolutions of mixing width and other mixing parameters such as molecular
mixing fraction, local anisotropy and density-specific volume correlation could
achieve the same laws of temporal behavior, especially during the later stage
after re-shock. These results to some extent demonstrate that there also exist
scaling law and temporal asymptotic behaviors in the mixing zone for
cylindrically converging shock wave driven interface. Moreover, the analyses of
turbulent kinetic energy spectrums in the azimuthal direction at late stage
also witness the $k^{-5/3}$ decaying law of turbulent kinetic energy for the
present inhomogeneity flows driven by cylindrically converging shock wave,

of ciphertexts and support massive parallelism of Homomorphic
Multiply-Accumulate (HMA) operations between ciphertexts. Despite the faster
HECNN inference, the mainstream packing schemes Dense Packing (DensePack) and
Convolution Packing (ConvPack) introduce expensive rotation overhead, which
prolongs the inference latency of HECNN for deeper and wider CNN architectures.
In this paper, we propose a low-rank factorization method named FFConv
dedicated to efficient ciphertext packing for reducing both the rotation
overhead and HMA operations. FFConv approximates a d x d convolution layer with
low-rank factorized convolutions, in which a d x d low-rank convolution with
fewer channels is followed by a 1 x 1 convolution to restore the channels. The
d x d low-rank convolution with DensePack leads to significantly reduced
rotation operations, while the rotation overhead of 1 x 1 convolution with
ConvPack is close to zero. To our knowledge, FFConv is the first work that is
capable of reducing the rotation overhead incurred by DensePack and ConvPack
simultaneously, without introducing additional special blocks into the HECNN
inference pipeline. Compared to prior art LoLa and Falcon, our method reduces
the inference latency by up to 88% and 21%, respectively, with comparable

practice of deep neural networks with batch normalization (BN-DNNs), where some
convolution layers are invariant to weight rescaling due to the normalization.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the practical usage of weight decay still
has some unsolved problems in spite of existing theoretical work on explaining
the effect of weight decay in BN-DNNs. On the one hand, when the non-adaptive
learning rate e.g. SGD with momentum is used, the effective learning rate
continues to increase even after the initial training stage, which leads to an
overfitting effect in many neural architectures. On the other hand, in both
SGDM and adaptive learning rate optimizers e.g. Adam, the effect of weight
decay on generalization is quite sensitive to the hyperparameter. Thus, finding
an optimal weight decay parameter requires extensive parameter searching. To
address those weaknesses, we propose to regularize the weight norm using a
simple yet effective weight rescaling (WRS) scheme as an alternative to weight
decay. WRS controls the weight norm by explicitly rescaling it to the unit
norm, which prevents a large increase to the gradient but also ensures a
sufficiently large effective learning rate to improve generalization. On a
variety of computer vision applications including image classification, object
detection, semantic segmentation and crowd counting, we show the effectiveness
and robustness of WRS compared with weight decay, implicit weight rescaling
(weight standardization) and gradient projection (AdamP).

energy. The magnetically driven dynamo is not so well studied as kinetically
forced dynamo. It has been thought to represent the amplification of magnetic
field in the stellar corona, accretion disk, or plasma lab. However, the
interaction between the helical magnetic field and plasma is a more fundamental
phenomenon that can be extended to the early Universe. The scale-invariant
helical magnetic field not only explains the currently observed large scale
astrophysical magnetic fields but also has information on the horizon scale in
the early Universe.
  The interaction between magnetic field and plasma is inherently non-linear,
making its mechanism difficult to understand. But, if the plasma system is
driven with helical field, the process can be linearized with alpha&betaand
large scale magnetic field. Conventionally, alpha effect is thought to transfer
magnetic field to the large scale regime, and betaeffect diffuses magnetic
field. However, these conclusions are based on the incompletely derived
alpha&beta. To get the exact profiles of evolving alpha&\b{eta}, we solved a
coupled semi-analytic equation set and applied the result to simulation data
for the large scale magnetic helicity and magnetic energy.
  Our result shows that the averaged alpha effect decreases before making a
significant contribution to the amplification of large scale B field. Rather,
betaeffect, which keeps negative, de facto plays a key role in the
amplification of large scale B field with Laplacian. And, this negative
diffusivity accounts for the attenuation of plasma kinetic energy

reinforcement learning (RL) owing to its sequential decision-making nature.
However, existing RL-based approaches rarely focus on scalability or
reusability to adapt to the ever-changing markets. These approaches are rigid
and unscalable to accommodate the varying number of assets of portfolios and
increasing need for heterogeneous data. Also, RL agents in the existing systems
are ad-hoc trained and hardly reusable for different portfolios. To confront
the above problems, a modular design is desired for the systems to be
compatible with reusable asset-dedicated agents. In this paper, we propose a
multi-agent RL-based system for PM (MSPM). MSPM involves two types of
asynchronously-updated modules: Evolving Agent Module (EAM) and Strategic Agent
Module (SAM). An EAM is an information-generating module with a DQN agent, and
it receives heterogeneous data and generates signal-comprised information for a
particular asset. An SAM is a decision-making module with a PPO agent for
portfolio optimization, and it connects to EAMs to reallocate the assets in a
portfolio. Trained EAMs can be connected to any SAM at will. With its
modularized architecture, the multi-step condensation of volatile market
information, and the reusable design of EAM, MSPM simultaneously addresses the
two challenges in RL-based PM: scalability and reusability. Experiments on
8-year U.S. stock market data prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit
accumulation by its outperformance over five baselines in terms of accumulated
rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return, and Sortino ratio. MSPM improves
ARR by at least 186.5% compared to CRP, a widely-used PM strategy. To validate
the indispensability of EAM, we back-test and compare MSPMs on four portfolios.
EAM-enabled MSPMs improve ARR by at least 1341.8% compared to EAM-disabled
MSPMs.

270 K, which is well above state-of-the-art strained Si hole mobility. By
lowering the temperature, the mobility increases to
$1390\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/V\cdot s}$ and becomes primarily limited by Coulomb
scattering. \txc{The combination of an electron affinity of $\sim$4 eV and a
small bandgap of tellurium provides zero Schottky barrier height for hole
injection at the metal-contact interface}, which is remarkable for reduction of
contact resistance in a highly scaled transistor. Exploiting these properties,
coupled with the dual-gated operation, we achieve a high drive current of
$216\,\mathrm{\mu A/\mu m}$ while maintaining an on-off ratio in excess of
$2\times10^4$. The findings have intriguing prospects for alternate channel
material based next-generation electronics.

distance metric that is consistent with the semantic similarities of objects.
The design of an appropriate loss function that encourages discriminative
feature learning is among the most crucial challenges in deep neural
network-based metric learning. Despite significant progress, slow convergence
and a poor local optimum of the existing contrastive and triplet loss based
deep metric learning methods necessitates a better solution. In this paper, we
propose cosine-margin-contrastive (CMC) and cosine-margin-triplet (CMT) loss by
reformulating both contrastive and triplet loss functions from the perspective
of cosine distance. The proposed reformulation as a cosine loss is achieved by
feature normalization which distributes the learned features on a hypersphere.
We then propose the MOTS R-CNN framework for joint multi-object tracking and
segmentation, particularly targeted at improving the tracking performance.
Specifically, the tracking problem is addressed through deep metric learning
based on the proposed loss functions. We propose a scale-invariant tracking by
using a multi-layer feature aggregation scheme to make the model robust against
object scale variations and occlusions. The MOTS R-CNN achieves the
state-of-the-art tracking performance on the KITTI MOTS dataset. We show that
the MOTS R-CNN reduces the identity switching by $62\%$ and $61\%$ on cars and

present here the first spectral and timing analysis of the source at its
various flaring states. During the higher {\gamma}-ray state, we found four
major peaks identified as P1, P2, P3, and P4. From timing analysis, we found
the rise and decay time of the order of hours with the fastest variability time
of 9.01+/-0.78 hr. We found the highest {\gamma}-ray photon of 77 GeV during
P4, which suggests the location of the {\gamma}-ray emitting region at the
outer edge of the broad-line region or the inner edge of the torus. The
{\gamma}-ray spectral analysis of the source indicates that during P4, the
{\gamma}-ray spectrum clearly deviates from the power-law behavior. From
cross-correlation analysis of the {\gamma}-ray and radio lightcurves, we found
that the two emission regions are separated by about 11 pc. Our broadband
spectral energy distribution modeling of the source during quiescent and active

potential to improve operational efficiency and vehicle fuel economy in traffic
systems. Despite abundant studies in this research area, most of them only
consider trajectory planning in the longitudinal dimension or assume the fully
CAV environment. This study proposes an approach to the decentralized planning
of CAV trajectories at an isolated signalized intersection under the mixed
traffic environment, which consists of connected and human-driven vehicles
(CHVs) and CAVs. A bi-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete
time to optimize the trajectory of a single CAV in both the longitudinal and
lateral dimensions given signal timings and the trajectory information of
surrounding vehicles. The upper-level model optimizes lateral lane-changing
strategies. The lower-level model optimizes longitudinal acceleration profiles
based on the lane-changing strategies from the upper-level model. Minimization
of vehicle delay, fuel consumption, and lane-changing costs are considered in
the objective functions. A Lane-Changing Strategy Tree (LCST) and a Parallel
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (PMCTS) algorithm are designed to solve the bi-level
optimization model. CAV trajectories are planned one by one according to their
distance to the stop bar. A rolling horizon scheme is applied for the dynamic
implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic condition.
Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed trajectory planning
model compared with the benchmark cases without CAV trajectory planning.

user controlling the robot needs to visualize a 3D scene as seen by the robot

provides the user more freedom such as choosing viewpoints at view time. In

Despite the appearance of static twisting on cooling from T ~ 300 K to 100 K,
no evidence for a phase transition was found in physical properties

a high order method, we have to adopt a numerical approach in the framework of
the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM). By a successively refined

providing input data smooth enough. Based on the formulation of the high order

parametric uncertainties and disturbances are handled by the time delay
estimation and the nonlinearity of the manipulator is addressed by the feedback
structure of the controller. The combination of terminal sliding mode surface
and higher-order control scheme in the controller guarantees a fast response
with a small chattering amplitude. Moreover, the controller is designed with a
modified sliding mode surface and variable-gain structure, so that the

quantization'), we propose the loss of covariance as a fundamental property of
the theory. This breakdown occurs for the first-order Einstein Hilbert action,
whereby loss of diffeomorphism invariance, besides first class constraints,
second class constriants also exist leading to non-standard ghost fields which
render the path integral non-covariant. We also attempt, for the first time,
the canonical quantization via calculation of the path integral for the
equivalent Hamiltonian formulation of GR for which only first class constraints
exist. However, loss of covariance still occurs in this action due to loss of
diffeomorphism invariance and structures arising from non-covariant constraints
in the path integral. In contrast, we find that covariance as a symmetry is
restored and quantization with perturbative calculations is possible in the
weak limit of the gravitational field of these actions. Hence, we firstly
establish, for the first time, that the breakdown in space-time is a property
of GR itself as its limitation, indicating it to be an Effective Field Theory
(EFT). We further propose that the breakdown of space-time occurs as a
non-perturbative feature of GR in the strong field limit of the theory. Besides
GR, we also note that covariance is preserved when constraint quantization is
conducted for non-Abelian gauge theories, such as the Yang-Mills theory. These
findings are novel from a canonical gravity formalism and EFT approach, and are
consistent with GR singularity theorems, yet are general and extend them, as
the singularity theorems indicate breakdown at a strong field limit of GR in

model exploits the sparsity of changepoints to detect abrupt changes within the
ECG signal; thereby, the R-peak detection task can be relaxed from any
preprocessing step. In this novel approach, prior biological knowledge about
the expected sequence of changes is incorporated into the model using the
constraint graph, which can be defined manually or automatically. First, we
define the constraint graph manually; then, we present a graph learning

networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such method developed
for automotive Ethernet. The proposed intrusion detection model is based on
feature generation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). To evaluate our
intrusion detection system, we built a physical BroadR-Reach-based testbed and
captured real AVTP packets. The experimental results show that the model
exhibits outstanding performance: the F1-score and recall are greater than
0.9704 and 0.9949, respectively. In terms of the inference time per input and
the generation intervals of AVTP traffic, our CNN model can readily be employed
for real-time detection.

machines designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. They can be
physically realized with continuous-time, non-quantum dynamical systems with
memory (time non-locality), whose ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be
numerically integrated on modern computers. Solutions of many hard problems
have been reported by numerically integrating the ODEs of DMMs, showing
substantial advantages over state-of-the-art solvers. To investigate the
reasons behind the robustness and effectiveness of this method, we employ three
explicit integration schemes (forward Euler, trapezoid and Runge-Kutta 4th
order) with a constant time step, to solve 3-SAT instances with planted
solutions. We show that, (i) even if most of the trajectories in the phase
space are destroyed by numerical noise, the solution can still be achieved;
(ii) the forward Euler method, although having the largest numerical error,
solves the instances in the least amount of function evaluations; and (iii)
when increasing the integration time step, the system undergoes a
""solvable-unsolvable transition"" at a critical threshold, which needs to decay
at most as a power law with the problem size, to control the numerical errors.
To explain these results, we model the dynamical behavior of DMMs as directed
percolation of the state trajectory in the phase space in the presence of
noise. This viewpoint clarifies the reasons behind their numerical robustness
and provides an analytical understanding of the unsolvable-solvable transition.
These results land further support to the usefulness of DMMs in the solution of
hard combinatorial optimization problems.

reported, as well as the detection of new maser lines. The highest vibrational
levels seem confined to small volumes, presumably close to the stars. The
J=1-0, v=2 line flux is greater than the corresponding v=1 in almost half of
the sample, which may confirm a predicted dependence on the pulsation cycle.
This database is potentially useful in models which should consider most of the
physical agents, time dependency, and mass-loss rates. As by-product, we report
detections of 27 thermal rotational lines from other molecules, including
isotopologues of SiS, H2S, SO, SO2, and NaCl.

because a panorama has a full field-of-view of the environment and provides a

i.e., the equirectangular projection, is suboptimal, as it becomes distorted
towards the poles. Another representation is the cubemap projection, which is
distortion-free but discontinued on edges and limited in the field-of-view.
This paper introduces a new framework to fuse features from the two
projections, unidirectionally feeding the cubemap features to the
equirectangular features only at the decoding stage. Unlike the recent
bidirectional fusion approach operating at both the encoding and decoding
stages, our fusion scheme is much more efficient. Besides, we also designed a
more effective fusion module for our fusion scheme. Experiments verify the

outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we
find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multi-directional outflow
emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for
high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead
consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the
measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for
intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are
young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate and
high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of
the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that
the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not

pair of pitching hydrofoils interacting in a minimal school. The hydrofoils
have an out-of-phase synchronization and they are varied through in-line,
staggered, and side-by-side arrangements within the two-dimensional interaction
plane. It is discovered that there is a \textit{two-dimensionally} stable
equilibrium point for a side-by-side arrangement. In fact, this arrangement is
super-stable, meaning that hydrodynamic forces will passively maintain this
arrangement even under external perturbations and the school as a whole has no
net forces acting on it, causing it to drift to one side or the other.
Moreover, previously discovered \textit{one-dimensionally} stable equilibria
driven by wake vortex interactions are shown to be, in fact, two-dimensionally
\textit{unstable}, at least for an out-of-phase synchronization. Additionally,
it is discovered that a trailing-edge vortex mechanism provides the restorative
force to stabilize a side-by-side arrangement and the stable equilibrium is
further verified for freely-swimming foils where dynamic recoil motions are
present. When constrained, the swimmers experience a collective thrust and
efficiency increase up to 100\% and 40\%, respectively, in a side-by-side
arrangement, whereas the staggered arrangements output an even higher
efficiency improvement of 87\% with a 94\% increase in thrust. For
freely-swimming foils, the recoil motion attenuates the improvements at the
stable equilibrium, showing a more modest speed and efficiency enhancement of
up to 9\% and 6\%, respectively. These newfound schooling performance and
stability characteristics suggest that fluid-mediated equilibria may play a
role in the control strategies of schooling fish and fish-inspired robots.

Adaptive control parameter methods that can adapt to problem landscape and

This paper proposes a novel adaptive parameter control approach based on
learning from the optimization experiences over a set of problems. In the
approach, the parameter control is modeled as a finite-horizon Markov decision
process. A reinforcement learning algorithm, named policy gradient, is applied
to learn an agent (i.e. parameter controller) that can provide the control
parameters of a proposed differential evolution adaptively during the search

compared against nine well-known evolutionary algorithms on the CEC'13 and

especially when they experience involuntary stopping from the freezing of gait

stopping"" and ""involuntary stopping"" caused by FOG is vital for the detection
and potential intervention of FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study
characterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG
in contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go
(TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component,
where participants reacted to verbal ""stop"" and ""walk"" instructions by
voluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP)
analysis was used to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different
walking phases, which included normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes
of involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal
walking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first
time that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary
stopping is distinguishable from that of the transition to involuntary stopping
caused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly
decreased power spectrum compared to that of FOG episodes, with distinctly
different patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These
findings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based treatment strategy
that can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confound of
voluntary stopping.

that end, in this paper, we target at developing a new paradigm for drug

Specifically, we first design a pre-training method based on neural
collaborative filtering to get the initial embedding of patients and drugs.
Then, the drug interaction graph will be initialized based on medical records

is formulated based on the exact $\ell_0$ regularization, and can be solved in
near-linear time and memory. Moreover, we show that the proposed estimator
enjoys a provably small estimation error. As a special case, we derive sharp
statistical guarantees for the inference of sparsely-changing Gaussian MRFs
(GMRF) in the high-dimensional regime, showing that such problems can be
learned with as few as one sample per time. Our proposed method is extremely
efficient in practice: it can accurately estimate sparsely-changing graphical
models with more than 500 million variables in less than one hour.

  LSTM for Predictive Learning","Accept at ICME2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatiotemporal predictive learning (ST-PL) is a hotspot with numerous
applications, such as object movement and meteorological prediction. It aims at
predicting the subsequent frames via observed sequences. However, inherent
uncertainty among consecutive frames exacerbates the difficulty in long-term
prediction. To tackle the increasing ambiguity during forecasting, we design
CMS-LSTM to focus on context correlations and multi-scale spatiotemporal flow
with details on fine-grained locals, containing two elaborate designed blocks:
Context Embedding (CE) and Spatiotemporal Expression (SE) blocks. CE is
designed for abundant context interactions, while SE focuses on multi-scale
spatiotemporal expression in hidden states. The newly introduced blocks also
facilitate other spatiotemporal models (e.g., PredRNN, SA-ConvLSTM) to produce
representative implicit features for ST-PL and improve prediction quality.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed method. With fewer params, CMS-LSTM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in numbers of metrics on two representative benchmarks

automated negotiation forbids a single strategy from being dominant against all

use mixture of experts, but at the same time, one problem of this method is the
selection of experts, as this approach is limited by the competency of the

incapability of adapting to dynamic variation of the opponent's behaviour
within a single negotiation session resulting in poor performance. This work
focuses on both, solving the problem of expert selection and adapting to the
opponent's behaviour with our Autonomous Negotiating Agent Framework. This
framework allows real-time classification of opponent's behaviour and provides
a mechanism to select, switch or combine strategies within a single negotiation
session. Additionally, our framework has a reviewer component which enables
self-enhancement capability by deciding to include new strategies or replace
old ones with better strategies periodically. We demonstrate an instance of our
framework by implementing maximum entropy reinforcement learning based
strategies with a deep learning based opponent classifier. Finally, we evaluate
the performance of our agent against state-of-the-art negotiators under varied

Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (BSNA) is a charge ordered pnictide
superconductor recently shown to exhibit a six-fold enhancement of
superconductivity due to nematic fluctuations near a quantum phase transition
(at $x_c=0.7$). The superconductivity is, however, anomalous, with the
resistive transition for $0.4 < x< x_c$ occurring at a higher temperature than
the specific heat anomaly. Using x-ray scattering, we discovered a new charge
density wave (CDW) in BSNA in this composition range. The CDW is commensurate
with a period of two lattice parameters, and is distinct from the two CDWs
previously reported in this material. We argue that the anomalous transport
behavior arises from heterogeneous superconductivity nucleating at antiphase

the formation and evolution of living or non-living structures, and shows
potential applications in many emerging domains. In existing research and
practice, there still lacks an ideal self-assembly mechanism that manifests
efficiency, scalability, and stability at the same time. Inspired by phototaxis
observed in nature, we propose a computational approach for massive
self-assembly of connected shapes in grid environments. The key component of
this approach is an artificial light field superimposed on a grid environment,
which is determined by the positions of all agents and at the same time drives
all agents to change their positions, forming a dynamic mutual feedback
process. This work advances the understanding and potential applications of
self-assembly.

  humans",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main objective of this paper is to outline a theoretical framework to
analyse how humans' decision-making strategies under uncertainty manage the
trade-off between information gathering (exploration) and reward seeking
(exploitation). A key observation, motivating this line of research, is the
awareness that human learners are amazingly fast and effective at adapting to
unfamiliar environments and incorporating upcoming knowledge: this is an
intriguing behaviour for cognitive sciences as well as an important challenge
for Machine Learning. The target problem considered is active learning in a
black-box optimization task and more specifically how the
exploration/exploitation dilemma can be modelled within Gaussian Process based
Bayesian Optimization framework, which is in turn based on uncertainty
quantification. The main contribution is to analyse humans' decisions with
respect to Pareto rationality where the two objectives are improvement expected
and uncertainty quantification. According to this Pareto rationality model, if
a decision set contains a Pareto efficient (dominant) strategy, a rational
decision maker should always select the dominant strategy over its dominated
alternatives. The distance from the Pareto frontier determines whether a choice
is (Pareto) rational (i.e., lays on the frontier) or is associated to
""exasperate"" exploration. However, since the uncertainty is one of the two
objectives defining the Pareto frontier, we have investigated three different
uncertainty quantification measures and selected the one resulting more
compliant with the Pareto rationality model proposed. The key result is an
analytical framework to characterize how deviations from ""rationality"" depend
on uncertainty quantifications and the evolution of the reward seeking process.

segmentation results using both active contours and information theory. The
mutual shape is here defined as a consensus shape estimated from a set of
different segmentations of the same object. In an original manner, such a shape
is defined as the minimum of a criterion that benefits from both the mutual
information and the joint entropy of the input segmentations. This energy
criterion is justified using similarities between information theory quantities
and area measures, and presented in a continuous variational framework. In
order to solve this shape optimization problem, shape derivatives are computed
for each term of the criterion and interpreted as an evolution equation of an
active contour. A mutual shape is then estimated together with the sensitivity
and specificity of each segmentation. Some synthetic examples allow us to cast
the light on the difference between the mutual shape and an average shape. The
applicability of our framework has also been tested for segmentation evaluation
and fusion of different types of real images (natural color images, old
manuscripts, medical images).

symptoms shown by patients are not consistent, making it difficult to diagnose
in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although
researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis

to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness
needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms
clinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of
patients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and
diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning
framework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine
learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or
parties. Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of
inconsistent time series of multi-view data. Finally, we compare the federated
framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss
the related results.

supports Sabina Leonelli's implicit appeal to the values of epistemic integrity
and the global public good that conjointly animate the ethos of responsible and
sustainable data work in the context of COVID-19. Drawing primarily on the
writings of sociologist Robert K. Merton, the thinkers of the Vienna Circle,
and Charles Sanders Peirce, I make some of these assumptions explicit by
telling a longer story about the evolution of social thinking about the
normative structure of science from Merton's articulation of his well-known
norms (those of universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and
disinterestedness) to the present. I show that while Merton's norms and his
intertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order
provide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the
commitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive,
and more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific
understanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its
moral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively
draw upon important critiques. Stepping past Merton, I argue that a combination
of situated universalism, methodological pluralism, strong objectivity, and
unbounded communalism must guide the responsible and sustainable data work of
the future.

popularity in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). However, the use of
distributed controllers introduces a new and important Request Dispatching (RD)
problem with the goal for every SDN switch to properly dispatch their requests
among all controllers so as to optimize network performance. This goal can be
fulfilled by designing an RD policy to guide distribution of requests at each
switch. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
(MA-DRL) approach to automatically design RD policies with high adaptability
and performance. This is achieved through a new problem formulation in the form
of a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MA-MDP), a new adaptive RD policy
design and a new MA-DRL algorithm called MA-PPO. Extensive simulation studies
show that our MA-DRL technique can effectively train RD policies to
significantly outperform man-made policies, model-based policies, as well as RD
policies learned via single-agent DRL algorithms.

system (MAS) with intermittent communication. We adopt a relay-explorer scheme,
where a mobile relay agent with absolute position sensors switches among a set
of explorers with relative position sensors to provide intermittent state
information. We model the MAS as a switched system where the explorers'
dynamics can be either fully-actuated or underactuated. The objective of the
explorers is to reach approximate consensus to a predetermined goal region. To
guarantee the stability of the switched system and the approximate consensus of
the explorers, we derive maximum dwell-time conditions to constrain the length
of time each explorer goes without state feedback (from the relay agent).
Furthermore, the relay agent needs to satisfy practical constraints such as
charging its battery and staying in specific regions of interest. Both the
maximum dwell-time conditions and these practical constraints can be expressed
by metric temporal logic (MTL) specifications. We iteratively compute the
optimal control inputs for the relay agent to satisfy the MTL specifications,
while guaranteeing stability and approximate consensus of the explorers. We
implement the proposed method on a case study with the CoppeliaSim robot
simulator.
