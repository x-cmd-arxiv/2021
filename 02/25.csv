implications for training the next generation of software engineers. In recent
years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns
of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have
focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31
participants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the
neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled,
contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of
reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization
task). Our primary result is that all three tasks -- coding, prose reading, and
mental rotation -- are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those
tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose
and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally
find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and
task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with
more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a
neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later.
While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g.,
relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also
provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice
programming.

dynamic graph neural networks (PT-DGNN), which uses dynamic attributed graph

Rietveld method and the results of the XRD investigation reveal the desired

hopping length etc. have been determined from the analysis of Rietveld method.
This study reports that the gamma irradiations demonstrate a great influence on
optical bandgap energy and it varies from 1.80 and 1.89 eV evaluated via K M

a previously published methodology and extend its application to embedded

methodology can recover members from data sets extincted up to Av ~ 6 mag with
accuracies, true positive, and contamination rates that are better than 99%,
80%, and 9%, respectively. Missing values hamper our methodology by introducing
contaminants and artifacts into the magnitude distributions. Nonetheless, these

extracted from simulations that such detailed information about interparticle

by linear amplification, a loss of class D, which severely limits the benefit
of hearing aids in noisy listening conditions, cannot. Not few users of hearing
aids keep complaining about the limited benefit of their devices in noisy
environments. Recently, in an approach to model human speech recognition by
means of a re-purposed automatic speech recognition system, the loss of class D
was explained by introducing a level uncertainty which reduces the individual
accuracy of spectro-temporal signal levels. Based on this finding, an

swift Government action of restricting/regulating movement to increasing public

have done enough to emerge successful. India is doing well, if not guaranteed
for the future, but at least for now. Here we review these measures and point
to their consistency with analysis of the role of intercommunity transmission
and within community action to stop localized outbreaks. In particular, severe
restrictions on travel, stopping gatherings, targeted localized lockdowns,
school closures, effective public communication, improvements in case
identification, rapid ramping of industrial production of masks and other
personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing capacity, as well as intensive
measures in high density areas of urban deprivation have placed India in a
regime of declining cases and outbreak control. It is time to recognize the
scientific basis of India's success and give it its due. With the number of new
cases in India leveling recently, the urgency is great to complete the

equation under the diffusive scaling. Due to the multiscale nature of our model
equation, the model is challenging to solve by using conventional methods. We
employ the physical informed neural network (PINN) framework, a mesh-free
learning method that can numerically solve partial differential equations.
Compared to conventional methods (such as finite difference or finite element
type), our proposed learning method is able to obtain the solution at any given
points in the chosen domain accurately and efficiently, which enables us to
better understand the physics underlying the model. In our framework, the
solution is approximated by a neural network that satisfies both the governing
equation and other constraints. The network is then trained with a combination
of different loss terms. Using the approximation theory and energy estimates
for kinetic models, we prove theoretically that the total loss vanishes as the
neural network converges, upon which the neural network approximated solution
converges pointwisely to the analytic solution of the linear transport model.
Numerical experiments for two benchmark examples are conducted to verify the
effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed method.

the design of probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS), which is a popular scheme
that relies on an amplitude shaper for increasing spectral efficiencies of
fiber-optic systems. One property of certain shapers used in PAS -- including
constant-composition distribution matchers -- that is often overlooked is that
a time-dependency between amplitudes is introduced. This dependency results in
symbols that are non-i.i.d., which have time-varying statistical properties.
Somewhat surprisingly, the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in PAS has
been shown to increase when the shaping blocklength decreases. This blocklength

the symbol sequences, in particular, to variation of the symbol energies. In
this paper, we investigate the temporal energy behavior of symbol sequences,

recover the objective function parameters of players in multi-player Nash

which the players can affect each other in their objective functions. In
generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs), a player's set of feasible
actions is also impacted by the actions taken by other players in the game; see
Facchinei and Kanzow (2010) for more background on this problem. One example of
such impact comes in the form of joint/""coupled"" constraints as referenced by
Rosen (1965), Harker (1991), and Facchinei et al. (2007) which involve other
players' variables in the constraints of the feasible region. We extend the
framework of Ratliff et al. (2014) to find inverse optimization solutions for
the class of GNEPs with joint constraints. The resulting formulation is then
applied to a simulated multi-player transportation problem on a road network.
Also, we provide some theoretical results related to this transportation
problem regarding runtime of the extended framework as well as uniqueness and
non-uniqueness of solutions to our simulation experiments. We see that our
model recovers parameterizations that produce the same flow patterns as the

different assumptions regarding players' perceived costs, and the majority of
restrictive capacity settings and the associated numbers of players. Code for

rotational energy losses into radiation. In this paper, we propose an
alternative emission mechanism, in which neither the pulsar rotational energy
nor its magnetic field is involved. The emission mechanism proposed here is
based on the hypothesis that the pulsar matter is stable only when moving with
respect to the ambient medium at a velocity exceeding some threshold value. A
decrease in velocity below this threshold value leads to the decay of matter
with the emission of electromagnetic radiation. It is shown that decay regions
on the pulsar surface in which the velocities of pulsar particles drops to
arbitrarily small values are formed under simple driving condition. It is also
shown that for the majority of pulsars having measured transverse velocities,
such a condition is quite possible. Thus, the pulsar radiation carries away not
the pulsar rotational energy, but its mass, while the magnitude of the
rotational energy does not play any role. At the end of the paper, we consider
the reason for the possible short-period precession of the pulsar.

an initialization process based on the system geometry. With an IMU noise

work within linear perturbation theory and relate the fluctuations of the
luminosity distance-redshift relation, in the Cosmic Concordance model, to the
intrinsic uncertainty associated to the measurement of $H_0$ from high-redshift
surveys ($0.15\le z\le3.85$). We first present the detailed derivation of the
luminosity distance-redshift relation 2-point correlation function and then
provide analytical results for all the involved relativistic effects, such as
peculiar velocity, lensing, time delay and (integrated) Sachs-Wolfe, and their
angular spectra. Hence, we apply our analytical results to the study of
high-redshift Hubble diagram, according to what has been recently claimed in
literature. Following the specific of Euclid Deep Survey and LSST, we conclude
that the cosmic variance associated with the measurement of the Hubble constant
is at most of 0.1 %. Our work extends the analysis already done in literature
for closer sources, where only peculiar velocity has been taken into account.

suitable guides for magnetoacoustic waves. Recent observations have shown that
propagating energy flux in pores is subject to strong damping with height;
however, the reason is still unclear. Aims. We investigate possible damping
mechanisms numerically to explain the observations. Methods. We performed 2D
numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, starting from an equilibrium
model of a single pore inspired by the observed properties. Energy was inserted
into the bottom of the domain via different vertical drivers with a period of
30s. Simulations were performed with both ideal MHD and non-ideal effects.
Results. While the analysis of the energy flux for ideal and non-ideal MHD
simulations with a plane driver cannot reproduce the observed damping, the
numerically predicted damping for a localized driver closely corresponds with
the observations. The strong damping in simulations with localized driver was
caused by two geometric effects, geometric spreading due to diverging field
lines and lateral wave leakage.

each firm. Firms face idiosyncratic as well as common economic shocks on
emissions, and have linear quadratic abatement costs. Firms can trade
allowances so to minimise total expected costs, from abatement and trading plus
a quadratic terminal penalty. Using variational methods, we exhibit in
closed-form the market equilibrium in function of regulator's dynamic
allocation. We then solve the Stackelberg game between the regulator and the
firms. Again, we obtain a closed-form expression of the dynamic allocation
policies that allow a desired expected emission reduction. Optimal policies are
not unique but share common properties. Surprisingly, all optimal policies
induce a constant abatement effort and a constant price of allowances. Dynamic
allocations outperform static ones because of adjustment costs and uncertainty,
in particular given the presence of common shocks. Our results are robust to
some extensions, like risk aversion of firms or different penalty functions.

assigning credit to actions over time has been temporal-difference (TD)
learning, which propagates credit backward timestep-by-timestep. This approach
suffers when delays between actions and rewards are long and when intervening
unrelated events contribute variance to long-term returns. We propose
state-associative (SA) learning, where the agent learns associations between
states and arbitrarily distant future rewards, then propagates credit directly
between the two. In this work, we use SA-learning to model the contribution of
past states to the current reward. With this model we can predict each state's
contribution to the far future, a quantity we call ""synthetic returns"".
TD-learning can then be applied to select actions that maximize these synthetic
returns (SRs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting agents with SRs
across a range of tasks on which TD-learning alone fails. We show that the
learned SRs are interpretable: they spike for states that occur after critical
actions are taken. Finally, we show that our IMPALA-based SR agent solves Atari
Skiing -- a game with a lengthy reward delay that posed a major hurdle to
deep-RL agents -- 25 times faster than the published state-of-the-art.

mismatched, the cooling of certain motional degrees of freedom becomes
difficult. This limits both the achievable fidelity of quantum gates and the
spectroscopic accuracy. Here we introduce a novel algorithmic cooling protocol
for transferring phonons from poorly- to efficiently-cooled modes. We
demonstrate it experimentally by simultaneously bringing two motional modes of
a Be$^{+}$-Ar$^{13+}$ mixed Coulomb crystal close to their zero-point energies,

reported for a highly charged ion, with a residual temperature of only
$T\lesssim200~\mathrm{\mu K}$ in each of the two modes, corresponding to a
residual mean motional phonon number of $\langle n \rangle \lesssim 0.4$.
Combined with the lowest observed electric field noise in a radiofrequency ion
trap, these values enable an optical clock based on a highly charged ion with
fractional systematic uncertainty below the $10^{-18}$ level. Our scheme is
also applicable to (anti-)protons, molecular ions, macroscopic charged

resulting GWs are found to have an energy fraction of about $10^{-9}$ of the

distribution of shear-wave velocity. The range of applicability is extremely
wide going, for example, from seismological studies to geotechnical
characterizations and exploration geophysics. However, the inversion of the
dispersion curves is severely ill-posed and only limited efforts have been put
into the development of effective regularization strategies. In particular,
relatively simple smoothing regularization terms are commonly used, even when
this is in contrast with the expected features of the investigated targets. To
tackle this problem, stochastic approaches can be utilized, but they are too
computationally expensive to be practical, at least, in the case of large
surveys. Instead, within a deterministic framework, we evaluate the
applicability of a regularizer capable of providing reconstructions
characterized by tunable levels of sparsity. This adjustable stabilizer is
based on the minimum support regularization, applied before on other kinds of
geophysical measurements, but never on surface wave data. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this stabilizer on i) two benchmark - publicly available -
datasets at crustal and near-surface scales, ii) an experimental dataset
collected on a well-characterized site. In addition, we discuss a possible
strategy for the estimation of the depth of investigation. This strategy relies
on the integrated sensitivity kernel used for the inversion and calculated for
each individual propagation mode. Moreover, we discuss the reliability, and
possible caveats, of the direct interpretation of this particular estimation of
the depth of investigation, especially in the presence of sharp boundary
reconstructions.

itself to target the selected landing point considering the overall descent
trajectory. In response to this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning

could evaluate and select landing sites with explicit consideration of the
terrain features, quality of future observations, and control to achieve a safe

able to achieve 94.8 $\%$ of successful landing in highly challenging landing

of self-tracked health observations that can be leveraged for health-relevant
research. However, such data streams have questionable reliability since they
hinge on user adherence to the app. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to
separate true behavior from self-tracking artifacts. By taking a machine
learning approach to modeling self-tracked cycle lengths, we can both make more
informed predictions and learn the underlying structure of the observed data.
In this work, we propose and evaluate a hierarchical, generative model for
predicting next cycle length based on previously-tracked cycle lengths that
accounts explicitly for the possibility of users skipping tracking their
period. Our model offers several advantages: 1) accounting explicitly for
self-tracking artifacts yields better prediction accuracy as likelihood of
skipping increases; 2) because it is a generative model, predictions can be
updated online as a given cycle evolves, and we can gain interpretable insight
into how these predictions change over time; and 3) its hierarchical nature
enables modeling of an individual's cycle length history while incorporating
population-level information. Our experiments using mHealth cycle length data
encompassing over 186,000 menstruators with over 2 million natural menstrual
cycles show that our method yields state-of-the-art performance against neural
network-based and summary statistic-based baselines, while providing insights
on disentangling menstrual patterns from self-tracking artifacts. This work can
benefit users, mHealth app developers, and researchers in better understanding
cycle patterns and user adherence.

Because they grow from the same material, theory predicts that there should be
a relationship between their compositions. In this study, we search for a
compositional link between rocky exoplanets and their host stars. We estimate
the iron-mass fraction of rocky exoplanets from their masses and radii and
compare it with the compositions of their host stars, which we assume reflect
the compositions of the protoplanetary disks. We find a correlation (but not a
1:1 relationship) between these two quantities, with a slope of >4, which we
interpret as being attributable to planet formation processes. Super-Earths and
super-Mercuries appear to be distinct populations with differing compositions,
implying differences in their formation processes.

on the structure in which the moments rotate 90$^{\circ}$ from layer to layer
realized in the iron pnictide RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$. The spin-wave spectrum in
superconductors is strongly renormalized due to the long-range electromagnetic
interactions between the oscillating magnetic moments. This leads to strong
enhancement of the frequency of the mode coupled with uniform field and this
enhancement exists only within a narrow range of the c-axis wave vectors of the
order of the inverse London penetration depth. The key feature of materials
like RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$ is that this uniform mode corresponds to the maximum
frequency of the spin-wave spectrum with respect to c-axis wave vector. As a
consequence, the high-frequency surface resistance acquires a very distinct
asymmetric feature spreading between the bare and renormalized frequencies. We
also consider excitation of spin waves with Josephson effect in a tunneling
contact between helical-magnetic and conventional superconductors and study the
interplay between the spin-wave features and geometrical cavity resonances in

designing dispersionless wave excitations and have become a versatile platform
to study various aspects of interacting many-body systems. Their essential
merit lies in hosting compactly localized eigenstates which originate from
destructive interference induced by the lattice geometry, in turn often based
on symmetry principles. We here show that flat bands can be generated from a
hidden symmetry of the lattice unit cell, revealed as a permutation symmetry
upon reduction of the cell over two sites governed by an effective dimer
Hamiltonian. This so-called latent symmetry is intimately connected to a
symmetry between possible walks of a particle along the cell sites, starting
and ending on each of the effective dimer sites. The summed amplitudes of any
eigenstate with odd parity on the effective dimer sites vanish on special site
subsets called walk multiplets. We exploit this to construct flat bands by
using a latently symmetric unit cell coupled into a lattice via walk multiplet
interconnections. We demonstrate that the resulting flat bands are tunable by
different parametrizations of the lattice Hamiltonian matrix elements which
preserve the latent symmetry. The developed framework may offer fruitful
perspectives to analyze and design flat band structures.

in perturbative quantum field theory is based on a Hopf algebra of Feynman

Consequently, one might suspect that non-local field theories such as matrix or

Here I show that, on the contrary, the renormalization and perturbative
diagramatics of a broad class of such field theories is based in the same way
on a Hopf algebra. These theories are characterized by interaction vertices
with graphs as external structure leading to Feynman diagrams which can be
summed up under the concept of ""2-graphs"". From the renormalization
perspective, such graph-like interactions are as much local as point-like
interactions. They differ in combinatorial details as I exemplify with the
central identity for the perturbative series of combinatorial correlation
functions. This sets the stage for a systematic study of perturbative

equations, for a number of combinatorially non-local field theories with

constructing fit formulae and quantifying the scatter of the data points from
those relations. Furthermore, we compare how individual data points deviate
from the corresponding fit to all data points. Considering this point-to-point
scatter we uncover a striking similarity between the frequency deviations of
perturbative data for isolated NSs and of oscillation frequencies of rapidly
rotating, hot, massive merger remnants. The correspondence of frequency
deviations in these very different stellar systems points to an underlying
mechanism and EoS information being encoded in the frequency deviation. We
trace the frequency scatter back to deviations of the tidal Love number from an
average tidal Love number for a given stellar compactness. Our results thus
indicate a possibility to break the degeneracy between NS radii, tidal
deformability and tidal Love number. We also relate frequency deviations to the
derivative of the tidal deformability with respect to mass. Our findings
generally highlight a possibility to improve GW asteroseismology relations
where the systematic behavior of frequency deviations is employed to reduce the
scatter in such relationships and consequently increase the measurement
accuracy. In addition, we relate the f-mode frequency of static stars and the
dominant GW frequency of merger remnants. We find an analytic mapping to

that asymptotic properties of an estimator follow directly from the convergence
of the random field if a large deviation estimate exists. The quasi-likelihood
analysis (QLA) proved a polynomial type large deviation (PLD) inequality to go
through a bottleneck of the program. A conclusion of the QLA is that if the
quasi-likelihood random field is asymptotically quadratic and if a key index
reflecting identifiability the random field has is non-degenerate, then the PLD
inequality is always valid, and as a result, the IHK program can run. Many

colored with $\mbox{polylog}(n)$ colors. In the past 60 years, this coloring
question was extensively studied for several special instances of semilinear
graphs, e.g. shift graphs, intersection and disjointness graphs of certain
geometric objects, and overlap graphs. Our main result provides a general upper
bound on the chromatic number of all such, seemingly unrelated, graphs.
  Furthermore, we consider the symmetric Ramsey problem for semilinear graphs
as well. It is known that if there exists an intersection graph of $N$ boxes in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (such graphs are semilinear of complexity $2d$) that contains
no clique or independent set of size $n$, then $N=O_d(n^2(\log n)^{d-1})$. That
is, the exponent of $n$ does not grow with the dimension. We prove a result
about the symmetric Ramsey properties of semilinear graphs, which puts this
phenomenon in a more general context.

mitigate the otherwise exponential increase of the magnetic field. Comparison
simulations of an initial Fishbone-Moncrief torus suggest that reconnection may
provide another quenching mechanism. The dynamo-generated magnetic flux expands
from the disk interior into the disk corona, becomes advected by disk
accretion, and fills the axial region of the domain. The dynamo leads to an
initially rapid increase in magnetic energy and flux, while for later
evolutionary stages the growth stabilizes. Accretion towards the black hole
depends strongly on the magnetic field structure that develops. The radial
field component supports extraction of angular momentum and thus accretion. It
also sets the conditions for launching a disk wind, initially from inner disk
area. When a strong field has engulfed the disk, strong winds are launched that
are predominantly driven by the pressure gradient of the toroidal field. For
rotating black holes we identify a Poynting flux-dominated jet, driven by the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This axial Poynting flux is advected from the disk

characterization of these exoplanetary systems depends critically on the
history of high-energy stellar radiation from X-rays to NUV, which drive
atmospheric mass loss and photochemistry in the planetary atmospheres. With the
Far Ultraviolet M-dwarf Evolution Survey (FUMES) we have assessed the evolution
of the FUV radiation, specifically 8 prominent emission lines, including
Ly$\alpha$, of M-dwarf stars with stellar rotation period and age. We
demonstrate tight power-law correlations between the spectroscopic FUV
features, and measure the intrinsic scatter of the quiescent FUV emissions. The
luminosity evolution with rotation of these spectroscopic features is well
described by a broken power-law, saturated for fast rotators, and decaying with
increasing Rossby number, with a typical power-law slope of $-2$, although
likely shallower for Ly$\alpha$. Our regression fits enable FUV emission line
luminosity estimates relative to bolometric from known rotation periods to
within $\sim$0.3 dex, across 8 distinct UV emission lines, with possible trends
in the fit parameters as a function of source layer in the stellar atmosphere.
Our detailed analysis of the UV luminosity evolution with age further shows
that habitable zone planets orbiting lower-mass stars experience much greater
high-energy radiative exposure relative the same planets orbiting more massive
hosts. Around early-to-mid M-dwarfs these exoplanets, at field ages, accumulate
up to 10-20$\times$ more EUV energy relative to modern Earth. Moreover, the
bulk of this UV exposure likely takes place within the first Gyr of the stellar

Looking at the Distant Universe with the MeerKAT Array (LADUMA), a
single-pointing deep-field survey reaching redshift $z_\mathrm{HI}=1.45$, as
well as potential future surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) that
would observe large portions of the sky out to redshift $z_\mathrm{HI}=1.37$.
We predict that LADUMA will potentially double the number of known OHMs,
creating an expected contamination of 1.0% of the survey's $\mathrm{HI}$
sample. Future SKA $\mathrm{HI}$ surveys are expected to see up to 7.2% OH
contamination. To mitigate this contamination, we present methods to
distinguish $\mathrm{HI}$ and OHM host populations without spectroscopic
redshifts using near- to mid-IR photometry and a k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
Using our methods, nearly 99% of OHMs out to redshift $z_\mathrm{OH} \sim 1.0$
can be correctly identified. At redshifts out to $z_\mathrm{OH}\sim2.0$, 97% of
OHMs can be identified. The discovery of these high-redshift OHMs will be
valuable for understanding the connection between extreme star formation and

(GR), in which oscillatory gravitational-wave (GW) signals are generically
accompanied by a monotonically-increasing strain which persists in the detector
long after the signal has passed. This effect presents a unique opportunity to
test GR in the dynamical and nonlinear regime. In this article we calculate the
nonlinear memory signal associated with GW bursts from cusps and kinks on
cosmic string loops, which are an important target for current and future GW
observatories. We obtain analytical waveforms for the GW memory from cusps and
kinks, and use these to calculate the ""memory of the memory"" and other
higher-order memory effects. These are among the first memory observables
computed for a cosmological source of GWs, with previous literature having
focused almost entirely on astrophysical sources. Surprisingly, we find that
the cusp GW signal diverges for sufficiently large loops, and argue that the
most plausible explanation for this divergence is a breakdown in the weak-field
treatment of GW emission from the cusp. This shows that previously-neglected
strong gravity effects must play an important role near cusps, although the
exact mechanism by which they cure the divergence is not currently understood.
We show that one possible resolution is for these cusps to collapse to form
primordial black holes (PBHs); the kink memory signal does not diverge, in
agreement with the fact that kinks are not predicted to form PBHs. Finally, we
investigate the prospects for detecting memory from cusps and kinks with GW
observatories. We find that in the scenario where the cusp memory divergence is
cured by PBH formation, the memory signal is strongly suppressed and is not
likely to be detected. However, alternative resolutions of the cusp divergence
may in principle lead to much more favourable observational prospects.

first-order through its coupling to the Higgs boson, and it spontaneously
breaks CP invariance through a dimension-5 contribution to the top quark mass
term, generated by integrating out the heavy top quark partners. We improve on
previous studies by incorporating updated transport equations, compatible with
large bubble wall velocities. The wall speed and thickness are computed
directly from the microphysical parameters rather than treating them as free
parameters, allowing for a first-principles computation of the baryon
asymmetry. The size of the CP-violating dimension-5 operator needed for EWBG is
constrained by collider, electroweak precision, and renormalization group
running constraints. We identify regions of parameter space that can produce
the observed baryon asymmetry or observable gravitational (GW) wave signals.
Contrary to standard lore, we find that for strong deflagrations, the
efficiencies of large baryon asymmetry production and strong GW signals can be
positively correlated. However we find the overall likelihood of observably
large GW signals to be smaller than estimated in previous studies. In

combines this connection with the detailed knowledge of the compactification

metric of such compactifications, as well as the rank-two Killing tensors can
be written in terms of bilinears of Killing vectors on the underlying ""round

Hamilton-Jacobi equation for consistent truncations. We introduce the idea of a
separating isometry and show that when a consistent truncation, without
reduction gauge vectors, has such an isometry, then the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation is always separable. When gauge vectors are present, the gauge group
is required to be an abelian subgroup of the separating isometry to not impede
separability. We classify the separating isometries for consistent truncations
on spheres, $S^n$, for $n=2, \dots, 7$, and exhibit all the corresponding
Killing tensors. These results may be of practical use in both identifying when
supergravity solutions belong to consistent truncations and generating

of $z_{\rm f}$ with $M_{\star}$. Interestingly, several low-mass galaxies with
have formation redshifts of $z_{\rm f}\approx5-8$. Star-forming galaxies evolve
about the star-forming main sequence, crossing the ridgeline several times in
their past. Quiescent galaxies show a wide range and continuous distribution of

and N-body simulations, to represent two distinct formation channels: BBHs
formed in the field (isolated channel) and in young star clusters (dynamical
channel). We then use a Bayesian hierarchical approach to infer the
distribution of the mixing fraction $f$, with $f=0$ ($f=1$) in the pure
dynamical (isolated) channel. %that controls the proportion of isolated and
dynamical BBHs. We explore the effects of additional hyper-parameters of the
model, such as the spread in metallicity $\sigma_{\text{Z}}$ and the parameter
$\sigma_{\text{sp}}$, describing the distribution of spin magnitudes. We find
that the dynamical model is slightly favoured with a median value of $f=0.26$,
when $\sigma_{\text{sp}}=0.1$ and $\sigma_{\text{Z}}=0.4$. Models with higher
spin magnitudes tend to strongly favour dynamically formed BBHs ($f\le{}0.1$ if
$\sigma_{\text{sp}}=0.3$). Furthermore, we show that hyper-parameters
controlling the rates of the model, such as $\sigma_{\rm Z}$, have a large
impact on the inference of the mixing fraction, which rises from $0.18$ to
$0.43$ when we increase $\sigma_{\text{Z}}$ from 0.2 to 0.6, for a fixed value

$\varepsilon$ represent the mass-energy fraction transferred to the massless

this 2-body decaying DM scenario, discussing in detail its dynamics and its
impact on the CMB and linear matter power spectra. We then investigate the

analysis: different $S_8$ priors, marginalization over the lensing information
in Planck data, trading Planck high$-\ell$ polarization data for those from the
SPTpol and ACTPol surveys, and the inclusion of the recent results from the

apparent only when the $S_8$ value determined from weak lensing data is added
to the analysis, does not sensibly degrade the fit to any of the cosmological
data-sets considered, and that the model could potentially explain the
anomalous electron recoil excess reported by the Xenon1T collaboration.
Furthermore, we explictly show that while current CMB data alone are not

next-generation CMB observations (CMB-S4) can unambiguously detect its

Using zoom-in resimulations of 324 massive galaxy clusters and their outskirts
from The ThreeHundred project, we test methods typically applied to large-scale
spectroscopic data sets. This paper describes our investigation of whether a
statistical compression of the FoG of cluster centres and galaxy groups can
lead to correct filament extractions in the cluster outskirts. We find that
within 5 R200 (~15 Mpc/h) statistically correcting for FoG elongations of
virialized regions does not achieve reliable filament networks compared to
reference filament networks based on true positions. This is due to the complex
flowing motions of galaxies towards filaments in addition to the cluster
infall, which overwhelm the signal of the filaments relative to the volume we
probe. While information from spectroscopic redshifts is still important to
isolate the cluster regions, and thereby reduce background and foreground
interlopers, we expect future spectroscopic surveys of galaxy cluster outskirts
to rely on 2D positions of galaxies to extract cosmic filaments.

In such systems, the breaking of time reversal due to magnetic moments gives

topological superconductors. However, in unconventional superconductors even
non-magnetic impurities induce in-gap states since scattering of Cooper pairs
changes their momentum but not their phase. Here, we propose a path for
creating topological superconductivity, which is based on an unconventional
superconductor with a chain of non-magnetic adatoms on its surface. The
topological phase can be reached by tuning the magnitude and direction of a
Zeeman field, such that Majorana zero modes at its boundary can be generated,
moved and fused. To demonstrate the feasibility of this platform, we develop a
general mapping of films with adatom chains to one-dimensional lattice
Hamiltonians. This allows us to study unconventional superconductors such as
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibiting multiple bands and an anisotropic order parameter.

far-UV spectra of M dwarf stars, but strong absorption from neutral hydrogen in
the interstellar medium makes observing Ly$\alpha$ challenging even for the
closest stars. As part of the Far-Ultraviolet M-dwarf Evolution Survey (FUMES),
the Hubble Space Telescope has observed 10 early-to-mid M dwarfs with ages
ranging from $\sim$24 Myr to several Gyrs to evaluate how the incident UV
radiation evolves through the lifetime of exoplanetary systems. We reconstruct
the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles from STIS G140L and E140M spectra and achieve
reconstructed fluxes with 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties ranging from 5% to a factor
of two for the low resolution spectra (G140L) and 3-20% for the high resolution
spectra (E140M). We observe broad, 500-1000 km s$^{-1}$ wings of the Ly$\alpha$
line profile, and analyze how the line width depends on stellar properties. We
find that stellar effective temperature and surface gravity are the dominant
factors influencing the line width with little impact from the star's magnetic
activity level, and that the surface flux density of the Ly$\alpha$ wings may
be used to estimate the chromospheric electron density. The Ly$\alpha$
reconstructions on the G140L spectra are the first attempted on
$\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim$1000 data. We find that the reconstruction precision
is not correlated with SNR of the observation, rather, it depends on the
intrinsic broadness of the stellar Ly$\alpha$ line. Young, low-gravity stars
have the broadest lines and therefore provide more information at low spectral
resolution to the fit to break degeneracies among model parameters.

change from normal lungs, making it difficult to build a mechanical model. The
purpose of this study is to develop a deformation estimation method of the 3D
surface of a deflated lung from a few partial observations. To estimate
deformations for a largely deformed lung, a kernel regression-based solution
was introduced. The proposed method used a few landmarks to capture the partial
deformation between the 3D surface mesh obtained from preoperative CT and the
intraoperative anatomical positions. The deformation for each vertex of the
entire mesh model was estimated per-vertex as a relative position from the
landmarks. The landmarks were placed in the anatomical position of the lung's
outer contour. The method was applied on nine datasets of the left lungs of
live Beagle dogs. Contrast-enhanced CT images of the lungs were acquired. The
proposed method achieved a local positional error of vertices of 2.74 mm,
Hausdorff distance of 6.11 mm, and Dice similarity coefficient of 0.94.
Moreover, the proposed method could estimate lung deformations from a small
number of training cases and a small observation area. This study contributes
to the data-driven modeling of pneumothorax deformation of the lung.

that incorporates the uncertainties in the redshift measurements for both the
SMGs and cross-correlated galaxies through sampling their full probability
distribution functions. By measuring the absolute linear bias of the SMGs we
derive halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo}[{h^{-1}\,\rm

redshift, contrary to some previous work. From considering models of halo mass
growth rates we predict that the SMGs will reside in haloes of mass
$\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo}[{h^{-1}\,\rm M_{\odot}}])\sim13.2$ at $z=0$, consistent
with the expectation that the majority of $z=1.5-3$ SMGs will evolve into
present-day spheroidal galaxies. Finally, comparing to models of
stellar-to-halo mass ratios, we show that SMGs may correspond to systems that
are maximally efficient at converting their gas reservoirs into stars. We
compare them to a simple model for gas cooling in halos that suggests that the
unique properties of the SMG population, including their high levels of
star-formation and their redshift distribution, are a result of the SMGs being
the most massive galaxies that are still able to accrete cool gas from their

and attach the object are not considered. Additionally, most of the approaches
assume cables as rigid links, but manipulating cables requires considering the
state when the cables are hanging. In this work, we design and control a
catenary robot. Our robot is able to transport hook-shaped objects in the
environment. The robotic system is composed of two quadrotors attached to the
two ends of a cable. By defining the catenary curve with five degrees of
freedom, position in 3-D, orientation in the z-axis, and span, we can drive the
two quadrotors to track a given trajectory. We validate our approach with
simulations and real robots. We present four different scenarios of
experiments. Our numerical solution is computationally fast and can be executed
in real-time.

the brain and its efferent projections innervate many brain regions, including
the thalamus. LC degrades with normal aging, but not much is known regarding

cognition. Methods: Here, we use high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI)-based tractography to examine structural connectivity between LC and the
thalamus in younger and older adults. Results: We found LC projections to be
bundled in a fiber tract anatomically consistent with the central tegmental
tract (CTT) and branch from this tract into the thalamus. The older cohort
exhibited a significant reduction in mean and radial diffusivity within CTT as
compared to the young cohort. We also observed a significant correlation
between CTT mean, axial, and radial diffusivities and memory performance
(delayed recall) in the older adult cohort. Discussion: These observations
suggest that although LC projections degrade with age, the degree of
degradation is associated with cognitive abilities in older adults.

magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) that measures diffusion signals on a sphere

leverages relevant historical dMRI data to calculate a prior distribution to
characterize local diffusion variability in each voxel in a template space. For
a new subject to be scanned, the priors are mapped into the subject-specific

demonstrate big advantages over the existing HARDI sampling and analysis

indicate that with very few q-space samples (e.g., 15 or 20), we can recover

becoming arbitrarily large at ultra-relativistic temperatures. Additionally, we

The effect of the black hole spin becomes more significant as the gas

of 10 per cent in the mass accretion rate for a maximally rotating black hole

SALSA starts with small counters, and overflowing counters simply merge with
their neighbors. SALSA can thereby allow more counters for a given space,
expanding them as necessary to represent large numbers. Our evaluation

were sonicated with 25 MHz 30 cycle pulses with pressure amplitudes between

Experimental observations reveal the generation of period 2(P2), P3, and two
different P4 oscillations at low excitation amplitude. Despite the reduced
damping of the uncoated bubble system, such enhanced nonlinear oscillations has
not been observed and can not be theoretically explained for the uncoated
bubble. To investigate the mechanism of the enhanced nonlinearity, the
bifurcation structure of the lipid coated MBs is studied for a wide range of
MBs sizes and shell parameters. Consistent with the experimental results, we
show that this unique oscillator can exhibit chaotic oscillations and higher
order subharmonics at excitation amplitudes considerably below those predicted

second-generation dust. While it remains unclear whether this ever becomes a
major component of the total dust content, the presence of such dust, and
potentially the substructure within, it can be used to explore a disc's
physical conditions. A perturbing planet produces nonaxisymmetric structures
and gaps in the dust, regardless of its origin. The dynamics of planetesimals,
however, will be very different than that of small dust grains due to weaker
gas interactions. Therefore, planetesimal collisions could create dusty disc
structures that would not exist otherwise. In this work, we use N-body
simulations to investigate the collision rate profile of planetesimals near
mean-motion resonances. We find that a distinct bump or dip feature is produced
in the collision profile, the presence of which depends on the libration width
of the resonance and the separation between the peri- and apocenter distances
of the edges of the resonance. The presence of one of these two features
depends on the mass and eccentricity of the planet. Assuming that the radial
dust emission traces the planetesimal collision profile, the presence of a bump
or dip feature in the dust emission at the 2:1 mean-motion resonance can
constrain the orbital properties of the perturbing planet. This assumption is
valid, so long as radial drift does not play a significant role during the
collisional cascade process. Under this assumption, these features in the dust
emission should be marginally observable in nearby protoplanetary disks with

calculation is reliable in both on-shell and off-shell regions, thereby
providing the first prediction of the mixed QCD-EW corrections in the entire
region of the lepton transverse momentum. The computed corrections are in
qualitative agreement with what we obtain in a factorised approach of QCD and
EW corrections. At large values of the lepton $p_T$, the mixed QCD-EW

the next-to-leading order QCD result at $p_T=500\,$GeV.

(VPP) is a non-linear variant of transmit-side channel inversion that perturbs
user data to achieve full diversity order. While promising, finding an optimal
perturbation in VPP is known to be an NP-hard problem, demanding heavy
computational support at the base station and limiting the feasibility of the
approach to small MIMO systems. This work proposes a radically different

design reduces VPP to a quadratic polynomial form amenable to QA, then refines
the problem coefficients to mitigate the adverse effects of QA hardware noise.
We evaluate our proposed QA based VPP (QAVP) technique on a real Quantum
Annealing device over a variety of design and machine parameter settings. With
existing hardware, QAVP can achieve a BER of $10^{-4}$ with 100$\mu$s compute

specifies the minimum amount of classical communication needed to perfectly
simulate a channel's input-output correlations when unlimited shared randomness
is held between encoder and decoder. This paper provides a collection of
device-independent tests that place lower and upper bounds on the signaling

with simulated and real data that both the random forest steps reduces test-set

individuals dominate team communication during global software development. It
is not known, however, how these members' contributions affect their teams'
knowledge diffusion process, or whether their personality profiles are
responsible for their dominant presence. Objective: We set out to address this
gap through the study of repository artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams
were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We employed social network
analysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and
Others, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement
in task changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used
to study practitioners' importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we
performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic
dimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality
profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top
Members occupied critical roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more
openness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality profiles
were represented during teamwork, although openness to experience,
agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific
personality predicted members' involvement in knowledge diffusion. Conclusion:
Task assignment that promotes highly connected team communication networks may
mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global software teams. Additionally, while
members expressing openness to experience are likely to be particularly driven
to perform, this is not entirely responsible for a global team's success.

uncertainties of dose-related quantities and leveraging this information in a
dose mimicking problem in the context of automated radiation therapy treatment
planning.
  Methods: A three-step pipeline, comprising feature extraction, dose statistic
prediction and dose mimicking, is employed. In particular, the features are
produced by a convolutional variational autoencoder and used as inputs in a
previously developed nonparametric Bayesian statistical method, estimating the
multivariate predictive distribution of a collection of predefined dose
statistics. Specially developed objective functions are then used to construct
a probabilistic dose mimicking problem based on the produced distributions,
creating deliverable treatment plans.
  Results: The numerical experiments are performed using a dataset of 94
retrospective treatment plans of prostate cancer patients. We show that the
features extracted by the variational autoencoder capture geometric information
of substantial relevance to the dose statistic prediction problem and are
related to dose statistics in a more regularized fashion than hand-crafted
features. The estimated predictive distributions are reasonable and outperforms
a non-input-dependent benchmark method, and the deliverable plans produced by
the probabilistic dose mimicking agree better with their clinical counterparts
than for a non-probabilistic formulation.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that prediction of dose-related quantities may be
extended to include uncertainty estimation and that such probabilistic
information may be leveraged in a dose mimicking problem. The treatment plans
produced by the proposed pipeline resemble their original counterparts well,
illustrating the merits of a holistic approach to automated planning based on
probabilistic modeling.

time series whose state process is unknown at all time-steps. Sometimes, time
series are firstly labelled thanks to some annotation function. Thus, another
category of models handles the case with regimes observed at all time-steps. We
present a novel model which addresses the intermediate case: (i) state
processes associated to such time series are modelled by Partially Hidden
Markov Chains (PHMCs); (ii) a linear autoregressive (LAR) model drives the
dynamics of the time series, within each regime. We describe a variant of the

propose a hidden state inference procedure and a forecasting function that take
into account the observed states when existing. We assess inference and

using simulated data. We show the benefits of using partially observed states
to decrease EM convergence times. A fully labelled scheme with unreliable
labels also speeds up EM. This offers promising prospects to enhance PHMC-LAR
model selection. We also point out the robustness of PHMC-LAR to labelling

learning provides model-agnostic control solutions but in general, it lacks the
theoretical guarantees required for safety. Recent advances show that under

safety to learning safely, there are two hurdles that need to be overcome: (i)
it has to be possible to learn the policy without having to re-initialize the

achieving high accuracy across a variety of machine learning tasks, fair ERM is
hindered by the incompatibility of fairness constraints with stochastic
optimization. We consider the problem of fair classification with discrete
sensitive attributes and potentially large models and data sets, requiring
stochastic solvers. Existing in-processing fairness algorithms are either
impractical in the large-scale setting because they require large batches of
data at each iteration or they are not guaranteed to converge. In this paper,
we develop the first stochastic in-processing fairness algorithm with
guaranteed convergence. For demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal
opportunity notions of fairness, we provide slight variations of our
algorithm--called FERMI--and prove that each of these variations converges in
stochastic optimization with any batch size. Empirically, we show that FERMI is
amenable to stochastic solvers with multiple (non-binary) sensitive attributes
and non-binary targets, performing well even with minibatch size as small as
one. Extensive experiments show that FERMI achieves the most favorable
tradeoffs between fairness violation and test accuracy across all tested setups
compared with state-of-the-art baselines for demographic parity, equalized
odds, equal opportunity. These benefits are especially significant with small
batch sizes and for non-binary classification with large number of sensitive
attributes, making FERMI a practical, scalable fairness algorithm. The code for
all of the experiments in this paper is available at:

Hershberger and Suri [SIAM J. Comput. 1999] gave an algorithm of $O(n\log n)$
time and $O(n\log n)$ space, where $n$ is the total number of vertices of all
obstacles. Recently, by modifying Hershberger and Suri's algorithm, Wang [SODA

$O(n\log n)$. In this paper, we present a new algorithm of $O(n+h\log h)$ time
and $O(n)$ space, provided that a triangulation of the free space is given,
where $h$ is the number of obstacles. The algorithm, which improves the
previous work when $h=o(n)$, is optimal in both time and space as
$\Omega(n+h\log h)$ is a lower bound on the runtime. Our algorithm builds a
shortest path map for a source point $s$, so that given any query point $t$,
the shortest path length from $s$ to $t$ can be computed in $O(\log n)$ time
and a shortest $s$-$t$ path can be produced in additional time linear in the
number of edges of the path.

comparison of observed phenomena to the predictions provided by null models:
when we find an interesting structure in a family of real networks, it is
important to ask whether this structure is also likely to arise in random
networks with similar characteristics to the real ones. A long-standing
challenge in network analysis has been the relative scarcity of reasonable null
models for networks; arguably the most common such model has been the
configuration model, which starts with a graph $G$ and produces a random graph
with the same node degrees as $G$. This leads to a very weak form of null
model, since fixing the node degrees does not preserve many of the crucial
properties of the network, including the structure of its subgraphs.
  Guided by this challenge, we propose a new family of network null models that
operate on the $k$-core decomposition. For a graph $G$, the $k$-core is its
maximal subgraph of minimum degree $k$; and the core number of a node $v$ in
$G$ is the largest $k$ such that $v$ belongs to the $k$-core of $G$. We provide
the first efficient sampling algorithm to solve the following basic
combinatorial problem: given a graph $G$, produce a random graph sampled nearly
uniformly from among all graphs with the same sequence of core numbers as $G$.
This opens the opportunity to compare observed networks $G$ with random graphs
that exhibit the same core numbers, a comparison that preserves aspects of the
structure of $G$ that are not captured by more local measures like the degree
sequence. We illustrate the power of this core-based null model on some
fundamental tasks in network analysis, including the enumeration of networks
motifs.

significantly by exploring the semantic information. In this paper, we make an
effort to recover the transmitted speech signals in the semantic communication
systems, which minimizes the error at the semantic level rather than the bit or
symbol level. Particularly, we design a deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic
communication system for speech signals, named DeepSC-S. In order to improve
the recovery accuracy of speech signals, especially for the essential
information, DeepSC-S is developed based on an attention mechanism by utilizing
a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) network. The motivation behind the attention
mechanism is to identify the essential speech information by providing higher
weights to them when training the neural network. Moreover, in order to
facilitate the proposed DeepSC-S for dynamic channel environments, we find a
general model to cope with various channel conditions without retraining.
Furthermore, we investigate DeepSC-S in telephone systems as well as multimedia
transmission systems to verify the model adaptation in practice. The simulation
results demonstrate that our proposed DeepSC-S outperforms the traditional
communications in both cases in terms of the speech signals metrics, such as
signal-to-distortion ration and perceptual evaluation of speech distortion.
Besides, DeepSC-S is more robust to channel variations, especially in the low
signal-to-noise (SNR) regime.

series that are hierarchically related via aggregation or disaggregation
operations. For instance, commercial organizations often want to forecast
inventories simultaneously at store, city, and state levels for resource
planning purposes. In such applications, it is important that the forecasts, in
addition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another.
Although forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by
economists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art models use strong
assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution
being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power
of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In this
paper, we propose using a flexible nonlinear model that optimizes quantile
regression loss coupled with suitable regularization terms to maintain the
consistency of forecasts across hierarchies. The theoretical framework
introduced herein can be applied to any forecasting model with an underlying
differentiable loss function. A proof of optimality of our proposed method is
also provided. Simulation studies over a range of datasets highlight the

achieve decent embedding rate, the payloads of the existing vacating room after
encryption (VRAE) based schemes are relatively low. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a generalized framework for high-capacity RDHEI for both VRBE
and VRAE cases. First, an efficient embedding room generation algorithm (ERGA)
is designed to produce large embedding room by using pixel prediction and
entropy encoding. Then, we propose two RDHEI schemes, one for VRBE, another for
VRAE. In the VRBE scenario, the image owner generates the embedding room with
ERGA and encrypts the preprocessed image by using the stream cipher with two
encryption keys. Then, the data hider locates the embedding room and embeds the
encrypted additional data. In the VRAE scenario, the cover image is encrypted
by an improved block modulation and permutation encryption algorithm, where the
spatial redundancy in the plain-text image is largely preserved. Then, the data
hider applies ERGA on the encrypted image to generate the embedding room and
conducts data embedding. For both schemes, the receivers with different
authentication keys can respectively conduct error-free data extraction and/or
error-free image recovery. The experimental results show that the two proposed
schemes outperform many state-of-the-art RDHEI arts. Besides, the schemes can
ensure high security level, where the original image can be hardly discovered
from the encrypted version before and after data hiding by the unauthorized
user.

us the underlying hydrodynamic picture in a generalized Gibbs ensemble with a
definite temperature that depends on the driving parameter and initial

growth of kinetic energy, can sharply localize the correlation at the

non-localize structure of correlation to the crossover regime, connecting the
prethermal phase to the heating phase, where the kinetic energy displays
complicated growth structure. We understand these numerical findings using the
notion of relative phase matching where prethermal phase (heating regime)

their outcomes into an end-to-end automatic speech recognition system to

capacity of the binary-input discrete memoryless channels with efficient
encoding and decoding algorithms. But the weight spectrum of Polar codes is
relatively poor compared to RM codes, which degrades their ML performance.
Pre-transformation with an upper-triangular matrix (including cyclic redundancy
check (CRC), parity-check (PC) and polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
codes), improves weight spectrum while retaining polarization. In this paper,
the weight spectrum of upper-triangular pre-transformed Polar Codes is

low-weight codewords due to their impact on error-correction performance.
Simulation results verify the accuracy of the analysis.

Moreover, the RNN activity resembles spatial information and

simulated galaxies using the Dusty SAGE semi-analytic model. In addition to
tracing the standard galaxy properties, Dusty SAGE also tracks cold dust mass
in the interstellar medium (ISM), hot dust mass in the halo and dust mass
ejected by feedback activity. Based on their ISM dust content, we divide our
galaxies into two categories: ISM dust-poor and ISM dust-rich. We split the ISM
dust-poor group into two subgroups: halo dust-rich and dust-poor (the latter
contains galaxies that lack dust in both the ISM and halo). Halo dust-rich
galaxies have high outflow rates of heated gas and dust and are more massive.
We divide ISM dust-rich galaxies based on their specific star formation rate
(sSFR) into star-forming and quenched subgroups. At redshift z=0, we find that
ISM dust-rich galaxies have a relatively high sSFR, low bulge-to-total (BTT)
mass ratio, and high gas metallicity. The high sSFR of ISM dust-rich galaxies
allows them to produce dust in the stellar ejecta. Their metal-rich ISM enables
dust growth via grain accretion. The opposite is seen in the ISM dust-poor
group. Furthermore, ISM dust-rich galaxies are typically late-types, while ISM
dust-poor galaxies resemble the early-type population, and we show how their
ISM content evolves from being dust-rich to dust-poor. Finally, we investigate
dust production from z=3 to z=0 and find that all groups evolve similarly,
except for the quenched ISM dust-rich group.

formula under the assumption that the initial state has a high overlap with an
energy eigenstate, or a collection of eigenstates in a narrow energy band. This
assumption is motivated by quantum phase estimation (QPE) and digital adiabatic
simulation (DAS). Treating the effective Hamiltonian that generates the
Trotterized time evolution using rigorous perturbative methods, we show that
the Trotter step size needed to estimate an energy eigenvalue within precision
$\epsilon$ using QPE can be improved in scaling from $\epsilon$ to
$\epsilon^{1/2}$ for a large class of systems (including any Hamiltonian which
can be decomposed as a sum of local terms or commuting layers that each have
real-valued matrix elements). For DAS we improve the asymptotic scaling of the
Trotter error with the total number of gates $M$ from $\mathcal{O}(M^{-1})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(M^{-2})$, and for any fixed circuit depth we calculate an
approximately optimal step size that balances the error contributions from
Trotterization and the adiabatic approximation. These results partially
generalize to diabatic processes, which remain in a narrow energy band
separated from the rest of the spectrum by a gap, thereby contributing to the
explanation of the observed similarities between the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm and diabatic quantum annealing at small system sizes.
Our analysis depends on the perturbation of eigenvectors as well as
eigenvalues, and on quantifying the error using state fidelity (instead of the
matrix norm of the difference of unitaries which is sensitive to an overall
global phase).

arises from the fact that the global parameter that controls the mixture of
local losses can only be updated infrequently on the global stage. To
compensate for this, we propose a Distributionally Robust Federated Averaging
(DRFA) algorithm that employs a novel snapshotting scheme to approximate the
accumulation of history gradients of the mixing parameter. We analyze the
convergence rate of DRFA in both convex-linear and nonconvex-linear settings.
We also generalize the proposed idea to objectives with regularization on the
mixture parameter and propose a proximal variant, dubbed as DRFA-Prox, with
provable convergence rates. We also analyze an alternative optimization method
for regularized cases in strongly-convex-strongly-concave and non-convex (under
PL condition)-strongly-concave settings. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first to solve distributionally robust federated learning with
reduced communication, and to analyze the efficiency of local descent methods
on distributed minimax problems. We give corroborating experimental evidence

convection and diffusion can significantly affect the flow patterns in the

governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. Coaxing them into a quantum state
is, however, difficult: the thermal environment masks any quantum signature of
the object's motion. Indeed, the thermal environment also masks effects of
proposed modifications of quantum mechanics at large mass scales. We prepare
the center-of-mass motion of a 10 kg mechanical oscillator in a state with an
average phonon occupation of 10.8. The reduction in temperature, from room
temperature to 77 nK, is commensurate with an 11 orders-of-magnitude
suppression of quantum back-action by feedback -- and a 13 orders-of-magnitude
increase in the mass of an object prepared close to its motional ground state.
This begets the possibility of probing gravity on massive quantum systems.

a single structural break in factor loadings at a common unknown date. First,
we propose a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator of the change point based
on the second moments of factors, which are estimated by principal component
analysis. We show that the QML estimator performs consistently when the
covariance matrix of the pre- or post-break factor loading, or both, is
singular. When the loading matrix undergoes a rotational type of change while
the number of factors remains constant over time, the QML estimator incurs a
stochastically bounded estimation error. In this case, we establish an
asymptotic distribution of the QML estimator. The simulation results validate
the feasibility of this estimator when used in finite samples. In addition, we
demonstrate empirical applications of the proposed method by applying it to
estimate the break points in a U.S. macroeconomic dataset and a stock return

for ergodic systems that demand efficient simulation of both short-time
dynamics and large-time statistics. However, locally Lipschitz SDEs often
require special treatments such as implicit schemes with small time-steps to
accurately simulate the ergodic measure. We introduce a framework to construct
inference-based schemes adaptive to large time-steps (ISALT) from data,
achieving a reduction in time by several orders of magnitudes. The key is the
statistical learning of an approximation to the infinite-dimensional
discrete-time flow map. We explore the use of numerical schemes (such as the
Euler-Maruyama, a hybrid RK4, and an implicit scheme) to derive informed basis
functions, leading to a parameter inference problem. We introduce a scalable
algorithm to estimate the parameters by least squares, and we prove the
convergence of the estimators as data size increases.
  We test the ISALT on three non-globally Lipschitz SDEs: the 1D double-well
potential, a 2D multi-scale gradient system, and the 3D stochastic Lorenz
equation with degenerate noise. Numerical results show that ISALT can tolerate
time-step magnitudes larger than plain numerical schemes. It reaches optimal
accuracy in reproducing the invariant measure when the time-step is
medium-large.

use case in Beyond 5G networks and future massive Internet of Things (IoT).
However, for the massive multiple access in mMTC, there is a serious access
preamble collision problem if the conventional 4-step random access (RA) scheme
is employed. Consequently, a range of grantfree (GF) RA schemes were proposed.
Nevertheless, if the number of cellular users (devices) significantly
increases, both the energy and spectrum efficiency of the existing GF schemes
still rapidly degrade owing to the much longer preambles required. In order to
overcome this dilemma, a layered grouping strategy is proposed, where the
cellular users are firstly divided into clusters based on their geographical
locations, and then the users of the same cluster autonomously join in
different groups by using optimum energy consumption (Opt-EC) based K-means
algorithm. With this new layered cellular architecture, the RA process is
divided into cluster load estimation phase and active group detection phase.
Based on the state evolution theory of approximated message passing algorithm,
a tight lower bound on the minimum preamble length for achieving a certain
detection accuracy is derived. Benefiting from the cluster load estimation, a
dynamic preamble selection (DPS) strategy is invoked in the second phase,
resulting the required preambles with minimum length. As evidenced in our
simulation results, this two-phase DPS aided RA strategy results in a
significant performance improvement

by a plateau at higher temperatures (T> 200K). Application of a virtual crystal
phonon conduction model allows us to elucidate the effects of boundary and
alloy scattering on the observed thermal conductivity behaviors. We further
demonstrate that the alloy scattering is caused mainly by strain-field
difference, and less by the atomic mass difference between ScN and AlN, which
is in contrast to the well-studied Al1-xGaxN and SixGe1-x alloy systems where
atomic mass difference dominates the alloy scattering. This work studies and
provides the quantitative knowledge for phonon scattering and the thermal

estimation of one-dimensional entropy from equiprobable random samples, and
compare it with the popular Bin-Counting (BC) method. In contrast to BC, which
uses equal-width bins with varying probability mass, the QS method uses
estimates of the quantiles that divide the support of the data generating
probability density function (pdf) into equal-probability-mass intervals.
Whereas BC requires optimal tuning of a bin-width hyper-parameter whose value
varies with sample size and shape of the pdf, QS requires specification of the
number of quantiles to be used. Results indicate, for the class of
distributions tested, that the optimal number of quantile-spacings is a fixed
fraction of the sample size (empirically determined to be ~0.25-0.35), and that
this value is relatively insensitive to distributional form or sample size,
providing a clear advantage over BC since hyperparameter tuning is not
required. Bootstrapping is used to approximate the sampling variability
distribution of the resulting entropy estimate, and is shown to accurately
reflect the true uncertainty. For the four distributional forms studied
(Gaussian, Log-Normal, Exponential and Bimodal Gaussian Mixture), expected
estimation bias is less than 1% and uncertainty is relatively low even for very
small sample sizes. We speculate that estimating quantile locations, rather

a differentially private model degrades the utility drastically when the model

and a small-norm residual gradient. Then, GEP perturbs the low-dimensional
embedding and the residual gradient separately according to the privacy budget.
Such a decomposition permits a small perturbation variance, which greatly helps
to break the dimensional barrier of private learning. With GEP, we achieve
decent accuracy with reasonable computational cost and modest privacy guarantee
for deep models. Especially, with privacy bound $\epsilon=8$, we achieve
$74.9\%$ test accuracy on CIFAR10 and $95.1\%$ test accuracy on SVHN,

centralized protocol for resolving spatial conflicts between robots. Our
proposed framework ensures progress for all robots without a grid-like
discretization of the environment or strong requirements on robot
communication, coordination, or cooperation. Each robot can freely choose how
to plan and coordinate for itself, without being vulnerable to other robots or
groups of robots blocking them from their goals, as long as they follow the
rules when necessary. We describe our space partition and motion rules, prove
that the motion rules suffice to guarantee progress in partitioned
environments, and demonstrate several cases in simulated polygonal
environments. This work strikes a balance between each robot's planning
independence and a guarantee that each robot can always reach any goal in
finite time.

artificial intelligence research. We propose a local approach to identify
whether a variable is a cause of a given target under the framework of causal
graphical models of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In general, the causal
relation between two variables may not be identifiable from observational data
as many causal DAGs encoding different causal relations are Markov equivalent.
In this paper, we first introduce a sufficient and necessary graphical
condition to check the existence of a causal path from a variable to a target
in every Markov equivalent DAG. Next, we provide local criteria for identifying
whether a variable is a cause/non-cause of a target based only on the local
structure instead of the entire graph. Finally, we propose a local learning
algorithm for this causal query via learning the local structure of the
variable and some additional statistical independence tests related to the
target. Simulation studies show that our local algorithm is efficient and
effective, compared with other state-of-art methods.

applications in practice. In this study, possessing these two specified
radiative properties, pure Y2Ce2O7 is demonstrated with a performance of
passive radiative cooling. With a bandgap at 375.7 nm, the prepared Y2Ce2O7
shows a high solar reflectance of 91%, while with lattice strain and distortion
of various bonds (e.g., Y-O, Ce-O), it also shows a high emittance of 0.96 in
MIR band. More attracting, the aesthetics performance of Y2Ce2O7 can be
modified by doping Fe3+ ions to change its color from ivory white to light
yellow or red with high NIR reflection and MIR emission, indicating that the
Y2Ce2-xFexO7 shows a better cooling performance than a common paint with a
similar color. According to the field demonstration of cooling performance at
noon time, the Y2Ce2O7 and Y2Ce1.9Fe0.1O7 paints are 2.2 K and 1.8 K lower than
the common white and umber paints, respectively, while at night, all paints are
2.3 K lower than the ambient air. If applied on the envelop of a building, the
simulation shows that the Y2Ce2O7 and Y2Ce1.9Fe0.1O7 paints save 54.45% and
21.14% energy consumption compared with a common white and umber paints,

of European financial derivatives. This option pricing approach is consistent
with global trading strategies by setting the premium as the value such that
the residual hedging risk of the long and short positions in the option are
equal under optimal hedging. The ERP setup of Marzban et al. (2020) is
considered where residual hedging risk is quantified with convex risk measures.
The main objective of this paper is to assess through extensive numerical
experiments the impact of including options as hedging instruments within the
ERP framework. The reinforcement learning procedure developed in Carbonneau and
Godin (2020), which relies on the deep hedging algorithm of Buehler et al.
(2019b), is applied to numerically solve the global hedging problems by
representing trading policies with neural networks. Among other findings,
numerical results indicate that in the presence of jump risk, hedging long-term
puts with shorter-term options entails a significant decrease of both equal
risk prices and market incompleteness as compared to trading only the stock.
Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the potential of ERP as a fair valuation
approach providing prices consistent with observable market prices. Analyses
exhibit the ability of ERP to span a large interval of prices through the
choice of convex risk measures which is close to encompass the variance-optimal
premium.

importance to single-shot diagnose the temporal contrast between laser pulse
peak and its noise pedestal. This allows fast optimization of pulse contrast
and meaningful comparison with theory for each pulse shot, and it can help new
outcomes from clean laser-plasma interactions. Thus far, high contrast ratios
up to ~10^10, required by present petawatt (PW) class lasers, have been
accessible in both generation and single-shot characterization. However,
ultrahigh contrast ~10^13, required by the planned 200-PW lasers, challenges
intense laser technology and remains an open question. This paper reports on
the first demonstration of such an ultrahigh-contrast measurement by adapting
single-shot cross-correlator (SSCC). We introduce an ultrafast method that
enables to determine the SSCC detection limit. Our strategy mimics the test
laser having known ultrahigh contrast in the measurement frame of time-to-space
mapping. The ultimate contrast-measurement limit of 10^13 is achieved, which
corresponds to the highest pulse intensity set by SSCC damage threshold and the
lowest noise pedestal set by single-photon detection. As a consequence, photon
noise in the detection is observed and increases as the noise pedestal reduces.
The demonstrated measurement ability at the photon noise limit is applied to a
high-contrast laser system based on second-harmonic generation and optical
parametric chirped-pulse amplification, suggesting accessible of ultrahigh
contrast pulses.

to calculate the attitude transformation matrix from body frame to navigation
frame. In this paper, such attitude transformation matrix is divided into two
parts through introducing the initial inertially fixed navigation frame as
inertial frame. The attitude changes of the navigation frame corresponding to
the defined inertial frame can be exactly calculated with known velocity and
position provided by GNSS. The attitude from body frame to the defined inertial
frame is estimated based on the SINS mechanization in inertial frame. The
attitude, velocity and position in inertial frame are formulated together as
element of the group of double direct spatial isometries.It is proven that the
group state model in inertial frame satisfies a particular ""group affine""
property and the corresponding error model satisfies a ""log linear"" autonomous
differential equation on the Lie algebra. Based on such striking property, the
attitude from body frame to the defined inertial frame can be estimated based
on the linear error model with even extreme large misalignments. Two different
error state vectors are extracted based on right and left matrix
multiplications and the detailed linear state space models are derived based on
the right and left errors for SINS mechanization in inertial frame. With the
derived linear state space models, the explicit initial alignment procedures
have been presented. Extensive simulation and field tests indicate that the
initial alignment based on the left error model can perform quite well within a
wide range of initial attitude errors, although the used filter is still a type
of linear Kalman filter. This method is promising in practical products
abandoning the traditional coarse alignment stage.

representative in the council that casts votes on their behalf. By ""optimal
weights"", we mean voting weights in the council which minimise the democracy
deficit, i.e. the expected deviation of the council vote from a (hypothetical)
popular vote. We assume that the voters within each group interact via what we
call a local collective bias or common belief (through tradition, common
values, strong religious beliefs, etc.). We allow in addition an interaction
across group borders via a global bias. Thus, the voting behaviour of each
voter depends on the behaviour of all other voters. This correlation may be
stronger between voters in the same group, but is in general not zero for
voters in different groups. We call the respective voting measure a Collective
Bias Model (CBM). The ""simple CBM"" introduced in [12] and in particular the
Impartial Culture and the Impartial Anonymous Culture are special cases of our
general model. We compute the optimal weights in the large population limit.
Those optimal weights are unique as long as there is no ""complete"" correlation
between the groups. In this case, we obtain optimal weights which are the sum
of a common constant equal for all groups and a summand which is proportional
to the population of each group. We also analyse the conditions under which the
optimal weights are negative, thus making it impossible to reach the
theoretical minimum of the democracy deficit. This is a new aspect of the model
owed to the correlation between votes belonging to different groups.

  spaces","This is the authors' submitted version of the manuscript to Energy &
  Fuels",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Displacing liquid in a confined space is important for technological
processes, ranging from porous membrane separation to CO$_{2}$ sequestration.
The liquid to be displaced usually consists of multiple components with
different solubilities in the displacing liquid. Phase separation and chemical
composition gradients in the liquids can influence the displacement rate. In
this work, we investigate the effects of liquid composition on the displacement
process of ternary liquid mixtures in a quasi-2D microchannel where
liquid-liquid phase separation occurs concurrently. We focused on model ternary
mixtures containing 1-octanol, ethanol, and water. These mixtures are displaced
with water or with ethanol aqueous solution. The spatial distribution of
subphases arising from phase separation and the displacement rates of the
solution are impacted by the initial ternary solution composition. The boundary
between the solution and displacing liquid changes from a defined interface to
a diffusive interface as the initial 1-octanol composition in the solution is
reduced. The displacement rate also varies non-linearly with the initial
1-octanol composition. The slowest displacement rate arises in the intermediate
1-octanol concentration, where a stable three-zone configuration forms at the
boundary. At very low 1-octanol concentration, the displacement rate is fast,
associated with droplet formation and motion driven by the chemical
concentration gradients formed during phase separation. The excessive energy
provided from phase separation may contribute to the enhanced displacement at
intermediate to high 1-octanol concentrations, but not at the low 1-octanol
concentration with enhancement from induced flow in confinement. The knowledge
gained from this study highlights the importance of manipulating phase
separation to enhance mass transport in confinement for a wide range of
separation processes.

systems, a minimax linear-quadratic control method is proposed using the
Wasserstein metric. Our method aims to construct a control policy that is
robust against errors in an empirical distribution of underlying uncertainty,
by adopting an adversary that selects the worst-case distribution. The opponent
receives a Wasserstein penalty proportional to the amount of deviation from the
empirical distribution. A closed-form expression of the finite-horizon optimal
policy pair is derived using a Riccati equation. The result is then extended to
the infinite-horizon average cost setting by identifying conditions under which
the Riccati recursion converges to the unique positive semi-definite solution
to an algebraic Riccati equation. Our method is shown to possess several
salient features including closed-loop stability, and an out-of-sample
performance guarantee. We also discuss how to optimize the penalty parameter
for enhancing the distributional robustness of our control policy. Last but not

is gaining more and more importance. Certain questions need to be addressed:
  How does an ML procedure derive the class for a particular entity? Why does a
particular clustering emerge from a particular unsupervised ML procedure? What
can we do if the number of attributes is very large? What are the possible
reasons for the mistakes for concrete cases and models?
  For binary attributes, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) offers techniques in
terms of intents of formal concepts, and thus provides plausible reasons for
model prediction. However, from the interpretable machine learning viewpoint,
we still need to provide decision-makers with the importance of individual
attributes to the classification of a particular object, which may facilitate
explanations by experts in various domains with high-cost errors like medicine
or finance.

and morbidity worldwide. Oropharyngeal-swab (OP-swab) sampling is widely used
for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the world. To avoid the clinical staff from
being affected by the virus, we developed a 9-degree-of-freedom (DOF)
rigid-flexible coupling (RFC) robot to assist the COVID-19 OP-swab sampling.
This robot is composed of a visual system, UR5 robot arm, micro-pneumatic
actuator and force-sensing system. The robot is expected to reduce risk and
free up the clinical staff from the long-term repetitive sampling work.
Compared with a rigid sampling robot, the developed force-sensing RFC robot can
facilitate OP-swab sampling procedures in a safer and softer way. In addition,
a varying-parameter zeroing neural network-based optimization method is also
proposed for motion planning of the 9-DOF redundant manipulator. The developed
robot system is validated by OP-swab sampling on both oral cavity phantoms and
volunteers.

of place images, also known as a `visual map'. Localization accuracy
requirements for specific areas of the visual map, `scene classes', vary
according to the context of the environment and task. State-of-the-art visual
mapping is unable to reflect these requirements by explicitly targetting scene
classes for inclusion in the map. Four different scene classes, including
pedestrian crossings and stations, are identified in each of the Nordland and
St. Lucia datasets. Instead of re-training separate scene classifiers which
struggle with these overlapping scene classes we make our first contribution:
defining the problem of `scene retrieval'. Scene retrieval extends image
retrieval to classification of scenes defined at test time by associating a
single query image to reference images of scene classes. Our second
contribution is a triplet-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to address
this problem which increases scene classification accuracy by up to 7% against
state-of-the-art networks pre-trained for scene recognition. The second
contribution is an algorithm `DMC' that combines our scene classification with
distance and memorability for visual mapping. Our analysis shows that DMC
includes 64% more images of our chosen scene classes in a visual map than just
using distance interval mapping. State-of-the-art visual place descriptors
AMOS-Net, Hybrid-Net and NetVLAD are finally used to show that DMC improves
scene class localization accuracy by a mean of 3% and localization accuracy of
the remaining map images by a mean of 10% across both datasets.

between two homogeneous media have interesting properties and useful
applications in photonics. The topological nature of BICs was previously
revealed based on a topological charge related to the far-field polarization
vector of the surrounding resonant states. Recently, it was established that
when a symmetry-protected BIC (with a nonzero topological charge) is destroyed
by a generic symmetry-breaking perturbation, a pair of circularly polarized
resonant states (CPSs) emerge and the net topological charge is conserved. A
periodic structure can also support propagating BICs with a nonzero wavevector.
These BICs are not protected by symmetry in the sense of symmetry mismatch, but
they need symmetry for their robust existence. Based on a highly accurate
computational method for a periodic array of slightly noncircular cylinders, we
show that a propagating BIC is typically destroyed by a structural perturbation
that breaks only the in-plane inversion symmetry, and when this happens, a pair
of CPSs of opposite handedness emerge so that the net topological charge is
conserved. We also study the generation and annihilation of CPSs when a
structural parameter is varied. It is shown that two CPSs with opposite
topological charge and same handedness, connected to two BICs or in a
continuous branch from one BIC, may collapse and become a CPS with a zero
charge. Our study clarifies the important connection between symmetry and
topological charge conservation.

lightweight, in-process sandbox and is, for example, used in production to
isolate different clients on edge clouds and function-as-a-service platforms.
Unfortunately, Spectre attacks can bypass Wasm's isolation guarantees. Swivel
hardens Wasm against this class of attacks by ensuring that potentially
malicious code can neither use Spectre attacks to break out of the Wasm sandbox
nor coerce victim code-another Wasm client or the embedding process-to leak
secret data.
  We describe two Swivel designs, a software-only approach that can be used on

mitigates Spectre and a deterministic approach that eliminates Spectre
altogether. Our randomized implementations impose under 10.3% overhead on the
Wasm-compatible subset of SPEC 2006, while our deterministic implementations
impose overheads between 3.3% and 240.2%. Though high on some benchmarks,

materials, the peak is located at a shallower depth along the beam direction
and becomes sharper with increasing electron density NZ. Subsequently, the
generated depth dose of the Bragg curve is then benchmarked with experimental
data from GSI in Germany. The results exhibit a reasonable correlation with GSI
experimental data with an accuracy of between 0.02 and 0.08 cm, thus
establishing the basis to adopt MC in heavy-ion treatment planning. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov K-S test further ascertained from a statistical point of
view that the simulation data matched the experimentally measured data very
well. The two-dimensional isodose contours at the entrance were compared to
those around the peak position and in the tail region beyond the peak, showing
that bone produces more dose, in comparison to both water and tissue, due to
secondary doses. In the water, the results show that the maximum energy
deposited per fragment is mainly attributed to secondary carbon ions, followed
by secondary boron and beryllium. Furthermore, the number of protons produced
is the highest, thus making the maximum contribution to the total dose
deposition in the tail region. Finally, the associated spectra of neutrons and

such that robots have neither a representation of their working space nor
planning function, instead, an active environment takes charge of these
aspects. This is realized by spatially deploying computing units, called cells,
and making cells manage traffic in their respective physical region. Different
from stigmegic approaches, cells interact with each other to manage
environmental information and to construct instructions on how robots move.
  As a proof-of-concept, we present an architecture called AFADA and its
prototype, consisting of modular cells and robots moving on the cells. The
instructions from cells are based on a distributed routing algorithm and a
reservation protocol. We demonstrate that AFADA achieves efficient robot moves
for single-robot navigation in a dynamic environment changing its topology with
a stochastic model, comparing to self-navigation by a robot itself. This is
followed by several demos, including multi-robot navigation, highlighting the
power of offloading both representation and planning from robots to the
environment. We expect that the concept of AFADA contributes to developing the
infrastructure for multiple robots because it can engage online and lifelong
planning and execution.

VGOS sessions currently available: group delay and differential total electron

VGOS group delays is at the level of less than 2 ps (1 ps = 10$^{-12}$ s),
while the contributions from systematic error sources, mainly source structure
related, are at the level of 20 ps. Due to the significant improvement in
measurement noise, source structure effects with relatively small magnitudes
that are not overwhelming in the S/X VLBI system, for instance 10 ps, are
clearly visible in VGOS observations. Another critical error source in VGOS
observations is discrete delay jumps, for instance, a systematic offset of
about 310 ps or integer multiples of that. The predominant causative factor is
found to be related to source structure. The measurement noise level of
$\delta$TEC observables is about 0.07 TECU, but the systematic effects are five
times larger than that. A strong correlation between group delay and
$\delta$TEC observables is discovered with a trend of 40 ps/TECU for
observations with large structure effects; there is a second trend in the range
60 ps/TECU to 70 ps/TECU when the measurement noise is dominant.

integrated volatility matrices based on high-frequency financial data. To
investigate their asymptotic behaviors, they require a sub-Gaussian or finite
high-order moment assumption for observed log-returns, which cannot account for
the heavy-tail phenomenon of stock returns. Recently, a robust estimator was
developed to handle heavy-tailed distributions with some bounded fourth-moment
assumption. However, we often observe that log-returns have heavier tail
distribution than the finite fourth-moment and that the degrees of heaviness of
tails are heterogeneous across asset and over time. In this paper, to deal with
the heterogeneous heavy-tailed distributions, we develop an adaptive robust
integrated volatility estimator that employs pre-averaging and truncation
schemes based on jump-diffusion processes. We call this an adaptive robust
pre-averaging realized volatility (ARP) estimator. We show that the ARP
estimator has a sub-Weibull tail concentration with only finite 2$\alpha$-th
moments for any $\alpha>1$. In addition, we establish matching upper and lower
bounds to show that the ARP estimation procedure is optimal. To estimate large
integrated volatility matrices using the approximate factor model, the ARP
estimator is further regularized using the principal orthogonal complement
thresholding (POET) method. The numerical study is conducted to check the
finite sample performance of the ARP estimator.

an important role in pulmonary disease diagnosis and computer-assisted therapy.
However, low contrast at peripheral branches and complex tree-like structures
remain as two mainly challenges for airway segmentation. Recent research has
illustrated that deep learning methods perform well in segmentation tasks.
Motivated by these works, a coarse-to-fine segmentation framework is proposed
to obtain a complete airway tree. Our framework segments the overall airway and
small branches via the multi-information fusion convolution neural network
(Mif-CNN) and the CNN-based region growing, respectively. In Mif-CNN, atrous
spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) is integrated into a u-shaped network, and it
can expend the receptive field and capture multi-scale information. Meanwhile,
boundary and location information are incorporated into semantic information.
These information are fused to help Mif-CNN utilize additional context
knowledge and useful features. To improve the performance of the segmentation
result, the CNN-based region growing method is designed to focus on obtaining
small branches. A voxel classification network (VCN), which can entirely
capture the rich information around each voxel, is applied to classify the
voxels into airway and non-airway. In addition, a shape reconstruction method
is used to refine the airway tree.

Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly

continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete
MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding
into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters
to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent
DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet
based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate
probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft
decoding in today's communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO

carbon ions at varying dose rates up to 340 Gy/s. The oxygen measurement was
performed using an optical sensor allowing for non-invasive measurements.
  Results: Oxygen consumption in water only depends on dose, dose rate and
linear energy transfer (LET) of the irradiation. The total amount of oxygen
depleted per 10 Gy was found to be 0.04 - 0.18 % atm for 225 kV photons, 0.04 -

consumption depends on dose rate by an inverse power law and saturates for
higher dose rates because of self-interactions of radicals. Higher dose rates
yield lower oxygen consumption. No total depletion of oxygen was found for
clinical doses.
  Conclusions: FLASH irradiation does consume oxygen, but not enough to deplete
all the oxygen present. For higher dose rates, less oxygen was consumed than at
standard radiotherapy dose rates. No total depletion was found for any of the

on its surface which they otherwise do not experience in Euclidean space.
Notably, the number of particles and the size of the system can be varied
separately, requiring a careful treatment of systems with one or several
characteristic length scales. All this can make it difficult to precisely
determine whether a particular system is in a disordered, fluid-like, or
crystal-like state. Here, we show how order transitions in systems of particles
interacting on the surface of a sphere can be detected by changes in two
hyperuniformity parameters, derived from spherical structure factor and cap
number variance. We demonstrate their use on two different systems -- solutions
of the thermal Thomson problem and particles interacting via an ultra-soft
potential of the generalized exponential model of order 4 -- each with a
distinct parameter regulating their degree of ordering. The hyperuniformity
parameters are not only able to detect the order transitions in both systems,
but also point out the clear differences in the ordered distributions in each
due to the nature of the interaction leading to them. Our study shows that
hyperuniformity analysis of particle distributions on the sphere provides a
powerful insight into fluid- and crystal-like order on the sphere.

blocks. While the P2P network design intends to hide the topology of the P2P
network, information about the topology is required to understand the network
from a scientific point of view. Thus, there is a natural tension between the
'desire' for unobservability on the one hand, and for observability on the
other hand. On a middle ground, one would at least be interested on some
statistical features of the Bitcoin network like the number of peers that
participate in the propagation of transactions and blocks. This number is
composed of the number of reachable peers that accept incoming connections and
unreachable peers that do not accept incoming connections. While the number of
reachable peers can be measured, it is inherently difficult to determine the
number of unreachable peers. Thus, the number of unreachable peers can only be
estimated based on some indicators. In this paper, we first define our
understanding of unreachable peers and then propose the PAL (Passive
Announcement Listening) method which gives an estimate of the number of
unreachable peers by observing ADDR messages that announce active IP addresses
in the network. The PAL method allows for detecting unreachable peers that
indicate that they provide services useful to the P2P network. In conjunction
with previous methods, the PAL method can help to get a better estimate of the
number of unreachable peers. We use the PAL method to analyze data from a
long-term measurement of the Bitcoin P2P network that gives insights into the
development of the number of unreachable peers over five years from 2015 to
2020. Results show that about 31,000 unreachable peers providing useful
services were active per day at the end of the year 2020. An empirical
validation indicates that the approach finds about 50 % of unreachable peers
that provide useful services.

have shown how this task can be automatically performed by computers. Here, we
build upon their pioneering work and further separate the detected low-surface

galaxies. For this purpose, we have manually classified 5567 detections from
multi-band images from DES and searched for a neural network architecture
capable of this task. Employing a hyperparameter search, we find a family of
convolutional neural networks achieving similar results as with the manual
classification, with an accuracy of 85% for spiral galaxies, 94% for dwarf
ellipticals, and 52% for dwarf irregulars. For dwarf irregulars - due to their
diversity in morphology - the task is difficult for humans and machines alike.

method of choice in many application areas. These include multibody dynamics,
shape analysis, data science, image registration and biophysical simulations.
Two important classes of intrinsic Lie group integrators are the
Runge--Kutta--Munthe--Kaas methods and the commutator free Lie group
integrators.
  We give a short introduction to these classes of methods. The Hamiltonian
framework is attractive for many mechanical problems, and in particular we
shall consider Lie group integrators for problems on cotangent bundles of Lie
groups where a number of different formulations are possible. There is a
natural symplectic structure on such manifolds and through variational
principles one may derive symplectic Lie group integrators. We also consider
the practical aspects of the implementation of Lie group integrators, such as
adaptive time stepping. The theory is illustrated by applying the methods to
two nontrivial applications in mechanics. One is the N-fold spherical pendulum
where we introduce the restriction of the adjoint action of the group $SE(3)$
to $TS^2$, the tangent bundle of the two-dimensional sphere. Finally, we show

using a three-pronged approach. First, we develop an evaluation framework,
DiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our
results suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (i.e., trained on
original data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of
adversarially robust models satisfy (A). Second, we introduce BlockMNIST, an
MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of
discriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information
to validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient
attributions of standard and robust models. Finally, we theoretically prove
that our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST
dataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard
one-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight
instance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A).
Our findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in

chemical composition and crystallographic orientation has been carried out in
selected areas of cast Inconel 718 specimens subjected to three different
tempers. The specimens showed a strong Nb segregation at the scale of the
dendrite arms, with local Nb contents that varied between 2 wt.% in the core of
the dendrite arms to 8 wt.% in the interdendritic regions and 25 wt.% within
the second phase particles (MC carbides, Laves phases and {\delta} phase
needles). The nanohardness was found to correlate strongly with the local Nb
content and the temper condition. On the contrary, the indentation elastic
moduli were not influenced by the local chemical composition or temper
condition, but directly correlated with the crystallographic grain orientation,
due to the high elastic anisotropy of nickel alloys.

distributed storage systems (DSS), while boosting the number of concurrent
accesses, maintaining strong consistency guarantees, and ensuring good
operation performance. To this respect, we define the notion of fragmented
objects:con-current objects composed of a list of fragments (or blocks) that
allow operations to manipulate each of their fragments individually. As the
fragments belong to the same object, it is not enough that each fragment is
linearizable to have useful consistency guarantees in the composed object.
Hence, we capture the consistency semantic of the whole object with the notion
of fragmented linearizability. Then, considering that a variance of
linearizability, coverability, is more suited for versioned objects like files,
we provide an implementation of a distributed file system, called COBFS, that
utilizes coverable fragmented objects (i.e., files).In COBFS, each file is a
linked-list of coverable block objects. Preliminary emulation of COBFS
demonstrates the potential of our approach in boosting the concurrency of
strongly consistent large objects.

anisotropic electronic coupling between the $f$- and conduction electrons,

Coherence time $T_2$ decreases rapidly from $184 \mu s$ at 300 K to $30 \mu s$
at 600 K, which is attributed to the interaction with paramagnetic impurities.
Single-quantum and double-quantum relaxation rates show an obvious
temperature-dependent behavior as well, and both of them are dominated by the
two phonon Raman process. While the inhomogeneous dephasing time $T_2^*$ and
thermal echo decoherence time $T_{TE}$ remain almost unchanged as temperature

thermal-echo-based thermometer is demonstrated to have a sensitivity of $41

flexibly modeling dependencies among different types of variables, so that BO
can enjoy the further improved sample efficiency. The FM kernel uses distances
on continuous variables to modulate the graph Fourier spectrum derived from
discrete variables. However, the frequency modulation does not always define a
kernel with the similarity measure behavior which returns higher values for
pairs of more similar points. Therefore, we specify and prove conditions for FM
kernels to be positive definite and to exhibit the similarity measure behavior.
In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of GP BO using FM
kernels (BO-FM).On synthetic problems and hyperparameter optimization problems,
BO-FM outperforms competitors consistently. Also, the importance of the
frequency modulation principle is empirically demonstrated on the same

containing a few luminous galaxies in close proximity to each other, which have
a typical size of a few tens kilopacsec in observation. On the other hand, in
the modern hierarchical structure formation paradigm, galaxies are assembled
and grouped in dark matter haloes, which have a typical size of a few hundreds
of kiloparsec. Few studies have explored the physical connection between the
observation based CGs and halo model based galaxy groups to date. In this
study, by matching the largest local CG catalog of Zheng & Shen (2020) to the
halo based group catalog of Yang et al. (2007), we find that the CGs are
physically heterogenous systems and can be mainly separated into two
categories, the isolated systems and those embedded in rich groups or clusters.
By examining the dynamical features of CGs, we find that the isolated CGs have
systematically lower dynamical masses than that of non-compact ones at the same
group luminosity, indicating a more evolved stage of isolated CGs. On the other
hand, the embedded CGs are mixtures of chance alignments in poor clusters and
recent infalling groups (sub-structures) of rich clusters.

this ""spooky"" alignment. This alignment cannot be explained by mutual
interaction at the time that quasars manifest themselves optically. A
cosmological explanation could be possible by the formation of superconducting
vortices (cosmic strings) in the early universe, just after the
symmetry-breaking phase of the universe. We gathered from the NASA/IPAC and
SIMBAD extragalactic databases the right ascension, declination, inclination,
position angle and eccentricity of the host galaxies of 3 large quasar groups
in order to obtain the azimuthal and polar angle of the spin vectors. The
alignment of the azimuthal angle of the spin vectors of quasars in their host
galaxy is confirmed in the large quasar group U1.27 and compared with two other
groups in the vicinity, i.e., U1.11 and U1.28, investigated by Clowes2013. It
is well possible that the azimuthal angle alignment fits the predicted
azimuthal angle dependency in the theoretical model of the formation of general
relativistic superconducting vortices, where the initial axial symmetry is
broken just after the symmetry breaking of the scalar-gauge field.

transport and deposition of particle matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) on printed
circuit boards, electronic components and heat exchange surfaces. This process
is enhanced by turbulent air flows generated from cooling fans. Particle
pollutants can persist after contemporary filtering, highlighting the
importance of elucidating particle transport mechanisms and utilising this
information to design robust equipment. This study investigates particle
transport behaviour arising from axial fans operating under varied aerodynamic
conditions. Transient, multi-phase numerical simulations were performed to
model the flow of millions of microscale particles in air and determine their
fate. Across a comprehensive range of fan operation conditions, from
aerodynamic stall to free delivery, non-dimensional deposition velocities
spanned an order of magnitude. Deposition profiles vary from monotonic to
non-monotonic behaviour, influenced by local flow impingement, blade tip
vortices, and shear velocity. A simple flow control solution that mitigates the
factors influencing deposition has been demonstrated for equipment already
deployed. The findings and numerical methods can be applied for the
optimization of fan-cooled equipment intended for indoor and outdoor

the historical state information of others. Moreover, we consider a set of
global linear constraints and impose some violation penalties on the updating

However, it is NP-complete to recognize if a graph is a Wheeler graph (Gibney,
Thankachan, ESA 2019).
  We propose an approach to alleviate the construction bottleneck of Wheeler
graphs. Rather than starting from an arbitrary graph, we study graphs induced
from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Elastic degenerate strings (Bernadini
et al. SPIRE 2017, ICALP 2019) can be seen as such graphs, and we introduce
here their generalization: elastic founder graphs. We first prove that even
such induced graphs are hard to index under OVH. Then we introduce two
subclasses, repeat-free and semi-repeat-free graphs, that are easy to index. We
give a linear time algorithm to construct a repeat-free non-elastic founder
graph from a gapless MSA, and (parameterized) near-linear time algorithms to
construct semi-repeat-free (repeat-free, respectively) elastic founder graphs
from general MSAs. Finally, we show that repeat-free elastic founder graphs
admit a reduction to Wheeler graphs in polynomial time.

navigation systems for robots. While state-of-the-art methods widely use
visual-based algorithms, it is worth noting that they all fail to deal with the
complexity of the real world by being computationally greedy and sometimes too
slow. They often require obstacles to be highly textured to improve the overall
performance, particularly when the obstacle is located within the focus of
expansion (FOE) where the optic flow (OF) is almost null. This study proposes
the FAst ITerative Half-plane (FAITH) method to determine the course of a micro
air vehicle (MAV). This is achieved by means of an event-based camera, along
with a fast RANSAC-based algorithm that uses event-based OF to determine the
FOE. The performance is validated by means of a benchmark on a simulated
environment and then tested on a dataset collected for indoor obstacle
avoidance. Our results show that the computational efficiency of our solution
outperforms state-of-the-art methods while keeping a high level of accuracy.
This has been further demonstrated onboard an MAV equipped with an event-based
camera, showing that our event-based FOE estimation can be achieved online
onboard tiny drones, thus opening the path towards fully neuromorphic solutions
for autonomous obstacle avoidance and navigation onboard MAVs.

are significantly slower than their crash fault-tolerant counterparts. Indeed,
in PBFT, the most widely known Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol, it
takes three message delays to decide a value, in contrast with just two in
Paxos. This motivates the search for fast Byzantine consensus algorithms that
can produce decisions after just two message delays \emph{in the common case},
e.g., under the assumption that the current leader is correct and not suspected
by correct processes. The (optimal) two-step latency comes with the cost of
lower resilience: fast Byzantine consensus requires more processes to tolerate
the same number of faults. In particular, $5f+1$ processes were claimed to be
necessary to tolerate $f$ Byzantine failures.
  In this paper, we present a fast Byzantine consensus algorithm that relies on
just $5f-1$ processes. Moreover, we show that $5f-1$ is the tight lower bound,
correcting a mistake in the earlier work. While the difference of just $2$
processes may appear insignificant for large values of $f$, it can be crucial
for systems of a smaller scale. In particular, for $f=1$, our algorithm
requires only $4$ processes, which is optimal for any (not necessarily fast)
partially synchronous Byzantine consensus algorithm.

rare decay into heavy neutrinos $h_1 \to NN$ at the proposed electron-positron
collider, with the focus on multi-lepton final states that contain same-sign
lepton pairs. $h_1 \to NN$ decay can derive from Higgs boson's mixing with new
physics scalar(s) that is complementary to the contribution from active-sterile
neutrino mixings. We consider the scenario with a singlet scalar which gives
the heavy neutrino mass and has a small mixing with the SM Higgs boson. We
analyze the semileptonic, fully leptonic and mixed $NN$ decay scenarios, and
categorize the signal on the number of leptons in the final state: $ \ell^\pm
\ell^\pm$ with at least 3 jets, $\ell^\pm \ell^\pm \ell$ with at least 2 jets,
and $e^\pm e^\pm \mu^\mp \mu^\mp$ plus with at least 1 jet, each containing one
or two same-sign dilepton system(s). Selection cuts are optimized for the
presence of the associated $Z$-boson, which leads to additional backgrounds at
the $e^-e^+$ collider. The Standard Model background channels are
systematically analyzed. Sensitivity limits on $h_1 \rightarrow NN$ branching
fractions are derived for signals with 2-4 final leptons assuming the heavy
neutrino masses are between 10 and 60 GeV. With 240 GeV center-of-mass energy
and 5.6 ab$^{-1}$ design luminosity, $h_1 \rightarrow NN$ branching fraction
can be probed to $2\times 10^{-4}$ in $2\ell$ and $3\ell$ channels, and
$6\times 10^{-4}$ in the $4\ell$ channel at $95\%$ confidence level. $3\ell,
4\ell$ channels expect one or fewer background event, and their sensitivities
saturate the statistic limit at 5.6 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity. A same-sign trilepton
($\ell^\pm \ell^\pm \ell^\pm$) signal in the $3\ell$ channel is also discussed.
Our search strategy provides an approach to discovering the singlet scalar and
exploring the origin of neutrino masses at future $e^-e^+$ colliders.

identifying the site of airway collapse. Audio signal was recorded
simultaneously with full-night polysomnography during sleep with a ceiling

extracted to classify the audio signal into OSA related snore, simple snore and
other sounds. Two algorithms were developed to extract OSA related snore using
an linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on the hypothesis that
OSA related snoring can assist in identifying the site-of-upper airway
collapse. An unbiased nested leave-one patient-out cross-validation process was
used to select a high performing feature set from the full set of features.
Results indicated that the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 87% for
identifying snore events from the audio recordings and an accuracy of 72% for
identifying OSA related snore events from the snore events. The direct method
to extract OSA-related snore events using a multi-class LDA classifier achieved
an accuracy of 64% using the feature selection algorithm. Our results gives a

near their present orbits requires understanding the structure of the inner
regions of protoplanetary discs. Previous studies have argued that the hot
inner protoplanetary disc is unstable to the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) due to thermal ionization of potassium, and that a local gas pressure
maximum forms at the outer edge of this MRI-active zone. Here we present a
steady-state model for inner discs accreting viscously, primarily due to the
MRI. The structure and MRI-viscosity of the inner disc are fully coupled in our
model; moreover, we account for many processes omitted in previous such models,
including disc heating by both accretion and stellar irradiation, vertical
energy transport, realistic dust opacities, dust effects on disc ionization and
non-thermal sources of ionization. For a disc around a solar-mass star with a
standard gas accretion rate ($\dot{M}$$\sim$$10^{-8}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$) and
small dust grains, we find that the inner disc is optically thick, and the
accretion heat is primarily released near the midplane. As a result, both the
disc midplane temperature and the location of the pressure maximum are only
marginally affected by stellar irradiation, and the inner disc is also
convectively unstable. As previously suggested, the inner disc is primarily
ionized through thermionic and potassium ion emission from dust grains, which,
at high temperatures, counteract adsorption of free charges onto grains. Our
results show that the location of the pressure maximum is determined by the
threshold temperature above which thermionic and ion emission become efficient.

language formation processes we examine the dynamics of the naming game with

effective surface tension, which drives the coarsening. Such a behaviour is
very robust and appears for a wide range of densities of agents and their
migration rates. (ii) However, when only multilingual agents are allowed to
migrate, monolingual islands are typically formed. In such a case, when the
migration rate is sufficiently large, the majority of agents acquire a common
language, which spontaneously emerges with no indication of the surface-tension
driven coarsening. A relatively slow coarsening that takes place in a dense
static population is very fragile, and most likely, an arbitrarily small
migration rate can divert the system toward quick formation of monolingual
islands. Our work shows that migration influences language formation processes
but additional details like density, or mobility of agents are needed to

angular dependence on magnetization, the competition of Rashba and
Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit couplings results in the dependence of these
effects on the crystal direction of the applied electric field. The
phenomenology that we observe highlights potential inapplicability of commonly
considered approaches for interpreting experiments. We point out that, in
general, there is no direct link between the current-induced non-equilibrium
spin polarization inferred from the measured spin-orbit torque and the
unidirectional magnetiresistance. We also emphasize that the unidirectional
magnetoresistance has not only longitudinal but also transverse components in
the electric field -- current indices which complicates its separation from the
thermoelectric contributions to the detected signals in common experimental
techniques. We use the theoretical results to analyze our measurements of the

they can entail significant volumes of data, point cloud compression is crucial
for practical usage. Recently, point cloud geometry compression approaches
based on deep neural networks have been explored. In this paper, we evaluate
the ability to predict perceptual quality of typical voxel-based loss functions
employed to train these networks. We find that the commonly used focal loss and
weighted binary cross entropy are poorly correlated with human perception. We
thus propose a perceptual loss function for 3D point clouds which outperforms
existing loss functions on the ICIP2020 subjective dataset. In addition, we
propose a novel truncated distance field voxel grid representation and find
that it leads to sparser latent spaces and loss functions that are more
correlated with perceived visual quality compared to a binary representation.

converters without a parallel corpus. Cycle-consistent adversarial
network-based VCs (CycleGAN-VC and CycleGAN-VC2) are widely accepted as
benchmark methods. However, owing to their insufficient ability to grasp
time-frequency structures, their application is limited to mel-cepstrum
conversion and not mel-spectrogram conversion despite recent advances in
mel-spectrogram vocoders. To overcome this, CycleGAN-VC3, an improved variant
of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates an additional module called time-frequency
adaptive normalization (TFAN), has been proposed. However, an increase in the
number of learned parameters is imposed. As an alternative, we propose
MaskCycleGAN-VC, which is another extension of CycleGAN-VC2 and is trained
using a novel auxiliary task called filling in frames (FIF). With FIF, we apply
a temporal mask to the input mel-spectrogram and encourage the converter to
fill in missing frames based on surrounding frames. This task allows the
converter to learn time-frequency structures in a self-supervised manner and
eliminates the need for an additional module such as TFAN. A subjective
evaluation of the naturalness and speaker similarity showed that
MaskCycleGAN-VC outperformed both CycleGAN-VC2 and CycleGAN-VC3 with a model

time is mainly determined by the interplay between the magnetic properties of
the NPs and the rheological properties of NPs environment. Although the role of
magnetism in MFH has been extensively studied, the thermal properties of the
NPs medium and their changes during of MFH experiments have been so far
underrated. Here, we show that ZnxFe3-xO4 NPs dispersed through different with
phase transition in the temperature range of the experiment: clarified butter
oil (CBO) and paraffin. These systems show non-linear behavior of the heating
rate within the temperature range of the MFH experiments. For CBO, a fast
increase at $306 K$ associated to changes in the viscosity (\texteta(T)) and
specific heat (c_p(T)) of the medium below and above its melting temperature.
This increment in the heating rate takes place around $318 K$ for paraffin.
Magnetic and morphological characterizations of NPs together with the observed
agglomeration of the nanoparticles above $306 K$ indicate that the fast
increase in MFH curves could not be associated to a change in the magnetic
relaxation mechanism, with N\'eel relaxation being dominant. In fact,
successive experiment runs performed up to temperatures below and above the CBO
melting point resulted in different MFH curves due to agglomeration of NPs
driven by magnetic field inhomogeneity during the experiments. Similar effects
were observed for paraffin. Our results highlight the relevance of the NPs
medium's thermodynamic properties for an accurate measurement of the heating
efficiency for in vitro and in vivo environments, where the thermal properties
are largely variable within the temperature window of MFH experiments.

alternative, the Incremental M-mode Block SVD, that employs the lower-level
abstractions, the part representations, to represent the higher level of
abstractions, the parent wholes. This incremental computational approach may
also be employed to update the causal model parameters when data becomes

interpretable combinatorial choice of intrinsic causal factor representations

object recognition robust to occlusion and reduces training data requirements.

to the gravity moments has become a major tool to characterise the interior
dynamics of gas giants. Previous studies differ with respect to the assumptions
made on how the wind velocity relates to density anomalies, on the functional
form of its decay with depth, and on the continuity of antisymmetric winds
across the equatorial plane. Most of the suggested vertical structures exhibit
a rather smooth radial decay of the zonal wind, which seems at odds with the
observed secular variation of the magnetic field and the prevailing geostrophy
of the zonal winds. Moreover, the results relied on an artificial equatorial
regularisation or ignored the equatorial discontinuity altogether. We favour an
alternative structure, where the equatorially antisymmetric zonal wind in an
equatorial latitude belt between $\pm 21^\circ$ remains so shallow that it does
not contribute to the gravity signal. The winds at higher latitudes suffice to
convincingly explain the measured gravity moments. Our results indicate that
the winds are geostrophic, i.e. constant along cylinders, in the outer $3000\,$

previously thought, agrees with the measured gravity moment, is compliant with
the magnetic constraints and the requirement of an adiabatic atmosphere and

  Strategies to Obtain Cognitive Event Appraisal Annotations","Published in WASSA 2021 at EACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Appraisal theories explain how the cognitive evaluation of an event leads to
a particular emotion. In contrast to theories of basic emotions or affect
(valence/arousal), this theory has not received a lot of attention in natural
language processing. Yet, in psychology it has been proven powerful: Smith and
Ellsworth (1985) showed that the appraisal dimensions attention, certainty,
anticipated effort, pleasantness, responsibility/control and situational
control discriminate between (at least) 15 emotion classes. We study different
annotation strategies for these dimensions, based on the event-focused enISEAR
corpus (Troiano et al., 2019). We analyze two manual annotation settings: (1)
showing the text to annotate while masking the experienced emotion label; (2)
revealing the emotion associated with the text. Setting 2 enables the
annotators to develop a more realistic intuition of the described event, while
Setting 1 is a more standard annotation procedure, purely relying on text. We
evaluate these strategies in two ways: by measuring inter-annotator agreement
and by fine-tuning RoBERTa to predict appraisal variables. Our results show
that knowledge of the emotion increases annotators' reliability. Further, we
evaluate a purely automatic rule-based labeling strategy (inferring appraisal
from annotated emotion classes). Training on automatically assigned labels
leads to a competitive performance of our classifier, even when tested on
manual annotations. This is an indicator that it might be possible to

  Systems: Opportunities, Challenges and Solutions","15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the depletion of spectrum, wireless communication systems turn to
exploit large antenna arrays to achieve the degree of freedom in space domain,
such as millimeter wave massive multi-input multioutput (MIMO), reconfigurable
intelligent surface assisted communications and cell-free massive MIMO. In
these systems, how to acquire accurate channel state information (CSI) is
difficult and becomes a bottleneck of the communication links. In this article,
we introduce the concept of channel extrapolation that relies on a small
portion of channel parameters to infer the remaining channel parameters. Since
the substance of channel extrapolation is a mapping from one parameter subspace
to another, we can resort to deep learning (DL), a powerful learning
architecture, to approximate such mapping function. Specifically, we first
analyze the requirements, conditions and challenges for channel extrapolation.
Then, we present three typical extrapolations over the antenna dimension, the
frequency dimension, and the physical terminal, respectively. We also
illustrate their respective principles, design challenges and DL strategies. It
will be seen that channel extrapolation could greatly reduce the transmission
overhead and subsequently enhance the performance gains compared with the
traditional strategies. In the end, we provide several potential research
directions on channel extrapolation for future intelligent communications
systems.

regenerative medicine, drug-discovery and personalised medicine due to their
potential to differentiate into all cell types, a property know as
pluripotency. A deeper understanding of how pluripotency is regulated is
required to assist in controlling pluripotency and differentiation trajectories
experimentally. Mathematical modelling provides a non-invasive tool through
which to explore, characterise and replicate the regulation of pluripotency and
the consequences on cell fate. Here we use experimental data of the expression
of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 in a growing hPSC colony to
develop and evaluate mathematical models for temporal pluripotency regulation.
We consider fractional Brownian motion and the stochastic logistic equation and
explore the effects of both additive and multiplicative noise. We illustrate
the use of time-dependent carrying capacities and the introduction of Allee
effects to the stochastic logistic equation to describe cell differentiation.
This mathematical framework for describing intra-cellular OCT4 regulation can
be extended to other transcription factors and developed into sophisticated
predictive models.

generated virtual features in a loss-adapted manner to avoid over-fitting. FASA
does not require any elaborate loss design, and removes the need for
inter-class transfer learning that often involves large cost and
manually-defined head/tail class groups. We show FASA is a fast, generic method
that can be easily plugged into standard or long-tailed segmentation
frameworks, with consistent performance gains and little added cost. FASA is
also applicable to other tasks like long-tailed classification with

nonequilibrium dynamics of completely overdamped Brownian colloidal particles
towards so-called dynamical density functional theory (DDFT). The success of
DDFT makes it a promising candidate for a first-principle description of active
matter. In this lecture, we shall first recapitulate classical DDFT for passive
colloidal particles typically described by Smoluchowski equation. After a basic
derivation of DDFT from the Smoluchowski equation, we discuss orientational
degrees of freedom and the effect of hydrodynamic interactions for passive
particles. This brings us into an ideal position to generalize DDFT towards
active matter. In particular we distinguish between ""dry active matter"" which
is composed of self-propelled particles that contain no hydrodynamic flow
effects of a surrounding solvent and ""wet active matter"" where the hydrodynamic
flow fields generated by the microswimmers are taken into account. For the
latter, DDFT is a tool which unifies thermal fluctuations, direct particle
interactions, external driving fields and hydrodynamic effects arising from
internal self-propulsion discriminating between ""pushers"" and ""pullers"". A
number of recent applications is discussed including transient clustering of
self-propelled rods and the spontaneous formation of a hydrodynamic pump in

To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance
of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising
result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important
compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these
diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model
performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM)

suited for simulating the interaction between short laser pulses with plasmas.
The fluid solver relies on two-step Lax-Wendroff split with a fourth-order
Runge-Kutta scheme, and we use the PseudoSpectral Analytical Time-Domain
(PSATD) method to solve Maxwell's curl equations. Overall, this method is only
based on finite difference schemes and fast Fourier transforms and does not
require any grid staggering. The PseudoSpectral Analytical Time-Domain method
removes the numerical dispersion for transverse electromagnetic wave
propagation in the absence of current that is conventionally observed for other

quantitative agreement with wave conversion of p-polarized electromagnetic wave

nebulae (PNe) A30 and A78 using IR images and spectra. We demonstrate that the
carbon-rich dust in A30 and A78 is spatially coincident with the H-poor ejecta
and coexists with hot X-ray-emitting gas up to distances of 50$''$ from the
central stars (CSPNs). Dust forms immediately after the born-again event and
survives for 1000 yr in the harsh environment around the CSPN as it is
destroyed and pushed away by radiation pressure and dragged by hydrodynamical
effects. Spitzer IRS spectral maps showed that the broad spectral features at
6.4 and 8.0 $\mu$m, attributed to amorphous carbon formed in H-deficient
environments, are associated with the disrupted disk around their CSPN,
providing an optimal environment for charge exchange reactions with the stellar
wind that produces the soft X-ray emission of these sources. Nebular and dust
properties are modeled for A30 with Cloudy taking into account different
carbonaceous dust species. Our models predict dust temperatures in the 40-230 K
range, five times lower than predicted by previous works. Gas and dust masses
for the born-again ejecta in A30 are estimated to be
$M_\mathrm{gas}=(4.41^{+0.55}_{-0.14})\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and
$M_\mathrm{dust}=(3.20^{+3.21}_{-2.06})\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, which can be
used to estimate a total ejected mass and mass-loss rate for the born-again
event of $(7.61^{+3.76}_{-2.20})\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and
$\dot{M}=[5-60]\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Taking into
account the carbon trapped into dust grains, we estimate that the C/O mass
ratio of the H-poor ejecta of A30 is larger than 1, which favors the very late
thermal pulse model over the alternate hypothesis of a nova-like event.

describe the underlying network geometry and topology of many complex systems.
While it is well known that network structure strongly affects its function,
the role that network topology and geometry has on the emerging dynamical
properties of higher-order networks is yet to be clarified. In this
perspective, the spectral dimension plays a key role since it determines the
effective dimension for diffusion processes on a network. Despite its
relevance, a theoretical understanding of which mechanisms lead to a finite
spectral dimension, and how this can be controlled, represents nowadays still a
challenge and is the object of intense research. Here we introduce two
non-equilibrium models of hyperbolic higher-order networks and we characterize
their network topology and geometry by investigating the interwined appearance
of small-world behavior, $\delta$-hyperbolicity and community structure. We
show that different topological moves determining the non-equilibrium growth of
the higher-order hyperbolic network models induce tunable values of the
spectral dimension, showing a rich phenomenology which is not displayed in
random graph ensembles. In particular, we observe that, if the topological
moves used to construct the higher-order network increase the area$/$volume
ratio, the spectral dimension continuously decreases, while the opposite effect
is observed if the topological moves decrease the area$/$volume ratio. Our work
reveals a new link between the geometry of a network and its diffusion
properties, contributing to a better understanding of the complex interplay
between network structure and dynamics.

have been done in order to categorize regular and chaotic motions of stars. We
have seen that escape mechanism has only seen near saddle points ($L_2$, $L_4$

- $y$ plane indicate that this escaping motion corresponds to the two ends of
the bar. Classifications of orbits are found by calculating maximal Lyapunov

locomotion: they generate smooth trajectories, are robust to perturbations and
are simple to implement. Although conceptually promising, we argue that the
full potential of CPGs has so far been limited by insufficient sensory-feedback
information. This paper proposes a new methodology that allows tuning CPG
controllers through gradient-based optimization in a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CPGs have
been trained in conjunction with a MultilayerPerceptron (MLP) network in a
Deep-RL context. In particular, we show how CPGs can directly be integrated as
the Actor in an Actor-Critic formulation. Additionally, we demonstrate how this
change permits us to integrate highly non-linear feedback directly from sensory
perception to reshape the oscillators' dynamics. Our results on a locomotion
task using a single-leg hopper demonstrate that explicitly using the CPG as the
Actor rather than as part of the environment results in a significant increase
in the reward gained over time (6x more) compared with previous approaches.
Furthermore, we show that our method without feedback reproduces results
similar to prior work with feedback. Finally, we demonstrate how our
closed-loop CPG progressively improves the hopping behaviour for longer
training epochs relying only on basic reward functions.

features and consequences of a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector.
We use the Planck 2018, BAO, JLA, KiDS and HST data to investigate two
extensions of the base $\Lambda$CDM model, viz., (i) we allow the interaction
among vacuum energy and dark matter, namely the I$\Lambda$CDM model, wherein
the interaction strength is proportional to the vacuum energy density and
expansion rate of the Universe, and (ii) the I$\Lambda$CDM scenario with free
effective neutrino mass and number, namely the $\nu$I$\Lambda$CDM model. We
also present comparative analyses of the interaction models with the companion
models, namely, $\Lambda$CDM, $\nu\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\nu w$CDM. In both
the interaction models, we find non-zero coupling in the dark sector up to 99\%
CL with energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum energy, and observe a
phantom-like behavior of the effective dark energy without actual ``phantom
crossing"". The well-known tensions on the cosmological parameters $H_0$ and
$\sigma_8$, prevailing within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, are relaxed
significantly in these models wherein the $\nu$I$\Lambda$CDM model shows
consistency with the standard effective neutrino mass and number. Both the
interaction models find a better fit to the combined data compared to the
companion models under consideration.

phenomenology, ranging from a metal-insulator transition, intriguing
thermodynamic behavior, and a putative spin liquid phase at intermediate
coupling, ultimately becoming a magnetic insulator at strong coupling. In this
multimethod study, we combine a finite-temperature tensor network method,
minimally entangled thermal typical states (METTS), with two
Green-function-based methods, connected-determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo
and cellular dynamical mean-field theory, to establish several aspects of this
model. We elucidate the evolution from the metallic to the insulating regime
from the complementary perspectives brought by these different methods. We
compute the full thermodynamics of the model on a width-four cylinder using
METTS in the intermediate to strong coupling regime. We find that the
insulating state hosts a large entropy at intermediate temperatures, which
increases with the strength of the coupling. Correspondingly, and consistently
with a thermodynamic Maxwell relation, the double occupancy has a minimum as a
function of temperature which is the manifestation of the Pomeranchuk effect of
increased localization upon heating. The intermediate coupling regime is found
to exhibit both pronounced chiral as well as stripy antiferromagnetic spin
correlations. We propose a scenario in which time-reversal symmetry-broken

of existing optimization algorithms. However, when introducing a new component
into an existing algorithm, assessing its potential benefits is a challenging
task. Often, the component is added to a default implementation of the
underlying algorithm and compared against a limited set of other variants. This
assessment ignores any potential interplay with other algorithmic ideas that
share the same base algorithm, which is critical in understanding the exact
contributions being made. We introduce a more extensive procedure, which uses
hyperparameter tuning as a means of assessing the benefits of new algorithmic
components. This allows for a more robust analysis by not only focusing on the
impact on performance, but also by investigating how this performance is
achieved. We implement our suggestion in the context of the Modular CMA-ES
framework, which was redesigned and extended to include some new modules and
several new options for existing modules, mostly focused on the step-size
adaptation method. Our analysis highlights the differences between these new
modules, and identifies the situations in which they have the largest
contribution.

broadly used to grapple with low voltage and voltage instability issues in

which poses time-varying requirements to UVLS, is integrated into the states

of a set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $d>n$. The first
one is to consider the classical Reifenberg-flat numbers $\alpha(x,r)$ ($x \in
S$, $r>0$), which measure the minimal scaling-invariant Hausdorff distances in
$B_r(x)$ between $S$ and $n$-dimensional affine subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$.
The second is an `intrinsic' approach in which we view the same set $S$ as a
metric space (endowed with the induced Euclidean distance). Then we consider
numbers ${\sf a}(x,r)$'s, that are the scaling-invariant Gromov-Hausdorff
distances between balls centered at $x$ of radius $r$ in $S$ and the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean ball of the same radius. As main result of our
analysis we make rigorous a phenomenon, first noted by David and Toro, for
which the numbers ${\sf a}(x,r)$'s behaves as the square of the numbers
$\alpha(x,r)$'s. Moreover we show how this result finds application in
extending the Cheeger-Colding intrinsic-Reifenberg theorem to the biLipschitz

the Jones' numbers $\beta$'s (i.e. the one-sided version of the numbers
$\alpha$'s).

in this paper we propose a dual mutual information neural estimation (MINE)
based neural secure communications model. The security constraints of this
method is constructed only with the input and output signal samples of the
legal and eavesdropper channels and benefit that training the encoder is
completely independent of the decoder. Moreover, since the design of secure
coding does not rely on the eavesdropper's decoding results, the security
performance would not be affected by the eavesdropper's decoding means.
Numerical results show that the performance of our model is guaranteed whether
the eavesdropper learns the decoder himself or uses the legal decoder.

In this step, a one-dimensional curvilinear stencil is assembled for each edge
to perform one-dimensional fast non-uniform WENO interpolation derived in this

The second step is to compute the divergence of fluxes at each vertex from the

of accuracy of the spatial scheme. After that, explicit RungeKutta time

the unknown-transition setting suffers from a larger sharp rate

established by proving a two-way reduction between IL and the value estimation
problem of the unknown expert policy under any given reward function, as well
as building connections with linear functional estimation with subsampled
observations. We further show that under the additional assumption that the
expert is optimal for the true reward function, there exists an efficient
algorithm, which we term as Mimic-Mixture, that provably achieves suboptimality
$O(1/N)$ for arbitrary 3-state MDPs with rewards only at the terminal layer. In
contrast, no algorithm can achieve suboptimality $O(\sqrt{H}/N)$ with high

remarkable breakthroughs in development of vaccines against the virus and the
launch of several phase 3 vaccine trials in Summer 2020 to evaluate vaccine
efficacy (VE). Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems
developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94-95%,
leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use
Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the
trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time.
Ethical considerations dictate that all trial participants be unblinded and
those randomized to placebo be offered vaccine, leading to trial protocol
amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to
vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular
features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a
potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on
whether or not VE wanes over time and estimation of VE at any post-vaccination
time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual- and
population-level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who

stressors-including stress from man-made chemicals is important for
conservation management, the ecological risk assessment of chemicals, and many
other ecological applications. Our current ability to predict and analyse the
joint effects of multiple stressors is insufficient to make the prospective
risk assessment of chemicals more ecologically relevant because we lack a full
understanding of how organisms respond to stress factors alone and in
combination. Here, we describe a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) based
bioenergetics model that predicts the potential effects of single or multiple
natural and chemical stressors on life history traits. We demonstrate the
plausibility of the model using a meta-analysis of 128 existing studies on
freshwater invertebrates. We then validate our model by comparing its
predictions for a combination of three stressors (i.e. chemical, temperature,
and food availability) with new, independent experimental data on life history
traits in the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia. We found that the model predictions
are in agreement with observed growth curves and reproductive traits. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of
three stress factors on life history traits observed in laboratory studies have
been predicted successfully in invertebrates. We suggest that a re-analysis of
existing studies on multiple stressors within the modelling framework outlined
here will provide a robust null model for identifying stressor interactions,
and expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will arise
from these new analyses. Bioenergetics modelling could be applied more broadly
to support environmental management decision making.

However, the storage solutions were complex and less optimal. This is because

development of caching, scheduling and governance plugins. Together, they
manage the entire lifecycle of the custom resource Dataset.
  We use Dataset Lifecycle Framework to serve data from object stores to both

fed into ML models directly without being downloaded to the local disks, which
makes the input scalable. We have enhanced the durability of training metadata
by storing it into a dataset, which also simplifies the set up of the
Tensorboard, separated from the notebook server. For the non-ML pipeline, we
have simplified the 1000 Genome Project pipeline with datasets injected into

Counts are then retrieved as the number of detected items.
  Specifically, we adopt a UNet-like architecture leveraging residual units and
an extended bottleneck for enlarging the field-of-view. In addition, we make
use of weighted maps that penalize the errors on cells boundaries increasingly
with overcrowding. These changes provide more context and force the model to
focus on relevant features during pixel-wise classification. As a result, the
model performance is enhanced, especially in presence of clumping cells,
artifacts and confounding biological structures. Posterior assessment of the
results with domain experts confirms that the model detects cells of interest
correctly. The model demonstrates a human-level ability inasmuch even erroneous

break through the constraints of the differential equation model due to the

performance of DDPG is usually degraded by unreasonable reward function design,
insufficient training, and low sampling efficiency. In order to solve this kind
of problem, a hybrid car-following strategy based on DDPG and cooperative
adaptive cruise control (CACC) is proposed. First, the car-following process is
modeled as the Markov decision process to calculate CACC and DDPG

from CACC and DDPG, respectively. Then, an optimal action, corresponding to the
one offering a larger reward, is chosen as the output of the hybrid strategy.
Meanwhile, a rule is designed to ensure that the change rate of acceleration is
smaller than the desired value. Therefore, the proposed strategy not only
guarantees the basic performance of car-following through CACC but also makes
full use of the advantages of exploration on complex environments via DDPG.
Finally, simulation results show that the car-following performance of the

memory bandwidth bottlenecks leading to significant computing and energy

context, the Linear-Inverse-Modeling (LIM) approach, by capturing a few
essential interactions between dynamical components of the full system, has
proven valuable in providing insights into predictability of the full system.
We demonstrate that Reservoir Computing (RC), a form of learning suitable for
systems with chaotic dynamics, provides an alternative nonlinear approach that
improves on the predictive skill of the LIM approach. We do this in the example
setting of predicting sea-surface-temperature in the North Atlantic in the
pre-industrial control simulation of a popular earth system model, the
Community-Earth-System-Model so that we can compare the performance of the new
RC based approach with the traditional LIM approach both when learning data is
plentiful and when such data is more limited. The improved predictive skill of
the RC approach over a wide range of conditions -- larger number of retained
EOF coefficients, extending well into the limited data regime, etc. -- suggests
that this machine-learning technique may have a use in climate predictability
studies. While the possibility of developing a climate emulator -- the ability
to continue the evolution of the system on the attractor long after failing to
be able to track the reference trajectory -- is demonstrated in the Lorenz-63

resolution of the map is 26"", which corresponds to $\sim$ 0.05 pc at a distance

the C$^{18}$O fractional abundance and find that it is roughly constant over
the column density range of $\lesssim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$, although
a trend of C$^{18}$O depletion is determined toward higher column density.
Therefore, C$^{18}$O intensity can follow the cloud structure reasonably well.
The mean C$^{18}$O abundance in Orion A is estimated to be
5.7$\times$10$^{-7}$, which is about 3 times larger than the fiducial value. We
identified 746 C$^{18}$O cores with astrodendro and classified 709 cores as
starless cores. We compute the core masses by decomposing the Herschel-Planck
dust column density using the relative proportions of the C$^{18}$O integrated
intensities of line-of-sight components. Applying this procedure, we attempt to
remove the contribution of the background emission, i.e., the ambient gas
outside the cores. Then, we derived mass function for starless cores and found
that it resembles the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The CMF for starless
cores, $dN/dM$, is fitted with a power-law relation of $M^\alpha$ with a power
index of $\alpha = -$2.25$\pm$ 0.16 at the high-mass slope ($\gtrsim$ 0.44
$M_\odot$). We also found that the ratio of each core mass to the total mass
integrated along the line of sight is significantly large. Therefore, in the
previous studies, the core masses derived from the dust image are likely to be
overestimated at least by a factor of a few. Accordingly, such previous studies
may underestimate the star formation efficiency of individual cores.

  Determines the Final Stellar Masses?","13 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJL",,"10.3847/2041-8213/abe7dd",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Applying dendrogram analysis to the CARMA-NRO C$^{18}$O ($J$=1--0) data
having an angular resolution of $\sim$ 8"", we identified 692 dense cores in the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) region. Using this core sample, we compare the core
and initial stellar mass functions in the same area to quantify the step from
cores to stars. About 22 \% of the identified cores are gravitationally bound.
The derived core mass function (CMF) for starless cores has a slope similar to
Salpeter's stellar initial mass function (IMF) for the mass range above 1
$M_\odot$, consistent with previous studies. Our CMF has a peak at a subsolar
mass of $\sim$ 0.1 $M_\odot$, which is comparable to the peak mass of the IMF
derived in the same area. We also find that the current star formation rate is
consistent with the picture in which stars are born only from self-gravitating
starless cores. However, the cores must gain additional gas from the
surroundings to reproduce the current IMF (e.g., its slope and peak mass),
because the core mass cannot be accreted onto the star with a 100\% efficiency.
Thus, the mass accretion from the surroundings may play a crucial role in
determining the final stellar masses of stars.

important task. In particular, code clone detection can have significant uses
in the context of vulnerability discovery, refactoring and plagiarism
detection. However, false positives are inevitable and always require manual
reviews. In this paper, we propose Twin-Finder+, a novel closed-loop approach
for pointer-related code clone detection that integrates machine learning and
symbolic execution techniques to achieve precision. Twin-Finder+ introduces a
formal verification mechanism to automate such manual reviews process. Our
experimental results show Twin-Finder+ that can remove 91.69% false positives
in average. We further conduct security analysis for memory safety using
real-world applications, Links version 2.14 and libreOffice-6.0.0.1.
Twin-Finder+ is able to find 6 unreported bugs in Links version 2.14 and one
public patched bug in libreOffice-6.0.0.1.
