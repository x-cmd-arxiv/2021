counting matchings of a given size, or more generally sampling/counting
monomer-dimer systems in planar, not-necessarily-bipartite, graphs. While
perfect matchings on planar graphs can be counted exactly in polynomial time,
counting non-perfect matchings was shown by [Jer87] to be #P-hard, who also
raised the question of whether efficient approximate counting is possible. We
answer this affirmatively by showing that the multi-site Glauber dynamics on
the set of monomers in a monomer-dimer system always mixes rapidly, and that
this dynamics can be implemented efficiently on downward-closed families of
graphs where counting perfect matchings is tractable. As further applications
of our results, we show how to sample efficiently using multi-site Glauber
dynamics from partition-constrained strongly Rayleigh distributions, and
nonsymmetric determinantal point processes.
  In order to analyze mixing properties of the multi-site Glauber dynamics, we
establish two notions for generating polynomials of discrete set-valued
distributions: sector-stability and fractional log-concavity. These notions
generalize well-studied properties like real-stability and log-concavity, but
unlike them robustly degrade under useful transformations applied to the
distribution. We relate these notions to pairwise correlations in the
underlying distribution and the notion of spectral independence introduced by
[ALO20], providing a new tool for establishing spectral independence based on
geometry of polynomials. As a byproduct of our techniques, we show that
polynomials avoiding roots in a sector of the complex plane must satisfy what
we call fractional log-concavity; this extends a classic result established by
[Gar59] who showed homogeneous polynomials that have no roots in a half-plane
must be log-concave over the positive orthant.

(customers) and supply (workers) that arrive randomly over time and may be lost

cumulative value of matches, minus costs incurred when demand and supply wait.
We develop a fluid model, that approximates the evolution of the stochastic
model, and captures explicitly the nonlinear dependence between the amount of
demand and supply waiting and the distribution of their patience times. The
fluid model invariant states approximate the steady-state mean queue-lengths in
the stochastic system, and, therefore, can be used to develop an optimization
problem whose optimal solution provides matching rates between demand and
supply types that are asymptotically optimal (on fluid scale, as demand and
supply rates grow large). We propose a discrete review matching policy that
asymptotically achieves the optimal matching rates. We further show that when
the aforementioned matching optimization problem has an optimal extreme point
solution, which occurs when the patience time distributions have increasing
hazard rate functions, a state-independent priority policy, that ranks the
edges on the bipartite graph connecting demand and supply, is asymptotically
optimal. A key insight from this analysis is that the ranking critically
depends on the patience time distributions, and may be different for different
distributions even if they have the same mean, demonstrating that models
assuming, e.g., exponential patience times for tractability, may lack
robustness. Finally, we observe that when holding costs are zero, a discrete
review policy, that does not require knowledge of inter-arrival and patience
time distributions, is asymptotically optimal.

based network with perceptual loss is trained on a benchmark dataset and
fine-tuned using one subject-specific static high resolution MRI as prior
knowledge to obtain high resolution dynamic images during the inference stage.
3D dynamic data for three subjects were acquired with different parameters to
test the generalisation capabilities of the network. The method was tested for
different levels of in-plane undersampling for dynamic MRI. The reconstructed
dynamic SR results after fine-tuning showed higher similarity with the high
resolution ground-truth, while quantitatively achieving statistically
significant improvement. The average SSIM of the lowest resolution experimented
during this research (6.25~\% of the k-space) before and after fine-tuning were
0.939 $\pm$ 0.008 and 0.957 $\pm$ 0.006 respectively. This could theoretically
result in an acceleration factor of 16, which can potentially be acquired in

emerged in recent years as a major platform for Kitaev spin liquid physics,
where spins fractionalize into emergent magnetic fluxes and Majorana fermions
with Dirac-like dispersions. While such exotic states are usually pre-empted by
long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, signatures of Majorana fermions
with long coherent times have been predicted to manifest at intermediate and
higher energy scales, similar to the observation of spinons in quasi-1D spin
chains. Here we present a Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering study of the
magnetic excitations of the hyperhoneycomb iridate $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ under
a magnetic field with a record-high-resolution spectrometer. At
low-temperatures, dispersing spin waves can be resolved around the predicted
intertwined incommensurate spiral and field-induced zigzag orders, whose
excitation energy reaches a maximum of 16meV. A 2T magnetic field softens the
dispersion around ${\bf Q}=0$. The behavior of the spin waves under magnetic
field is consistent with our semiclassical calculations for the ground state
and the dynamical spin structure factor, which further predicts that the ensued
intertwined uniform states remain robust up to very high fields (100 T). Most
saliently, the low-energy magnon-like mode is superimposed by a broad continuum
of excitations, centered around 35meV and extending up to 100meV. This
high-energy continuum survives up to at least 300K -- well above the ordering
temperature of 38K -- and gives evidence for pairs of long-lived Majorana
fermions of the proximate Kitaev spin liquid.

an original perturbation scheme which circumvents this problem by treating both
the perturbations due to rotation and (weak) entrainment simultaneously.
Applying this scheme, we propose a simple method for calculating the superfluid
r-mode eigenfrequency in the limit of vanishing rotation rate. We also
calculate the r-mode spectrum at finite rotation rate for realistic
microphysics input (adopting, however, the Newtonian framework and Cowling
approximation when considering perturbed oscillation equations) and show that
the normal r-mode exhibits resonances with superfluid r-modes at certain values
of temperatures and rotation frequencies in the parameter range relevant to
neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). This turns the recently
suggested phenomenological model of resonance r-mode stabilization into a
quantitative theory, capable of explaining observations. A strong dependence of

allows us to constrain the latter by confronting our calculations with the

the input image with respect to a bounding box calculated during

Interest~(RoIs). Peripheral regions like hair are ignored and nearby faces that
are partially included in the bounding box can cause distractions. Moreover,
these methods are only trained and evaluated on near-frontal portrait images
and thus their performance for in-the-wild cases has been unexplored. To
address these issues, this paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce
iBugMask dataset for face parsing in the wild, which consists of 21,866
training images and 1,000 testing images. The training images are obtained by
augmenting an existing dataset with large face poses. The testing images are
manually annotated with $11$ facial regions and there are large variations in
sizes, poses, expressions and background. Second, we propose RoI Tanh-polar
transform that warps the whole image to a Tanh-polar representation with a
fixed ratio between the face area and the context, guided by the target
bounding box. The new representation contains all information in the original
image, and allows for rotation equivariance in the convolutional neural
networks~(CNNs). Third, we propose a hybrid residual representation learning
block, coined HybridBlock, that contains convolutional layers in both the
Tanh-polar space and the Tanh-Cartesian space, allowing for receptive fields of
different shapes in CNNs. Through extensive experiments, we show that the
proposed method improves the state-of-the-art for face parsing in the wild and
does not require facial landmarks for alignment.

We demonstrate that normalizing flows are particularly well suited as a Monte

repeated evaluation of high-dimensional integrals across smoothly varying
integrands and integration regions. As an example, we consider the
finite-temperature nuclear equation of state. An important advantage of
normalizing flows is the ability to build highly expressive models of the

nuclear free energy and its derivatives. Furthermore, we show that a
normalizing flow model trained on one target integrand can be used to
efficiently calculate related integrals when the temperature, density, or
nuclear force is varied. This work will support future efforts to build
microscopic equations of state for numerical simulations of supernovae and
neutron star mergers that employ state-of-the-art nuclear forces and many-body

mitigate and address some of the major global environmental challenges.
Specifically, the organic carbon stored in soils, called Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC), can, through proper soil management, help offset fuel emissions,
increase food productivity, and improve water quality. As collecting data on
SOC is costly and time consuming, not much data on SOC is available, although
understanding the spatial variability in SOC is of fundamental importance for
effective soil management.
  In this manuscript, we propose a modeling framework that can be used to gain
a better understanding of the dependence structure of a spatial process by
identifying regions within a spatial domain where the process displays the same
spatial correlation range. To achieve this goal, we propose a generalization of
the Multi-Resolution Approximation (M-RA) modeling framework of Katzfuss (2017)
originally introduced as a strategy to reduce the computational burden
encountered when analyzing massive spatial datasets.
  To allow for the possibility that the correlation of a spatial process might
be characterized by a different range in different subregions of a spatial
domain, we provide the M-RA basis functions weights with a two-component
mixture prior with one of the mixture components a shrinking prior. We call our
approach the mixture M-RA. Application of the mixture M-RA model to both
stationary and non-stationary data shows that the mixture M-RA model can handle
both types of data, can correctly establish the type of spatial dependence
structure in the data (e.g. stationary vs not), and can identify regions of
local stationarity.

meaning in artworks is the identifications of figures (actors). In Christian
art, specifically, one must identify the actors in order to identify the
Biblical episode or story depicted, an important step in understanding the
artwork. We designed an automatic system based on deep convolutional neural

specificities in its applications and the numerical method.
  Methods: We describe in this two-part paper a new ultrasound simulator
(SIMUS) for MATLAB, which belongs to the MATLAB UltraSound Toolbox (MUST). The
SIMUS software simulates acoustic pressure fields and radiofrequency RF signals
for uniform linear or convex probes. SIMUS is an open-source software whose

goal was to offer a comprehensive turnkey tool, along with a detailed theory

  Results: This article describes in detail the underlying linear theory of
SIMUS and provides examples of simulated acoustic fields and ultrasound images.
The accompanying article (part II) is devoted to the comparison of SIMUS with
several software: Field II, k-Wave, FOCUS, and the Verasonics simulator. The

comparable with and often exceeds other relevant parameters such as Hund's
coupling $J_{\rm H}$, noncubic crystal field splitting $\Delta$, and the

  This paper presents a parameter-free instance-based learning algorithm using

In our experiments, the resulting classifier bettered $KNN$ for any $k$ in a

majority rules to both kNN and HSP classifiers.
  Surprisingly, when using a probabilistic index to approximate the HSP graph

electrolysis or biomedical applications. The exact nature of these very dynamic
plasmas and most important their ignition physics are strongly debated. The
ignition itself may be explained by two competing hypothesis: (i) ignition via
field effects or (ii) via electron multiplication in nanovoids. Both hypothesis
are supported by theory, but experimental data are very sparse due to the
difficulty to monitor the very fast processes in space and time. In this paper,
we are using fast camera measurements and fast emission spectroscopy of
nanosecond plasmas in water applying a positive and a negative polarity to a
sharp tungsten electrode. It is shown that plasma ignition is dominated by
field effects at the electrode-liquid interface either as field ionization for
positive polarity or as field emission for negative polarity. This leads to a
hot tungsten surface at a temperature of 7000 K for positive polarity, whereas
the surface temperature is much lower for the negative polarity. At ignition,
the electron density reaches 4 $\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ for positive and only
2 $\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ for the negative polarity. At the same time, the
emission of the \Ha~light for the positive polarity is 4 times higher than that
for the negative polarity. During plasma propagation, the electron densities
are almost identical of the order of a 1 to 2 $\cdot$ 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$ and
decay after the end of the pulse over 15 ns. It is concluded that plasma
propagation is governed by field effects in a low density region that is
created either by nanovoids or by density fluctuation in super critical water
surrounding the electrode that is created by the pressure at the moment of
plasma ignition.

development of a number of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models. In this
study, we aim to better understand the connection between certain CG
parametrization strategies and the dynamical properties and transferability of
the resulting models. We systematically compare five CG models: a model largely
parametrized from experimental thermodynamic observables; a refinement of this
model to increase its structural accuracy; and three models that reproduce a
given set of structural distribution functions by construction, with varying
intramolecular parametrizations and reference temperatures. All five CG models
display limited structural transferability over temperature, and also result in
various effective dynamical speedup factors, relative to a reference atomistic
model. On the other hand, the structure-based CG models tend to result in more
consistent cation-anion relative diffusion than the thermodynamic-based models,
for a single thermodynamic state point. By linking short- and long-timescale
dynamical behaviors, we demonstrate that the varying dynamical properties of
the different coarse-grained models can be largely collapsed onto a single
curve, which provides evidence for a route to constructing
dynamically-consistent CG models of RTILs.

the state-of-the-art unconditional generator. We identify and analyze the
existence of a distortion-editability tradeoff and a distortion-perception
tradeoff within the StyleGAN latent space. We then suggest two principles for
designing encoders in a manner that allows one to control the proximity of the
inversions to regions that StyleGAN was originally trained on. We present an
encoder based on our two principles that is specifically designed for
facilitating editing on real images by balancing these tradeoffs. By evaluating
its performance qualitatively and quantitatively on numerous challenging
domains, including cars and horses, we show that our inversion method, followed
by common editing techniques, achieves superior real-image editing quality,
with only a small reconstruction accuracy drop.

fine-grained patchy image classification. The key challenge of fine-grained
patchy image classification lies in two folds, ultra-fine-grained
inter-category variances among objects and very few data available for
training. This motivates us to consider employing more useful supervision
signal to train a discriminative model within limited training samples.
Specifically, the proposed MGA integrates a pre-trained semantic segmentation
model that produces auxiliary supervision signal, i.e., patchy attention mask,
enabling a discriminative representation learning. The patchy attention mask
drives the classifier to filter out the insignificant parts of images (e.g.,
common features between different categories), which enhances the robustness of
MGA for the fine-grained patchy image classification. We verify the
effectiveness of our method on three publicly available patchy image datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our MGA method achieves superior
performance on three datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In
addition, our ablation study shows that MGA improves the accuracy by 2.25% and
2% on the SoyCultivarVein and BtfPIS datasets, indicating its practicality
towards solving the fine-grained patchy image classification.

For confinement ratio d/h = 1.2, the tightly confined disk-like droplets in the

the meniscus that drives the imbibition, there is a droplet-free region,
separated from the suspension region by a sharp concentration front. The
suspension exhibits strong droplet density and velocity fluctuations, but on
average, the suspension domain remains uniform. For weaker confinement, d/h =
0.65, the spherical droplets move faster than the average suspension flow,
resulting in the formation of a dynamically unstable high-concentration region
near the meniscus. We describe the macroscopic suspension dynamics using linear
transport equations for the particle-phase flux and suspension flux that are
driven by the local pressure gradient. A dipolar particle interaction model
explains the observed large density and velocity fluctuations in terms of the

about a fully autonomous vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them
coexist. In the last few years, a variety of external interfaces have been
proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including
vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and
road infrastructure interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays).
These designs were experimented in different settings, using mockups, specially
prepared vehicles, or virtual environments, with heterogeneous evaluation
metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR) have been
proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet.
This paper aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a
comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces and new designs under common
conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation was
developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing
in urban environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then
performed to investigate the various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian
interaction leveraging objective and subjective metrics. Even though no
interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the AR
designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the
cost of higher cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels
showing anthropomorphic features. Together with rankings on the various
dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks of the various
alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information
for next developments in the field.

in determining their mass-loss rates and overall spatial distribution within a
host halo. Haloes in cosmological simulations grow by a combination of
relatively smooth accretion and more violent mergers, and both processes will
modify subhalo orbits. To isolate the impact of the smooth growth of the host
halo from other relevant mechanisms, we study subhalo orbital evolution using
numerical calculations in which subhaloes are modelled as massless particles
orbiting in a time-varying spherical potential. We find that the radial action
of the subhalo orbit decreases over the first few orbits, indicating that the
response to the growth of the host halo is not adiabatic during this phase. The
subhalo orbits can shrink by a factor of $\sim$1.5 in this phase. Subsequently,
the radial action is well conserved and orbital contraction slows down. We
propose a model accurately describing the orbital evolution. Given these
results, we consider the spatial distribution of the population of subhaloes
identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that it is
consistent with this population having been accreted at z < 3, indicating that
any subhaloes accreted earlier are unresolved in the simulations. We also
discuss tidal stripping as a formation scenario for NGC1052-DF2, an ultra
diffuse galaxy significantly lacking DM, and find that its expected DM mass
could be consistent with observational constraints if its progenitor was
accreted early enough, z > 1.5, although it should still be a relatively rare

a complementary approach to GCE models, which can estimate isotopic abundances

fit to observational Sculptor abundance data to tune the free parameters. The
completed model gives the average isotopic history of Sculptor for massive

find that Type Ia SNe contribute $\approx$ 86 per cent to the late stage

features for categorical time series classification, we consider two relevant
quantities: the spectral envelope and its corresponding set of optimal
scalings. These quantities characterize oscillatory patterns in a categorical
time series as the largest possible power at each frequency, or spectral
envelope, obtained by assigning numerical values, or scalings, to categories
that optimally emphasize oscillations at each frequency. Our procedure combines
these two quantities to produce an interpretable and parsimonious feature-based
classifier that can be used to accurately determine group membership for
categorical time series. Classification consistency of the proposed method is
investigated, and simulation studies are used to demonstrate accuracy in
classifying categorical time series with various underlying group structures.
Finally, we use the proposed method to explore key differences in oscillatory
patterns of sleep stage time series for patients with different sleep disorders
and accurately classify patients accordingly.

several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, there is limited

explaining a popularly used technique for avoiding catastrophic forgetting:
quadratic regularization. We show that quadratic regularizers prevent
forgetting of past tasks by interpolating current and previous values of model
parameters at every training iteration. Over multiple training iterations, this
interpolation operation reduces the learning rates of more important model
parameters, thereby minimizing their movement. Our analysis also reveals two
drawbacks of quadratic regularization: (a) dependence of parameter
interpolation on training hyperparameters, which often leads to training
instability and (b) assignment of lower importance to deeper layers, which are
generally the place forgetting occurs in DNNs. Via a simple modification to the
order of operations, we show these drawbacks can be easily avoided, resulting

statistically most frequent scenario.
  Methods: We studied a large sample of active regions recorded by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument. The sample was split into two
groups: forming (367 members) and decaying (679 members) active regions. We
tracked individual dark features (i.e. those that are assumed to be intensity
counterparts of magnetised fragments from small objects to proper sunspots) and
followed their evolution. We investigated the statistically most often
locations of fragment merging and splitting as well as their properties.
  Results: Our results confirm that statistically, sunspots form by merging
events of smaller fragments. The coalescence process is driven by turbulent
diffusion in a process similar to random-walk, where supergranular flows seem
to play an important role. The number of appearing fragments does not seem to
significantly correlate with the number of sunspots formed. The formation seems
to be consistent with the magnetic field accumulation. Statistically, the
merging occurs most often between a large and a much smaller object. The decay
of the active region seems to take place preferably by a process similar to the
erosion.

progressively learns restoration functions for the degraded inputs, thereby
breaking down the overall recovery process into more manageable steps.
Specifically, our model first learns the contextualized features using
encoder-decoder architectures and later combines them with a high-resolution
branch that retains local information. At each stage, we introduce a novel
per-pixel adaptive design that leverages in-situ supervised attention to
reweight the local features. A key ingredient in such a multi-stage
architecture is the information exchange between different stages. To this end,
we propose a two-faceted approach where the information is not only exchanged
sequentially from early to late stages, but lateral connections between feature
processing blocks also exist to avoid any loss of information. The resulting
tightly interlinked multi-stage architecture, named as MPRNet, delivers strong
performance gains on ten datasets across a range of tasks including image

generators chosen uniformly at random, with $1 \ll \log k \ll \log |G|$; denote
it $G_k$. A conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985) asserts, for $k \gg \log
|G|$, that the random walk on this graph exhibits cutoff. Further, the cutoff
time should be a function only of $k$ and $|G|$, to sub-leading order. This was
verified for all Abelian groups in the '90s. We extend the conjecture to $1 \ll
k \lesssim \log |G|$. We establish cutoff for all Abelian groups under the
condition $k - d(G) \gg 1$, where $d(G)$ is the minimal size of a generating
subset of $G$, which is almost optimal. The cutoff time is described
(abstractly) in terms of the entropy of random walk on $\mathbb Z^k$. This
abstract definition allows us to deduce that the cutoff time can be written as
a function only of $k$ and $|G|$ when $d(G) \ll \log |G|$ and $k - d(G) \asymp
k \gg 1$; this is not the case when $d(G) \asymp \log |G| \asymp k$. For
certain regimes of $k$, we find the limit profile of the convergence to
equilibrium. Wilson (1997) conjectured that $\mathbb Z_2^d$ gives rise to the
slowest mixing time for $G_k$ amongst all groups of size at most $2^d$. We give
a partial answer, verifying the conjecture for nilpotent groups. This is
obtained via a comparison result of independent interest between the mixing
times of nilpotent $G$ and a corresponding Abelian group $\overline G$, namely
the direct sum of the Abelian quotients in the lower central series of $G$. We
use this to refine a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994): we show for
nilpotent $G$ that $G_k$ is an expander provided $k - d(\overline G) \gtrsim
\log |G|$. As another consequence, we establish cutoff for nilpotent groups
with relatively small commutators, including high-dimensional special groups,

aiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The
field has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which
exhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted
pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their
outputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and
is the problem addressed in the paper.
  Previous work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment
score for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained
approach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word
level. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to
leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training
instance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring
procedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive
evaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio
benchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of
the proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control
hallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further
experiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be
successfully used on very noisy settings.

far. Here we show that charge-$4e$ phase can arise as a vestigial order above
the nematic superconducting transition temperature in time-reversal-invariant
nematic superconductors. On the one hand, the nontrivial topological defect --
nematic vortex -- is energetically favored over the superconducting phase
vortex when the nematic stiffness is less than the superfluid stiffness;
consequently the charge-$4e$ phase emerges by proliferation of nematic vortices
upon increasing temperatures. On the other hand, the Ginzburg-Landau theory of
the nematic superconductors has two distinct decoupling channels to either
charge-$4e$ orders or nematic orders; by analyzing the competition between the
effective mass of the charge-$4e$ order and the cubic potential of the nematic
order, we find a sizable regime where the charge-$4e$ order is favored. These
two analysis consistently show that nematic superconductors can provide a
promising route to realize charge-$4e$ phases, which may apply to candidate
nematic superconductors such as PbTaSe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene.

possible if the observed objects can be reliably classified. Spectroscopic
observations are infeasible with more distant targets, and so we wish to
determine whether machine learning methods can classify massive stars using
broadband infrared photometry. We find that a Support Vector Machine classifier
is capable of coarsely classifying massive stars with labels corresponding to
hot, cool, and emission line stars with high accuracy, while rejecting
contaminating low mass giants. Remarkably, 76\% of emission line stars can be
recovered without the need for narrowband or spectroscopic observations. We
classify a sample of ${\sim}2500$ objects with no existing labels, and identify
fourteen candidate emission line objects. Unfortunately, despite the high
precision of the photometry in our sample, the heterogeneous origins of the
labels for the stars in our sample severely inhibits our classifier from
distinguishing classes of stars with more granularity. Ultimately, no large and
homogeneously labeled sample of massive stars currently exists. Without
significant efforts to robustly classify evolved massive stars -- which is
feasible given existing data from large all-sky spectroscopic surveys --
shortcomings in the labeling of existing data sets will hinder efforts to
leverage the next-generation of space observatories.

exhibit different accretion disk-corona connections compared to sub-Eddington
accreting AGNs. We find tight correlations between the X-ray-to-UV/optical
spectral slope parameter ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and the monochromatic luminosity
at $2500~\r{A}$ ($L_{\rm 2500~\r{A}}$) for both the super- and sub-Eddington
subsamples. The best-fit $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\rm 2500~\r{A}}$ relations are
consistent overall, indicating that super-Eddington accreting AGNs are not
particularly X-ray weak in general compared to sub-Eddington accreting AGNs. We
find dependences of $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ on both the Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm
Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$) and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) parameters for our full
sample. A multi-variate linear regression analysis yields $\alpha_{\rm
OX}=-0.13 {\rm log}(L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd})-0.10 {\rm log}M_{\rm BH}-0.69$,
with a scatter similar to that of the $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\rm 2500~\r{A}}$
relation. The hard (rest-frame $>2\rm ~keV$) X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$) is
strongly correlated with $L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for the full sample and the
super-Eddington subsample, but these two parameters are not significantly
correlated for the sub-Eddington subsample. A fraction of super-Eddington
accreting AGNs show strong X-ray variability, probably due to small-scale gas
absorption, and we highlight the importance of employing high-state (intrinsic)
X-ray radiation to study the accretion disk-corona connections in AGNs.

source nodes utilize carrier sensing to reduce collisions and adopt an
asynchronized sleep-wake scheduling strategy to achieve a target network
lifetime (e.g., 10 years). We use age of information (AoI) to measure the
freshness of status updates, and design sleep-wake parameters for minimizing
the weighted-sum peak AoI of the sources, subject to per-source battery
lifetime constraints. When the sensing time (i.e., the time duration of carrier
sensing) is zero, this sleep-wake design problem can be solved by resorting to
a two-layer nested convex optimization procedure; however, for positive sensing
times, the problem is non-convex. We devise a low-complexity solution to solve
this problem and prove that, for practical sensing times that are short, the
solution is within a small gap from the optimum AoI performance. When the mean
transmission time of status-update packets is unknown, we devise a
reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively performs the following two
tasks in an ``efficient way'': a) it learns the unknown parameter, b) it also
generates efficient controls that make channel access decisions. We analyze its
performance by quantifying its ``regret'', i.e., the sub-optimality gap between
its average performance and the average performance of a controller that knows
the mean transmission time. Our numerical and NS-3 simulation results show that
our solution can indeed elongate the batteries lifetime of information sources,

The expansion is proved by transforming a known formula for $p$-adic

development programs based on the limited knowledge from early stage clinical
trials. In this situation, eliciting the judgements of experts is an attractive
approach for synthesising evidence on the unknown quantities of interest. When
calculating the probability of success for a drug development program, multiple
quantities of interest - such as the effect of a drug on different endpoints -
should not be treated as unrelated.
  We discuss two approaches for establishing a multivariate distribution for
several related quantities within the SHeffield ELicitation Framework (SHELF).
The first approach elicits experts' judgements about a quantity of interest
conditional on knowledge about another one. For the second approach, we first
elicit marginal distributions for each quantity of interest. Then, for each
pair of quantities, we elicit the concordance probability that both lie on the
same side of their respective elicited medians. This allows us to specify a
copula to obtain the joint distribution of the quantities of interest.
  We show how these approaches were used in an elicitation workshop that was
performed to assess the probability of success of the registrational program of
an asthma drug. The judgements of the experts, which were obtained prior to
completion of the pivotal studies, were well aligned with the final trial
results.

result of excessive liquid accumulation, which reduces mass transfer efficiency
and causes a large pressure drop. Pressure drop measurements are typically used
as the hydrodynamic parameter for predicting flooding. They are, however, only
indicative of the occurrence of transition of the flow regime across the packed
column. They offer limited spatial information to mass transfer packed column
operators and designers. In this work, a new method using Electrical
Capacitance Tomography (ECT) is implemented for the first time so that
real-time flow regime monitoring at different vertical positions is achieved in
a countercurrent packed bed column using ECT. Two normalisation methods are
implemented to monitor the transition from pre-loading to flooding in a column
of 200 mm diameter, 1200 mm height filled with plastic structured packing.
Liquid distribution in the column can be qualitatively visualised via
reconstructed ECT images. A flooding index is implemented to quantitatively
indicate the progression of local flooding. In experiments, the degree of local
flooding is quantified at various gas flow rates and locations of ECT sensor.
ECT images were compared with pressure drop and visual observation. The
experimental results demonstrate that ECT is capable of monitoring liquid
distribution, identifying flow regime transitions and predicting local
flooding.

from the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) which were obtained in the
large wavenumber limit. DNS are performed at various Reynolds numbers and the
correlations are analyzed in different time regimes focusing on the large
wavenumbers. At small time delays, we find that the two-point correlation
function decays as a Gaussian in the variable $kt$ where $k$ is the wavenumber
and $t$ the time delay. The three-point correlation function, determined from
the time-dependent advection-velocity correlations, also follows a Gaussian
decay at small $t$ with the same prefactor as the one of the two-point
function. These behaviors are in precise agreement with the FRG results, and
can be simply understood as a consequence of sweeping. At large time delays,
the FRG predicts a crossover to an exponential in $k^2 t$, which we were not
able to resolve in our simulations. However, we analyze the two-point
spatio-temporal correlations of the modulus of the velocity, and show that they
exhibit this crossover from a Gaussian to an exponential decay, although we

orders of magnitude difference in length scale. The fluidized state furthermore
highlights capillary attraction, as expected for liquid capillary bridges. This

on previous actions leads to a dramatic divergence between ""held out"" error and
performance of the learner in situ. Interactive approaches can provably address
this divergence but require repeated querying of a demonstrator. Recent work
identifies this divergence as stemming from a ""causal confound"" in predicting
the current action, and seek to ablate causal aspects of current state using
tools from causal inference. In this work, we argue instead that this
divergence is simply another manifestation of covariate shift, exacerbated
particularly by settings of feedback between decisions and input features. The
learner often comes to rely on features that are strongly predictive of
decisions, but are subject to strong covariate shift.
  Our work demonstrates a broad class of problems where this shift can be
mitigated, both theoretically and practically, by taking advantage of a
simulator but without any further querying of expert demonstration. We analyze
existing benchmarks used to test imitation learning approaches and find that
these benchmarks are realizable and simple and thus insufficient for capturing
the harder regimes of error compounding seen in real-world decision making
problems. We find, in a surprising contrast with previous literature, but
consistent with our theory, that naive behavioral cloning provides excellent
results. We detail the need for new standardized benchmarks that capture the
phenomena seen in robotics problems.

set of overlapping substrings of a genome, the aim is to reconstruct the source

about such overlaps. For genome assembly algorithms, these graphs present a
trade-off between overlap information stored and scalability. Thus,
Hierarchical Overlap Graph (HOG) was proposed to overcome the limitations of
both these approaches.
  For a given set $P$ of $n$ strings, the first algorithm to compute HOG was
given by Cazaux and Rivals [IPL20] requiring $O(||P||+n^2)$ time using
superlinear space, where $||P||$ is the cumulative sum of the lengths of
strings in $P$. This was improved by Park et al. [SPIRE20] to $O(||P||\log n)$
time and $O(||P||)$ space using segment trees, and further to
$O(||P||\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ for the word RAM model. Both these results
described an open problem to compute HOG in optimal $O(||P||)$ time and space.
In this paper, we achieve the desired optimal bounds by presenting a simple
algorithm that does not use any complex data structures. At its core, our
solution improves the classical result [IPL92] for a special case of the All

However, it is still difficult to catch planet formation in-situ. Nevertheless,
from recent ALMA/SPHERE data, encouraging evidence of the direct and indirect
presence of embedded planets has been identified in disks around young stars:
co-moving point sources, gravitational perturbations, rings, cavities, and
emission dips or shadows cast on disks. The interpretation of these
observations needs a robust physical framework to deduce the complex disk
geometry. In particular, protoplanetary disk models usually assume the gas
pressure scale-height given by the ratio of the sound speed over the azimuthal
velocity $H/r = c_{s\rm }/v_{\rm k}$. By doing so, \textit{radiative} pressure
fields are often ignored, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the real
vertical structure of such disks. We follow the evolution of a gaseous disk
with an embedded Jupiter mass planet through hydrodynamical simulations,
computing the disk scale-height including radiative pressure, which was derived
from a generalization of the stellar atmosphere theory. We focus on the
vertical impact of the radiative pressure in the vicinity of circumplanetary
disks, where temperatures can reach $\gtrsim 1000$ K for an accreting planet,
and radiative forces can overcome gravitational forces from the planet. The
radiation-pressure effects create a vertical optically thick column of gas and
dust at the proto-planet location, casting a shadow in scattered light. This
mechanism could explain the peculiar illumination patterns observed in some
disks around young stars such as HD 169142 where a moving shadow has been
detected, or the extremely high aspect-ratio $H/r \sim 0.2$ observed in systems

suboptimal parameter values which do not yield the minimum eigenvalue. In this
work, we address this shortcoming by adopting the concept of variational
adiabatic quantum computing (VAQC) as a procedure to improve VQE. In VAQC, the
ground state of a continuously parameterized Hamiltonian is approximated via a

the development of a hybrid quantum-classical homotopy continuation method. The
proposed method has parallels with a predictor-corrector method for numerical
integration of differential equations. While there are theoretical limitations
to the procedure, we see in practice that VAQC can successfully find good
initial circuit parameters to initialize VQE. We demonstrate this with two
examples from quantum chemistry. Through these examples, we provide empirical
evidence that VAQC, combined with other techniques (an adaptive termination
criteria for the classical optimizer and a variance-based resampling method for
the expectation evaluation), can provide more accurate solutions than ""plain""
VQE, for the same amount of effort.

the component signals of the source are statistically independent with
'non-degenerate' second-order statistics. The latter assumption requires the
source signal to meet one of three regularity conditions which essentially
ensure that the source is sufficiently far away from the non-recoverable

cover many popular time series models and stochastic processes, allow us to
reformulate the initial problem of nonlinear blind source separation as a
simple-to-state problem of optimisation-based function approximation. We
propose to solve this approximation problem by minimizing a novel type of
objective function that efficiently quantifies the mutual statistical
dependence between multiple stochastic processes via cumulant-like statistics.

It is known that DNN classifiers may not be robust to noises: by adding a small
amount of noise to an input image, a DNN classifier may make a wrong
classification of the noisy image (i.e., in-distribution adversarial sample),
whereas it makes the right classification of the clean image. Another issue is
caused by out-of-distribution samples that are not similar to any sample in the

meaningless. In this study, we investigated the in-distribution (IND) and

networks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the
expensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time
Over-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random
sparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during
training, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold,
closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense
training. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic
Sparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its
ability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the
optimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that
have been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense
neural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support
our conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance
with ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant
performance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme
sparsity levels. When trained on CIFAR-100, our method can match the
performance of the dense model even at an extreme sparsity (98%). Code can be

  Convergence Speed","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2008.11343",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Scalable training of large models (like BERT and GPT-3) requires careful
optimization rooted in model design, architecture, and system capabilities.
From a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck,
especially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer
limited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique
to reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is
error-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under
1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only
work with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly
dependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based
optimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and
accuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that
reduces the communication volume by up to $5\times$, offers much better
scalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our
key finding is that Adam's variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a
warmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the
training (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit
Adam enables up to $3.3\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training
and up to $2.9\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning. In addition, we
provide theoretical analysis for our proposed work.

reveals its secret to a passive observer. Several notions of opacity have been
introduced in the literature. We study the notions of language-based opacity,
current-state opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-and-final-state opacity,
K-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. Comparing the notions is a natural
question that has been investigated and summarized by Wu and Lafortune, who
provided transformations among current-state opacity, initial-and-final-state
opacity, and language-based opacity, and, for prefix-closed languages, also
between language-based opacity and initial-state opacity. We extend these
results by showing that all the discussed notions of opacity are transformable
to each other. Besides a deeper insight into the differences among the notions,
the transformations have applications in complexity results. In particular, the
transformations are computable in polynomial time and preserve the number of
observable events and determinism, and hence the computational complexities of
the verification of the notions coincide. We provide a complete and improved
complexity picture of the verification of the discussed notions of opacity, and
improve the algorithmic complexity of deciding language-based opacity,
infinite-step opacity, and K-step opacity.

  Ambient temperature collected at ground level can have a higher variability
when compared to regional weather forecasts, which fail to capture the local

proposed a framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning

  Materials and Methods: We applied multi-step image classification to allow
for combined Deep Q learning and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 30
images (15 normal and 15 tumor-containing). We tested on a separate set of 30

tested a supervised deep-learning classification network on the same set of

  Results: Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data

regression-based estimation of biventricular position, for example, a symmetric
definition of coordinate directions in both ventricles is important. For the
transfer of data between different hearts as another use case, the consistency
of coordinate values across different geometries is particularly relevant. To
meet these requirements, we compare different approaches to compute coordinates
and present Cobiveco, a symmetric, consistent and intuitive biventricular
coordinate system that builds upon existing coordinate systems, but overcomes
some of their limitations. A novel one-way transfer error is introduced to
assess the consistency of the coordinates. Normalized distances along bijective
trajectories between two boundaries were found to be superior to solutions of
Laplace's equation for defining coordinate values, as they show better
linearity in space. Evaluation of transfer and linearity errors on 36 patient

radio diffuse emission in the form of halos and relics. The cluster pair
A399-A401 represents a special case: both clusters host a radio halo. Recent
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations at 140 MHz revealed the presence of a
radio bridge connecting the two clusters along with two relic candidates. These
relics include one South of A399 and the other in between the two clusters, in
proximity of a shock front detected in X-ray observations. In this paper we
present observations of the A399-A401 cluster pair at 1.7, 1.4, 1.2 GHz and 346
MHz from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). We detect the radio
halo in the A399 cluster at 346 MHz, extending up to $\sim 650$ kpc and with a
$125 \pm 6$ mJy flux density. Its spectral index between 140 MHz and 346 MHz is
$\alpha = 1.75 \pm 0.14$. The two candidate relics are also seen at 346 MHz and
we determine their spectral indices to be $\alpha = 1.10 \pm 0.14$ and $\alpha
= 1.46 \pm 0.14$. The low surface brightness bridge connecting the two clusters
is below the noise level at 346 MHz, therefore we constrain the bridge average
spectral index to be steep, i.e. $\alpha > 1.5$ at 95% confidence level. This
result favours the scenario where dynamically-induced turbulence is a viable
mechanism to reaccelerate a population of mildly relativistic particles and
amplify magnetic fields on scales of a few Mpcs.

different from other types of optical resonances in that it is cavity-less

is instead dictated by the driving sequence and can thus be used to probe the
topological characteristics of the system. We demonstrated excitation of FMRs
by edge modes in a Floquet octagon lattice on silicon-on-insulator, achieving
extrinsic quality factors greater than 10^4. Imaging of the scattered light
pattern directly revealed the hopping sequence of the Floquet system and

successfully demonstrated the ability to realize nickel infiltrated porous GaN,
where the magnetic properties were dominated by the infiltrated material
without a measurable surface contribution. We found that the structure and
magnetization of electrodeposited porous-GaN/Ni composites depended on GaN
degree of porosity and the amount of deposited nickel. The magnetization
evolves from a nearly isotropic response in the infiltrated structures, to a
shape-anisotropy controlled magnetic thin-film behaviour. Furthermore, both

have low (< 0.1%) strain and corresponding low coercivity: < 6.4 and < 2.4 kA/m

lowered strain is increased compliance of the porous GaN compared to bulk.

CNN) to estimate high-resolution traffic speed fields from sparse probe vehicle
trajectories. We introduce two key approaches that allow us to incorporate
kinematic wave theory principles to improve the robustness of existing
learning-based estimation methods. First, we propose an anisotropic traffic
kernel for the Deep CNN. The anisotropic kernel explicitly accounts for
space-time correlations in macroscopic traffic and effectively reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the Deep CNN model. Second, we propose to use
simulated data for training the Deep CNN. Using a targeted simulated data for
training provides an implicit way to impose desirable traffic physical features
on the learning model. In the experiments, we highlight the benefits of using
anisotropic kernels and evaluate the transferability of the trained model to
real-world traffic using the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) and the German
Highway Drone (HighD) datasets. The results demonstrate that anisotropic
kernels significantly reduce model complexity and model over-fitting, and
improve the physical correctness of the estimated speed fields. We find that
model complexity scales linearly with problem size for anisotropic kernels
compared to quadratic scaling for isotropic kernels. Furthermore, evaluation on
real-world datasets shows acceptable performance, which establishes that
simulation-based training is a viable surrogate to learning from real-world
data. Finally, a comparison with standard estimation techniques shows the
superior estimation accuracy of the proposed method.

based indoor climate control of multi-zone buildings to provide energy
efficiency. Unlike prior works we do not assume the availability of a
high-resolution multi-zone building model, which is challenging to obtain.
Instead, the architecture uses a low-resolution model of the building which is
divided into a small number of ""meta-zones"" that can be easily identified using
existing data-driven modeling techniques. The proposed architecture is
hierarchical. At the higher level, an MPC controller uses the low-resolution
model to make decisions for the air handling unit (AHU) and the meta-zones.
Since the meta-zones are fictitious, a lower level controller converts the
high-level MPC decisions into commands for the individual zones by solving a
projection problem that strikes a trade-off between two potentially conflicting
goals: the AHU-level decisions made by the MPC are respected while the climate
of the individual zones is maintained within the comfort bounds. The
performance of the proposed controller is assessed via simulations in a
high-fidelity simulation testbed and compared to that of a rule-based
controller that is used in practice. Simulations in multiple weather conditions
show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in terms of energy savings,
climate control, and computational tractability.

continuous transition between disordered and synchronous motion. Reinterpreting
the oscillators as rotating unit vectors, the model was extended to allow
vectors to move on the surface of D-dimensional spheres, with $D=2$
corresponding to the original model. It was shown that the transition to
synchronous dynamics was discontinuous for odd D, raising a lot of interest.
Inspired by results in 2D, Ott et al proposed an ansatz for density function
describing the oscillators and derived equations for the ansatz parameters,
effectively reducing the dimensionality of the system. Here we take a different
approach for the 3D system and construct an ansatz based on spherical harmonics
decomposition of the distribution function. Our result differs significantly

determining the dynamics of the order parameter. We derive the phase diagram of

finding good agreement in all cases. We believe our approach can be generalized

Several approaches for the estimation of Laplacian spectrum of the Kronecker

that not all the methods are practical to apply in network science models,
particularly in the context of multilayer networks. Here we develop a practical
and computationally efficient method to estimate Laplacian spectra of this

stable than the alternatives proposed in the literature. We emphasize that a

coincides with the $x$-axis, unlike the alternatives which have sudden jumps at
the beginning followed by a gradual decrease for the percentage errors. The
percentage errors confined (confidence of the estimations) up to $\pm$10% for
all considered approximations, depending on a graph density. Moreover, we
theoretically prove that the percentage errors becomes smaller when the network
grows or the edge density level increases. Additionally, some novel theoretical

mechanisms that operate across a broad range of disparate scales. An imperfect
knowledge of material behavior across scales is a source of epistemic
uncertainty of the overall material behavior. However, assessing this
uncertainty is difficult due to the complex nature of material response and the
prohibitive computational cost of integral calculations. In this paper, we
exploit the multiscale and hierarchical nature of material response to develop
an approach to quantify the overall uncertainty of material response without
the need for integral calculations. Specifically, we bound the uncertainty at
each scale and then combine the partial uncertainties in a way that provides a
bound on the overall or integral uncertainty. The bound provides a conservative
estimate on the uncertainty. Importantly, this approach does not require
integral calculations that are prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate the
framework on the problem of ballistic impact of a polycrystalline magnesium
plate. Magnesium and its alloys are of current interest as promising
light-weight structural and protective materials. Finally, we remark that the
approach can also be used to study the sensitivity of the overall response to
particular mechanisms at lower scales in a materials-by-design approach.

concentrate in the low-temperature region of collisionally magnetized plasma
and in the high-temperature region of collisionally unmagnetized plasma,
respectively. Moreover, collisional magnetization can be determined as the
ratio of the light ion gyrofrequency to the collision frequency of light and
heavy ion species, and the behavior of this effect in the intermediate regime
of partially magnetized plasma is predominantly dependent on this Hall
parameter. Multi-ion cross-field transport has been described before in the
collisionally magnetized plasma regime, and generalized pinch relations, which
describe densities of ion species in equilibrium in that plasma, are found in
the literature. In this paper, the role of collisional magnetization and Larmor
magnetization in multi-ion collisional transport is clarified and generalized
pinch relations are extended to the partially magnetized regime, in which the
ion Hall parameter may be small, as long as electrons remain collisionally
magnetized. Equilibrium ion density profiles have the same dependence on
external forces and on each other regardless of collisional magnetization of
ions. The expansion of the range of validity of multi-ion collisional transport
models makes them applicable to a wider range of laboratory plasma conditions.
In particular, ion density profiles evolve sufficiently fast for radial
impurity transport to be observable around stagnation on MagLIF, leading to
expulsion of heavy ion impurities from the hotspot as long as plasma becomes
sufficiently collisionally magnetized during the implosion.

second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on

there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and

sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of
tabular data. However , we found no evidence of a difference in

in efficient circuit simulation. It has been shown that it can be made of
arbitrary high local order of convergence while maintaining unconditional
numerical stability. Nevertheless, the theoretical basis for the high order of
convergence has been known only for the special case where the underlying
system of differential equations is of the ordinary type, i.e., for ordinary

  This paper presents the theoretical characterization for the local order of

DAE, the local order of convergence is a function of the differentiation index
of the system and, under certain conditions, becomes lower than the order

fundamental issue in relation to the use of hypothetical survey methods.
Whether or to what extent choices of survey participants and subsequent
inferred estimates translate to real-world settings continues to be debated.
While HB has been extensively studied in the broader context of contingent
valuation, it is much less understood in relation to choice experiments (CE).
This paper reviews the empirical evidence for HB in CE in various fields of
applied economics and presents an integrative framework for how HB relates to
external validity. Results suggest mixed evidence on the prevalence, extent and
direction of HB as well as considerable context and measurement dependency.
While HB is found to be an undeniable issue when conducting CEs, the empirical
evidence on HB does not render CEs unable to represent real-world preferences.
While health-related choice experiments often find negligible degrees of HB,
experiments in consumer behaviour and transport domains suggest that
significant degrees of HB are ubiquitous. Assessments of bias in environmental
valuation studies provide mixed evidence. Also, across these disciplines many
studies display HB in their total willingness to pay estimates and opt-in rates
but not in their hypothetical marginal rates of substitution (subject to scale
correction). Further, recent findings in psychology and brain imaging studies
suggest neurocognitive mechanisms underlying HB that may explain some of the
discrepancies and unexpected findings in the mainstream CE literature. The
review also observes how the variety of operational definitions of HB prohibits
consistent measurement of HB in CE. The paper further identifies major sources
of HB and possible moderating factors. Finally, it explains how HB represents
one component of the wider concept of external validity.

However, their performance is often limited by payload capacity, operational
time, and robustness to impact and collision. These limitations of aerial
vehicles become more acute for missions in challenging environments such as
subterranean structures which may require extended autonomous operation in
confined spaces. While software solutions for aerial robots are developing
rapidly, improvements to hardware are critical to applying advanced planners
and algorithms in large and dangerous environments where the short range and
high susceptibility to collisions of most modern aerial robots make
applications in realistic subterranean missions infeasible. To provide such
hardware capabilities, one needs to design and implement a hardware solution
that takes into the account the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints.
This work focuses on providing a robust and versatile hybrid platform that
improves payload capacity, operation time, endurance, and versatility. The
Bi-modal Aerial and Terrestrial hybrid vehicle (BAXTER) is a solution that
provides two modes of operation, aerial and terrestrial. BAXTER employs two
novel hardware mechanisms: the M-Suspension and the Decoupled Transmission
which together provide resilience during landing and crashes and efficient
terrestrial operation. Extensive flight tests were conducted to characterize
the vehicle's capabilities, including robustness and endurance. Additionally,
we propose Agile Mode Transfer (AMT), a transition from aerial to terrestrial

a quick and simple transition process that exploits BAXTER's resilience to

evidence of their effectiveness. The paper follows the review of empirical
evidence on the existence of HB presented in Part I of this study. While the
number of CE studies has rapidly increased since 2010, the critical issue of HB
has been studied in only a small fraction of CE studies. The present review
includes both ex-ante and ex-post bias mitigation methods. Ex-ante bias
mitigation methods include cheap talk, real talk, consequentiality scripts,
solemn oath scripts, opt-out reminders, budget reminders, honesty priming,
induced truth telling, indirect questioning, time to think and pivot designs.
Ex-post methods include follow-up certainty calibration scales, respondent
perceived consequentiality scales, and revealed-preference-assisted estimation.
It is observed that the use of mitigation methods markedly varies across
different sectors of applied economics. The existing empirical evidence points
to their overall effectives in reducing HB, although there is some variation.
The paper further discusses how each mitigation method can counter a certain
subset of HB sources. Considering the prevalence of HB in CEs and the
effectiveness of bias mitigation methods, it is recommended that implementation

However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an
AirComp-based FL scheme. To combat this effect, the concept of dynamic learning

multiple-input-single-output (MISO) scenario, since the underlying optimization
problem is convex and has closed-form solution. We then extend our studies to
more general multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) case and an iterative method

the asymptotic analysis and give a near-optimal receive beamforming design

Unfortunately, it has been experimentally shown that adversarial training
sharpens the weight loss landscape, but this phenomenon has not been

increasing the loss, which is used in adversarial training. We theoretically
and experimentally confirm that the weight loss landscape becomes sharper as

various practical MT use cases. Although many studies have demonstrated the
effectiveness of pre-editing methods for particular settings, thus far, a deep
understanding of what pre-editing is and how it works for black-box NMT is
lacking. To elicit such understanding, we extensively investigated human
pre-editing practices. We first implemented a protocol to incrementally record

across three translation directions, two MT systems, and four text domains. We

pre-editing operations on NMT outputs. Our findings include the following: (1)
enhancing the explicitness of the meaning of an ST and its syntactic structure
is more important for obtaining better translations than making the ST shorter

  Patch Hiding Attacks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art object detectors are vulnerable to localized patch hiding
attacks, where an adversary introduces a small adversarial patch to make
detectors miss the detection of salient objects. The patch attacker can carry
out a physical-world attack by printing and attaching an adversarial patch to
the victim object. In this paper, we propose DetectorGuard as the first general
framework for building provably robust object detectors against localized patch
hiding attacks. DetectorGuard is inspired by recent advancements in robust
image classification research; we ask: can we adapt robust image classifiers
for robust object detection? Unfortunately, due to their task difference, an
object detector naively adapted from a robust image classifier 1) may not
necessarily be robust in the adversarial setting or 2) even maintain decent
performance in the clean setting. To build a high-performance robust object
detector, we propose an objectness explaining strategy: we adapt a robust image
classifier to predict objectness for every image location and then explain each
objectness using the bounding boxes predicted by a conventional object
detector. If all objectness is well explained, we output the predictions made
by the conventional object detector; otherwise, we issue an attack alert.
Notably, 1) in the adversarial setting, we formally prove the end-to-end
robustness of DetectorGuard on certified objects, i.e., it either detects the
object or triggers an alert, against any patch hiding attacker within our
threat model; 2) in the clean setting, we have almost the same performance as
state-of-the-art object detectors. Our evaluation on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO,
and KITTI datasets further demonstrates that DetectorGuard achieves the first
provable robustness against localized patch hiding attacks at a negligible cost
(<1%) of clean performance.

  Approach: We used a dictionary approach to develop rule-based algorithms
(RBA) for extraction of disease labels from radiology text reports. We targeted
three organ systems (lungs/pleura, liver/gallbladder, kidneys/ureters) with
four diseases per system based on their prevalence in our dataset. To expand
the algorithms beyond pre-defined keywords, attention-guided recurrent neural
networks (RNN) were trained using the RBA-extracted labels to classify reports
as being positive for one or more diseases or normal for each organ system.
Confounding effects on model performance were evaluated using random
initialization or pre-trained embedding as well as different sizes of training
datasets. Performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC) against 2,158 manually obtained labels.
  Results: Our models extracted disease labels from 261,229 radiology reports
of 112,501 unique subjects. Pre-trained models outperformed random
initialization across all diseases. As the training dataset size was reduced,
performance was robust except for a few diseases with relatively small number
of cases. Pre-trained classification AUCs achieved > 0.95 for all five disease
outcomes across all three organ systems.
  Conclusions: Our label-extracting pipeline was able to encompass a variety of
cases and diseases by generalizing beyond strict rules with exceptional
accuracy. This method can be easily adapted to enable automated labeling of
hospital-scale medical data sets for training image-based disease classifiers.

acoustic waves propagating in a one-dimensional duct equipped with periodic
thermoacoustic coupling elements. Each coupling element consists in a classical
thermoacoustic regenerator subject to a spatial temperature gradient. When
acoustic waves pass through the regenerator, thermal-to-acoustic energy
conversion takes place and can either amplify or attenuate the wave, depending
on the direction of propagation of the wave. The presence of the spatial
gradient naturally induces a loss of reciprocity. This study provides a
comprehensive theoretical model as well as an in-depth numerical analysis of
the band structure and of the propagation properties of this
thermoacoustically-coupled, tunable, one-dimensional metamaterial. Among the
most significant findings, it is shown that the acoustic metamaterial is
capable of supporting non-reciprocal thermoacoustic Bloch waves that are
associated with a particular form of unidirectional energy transport.
Remarkably, the thermoacoustic coupling also allows achieving effective zero
compressibility and zero refractive index that ultimately lead to the phase
invariance of the propagating sound waves. This single zero effective property
is also shown to have very interesting implications in the attainment of
acoustic cloaking.

fractal dimension (MFD), which are robust against the diversity of
environmental sounds, for the content-based similarity search. The diversity of
sound sources and acoustic compositions is a typical feature of environmental
sounds. Several acoustic features have been proposed for environmental sounds.
Among them is the widely-used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),
which describes frequency-domain features. However, in addition to these
features in the frequency domain, environmental sounds have other important
features in the time domain with various time scales. In our previous paper, we
proposed enhanced multiscale fractal dimension signature (EMFD) for
environmental sounds. This paper extends EMFD by using the kernel density
estimation method, which results in better performance of the similarity search
tasks. Furthermore, it newly proposes another acoustic feature signature based
on MFD, namely very-long-range multiscale fractal dimension signature (MFD-VL).
The MFD-VL signature describes several features of the time-varying envelope

against background noise and small fluctuations in the parameters of sound

should be reflected to reduce heat gain and the infrared radiation emission
should be enhanced for further cooling by using the sky as a heat sink. With a
high NIR reflection, a transparent radiative cooling photonic structure
consisting of 2D silica gratings atop ZnO/Ag/ZnO is demonstrated for
energy-saving and safety. With 81% visible light transmitted, 57% NIR solar
radiation reflected and 90% thermal infrared radiation emitted, a synthetical
cooling is realized by the photonic structure. Theoretically, the total power
of reflected solar irradiance and radiative cooling in infrared of this
structure is more than double that of a planar silica. The field test shows
that with this structure, the temperature rise of a sealed chamber covered by
planar silica can be cooled down by 53.7%. This work shows that the concept of
daytime radiative cooling can be applied in combination with the utilization of

particular, we show that Sign-RIP can guarantee the uniform convergence of the

observation that SAs can be fitted through concatenation of sub-ULAs. A
corresponding SA design principle, called ULA fitting, is then proposed. It
aims to design SAs from sub-ULAs. Towards this goal, a polynomial model for
arrays is used, and based on it, a DCA structure is analyzed if SA is composed
of multiple sub-ULAs. SA design with low mutual coupling is considered. ULA
fitting enables to transfer the SA design requirements, such as hole free, low
mutual coupling and other requirements, into pseudo polynomial equation, and
hence, find particular solutions. We mainly focus on designing SAs with low
mutual coupling and large uniform DOF. Two examples of SAs with closed-form
expressions are then developed based on ULA fitting. Numerical experiments
verify the superiority of the proposed SAs in the presence of heavy mutual

payload weight) characteristics that affect overall performance. Iterating over
the many component choices results in a combinatorial explosion of the number
of possible combinations: from 10s of thousands to billions, depending on
implementation details. Manually selecting combinations of these components is
tedious and expensive. To navigate the {cyber-physical design space}

full-system UAV co-design. AutoPilot uses Bayesian optimization to navigate a
large design space and automatically select a combination of autonomy algorithm

cyber and physical UAV components. We show that the AutoPilot methodology
consistently outperforms general-purpose hardware selections like Xavier NX and

there are finite process graphs that are not bisimilar to the process
interpretation of any regular expression. For reasoning about graphs that are
expressible by regular expressions modulo bisimilarity it is desirable to have
structural representations of process graphs in the image of the

Heisenberg or XY interaction on the 2D square lattice -- are known to be
universal. However, the known encodings can be very inefficient, requiring
interaction energy that scales exponentially with system size if the original
Hamiltonian has higher-dimensional, long-range, or even all-to-all

universal families are in fact ""strongly"" universal. This means that the
required interaction energy and all other resources in the 2D simulator scale
polynomially in the size of the target Hamiltonian and precision parameters,
regardless of the target's connectivity. This exponential improvement over
previous constructions is achieved by combining the tools of quantum phase
estimation algorithm and circuit-to-Hamiltonian transformation in a
non-perturbative way that only incurs polynomial overhead. The simulator
Hamiltonian also possess certain translation-invariance. Furthermore, we show
that even 1D Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbor interaction of 8-dimensional

from the flexibility, versatility, and reliability of model-based optimization
methods. LoRD-Net operates in a blind fashion, which requires addressing both
the non-linear nature of the data-acquisition system as well as identifying a
proper optimization objective for signal recovery. Accordingly, we propose a

equilibrium volume although different distortions may occur as function of
lattice expansion. The choice between the two distortion modes is in part
governed by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. However, another factor
explaining the difference between Sn and Pb compared with Ge and Si is the
stronger lone-pair character of Ge and Si when forced to be divalent as is the
case in these structures. The lone-pair chemistry is related to the
off-centering. While the Si-based compounds have not yet been synthesized, the
Ge compounds have been established experimentally. As a final test of the

combinatorial optimization (CO) problems in recent years. Typical CO deep
learning approaches leverage the problem structure in the model architecture.
Nevertheless, the model selection is still mainly based on the conventional
machine learning setting. Due to the discrete nature of CO problems, a single
model is unlikely to learn the problem entirely. We introduce ZTop, which
stands for Zero Training Overhead Portfolio, a simple yet effective model
selection and ensemble mechanism for learning to solve combinatorial problems.
ZTop is inspired by algorithm portfolios, a popular CO ensembling strategy,
particularly restart portfolios, which periodically restart a randomized CO
algorithm, de facto exploring the search space with different heuristics. We
have observed that well-trained models acquired in the same training
trajectory, with similar top validation performance, perform well on very
different validation instances. Following this observation, ZTop ensembles a
set of well-trained models, each providing a unique heuristic with zero
training overhead, and applies them, sequentially or in parallel, to solve the
test instances. We show how ZTopping, i.e., using a ZTop ensemble strategy with
a given deep learning approach, can significantly improve the performance of

spin systems and electrical networks that plays a fundamental role in designing
efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms for the classical
ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. In this paper, we study a natural
non-local Markov chain known as the Chayes-Machta dynamics for the mean-field
case of the random-cluster model, where the underlying graph is the complete
graph on $n$ vertices. The random-cluster model is parametrized by an edge
probability $p$ and a cluster weight $q$. Our focus is on the critical regime:
$p = p_c(q)$ and $q \in (1,2)$, where $p_c(q)$ is the threshold corresponding
to the order-disorder phase transition of the model. We show that the mixing
time of the Chayes-Machta dynamics is $O(\log n \cdot \log \log n)$ in this
parameter regime, which reveals that the dynamics does not undergo an
exponential slowdown at criticality, a surprising fact that had been predicted
(but not proved) by statistical physicists. This also provides a nearly optimal
bound (up to the $\log\log n$ factor) for the mixing time of the mean-field
Chayes-Machta dynamics in the only regime of parameters where no non-trivial
bound was previously known. Our proof consists of a multi-phased coupling
argument that combines several key ingredients, including a new local limit
theorem, a precise bound on the maximum of symmetric random walks with varying
step sizes, and tailored estimates for critical random graphs. In addition, we
derive an improved comparison inequality between the mixing time of the
Chayes-Machta dynamics and that of the local Glauber dynamics on general
graphs; this results in better mixing time bounds for the local dynamics in the
mean-field setting.

structure in protoplanetary disks, shedding light on mechanisms of disk
accretion and structure formation. 1) By carrying out viscous simulations, we
confirm that the disk's velocity structure differs dramatically using vertical
stress profiles from different accretion mechanisms. Thus, kinematic
observations tracing flows at different disk heights can potentially
distinguish different accretion mechanisms. On the other hand, the disk surface
density evolution is mostly determined by the vertically integrated stress. The
sharp disk outer edge constrained by recent kinematic observations can be
caused by a radially varying $\alpha$ in the disk. 2) We also study kinematic
signatures of a young planet by carrying out 3-D planet-disk simulations. The
relationship between the planet mass and the ""kink"" velocity is derived,
showing a linear relationship with little dependence on disk viscosity, but
some dependence on disk height when the planet is massive, e.g. $10 M_J$. We
predict the ""kink"" velocities for the potential planets in DSHARP disks. At the
gap edge, the azimuthally-averaged velocities at different disk heights deviate
from the Keplerian velocity at similar amplitudes, and its relationship with
the planet mass is consistent with that in 2-D simulations. After removing the
planet, the azimuthally-averaged velocity barely changes within the viscous
timescale, and thus the azimuthally-averaged velocity structure at the gap edge
is due to the gap itself and not directly caused to the planet. Combining both
axisymmetric kinematic observations and the residual ""kink"" velocity is needed
to probe young planets in protoplanetary disks.

leads to unconventional magneto-transport behavior. Weyl fermions induce
topologically protected spin-momentum locking, which is closely related to
spin-wave gap formation in magnetic crystals. Ferromagnetic SrRuO3, regarded as
a strong candidate for Weyl semimetal, inherently possesses a nonzero spin-wave
gap owing to its strong magnetic anisotropy. In this paper, we propose a method
to control the spin-wave dynamics by nanolayer designing of the SrRuO3/SrTiO3
superlattices. In particular, the six-unit-cell-thick SrRuO3 layers within the
superlattices undergo a phase transition in crystalline symmetry from
orthorhombic to tetragonal, as the thickness of the SrTiO3 layers is modulated
with atomic-scale precision. Consequently, the magnetic anisotropy, anomalous
Hall conductivity, and spin-wave gap could be systematically manipulated. Such
customization of magnetic anisotropy via nanoscale heterostructuring offers a
novel control knob to tailor the magnon excitation energy for future spintronic
applications, including magnon waveguides and filters. Our nanolayer approach
unveils the important correlation between the tunable lattice degrees of
freedom and spin dynamics in topologically non-trivial magnetic materials.

developers with more design options to improve performance and save cost. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first serverless system that
takes full advantage of the client-fog-cloud synergy to better serve the
DNN-based video analytics. Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals:
1) Provide the optimal analytics results under the constraints of lower
bandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing the
computational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud
environment. 2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation
tasks, including DNN deployment, cloud and fog's resource management. To this
end, we implement a holistic cloud-fog system referred to as VPaaS
(Video-Platform-as-a-Service). VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable
developers to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of
functions (e.g., model inference), which are then orchestrated to process
videos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth and reduce RTT,
VPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video
to the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can
identify regions of video frames that need further processing at the fog ends.
At the fog ends, misidentified labels in these regions can be corrected using a
light-weight DNN model. To address the data drift issues, we incorporate
limited human feedback into the system to verify the results and adopt
incremental learning to improve our system continuously. The evaluation
demonstrates that VPaaS is superior to several SOTA systems: it maintains high
accuracy while reducing bandwidth usage by up to 21%, RTT by up to 62.5%, and
cloud monetary cost by up to 50%.

the hopping probability of electron (or the electron mobility) in solids. Since
controlling the conductivity of ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) is a key
subject for the development of spintronic device applications, the manipulation
of the conductivity through IVCT may become a new approach of band engineering
in FMSs. In Ru-doped cobalt ferrite CoFe$_2$O$_4$ (CFO) that shows
ferrimagnetism and semiconducting transport properties, the reduction of the
electric resistivity is attributed to both the carrier doping caused by the Ru
substitution for Co and the increase of the carrier mobility due to
hybridization between the wide Ru $4d$ and the Fe $3d$ orbitals. The latter is
the so-called IVCT mechanism that is charge transfer between the mixed valence
Fe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$ states facilitated by bridging Ru $4d$ orbital: Fe$^{2+}$ +
Ru$^{4+}$ $\leftrightarrow$ Fe$^{3+}$ + Ru$^{3+}$. To elucidate the emergence

private; that is, to make it difficult for an observer to determine the reward
function used. We define the problem of privacy-preserving reinforcement
learning, and present two models for solving it. These models are based on
dissimulation -- a form of deception that `hides the truth'. We evaluate our
models both computationally and via human behavioural experiments. Results show
that the resulting policies are indeed deceptive, and that participants can
determine the true reward function less reliably than that of an honest agent.

panoptic segmentation). In the literature, top-performing instance segmentation
methods typically follow the paradigm of Mask R-CNN and rely on ROI operations
(typically ROIAlign) to attend to each instance. In contrast, we propose to
attend to the instances with dynamic conditional convolutions. Instead of using
instance-wise ROIs as inputs to the instance mask head of fixed weights, we
design dynamic instance-aware mask heads, conditioned on the instances to be
predicted. CondInst enjoys three advantages: 1.) Instance and panoptic
segmentation are unified into a fully convolutional network, eliminating the
need for ROI cropping and feature alignment. 2.) The elimination of the ROI
cropping also significantly improves the output instance mask resolution. 3.)
Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditional
convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, each
having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference time per
instance and making the overall inference time almost constant, irrelevant to
the number of instances. We demonstrate a simpler method that can achieve
improved accuracy and inference speed on both instance and panoptic
segmentation tasks. On the COCO dataset, we outperform a few state-of-the-art
methods. We hope that CondInst can be a strong baseline for instance and
panoptic segmentation. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet

devices by offloading computation-intensive tasks over wireless networks to
edge servers. One challenge faced by the deployment of MEC in cellular networks
is to support user mobility. As a result, offloaded tasks can be seamlessly
migrated between base stations (BSs) without compromising the
resource-utilization efficiency and link reliability. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge by optimizing the policy for migration/handover between BSs by
jointly managing computation-and-radio resources. The objectives are twofold:
maximizing the sum offloading rate, quantifying MEC throughput, and minimizing
the migration cost. The policy design is formulated as a decision-optimization
problem that accounts for virtualization, I/O interference between virtual
machines (VMs), and wireless multi-access. To solve the complex combinatorial
problem, we develop an efficient relaxation-and-rounding based solution
approach. The approach relies on an optimal iterative algorithm for solving the
integer-relaxed problem and a novel integer-recovery design. The latter
outperforms the traditional rounding method by exploiting the derived problem
properties and applying matching theory. In addition, we also consider the
design for a special case of ""hotspot mitigation"", referring to alleviating an
overloaded server/BS by migrating its load to the nearby idle servers/BSs. From
simulation results, we observed close-to-optimal performance of the proposed
migration policies under various settings. This demonstrates their efficiency

effect and the orientation-dependent light shift. In this work, we find that
the nuclear Zeeman effect can also have a significant impact on the heading
errors, especially for continuously-driving magnetometers with unresolved
magnetic transitions. It not only shifts the precession frequency but deforms
the heading errors and causes asymmetry: the heading errors for pump lasers
with opposite helicities are different. The heading error also depends on the
relative direction (parallel or vertical) of the probe laser to the RF driving
magnetic field. Thus, one can design the configuration of the magnetometer and
make it work in the smaller-heading-error regime. To suppress the heading
error, our studies suggest to sum up the output precession frequencies from
atomic cells pumped by two lasers with opposite helicities and probed by lasers
propagating in orthogonal directions (one parallel and another perpendicular to
the RF field), instead of utilizing probe lasers propagating in the same
directions. Due to the nuclear Zeeman effect, the average precession
frequencies in the latter case can have a non-negligible angular dependence,
while in the former case the nuclear-Zeeman-effect induced heading error can be
largely compensated and the residue is within 1Hz. Furthermore, for practical
use, we propose to simply utilize a small magnetic field parallel/antiparallel
to the pump laser. By tuning the magnitude of this auxiliary field, the heading
error can be flattened around different angles, which can improve the accuracy
when the magnetometer works around a certain orientation angle.

pricing problems. Under mild conditions we show that the best price in the
direction of a positive vector results in profits that are guaranteed to be at
least as large as a fraction of the profits from optimal personalized pricing.
For unconstrained problems, the fraction depends on the factor and on optimal
price vectors for the different customer types. For constrained problems the
factor depends on the factor and a ratio of the constraints. Using a factor
vector with equal components results in uniform pricing and has exceedingly
mild sufficient conditions for the bound to hold. A robust factor is presented
that achieves the best possible performance guarantee. As an application, our
model yields a tight lower-bound on the performance of linear pricing relative
to optimal personalized non-linear pricing, and suggests effective non-linear
price heuristics relative to personalized solutions. Additionally, our model
provides guarantees for simple strategies such as bundle-size pricing and
component-pricing with respect to optimal personalized mixed bundle pricing.
Heuristics to cluster customer types are also developed with the goal of
improving performance by allowing each cluster to price along its own factor.
Numerical results are presented for a variety of demand models that illustrate

$O\left(n^{-\frac{(d_F-2)}{d_r}(2\theta-\frac{d_r}{2})}\right)$. Interestingly,
we then prove that the average number of drones, needed to connect each mobile
node not covered by gNBs is comparable to the number of isolated mobile nodes.
We complete the characterisation by proving that when $\theta<d_r/4$ the
proportion of covered mobile nodes tends to zero. We provide insights on the
intelligent placement of the ""garage of drones"", the home location of these
nomadic infrastructure nodes, such as to minimize what we call the

that will be garages (and store drones) in order to minimize the number of

acceleration of relativistic electrons in merger-driven shocks with low sonic
Mach numbers ($M_{\rm s}\lesssim 3$) in the intracluster medium (ICM). Recent
studies have suggested that electron injection to diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) could take place through the so-called Fermi-like acceleration in the
shock foot of $\beta=P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}\approx 20-100$ shocks and the
stochastic shock drift acceleration (SSDA) in the shock transition of
$\beta\approx 1-5$ shocks. Here we explore how the SSDA can facilitate electron
preacceleration in weak quasi-perpendicular ($Q_{\perp}$) shocks in
$\beta\approx 20-100$ plasmas by performing particle-in-cell simulations in the
two-dimensional domain large enough to encompass ion-scale waves. We find that
in supercritical shocks with $M_{\rm s}\gtrsim M_{\rm AIC}^*\sim 2.3$,
multi-scale waves are excited by the ion and electron temperature anisotropies
in the downstream of the shock ramp, and that through stochastic pitch-angle
scattering off the induced waves, electrons are confined in the shock
transition for an extended period. Gaining energy through the gradient-drift
along the motional electric field, electrons could be preaccelerated all the
way to injection to DSA at such ICM shocks. Our findings imply that the
electron DSA process at weak ICM shocks could explain the origin of radio
relics. However, a further investigation of electron acceleration at
subcritical shocks with $M_{\rm s}< 2.3$ is called for, since the Mach numbers
of some observed radio relic shocks derived from radio or X-ray observations
are as low as $M_{\rm s}\sim 1.5$.

induction and demand cannibalization. For the latent class MNL model, a firm

$n$ is the number of products and $m$ the number of customer types.
Surprisingly, the revenue-ordered assortment heuristic has the same performance
guarantees relative to {\em personalized} refined assortment optimization as it
does to traditional assortment optimization. Based on this finding, we
construct refinements of the revenue-order heuristic and measure their improved

into formal proofs, whose validity is an objective question, decidable by a
computer. Yet, in practice, proofs are informal and may omit many details. An
agent considers a proof valid if they trust that it could be expanded into a
machine-verifiable proof. A proof's validity can thus become a subjective
matter and lead to a debate, which may be difficult to settle. Hence, while the
concept of valid proof is well-defined, the process to establish validity is
itself a complex multi-agent problem.
  We introduce the SPRIG protocol. SPRIG allows agents to propose and verify
succinct and informative proofs in a decentralized fashion; the trust is
established by agents being able to request more details in the proof steps;
debates, if they arise, must isolate details of proofs and, if they persist, go
down to machine-level details, where they are automatically settled. A
structure of bounties and stakes is set to incentivize agents to act in good
faith.
  We propose a game-theoretic discussion of SPRIG, showing how agents with
various types of information interact, leading to a proof tree with an
appropriate level of detail and to the invalidation of wrong proofs, and we
discuss resilience against various attacks. We then analyze a simplified model,
characterize its equilibria and compute the agents' level of trust.
  SPRIG is designed to run as a smart contract on a blockchain platform. This
allows anonymous agents to participate in the verification debate, and to
contribute with their information. The smart contract mediates the
interactions, settles debates, and guarantees that bounties and stakes are paid
as specified.
  SPRIG enables new applications, such as the issuance of bounties for open
problems, and the creation of derivatives markets, allowing agents to inject
more information pertaining to proofs.

holding $d$-dimensional observations of a $K$-sparse vector $\mu$ corrupted by
additive Gaussian noise. The $M$ machines are connected in a star topology to a
fusion center, whose goal is to estimate the vector $\mu$ with a low
communication budget. Previous works have shown that to achieve the centralized
minimax rate for the $\ell_2$ risk, the total communication must be high - at
least linear in the dimension $d$. This phenomenon occurs, however, at very
weak signals. We show that at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that are
sufficiently high - but not enough for recovery by any individual machine - the
support of $\mu$ can be correctly recovered with significantly less
communication. Specifically, we present two algorithms for distributed
estimation of a sparse mean vector corrupted by either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian
noise. We then prove that above certain SNR thresholds, with high probability,
these algorithms recover the correct support with total communication that is
sublinear in the dimension $d$. Furthermore, the communication decreases
exponentially as a function of signal strength. If in addition $KM\ll
\tfrac{d}{\log d}$, then with an additional round of sublinear communication,
our algorithms achieve the centralized rate for the $\ell_2$ risk. Finally, we
present simulations that illustrate the performance of our algorithms in
different parameter regimes.

artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of its

been successfully developed to exploit the benefit of the inherent physical
properties of particle therapy. Many reviews about AI applications in
radiotherapy have already been published, but none were specifically dedicated
to particle therapy. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the
recent published works on AI applications in particle therapy, which can be
classified into particle therapy treatment planning, adaptive particle therapy,
range and dose verification and other applications in particle therapy.
Although promising results reported in these works demonstrate how AI-based
methods can help exploit the intrinsic physic advantages of particle therapy,
challenges remained to be address before AI applications in particle therapy
enjoy widespread implementation in clinical practice.

277 galaxies were selected based on the single condition of a low enough ratio
of the intermediate to long axis of the stellar component. We followed the mass
and shape evolution of the galaxies as well as their interactions with other
objects and divided them into three classes based on the origin of the bar and
the subsequent history. In galaxies of class A (comprising 28% of the sample),
the bar was induced by an interaction with a larger object, most often a
cluster or group central galaxy, and the galaxies were heavily stripped of dark
matter and gas. In classes B and C (27% and 45% of the sample, respectively)
the bars were induced by a merger or a passing satellite, or they were formed
by disk instability. Class B galaxies were then partially stripped of mass,
while those of class C evolved without strong interactions, thus retaining
their dark matter and gas in the outskirts. We illustrate the properties of the
different classes with three representative examples of individual galaxies. In
spite of the different evolutionary histories, the bars are remarkably similar
in strength, length, and formation times. The gas fraction in the baryonic
component within two stellar half-mass radii at the time of bar formation is
always below 0.4 and usually very low, which confirms in the cosmological
context the validity of this threshold, which has previously been identified in
controlled simulations. Observational counterparts of these objects can be
found among early-type fast rotators, S0 galaxies, or red spirals with bars.

uplink beamforming design is investigated for maximizing the long-term energy
efficiency (EE) with the aid of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the
cell-free network. Firstly, based on the minimum mean square error channel
estimation and exploiting successive interference cancellation for signal
detection, the expression of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is
derived. Secondly, according to the formulation of SINR, we define the
long-term EE, which is a function of beamforming matrix. Thirdly, to address
the dynamic beamforming design with continuous state and action space, a
DRL-enabled beamforming design is proposed based on deep deterministic policy
gradient (DDPG) algorithm by taking the advantage of its double-network
architecture. Finally, the results of simulation indicate that the DDPG-based
beamforming design is capable of converging to the optimal EE performance.
Furthermore, the influence of hyper-parameters on the EE performance of the
DDPG-based beamforming design is investigated, and it is demonstrated that an

performance.

violence of the nonlinear dynamics, and, in particular, when these modes lead
to a disruption, is not yet understood. In this paper, the nonlinear phase of
external kinks in an unstable QA configuration with an edge safety factor below
two is simulated. An axisymmetric approximation of this stellarator is
constructed in the nonlinear MHD code, JOREK, capturing the influence of the
external rotational transform. The use of this approximation for the considered
stellarator is validated by comparing the linear dynamics against the linear
viscoresistive MHD code, CASTOR3D. The nonlinear dynamics of this stellarator
approximation are compared with an equivalent tokamak to understand the
influence of a relatively small external rotational transform. While the
external rotational transform does have a stabilising influence on the MHD
activity, it remains violent. To explore the first order influence of a larger
external rotational transform, this equilibrium parameter is artificially
increased for the considered stellarator, reducing the effective plasma
current. The violence of the kink instability is quantified, and shown to
reduce with the increasing external rotational transform. At the same time, the
external kink triggers internal modes that exacerbate the loss in confinement
during the nonlinear phase, such that it remains large over much of the
parameter space. It is only with a significant fraction of external rotational
transform that these subsequent modes are stabilised.

results, which associate the emerging main conductance maxima with the junction
films' superconducting gaps, thinner Ni (1.6 nm)-Ga (30 nm) bilayers entail
completely different physics, and give rise to novel large-bias (when compared

attract considerable attention also in similar magnetic superconducting bilayer

the interface of the Ni-Ga bilayer. We further substantiate this claim
performing complementary polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on the

five data augmentation strategies under different training data inadequacy are
investigated in two scenarios: the noise-free scenario where different

in addressing the recommendation task. In particular, users show distinct
preferences when considering different aspects of the reviews (i.e. properties)
for making decisions about the items. Hence, it is important to model the
relationship between the reviews' properties and the usefulness of reviews
while learning the users' preferences and the items' attributes. Therefore, we
propose to model the reviews with their associated available properties. We
introduce a novel review properties-based recommendation model (RPRM) that
learns which review properties are more important than others in capturing the
usefulness of reviews, thereby enhancing the recommendation results.
Furthermore, inspired by the users' information adoption framework, we
integrate two loss functions and a negative sampling strategy into our proposed

users' preferences. We examine the effectiveness of RPRM using the well-known
Yelp and Amazon datasets. Our results show that RPRM significantly outperforms

  arXiv:2210.14107 which was submitted as a new work by accident",,,,"math.AP nlin.PS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coupled Boussinesq equations describe long weakly-nonlinear longitudinal
strain waves in a bi-layer with a soft bonding between the layers (e.g. a soft
adhesive). From the mathematical viewpoint, a particularly difficult case
appears when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are significantly
different (high-contrast case). The traditional derivation of the
uni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations, for the
right- and left-propagating waves in each layer. However, the models impose a
``zero-mass constraint'' i.e. the initial conditions should necessarily have
zero mean, restricting the applicability of that description. Here, we bypass
the contradiction in this high-contrast case by constructing the solution for
the deviation from the evolving mean value, using asymptotic multiple-scale
expansions involving two pairs of fast characteristic variables and two
slow-time variables. By construction, the Ostrovsky equations emerging within
the scope of this derivation are solved for initial conditions with zero mean
while initial conditions for the original system may have non-zero mean values.
Asymptotic validity of the solution is carefully examined numerically. We apply
the models to the description of counter-propagating waves generated by
solitary wave initial conditions, or co-propagating waves generated by cnoidal
wave initial conditions, as well as the resulting wave interactions, and
contrast with the behaviour of the waves in bi-layers when the linear long-wave
speeds in the layers are close (low-contrast case). One local (classical) and
two non-local (generalised) conservation laws of the coupled Boussinesq
equations for strains are derived, and these are used to control the accuracy
of the numerical simulations.

curvature on anomalous vortex-network active turbulence. This regime is
characterised by self-assembly of finite-size vortices into linked chains of

qualitative and their explanations are still incomplete, several of the
observed phenomena are in qualitative agreement with experiments on active

of the delicate interplay between geometrical properties of the surface and
characteristics of the flow field, which has the potential to control active
flows on surfaces via gradients in the spatial curvature of the surface.

Attempts to explain this limit through instabilities arising in near- or

evolution we aim to re-examine the HD limit, investigating the impact of
enhanced mixing on massive stars. We construct grids of stellar evolution
models appropriate for the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC), as
well as for the Galaxy, spanning various initial rotation rates and convective
overshooting parameters. Significantly enhanced mixing apparently steers
stellar evolution tracks away from the region of the HD limit. To quantify the
excess of over-luminous stars in stellar evolution simulations we generate
synthetic populations of massive stars, and make detailed comparisons with
catalogues of cool (T < 12.5kK) and luminous (log L > 4.7) stars in the SMC and
LMC. We find that adjustments to the mixing parameters can lead to agreement
between the observed and simulated red supergiant populations, but for hotter
supergiants the simulations always over-predict the number of very luminous
(log L > 5.4) stars compared to observations. The excess of luminous
supergiants decreases for enhanced mixing, possibly hinting at an important
role mixing has in explaining the HD limit. Still, the HD limit remains

the available spectrum and simultaneously reduce the energy consumption. From
the radio resource allocation perspective, the solution to this problem is to
maximize the energy efficiency instead of the throughput. This results in the
optimal benefit-cost ratio between data rate and energy consumption. It also
often leads to a considerable reduction in throughput and, hence, an
underutilization of the available spectrum. Contemporary approaches to balance
these metrics based on multi-objective programming theory often lack
operational meaning and finding the correct operating point requires careful
experimentation and calibration. Instead, we propose the novel concept of
hierarchical resource allocation where conflicting objectives are ordered by
their importance. This results in a resource allocation algorithm that strives
to minimize the transmit power while keeping the data rate close the maximum
achievable throughput. In a typical multi-cell scenario, this strategy is shown
to reduces the transmit power consumption by 65% at the cost of a 5% decrease
in throughput. Moreover, this strategy also saves energy in scenarios where
global energy efficiency maximization fails to achieve any gain over throughput
maximization.

decoding path. The model independent encoding path can capture
modality-specific features from the N modalities. Since there exists a strong
correlation between different modalities, we first propose a linear correlation
block to learn the correlation between modalities, then a loss function is used
to guide the network to learn the correlated features based on the linear
correlation block. This block forces the network to learn the latent correlated
features which are more relevant for segmentation. Considering that not all the
features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to
use dual attention based fusion block to recalibrate the features along the
modality and spatial paths, which can suppress less informative features and
emphasize the useful ones. The fused feature representation is finally
projected by the decoder to obtain the segmentation result. Our experiment

algorithms must reliably consider the inherent uncertainties of the traffic
environment, e.g. arising from the variety of human driving styles. Such
uncertainties can generate ambiguous decisions, requiring the algorithm to
appropriately balance low-probability hazardous events, e.g. collisions, and
high-probability beneficial events, e.g. quickly crossing the intersection.
State-of-the-art behavior generation algorithms lack a distributional treatment
of decision outcome. This impedes a proper risk evaluation in ambiguous
situations, often encouraging either unsafe or conservative behavior. Thus, we
propose a two-step approach for risk-sensitive behavior generation combining
offline distribution learning with online risk assessment. Specifically, we
first learn an optimal policy in an uncertain environment with Deep
Distributional Reinforcement Learning. During execution, the optimal
risk-sensitive action is selected by applying established risk criteria, such
as the Conditional Value at Risk, to the learned state-action return
distributions. In intersection crossing scenarios, we evaluate different risk
criteria and demonstrate that our approach increases safety, while maintaining
an active driving style. Our approach shall encourage further studies about the
benefits of risk-sensitive approaches for self-driving vehicles.

these is the standard Regge configuration in which the chaos bound applies. The
second is the `causally scattering configuration' in which the correlator
develops a bulk point singularity. We find an expression for the coefficient of
the bulk point singularity in terms of the bulk S matrix of the bulk dual

governed by the same power as in the standard Regge configuration, and so is
constrained by the chaos bound, which turns out to be violated unless the bulk
flat space S matrix grows no faster than $s^2$ in the Regge limit. It follows
that in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the chaos bound applied to
the boundary field theory implies that the S matrices of the dual bulk scalars,

faults respond to transient sources of fluid. Natural and artificial sources
can elevate pore fluid pressure on the fault frictional interface, which may
induce slip. We consider a simple boundary value problem to provide an
elementary model of the physical process and to provide a benchmark for
numerical solution procedures. We examine the slip of a fault that is an
interface of two elastic half-spaces. Injection is modeled as a line source at
constant pressure and fluid pressure is assumed to diffuse along the interface.
The resulting problem is an integro-differential equation governing fault slip,
which has a single dimensionless parameter. The expansion of slip is
self-similar and the rupture front propagates at a factor $\lambda$ of the
diffusive lengthscale $\sqrt{\alpha t}$. We identify two asymptotic regimes
corresponding to $\lambda$ being small or large and perform a perturbation
expansion in each limit. For large $\lambda$, in the regime of a so-called
critically stressed fault, a boundary layer emerges on the diffusive
lengthscale, which lags far behind the rupture front. We demonstrate
higher-order matched asymptotics for the integro-differential equation, and in
doing so, we derive a multipole expansion to capture successive orders of
influence on the outer problem for fault slip for a driving force that is small
relative to the crack dimensions. Asymptotic expansions are compared to
accurate numerical solutions to the full problem, which are tabulated to high
precision.

  Due to the extended functionality, it is not surprising that such an
expansion of complexity implies a bigger attack surface. In contrast to CMS
core systems, extensions are usually not considered during public security
audits. However, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL injection (SQLi) attack
within an activated extension has the same effect on the security of a CMS as
the same issue within the core itself. Therefore, vulnerabilities within
extensions are a very attractive tool for malicious parties.

most popular systems. We discovered that nearly every second installation of
such a system also includes Joomla's official top-10 rated extensions as a per

introduce the same vulnerabilities. Finally, we pinpoint mitigation strategies

analytically the effects of noise on the defect density production. In the
absence of noise, it is well known that in the slow sweep regime, the defect
density follows the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling behavior with respect to the
sweep speed. We consider time-dependent fast Gaussian noise in the anisotropy
of the spin-coupling term [$\gamma_0=(J_1-J_2)/(J_1+J_2)$] and show via
analytical calculations that the defect density exhibits anti-Kibble-Zurek
(AKZ) scaling behavior in the slow sweep regime. In the limit of large chain
length and long time, we calculate the entropy and magnetization density of the
final decohered state and show that their scaling behavior is consistent with
the AKZ picture in the slow sweep regime. We have also numerically calculated
the sub-lattice spin correlators for finite separation by evaluating the
Toeplitz determinants and find results consistent with the KZ picture in the
absence of noise, while in the presence of noise and slow sweep speeds the
correlators exhibit the AKZ behavior. Furthermore, by considering the large
$n$-separation asymptotes of the Toeplitz determinants, we further quantify the
effect of the noise on the spin-spin correlators in the final decohered state.
We show that while the correlation length of the sub-lattice correlator scales
according to the AKZ behavior, we obtain different scaling for the
magnetization correlators.

industrial and service scenarios to replace human labor. However, these
scenarios include dense and dynamic obstacles that make motion planning of
robots challenging. Traditional algorithms like A* can plan collision-free
trajectories in static environment, but their performance degrades and
computational cost increases steeply in dense and dynamic scenarios.
Optimal-value reinforcement learning algorithms (RL) can address these problems
but suffer slow speed and instability in network convergence. Network of policy
gradient RL converge fast in Atari games where action is discrete and finite,
but few works have been done to address problems where continuous actions and
large action space are required. In this paper, we modify existing advantage
actor-critic algorithm and suit it to complex motion planning, therefore
optimal speeds and directions of robot are generated. Experimental results
demonstrate that our algorithm converges faster and stable than optimal-value
RL. It achieves higher success rate in motion planning with lesser processing
time for robot to reach its goal.

Exploration via Novelty and Emitters (SERENE) algorithm, capable of efficiently

separates the search space exploration and reward exploitation into two
alternating processes. The first process performs exploration through Novelty
Search, a divergent search algorithm. The second one exploits discovered reward
areas through emitters, i.e. local instances of population-based optimization
algorithms. A meta-scheduler allocates a global computational budget by
alternating between the two processes, ensuring the discovery and efficient
exploitation of disjoint reward areas. SERENE returns both a collection of
diverse solutions covering the search space and a collection of high-performing
solutions for each distinct reward area. We evaluate SERENE on various sparse
reward environments and show it compares favorably to existing baselines.

interactive feedback, allowing for intuitive reposing and animation. Since we
only have very limited training samples, one of the key challenges lies in how
to address (dis)occlusions, e.g. when a hand moves behind or in front of a
body. To address this, we introduce a novel layering approach which explicitly
splits the input keypoints into different layers which are processed
independently. These layers represent different parts of the character and
provide a strong implicit bias that helps to obtain realistic results even with
strong (dis)occlusions. To combine the features of individual layers we use an
adaptive scaling approach conditioned on all keypoints. Finally, we introduce a
mask connectivity constraint to reduce distortion artifacts that occur with
extreme out-of-distribution poses at test time. We show that our approach
outperforms recent baselines and creates realistic animations for diverse
characters. We also show that our model can handle discrete state changes, for
example a profile facing left or right, that the different layers do indeed
learn features specific for the respective keypoints in those layers, and that
our model scales to larger datasets when more data is available.

trivial. Induced orientation of molecules prior to X-ray exposure can be highly
beneficial, as it significantly reduces the number of collected diffraction
patterns whilst improving the quality of the reconstructed structure. We
present here the possibility of protein orientation using a time-dependent
external electric field. We used ab initio simulations on Trp-cage protein to
provide a qualitative estimation of the field strength required to break
protein bonds, with 45 V/nm as a breaking point value. Furthermore, we
simulated, in a classical molecular dynamics approach, the orientation of
ubiquitin protein by exposing it to different time-dependent electric fields.
The protein structure was preserved for all samples at the moment orientation
was achieved, which we denote `orientation before destruction'. Moreover, we
find that the minimal field strength required to induce orientation within ten

explain the process of field orientation of proteins and can support the design
of instruments for protein orientation.

element is the so called amortized inference network, which can perform test
time inference using a single feed forward pass. Unfortunately, this comes at
the cost of degraded accuracy in posterior approximation, often underperforming
the instance-wise variational optimization. Although the latest semi-amortized
approaches mitigate the issue by performing a few variational optimization
updates starting from the VAE's amortized inference output, they inherently
suffer from computational overhead for inference at test time. In this paper,
we address the problem in a completely different way by considering a random
inference model, where we model the mean and variance functions of the
variational posterior as random Gaussian processes (GP). The motivation is that
the deviation of the VAE's amortized posterior distribution from the true
posterior can be regarded as random noise, which allows us to take into account
the uncertainty in posterior approximation in a principled manner. In
particular, our model can quantify the difficulty in posterior approximation by
a Gaussian variational density. Inference in our GP model is done by a single
feed forward pass through the network, significantly faster than semi-amortized
methods. We show that our approach attains higher test data likelihood than the
state-of-the-arts on several benchmark datasets.

to defend against such attacks trains on generated adversarial examples to
learn their distribution. Previous work aimed to align original and adversarial
image representations in the same way as domain adaptation to improve
robustness. Yet, they partially align the representations using approaches that

difficult to accurately compare robustness between defended models. Until now,
they have been evaluated using a fixed perturbation size. However, defended
models may react differently to variations of this perturbation size. In this
paper, the analogy of domain adaptation is taken a step further by exploiting
optimal transport theory. We propose to use a loss between distributions that

promising successes in goodness-of-fit tests and model learning in high

depends crucially on the search of optimal slicing directions to discriminate
between two distributions. Unfortunately, previous gradient-based optimisation
approaches for this task return sub-optimal results: they are computationally
expensive, sensitive to initialization, and they lack theoretical guarantees
for convergence. We address these issues in two steps. First, we provide
theoretical results stating that the requirement of using optimal slicing
directions in the kernelized version of SSD can be relaxed, validating the
resulting discrepancy with finite random slicing directions. Second, given that
good slicing directions are crucial for practical performance, we propose a
fast algorithm for finding such slicing directions based on ideas of active
sub-space construction and spectral decomposition. Experiments on
goodness-of-fit tests and model learning show that our approach achieves both
improved performance and faster convergence. Especially, we demonstrate a
14-80x speed-up in goodness-of-fit tests when comparing with gradient-based

physical models of the turbulent magnetized interstellar medium. This letter
takes a significant step toward this goal by proposing a method that retrieves
non-Gaussian statistical characteristics of dust emission from noisy Planck

coherent structures in non-Gaussian random fields and define a generative model
of the data. The method was validated on mock data combining a dust map from a
magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Planck noise maps. The denoised map
reproduces the true power spectrum down to scales where the noise power is an
order of magnitude larger than that of the signal. It remains highly correlated
to the true emission and retrieves some of its non-Gaussian properties. Applied
to Planck data, the method provides a new approach to building a generative
model of dust polarization that will characterize the full complexity of the
dust emission. We also release PyWPH, a public Python package, to perform
GPU-accelerated WPH analyses on images.

leverages automated and elastic pipelining and data parallelism for efficient

adjusts the pipelining and data parallelism by identifying and freezing some

excludes converged layers from the pipeline, packs active layers into fewer
GPUs, and forks more replicas to increase data-parallel width. We evaluate
PipeTransformer using Vision Transformer (ViT) on ImageNet and BERT on GLUE and

classical linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based estimators, also known
as Wiener filtering. For this, we propose a low-complexity recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based estimator that allows channel equalization of a sequence of
channel observations based on independent time- and frequency-domain long
short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Motivated by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
applications, we simulate time- and frequency-selective channels with
orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) and extend our channel models in
such a way that a continuous degradation from line-of-sight (LoS) to
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions can be emulated. It turns out that the
NN-based system cannot just compete with the LMMSE equalizer, but it also can
be trained w.r.t. resilience against system parameter mismatch. We thereby
showcase the conceptual simplicity of such a data-driven system design, as this
not only enables more robustness against, e.g., signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) or
Doppler spread estimation mismatches, but also allows to use the same equalizer
over a wider range of input parameters without the need of re-building (or
re-estimating) the filter coefficients. Particular attention has been paid to
ensure compatibility with the existing IEEE 802.11p piloting scheme for V2X
communications. Finally, feeding the payload data symbols as additional
equalizer input unleashes further performance gains. We show significant gains
over the conventional LMMSE equalization for highly dynamic channel conditions
if such a data-augmented equalization scheme is used.

between perceived realism and a physically accurate approximation of reality in
a virtual reality experience in which the user has been scaled by a factor of
ten. Study 1 investigated perception of physics when scaled-down by a factor of
ten, whereas Study 2 focused on enlargement by a similar amount. Studies were
carried out as within-subjects experiments in which a total of 84 subjects
performed simple interaction tasks with objects under two different physics
simulation conditions. In the true physics condition, the objects, when dropped
and thrown, behaved accurately according to the physics that would be correct
at that either reduced or enlarged scale in the real world. In the movie
physics condition, the objects behaved in a similar manner as they would if no
scaling of the user had occurred. We found that a significant majority of the
users considered the movie physics condition to be the more realistic one.
However, at enlarged scale, many users considered true physics to match their
expectations even if they ultimately believed movie physics to be the realistic

were scanned as part of a clinical trial of ketamine efficacy under three

infusion; and c) 6-9 hours following placebo-saline infusion. We obtained
estimates of E/I interaction strengths by using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM)
on the timeseries, thereby allowing us to pinpoint, under each scanning
condition, where each subject's dynamics lie within the Poincar\'e diagram - as
defined in dynamical systems theory. We demonstrate that the Poincar\'e diagram
offers classification capability for TRD patients, in that the further the
patients' coordinates were shifted (by virtue of ketamine) toward the stable

symptoms improved. The same relationship was not observed by virtue of a

show that the shift in neural dynamics required for symptom improvement

getting such results was suggested and applied by B. Plotkin and the author (B.
Plotkin , G. Zhitomirski, On automorphisms of categories of free algebras of
some varieties, J. Algebra 306(2) (2006) 344-367). The method is to find all
terms in the language of a given variety which determine such V-algebras that
are isomorphic to a given C-algebra and have the same underlying set with it.
But this method can be applied only to automorphisms which take all objects to
isomorphic ones. The aim of the present paper is to suggest another method that
is free from the mentioned restriction. This method is based on two main
theorems. Let C be a category supplied with a faithful representative functor
to the category of sets. Theorem 1 gives a general description of automorphisms
of C, using a new notion of a quasi-inner automorphism. Theorem 5 shows how to
obtain the full description of automorphisms of the category of finitely

of them shows the preference of our method in a known situation (the variety of
all semigroups) and the second one demonstrates obtaining new results (the

solve this problem, we consider the estimator given by the last iterate of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with constant step-size. In this context, our
contribution is two fold: (i) from a (stochastic) optimization perspective, we
exhibit an archetypal problem where we can show explicitly the convergence of
SGD final iterate for a non-strongly convex problem with constant step-size
whereas usual results use some form of average and (ii) from a statistical
perspective, we give explicit non-asymptotic convergence rates in the
over-parameterized setting and leverage a fine-grained parameterization of the
problem to exhibit polynomial rates that can be faster than $O(1/T)$. The link
with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is established.

the phase difference of two coherent Gaussian vortex beams. The scintillation

contrast to conventional communication systems where the principal criteria are
to maximize the throughput, we aim at optimizing the learning performance.
Specifically, we minimize the maximum learning error of all users by jointly
optimizing the beamforming vectors of the base station and the phase-shift
matrix of the RIS. An alternating optimization-based framework is proposed to
optimize the two terms iteratively, where closed-form expressions of the
beamforming vectors are derived, and an alternating direction method of

searching framework to effectively solve the nonconvex optimization problem of
the phase-shift matrix. Simulation results demonstrate significant gains of
deploying an RIS and validate the advantages of our proposed algorithms over

very high energy emission from blazars remains controversial in the literature.
The possible role of resonance beam plasma instability has been studied both
analytically and numerically but no consensus has been reached. In this paper,
we thoroughly analyze the development of this type of instability. This
analysis takes into account that a highly relativistic beam loses energy only
due to interactions with the plasma waves propagating within the opening angle
of the beam (we call them parallel waves), whereas excitation of oblique waves
results merely in an angular spreading of the beam, which reduces the
instability growth rate. For parallel waves, the growth rate is a few times
larger than for oblique ones, so they grow faster than oblique waves and drain
energy from the beam before it expands. However, the specific property of
extragalactic beams is that they are extraordinarily narrow; the opening angle
is only $\Delta\theta\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$. In this case, the width of the
resonance for parallel waves, $\propto\Delta\theta^2$, is too small for them to
grow in realistic conditions. We perform both analytical estimates and
numerical simulations in the quasilinear regime. These show that for
extragalactic beams, the growth of the waves is incapable of taking a
significant portion of the beam's energy. This type of instability could at
best lead to an expansion of the beam by some factor but the beam's energy
remains nearly intact.

an Earth-like profile and a simplified thermal structure. The molecular line
width of such planets can be comparable to or broader than the Doppler shift
due to the planetary orbital motion. Given the likely difficulty in knowing the
high-resolution MIR spectrum of the host star with sufficient accuracy, we
propose to observe the target system at two quadrature phases and extract the
differential spectra as the planetary signal. In this case, the signals can be
substantially suppressed compared with the case where the host star spectrum is
perfectly known, as some parts of the spectral features do not remain in the
differential spectra. Despite this self-subtraction, the CO$_2$ and H$_2$O
features of nearby ($\lesssim $ 5~pc) systems with mid-/late-M host stars would
be practical with a 6.5-meter-class cryogenic telescope, and orbital
inclination could also be constrained for some of them. For CO$_2$ and N$_2$O
in a 1~bar Earth-like atmosphere, this method would be sensitive when the
mixing ratio is 1-10$^3$ ppm. The detectability of molecules except O$_3$ is
not significantly improved when the spectral resolution is higher than

  references",,"10.1007/JHEP09(2021)136",,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First we review in detail the
geometric aspects of the swampland program for supersymmetric 4d effective
theories using a new and unifying language we dub `domestic geometry', the
generalization of special K\""ahler geometry which does not require the
underlying manifold to be K\""ahler or have a complex structure. All 4d SUGRAs
are described by domestic geometry. As special K\""ahler geometries, domestic
geometries carry formal brane amplitudes: when the domestic geometry describes
the supersymmetric low-energy limit of a consistent quantum theory of gravity,
its formal brane amplitudes have the right properties to be actual branes. The
main datum of the domestic geometry of a 4d SUGRA is its gauge coupling, seen
as a map from a manifold which satisfies the geometric Ooguri-Vafa conjectures
to the Siegel variety; to understand the properties of the quantum-consistent
gauge couplings we discuss several novel aspects of such `Ooguri-Vafa'
manifolds, including their Liouville properties.
  Our second goal is to present some novel speculation on the extension of the
swampland program to no-supersymmetric effective theories of gravity. The idea
is that the domestic geometric description of the quantum-consistent effective
theories extends, possibly with some qualifications, also to the
non-supersymmetric case.

linear patterns and extract this type of information from diverse imagery
conditions. Here, we propose a deep learning approach based on graphs to detect
plantation lines in UAV-based RGB imagery presenting a challenging scenario
containing spaced plants. The first module of our method extracts a feature map
throughout the backbone, which consists of the initial layers of the VGG16.
This feature map is used as an input to the Knowledge Estimation Module (KEM),
organized in three concatenated branches for detecting 1) the plant positions,
2) the plantation lines, and 3) for the displacement vectors between the
plants. A graph modeling is applied considering each plant position on the
image as vertices, and edges are formed between two vertices (i.e. plants).
Finally, the edge is classified as pertaining to a certain plantation line
based on three probabilities (higher than 0.5): i) in visual features obtained
from the backbone; ii) a chance that the edge pixels belong to a line, from the
KEM step; and iii) an alignment of the displacement vectors with the edge, also
from KEM. Experiments were conducted in corn plantations with different growth
stages and patterns with aerial RGB imagery. A total of 564 patches with 256 x
256 pixels were used and randomly divided into training, validation, and
testing sets in a proportion of 60\%, 20\%, and 20\%, respectively. The
proposed method was compared against state-of-the-art deep learning methods,
and achieved superior performance with a significant margin, returning
precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.7\%, 91.9\%, and 95.1\%, respectively.
This approach is useful in extracting lines with spaced plantation patterns and
could be implemented in scenarios where plantation gaps occur, generating lines
with few-to-none interruptions.

ordered solid-state materials and provide great tunability and flexibility for
interacting with various quantum modules for integration in diverse quantum

exploration of novel quantum phenomena in materials science and engineering. In

  sources","26 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1002/mp.14844",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To update and extend the Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy
Physics (CLRP) Eye Plaque (EP) dosimetry database for low-energy
photon-emitting brachytherapy sources using egs_brachy, an open-source EGSnrc
application. The previous database, CLRP_EPv1, contained datasets for the
Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) plaques (2008). The new database,
CLRP EPv2, consists of newly-calculated 3D dose distributions for 17 plaques [8
COMS, 5 Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG, and 4 other representative models] for Pd-103,
I-125, and Cs-131 seeds.
  Methods: Plaque models are developed with egs_brachy, based on
published/manufacturer dimensions and material data. The BEBIG plaques are
identical in dimensions to COMS plaques but differ in elemental composition
and/or density. Eye plaques and seeds are simulated at the centre of
full-scatter water phantoms, scoring in (0.05 cm)^3 voxels spanning the eye for
scenarios: (i) HOMO: simulated TG43 conditions; (ii) HETERO: eye plaques and
seeds fully modelled; (iii) HETsi (BEBIG only): one seed is active at a time
with other seed geometries present but not emitting photons (inactive). For
validation, doses are compared to those from CLRP_EPv1 and published data.
  Data Format and Access: Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/
clrp/eye_plaque_v2, http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2. The data consist of 3D
dose distributions (text-based EGSnrc 3ddose file) and graphical presentations
of the comparisons to previously published data.
  Potential Applications: The CLRP EPv2 database provides accurate reference 3D
dose distributions to advance ocular brachytherapy dose evaluations. The
fully-benchmarked eye plaque models will be freely-distributed with egs brachy,
supporting adoption of model-based dose evaluations as recommended by TG-129,
TG-186, and TG-221.

late-stage circumplanetary disk around Saturn. Evaluating the evolution of the
abundances of volatile species in this disk as a function of the migration,
growth, and evaporation of icy grains is then of primary importance to assess
the origin of the material that eventually formed these two moons. Here we use
a simple prescription of Saturn's circumplanetary disk in which the location of
the centrifugal radius is varied, to investigate the time evolution of the
icelines of water ice, ammonia hydrate, methane clathrate, carbon monoxide and
dinitrogen pure condensates. To match their compositional data, the building
blocks of both moons would have had to form in a region of the circumplanetary
disk situated between the icelines of carbon monoxide and dinitrogen at their
outer limit, and the iceline of methane clathrate as their inner limit. We find
that a source of dust at the location of centrifugal radius does not guarantee
the replenishment of the disk in the volatiles assumed to be primordial in
Titan and Enceladus. Only simulations assuming a centrifugal radius in the
66--100 Saturnian radii range allow for the formation and growth of solids with
compositions consistent with those measured in Enceladus and Titan. The species
are then able to evolve in solid forms in the system for longer periods of
time, even reaching an equilibrium, thus favoring the formation of Titan and
Enceladus building blocks in this region of the disk.

from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the
pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system,
representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector
that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share
of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy,
wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the

supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).
Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored
low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower
midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most
countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since
rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus
to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon

industries. On the domain of image classification, convolutional neural
networks proved the ability to learn robust features for the closed set

CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and IMAGENET. These approaches use deep neural networks with
dense layers with softmax activation functions in order to learn features that
can separate classes in a latent space. However, this traditional approach is
not useful for identifying classes unseen on the training set, known as the
open set problem. A similar problem occurs in scenarios involving learning on
small data. To tackle both problems, few-shot learning has been proposed. In
particular, metric learning learns features that obey constraints of a metric
distance in the latent space in order to perform classification. However, while
this approach proves to be useful for the open set problem, current
implementation requires pair-wise training, where both positive and negative
examples of similar images are presented during the training phase, which
limits the applicability of these approaches in large data or large class

we present a constraint-based approach applied to the representations in the
latent space under the normalized softmax loss, proposed by[18]. We
experimentally validate the proposed approach for the classification of unseen
classes on different datasets using both metric learning and the normalized
softmax loss, on disjoint and joint scenarios. Our results show that not only
our proposed strategy can be efficiently trained on larger set of classes, as
it does not require pairwise learning, but also present better classification
results than the metric learning strategies surpassing its accuracy by a

  Markov Remote Sources","Extended Version of a paper submitted for publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The age of Incorrect Information (AoII) has been introduced recently to
address the shortcomings of the standard Age of information metric (AoI) in
real-time monitoring applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of
monitoring the states of remote sources that evolve according to a Markovian
Process. A central scheduler selects at each time slot which sources should
send their updates in such a way to minimize the Mean Age of Incorrect
Information (MAoII). The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the
scheduler cannot know the states of the sources before receiving the updates
and it has then to optimally balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off. We
show that the problem can be modeled as a partially Observable Markov Decision
Process Problem framework. We develop a new scheduling scheme based on
Whittle's index policy. The scheduling decision is made by updating a belief
value of the states of the sources, which is to the best of our knowledge has
not been considered before in the Age of Information area. To that extent, we
proceed by using the Lagrangian Relaxation Approach, and prove that the dual
problem has an optimal threshold policy. Building on that, we shown that the
problem is indexable and compute the expressions of the Whittle's indices.
Finally, we provide some numerical results to highlight the performance of our
derived policy compared to the classical AoI metric.

thus, it has broad applications in crime prevention, forensic identification,

utilize either a gait template which makes it difficult to preserve temporal
information, or a gait sequence that maintains unnecessary sequential
constraints and thus loses the flexibility of gait recognition. In this paper,
we present a novel perspective that utilizes gait as a deep set, which means
that a set of gait frames are integrated by a global-local fused deep network
inspired by the way our left- and right-hemisphere processes information to
learn information that can be used in identification. Based on this deep set
perspective, our method is immune to frame permutations, and can naturally
integrate frames from different videos that have been acquired under different
scenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes, or different
item-carrying conditions. Experiments show that under normal walking
conditions, our single-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of
96.1% on the CASIA-B gait dataset and an accuracy of 87.9% on the OU-MVLP gait
dataset. Under various complex scenarios, our model also exhibits a high level
of robustness. It achieves accuracies of 90.8% and 70.3% on CASIA-B under
bag-carrying and coat-wearing walking conditions respectively, significantly
outperforming the best existing methods. Moreover, the proposed method
maintains a satisfactory accuracy even when only small numbers of frames are
available in the test samples; for example, it achieves 85.0% on CASIA-B even
when using only 7 frames. The source code has been released at

information about name instances with their predicted cluster indices and
frequencies of those indices per truth cluster. This integrative calculation
reduces greatly calculation runtime, which is scalable to a clustering task

related by a sequence of knot insertion and/or degree elevation steps and
performing only numerically stable operations. In addition to theoretically

granularity level that is biased towards easy-to-spot and low impact cases.
  We designed and implemented a framework -- Twitter Watch -- that performs
structured Twitter data collection, applying it to the Portuguese
Twittersphere. We investigate a data snapshot taken on May 2020, with around 5
million accounts and over 120 million tweets (this value has since increased to
over 175 million). The analyzed time period stretches from August 2019 to May
2020, with a focus on the Portuguese elections of October 6th, 2019. However,
the Covid-19 pandemic showed itself in our data, and we also delve into how it
affected typical Twitter behavior.
  We performed three main approaches: content-oriented, metadata-oriented, and
network interaction-oriented. We learn that Twitter's suspension patterns are
not adequate to the type of political trolling found in the Portuguese
Twittersphere -- identified by this work and by an independent peer - nor to
fake news posting accounts. We also surmised that the different types of
malicious accounts we independently gathered are very similar both in terms of
content and interaction, through two distinct analysis, and are simultaneously
very distinct from regular accounts.

for a laminated Timoshenko beam with interfacial slip in the whole space R
subject to a thermal effect acting only on one component modelled by either
Fourier or Cattaneo law. When the thermal effect is acting via the second or
third component of the laminated Timoshenko beam (rotation angle displacement
or dynamic of the slip), we obtain that both systems, Timoshenko-Fourier and
Timoshenko-Cattaneo systems, satisfy the same polynomial stability estimates in
the L2 -norm of the solution and its higher order derivatives with respect of
the space variable. The decay rate depends on the regularity of the initial
data. In addition, the presence and absence of the regularity-loss type
property are determined by some relations between the parameters of systems.
However, when the thermal effect is acting via the first comoponent of the
system (transversal displacement), a new stability condition is introduced for
both TimoshenkoFourier and Timoshenko-Cattaneo systems. This stability
condition is in the form of threshold between polynomial stability and
convergence to zero. To prove our results, we use the energy method in Fourier
space combined with judicious choices of weight functions to build appropriate
Lyapunov functionals.

is investigated. The system configuration considered is a segmented structure
having non-linear stiffness characteristics. It is proposed here that such a
frequency-shifting mechanism could complement metamaterial concepts for
mass-efficient sound barriers. The acoustical behavior of the material system
was studied through a representative two-dimensional model consisting of a
segmented plate with a contact interface. Multiple harmonic peaks were observed
in response to a purely single frequency excitation, and the strength of the
response was found to depend on the degree of non-linearity introduced. The
lower and closer an excitation frequency was to the characteristic resonance
frequencies of the base system, the stronger was the predicted higher harmonic
response. The broadband sound transmission loss of these systems has also been
calculated and the low frequency sound transmission loss was found to increase
as the level of the broadband incident sound field increased. The present
findings support the feasibility of designing material systems that transfer
energy from lower frequency bands, where a sound barrier is less efficient, to
higher bands where energy is more readily dissipated.

  Quantum 2.0 advances in sensor technology offer many opportunities and new

portfolio of small experiments based on these advances. QuantISED experiments
could use sensor technologies that exemplify Quantum 2.0 breakthroughs. They
would strive to achieve new HEP science results, while possibly spinning off
other domain science applications or serving as pathfinders for future HEP
science targets. QuantISED experiments should be led by a DOE laboratory, to
take advantage of laboratory technical resources, infrastructure, and expertise
in the safe and efficient construction, operation, and review of experiments.

energy, quantum gravity, and new physics responsible for neutrino masses,
cosmic inflation, and the cosmic preference for matter over antimatter. Where
