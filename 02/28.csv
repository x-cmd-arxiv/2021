to observe the condition of the heart, typically looking at the heart from 12
different directions. Several types of the cardiac disease are diagnosed by
using 12-lead ECGs Recently, various wearable devices have enabled immediate
access to the ECG without the use of wieldy equipment. However, they only
provide ECGs with a couple of leads. This results in an inaccurate diagnosis of
cardiac disease due to lacking of required leads. We propose a deep generative
model for ECG synthesis from two asynchronous leads to ten leads. It first
represents a heart condition referring to two leads, and then generates ten
leads based on the represented heart condition. Both the rhythm and amplitude
of leads generated resemble those of the original ones, while the technique
removes noise and the baseline wander appearing in the original leads. As a
data augmentation method, our model improves the classification performance of
models compared with models using ECGs with only one or two leads.

numerous methods proposed every year. Thanks to the advent of deep learning in
semantic segmentation, the performance on existing benchmarks is close to
saturation. A natural question then arises: Does the superior performance on
the closed (and frequently re-used) test sets transfer to the open visual world
with unconstrained variations? In this paper, we take steps toward answering
the question by exposing failures of existing semantic segmentation methods in
the open visual world under the constraint of very limited human labeling
effort. Inspired by previous research on model falsification, we start from an
arbitrarily large image set, and automatically sample a small image set by
MAximizing the Discrepancy (MAD) between two segmentation methods. The selected
images have the greatest potential in falsifying either (or both) of the two
methods. We also explicitly enforce several conditions to diversify the exposed
failures, corresponding to different underlying root causes. A segmentation
method, whose failures are more difficult to be exposed in the MAD competition,
is considered better. We conduct a thorough MAD diagnosis of ten PASCAL VOC
semantic segmentation algorithms. With detailed analysis of experimental
results, we point out strengths and weaknesses of the competing algorithms, as
well as potential research directions for further advancement in semantic

information on both architectural and non-permanent elements. These models must
be created from measured data such as RGB-D images or 3D point clouds, whose
capture and consolidation involves lengthy data workflows. This strongly limits
the rate at which 3D models can be produced, preventing the adoption of many
digital services for indoor space management. We provide an alternative to such
data-intensive procedures by presenting Walk2Map, a data-driven approach to
generate floor plans only from trajectories of a person walking inside the
rooms. Thanks to recent advances in data-driven inertial odometry, such
minimalistic input data can be acquired from the IMU readings of consumer-level
smartphones, which allows for an effortless and scalable mapping of real-world
indoor spaces. Our work is based on learning the latent relation between an
indoor walk trajectory and the information represented in a floor plan:
interior space footprint, portals, and furniture. We distinguish between
recovering area-related (interior footprint, furniture) and wall-related

them in a cascaded fashion on an indoor walk trajectory at inference time. We
perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation using both simulated and

image-to-image translation. The experiments confirm the feasibility of our

study a time sequence of linear and circular polarimetric images of numerical,

resolved linear and circular polarizations is rather sensitive to the
assumption of the coupling of electron and ions in the accretion flow. Models
with cooler electrons have higher Faraday rotation and conversion depths which
results in scrambled linear polarization and enhanced circular polarization. In
those high Faraday thickness cases the circular polarization is particularly
sensitive to dynamics of toroidal-radial magnetic fields in the accretion
flows. The models with high Faraday thickness are characterized by nearly
constant handedness of circular polarization, consistent with observations of
some accreting black holes. We also find that the emission region produced by
light which is lensed around the black hole shows inversion of circular
polarization handedness with respect to the handedness of the circular
polarization of the entire emission region. Such polarity inversions are unique
to near horizon emission.

may lead to software defects and affect code understandability. In this paper,
we present DeepName, a context-based, deep learning approach to detect method
name inconsistencies and suggest a proper name for a method. The key departure
point is the philosophy of ""Show Me Your Friends, I'll Tell You Who You Are"".
Unlike the state-of-the-art approaches, in addition to the method's body, we
also consider the interactions of the current method under study with the other
ones including the caller and callee methods, and the sibling methods in the
same enclosing class. The sequences of sub-tokens in the program entities'
names in the contexts are extracted and used as the input for an RNN-based
encoder-decoder to produce the representations for the current method. We
modify that RNN model to integrate the copy mechanism and our newly developed
component, called the non-copy mechanism, to emphasize on the possibility of a
certain sub-token not to be copied to follow the current sub-token in the
currently generated method name.
  We conducted several experiments to evaluate DeepName on large datasets with
+14M methods. For consistency checking, DeepName improves the state-of-the-art
approach by 2.1%, 19.6%, and 11.9% relatively in recall, precision, and

total, in 30/50 cases, the team members agree that our suggested method names

approach that locates the buggy code at the statement and method levels by
treating FL as an image pattern recognition problem. DeepRL4FL does so via
novel code coverage representation learning (RL) and data dependencies RL for
program statements. Those two types of RL on the dynamic information in a code
coverage matrix are also combined with the code representation learning on the
static information of the usual suspicious source code. This combination is
inspired by crime scene investigation in which investigators analyze the crime
scene (failed test cases and statements) and related persons (statements with
dependencies), and at the same time, examine the usual suspects who have
committed a similar crime in the past (similar buggy code in the training
data).
  For the code coverage information, DeepRL4FL first orders the test cases and
marks error-exhibiting code statements, expecting that a model can recognize
the patterns discriminating between faulty and non-faulty statements/methods.
For dependencies among statements, the suspiciousness of a statement is seen
taking into account the data dependencies to other statements in execution and
data flows, in addition to the statement by itself. Finally, the vector
representations for code coverage matrix, data dependencies among statements,
and source code are combined and used as the input of a classifier built from a
Convolution Neural Network to detect buggy statements/methods. Our empirical
evaluation shows that DeepRL4FL improves the top-1 results over the
state-of-the-art statement-level FL baselines from 173.1% to 491.7%. It also
improves the top-1 results over the existing method-level FL baselines from
15.0% to 206.3%.

the bore paths' deviations impact. We introduce an adaptive, anisotropic
stochastic collocation method, known as the generalized Smolyak algorithm,
which was previously unused in this context and apply it to a numerical model

exchanger array performance is surprisingly reliable even with potentially
severe implementation errors during their construction. This, coupled with the

uniformly sampled waypoints defined in the model coordinate system into a
highly discontinuous motion in the machine coordinate system, which leads to

model multi-phase features for accurate liver tumor segmentation, in which a
phase attention (PA) is newly proposed to additionally exploit the images of
arterial (ART) phase to facilitate the segmentation of portal venous (PV)
phase. The PA block consists of an intra-phase attention (Intra-PA) module and
an inter-phase attention (Inter-PA) module to capture channel-wise
self-dependencies and cross-phase interdependencies, respectively. Thus it
enables the network to learn more representative multi-phase features by
refining the PV features according to the channel dependencies and
recalibrating the ART features based on the learned interdependencies between
phases. We propose a PA-based multi-scale fusion (MSF) architecture to embed
the PA blocks in the network at multiple levels along the encoding path to fuse
multi-scale features from multi-phase images. Moreover, a 3D boundary-enhanced
loss (BE-loss) is proposed for training to make the network more sensitive to
boundaries. To evaluate the performance of our proposed PA-ResSeg, we conducted
experiments on a multi-phase CT dataset of focal liver lesions (MPCT-FLLs).
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving
a dice per case (DPC) of 0.77.87, a dice global (DG) of 0.8682, a volumetric
overlap error (VOE) of 0.3328 and a relative volume difference (RVD) of 0.0443

people usually utilize first-order methods (e.g., gradient descent ascent) to
find the optimal solution. One feature which separates convex-concave min-max
problems from convex minimization problems is that the best known convergence
rates for min-max problems have an explicit dependence on the size of the
domain, rather than on the distance between initial point and the optimal
solution. This means that the convergence speed does not have any improvement
even if the algorithm starts from the optimal solution, and hence, is oblivious
to the initialization. Here, we show that strict-convexity-strict-concavity is
sufficient to get the convergence rate to depend on the initialization. We also
show how different algorithms can asymptotically achieve
initialization-dependent convergence rates on this class of functions.
Furthermore, we show that the so-called ""parameter-free"" algorithms allow to
achieve improved initialization-dependent asymptotic rates without any learning
rate to tune. In addition, we utilize this particular parameter-free algorithm
as a subroutine to design a new algorithm, which achieves a novel
non-asymptotic fast rate for strictly-convex-strictly-concave min-max problems

If this assumption is satisfied, even a two pixel imaging system can provide a

sufficiently precise as to be used as a robustly reliable steering signal.
Implementing Eulerian optical flow sensing poses significant challenges,
however. Lagrangian optical flow, on the other hand, tracks feature image
points as they move on the retina. This form of visual sensing is the basis for
many standard computer vision implementations, including Lukas-Kanade and
Horn-Schunck. Lagrangian optical flow has its own challenges, not least of
which is that it is badly confounded by rotational components of motion.
Combined steering and sensing strategies for mitigating the effects of
rotational motions are considered.

regulation to justify and explain their analysis results. At the same time, the
logic that they have followed to analyze the data, i.e., their queries, may be
proprietary and confidential. Data provenance, a record of the transformations
that data underwent, was extensively studied as means of explanations. In
contrast, only a few works have studied the tension between disclosing
provenance and hiding the underlying query.
  This tension is the focus of the present paper, where we formalize and
explore for the first time the tradeoff between the utility of presenting
provenance information and the breach of privacy it poses with respect to the
underlying query. Intuitively, our formalization is based on the notion of
provenance abstraction, where the representation of some tuples in the
provenance expressions is abstracted in a way that makes multiple tuples
indistinguishable. The privacy of a chosen abstraction is then measured based
on how many queries match the obfuscated provenance, in the same vein as
k-anonymity. The utility is measured based on the entropy of the abstraction,
intuitively how much information is lost with respect to the actual tuples
participating in the provenance. Our formalization yields a novel optimization
problem of choosing the best abstraction in terms of this tradeoff. We show
that the problem is intractable in general, but design greedy heuristics that
exploit the provenance structure towards a practically efficient exploration of
the search space. We experimentally prove the effectiveness of our solution
using the TPC-H benchmark and the IMDB dataset.

Azobenzene exists in two isomers trans- and cis-. We show that all nuclear

i.e. of Copernican period. The aim of this work is to improve our understanding
of such relationships based on our new estimates of the craters's depth and
diameter. Previous studies considered similar relationships for much older
craters (up to 3.2 billion years). We calculated the depths of craters with
diameters from 10 to 100 km based on the altitude profiles derived from data
obtained by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The ratio h/D of the depth h of a crater to its
diameter D can diverge by up to a factor of two for craters with almost the
same diameters. The linear and power approximations (regressions) of the
dependence of h/D on D were made for simple and complex Copernican craters
selected from the data from Mazrouei et al. (2019) and Losiak et al. (2015).
For the separation of highland craters into two groups based only on their
dependences of h/D on D, at D<18 km these are mostly simple craters, although
some complex craters can have diameters D>16 km. Depths of mare craters with
D<14 km are greater than 0.15D. Following Pike's (1981) classification, we
group mare craters of D<15 km as simple craters. Mare craters with 15<D<18 km
fit both approximation curves for simple and complex craters. Depths of mare
craters with D>18 km are in a better agreement with the approximation curve of
h/D vs. D for complex craters than for simple craters. At the same diameter,
mare craters are deeper than highland craters at a diameter smaller than 30-40
km. For greater diameters, highland craters are deeper.

develops with time. Several arc-structures evolve perpendicular to the jet
ridge line. We find evidence for precession of a curved jet based on kinematic
modelling and a periodicity analysis. An outflowing broad line region (BLR)
based on the C IV line emission (Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS) is found. We
attribute the atypical ring to an interaction of the precessing jet with the
outflowing material. We discuss our findings in the context of a spine-sheath
scenario where the ring reveals the sheath and its interaction with the
surroundings (narrow line region, NLR, clouds). We find that the radio emission
is correlated with the $\gamma$-ray emission, with radio lagging the
$\gamma$-rays. Based on the $\gamma$-ray variability timescale, we constrain
the $\gamma$-ray emission zone to the BLR (30-200 $r_{\rm g}$) and within the
jet launching region. We discuss that the outflowing BLR provides the external
radiation field for $\gamma$-ray production via external Compton scattering.
The neutrino is most likely produced by proton-proton interaction in the blazar
zone (beyond the BLR), enabled by episodic encounters of the jet with dense
clouds, i.e. some molecular cloud in the NLR.

player limit of social dilemma games is a matter of intense speculation.
Various analytical methods have been proposed to analyse the thermodynamic
limit of social dilemmas. In a previous work [Chaos Solitons and fractals 135,
109762(2020)] involving one among us, two of those methods, Hamiltonian
Dynamics(HD) and Nash equilibrium(NE) mapping were compared. The inconsistency
and incorrectness of HD approach vis-a-vis NE mapping was brought to light. In
this work we compare a third analytical method, i.e, Darwinian evolution(DE)
with NE mapping and a numerical agent based approach. For completeness, we give
results for HD approach as well. In contrast to HD which involves maximisation
of payoffs of all individuals, in DE, payoff of a single player is maximised
with respect to its nearest neighbour. While, HD utterly fails as compared to
NE mapping, DE method gives a false positive for game magnetisation -- the net
difference between the fraction of cooperators and defectors -- when payoffs
obey the condition a+d=b+c, wherein a, d represent the diagonal elements and b,
c the off diagonal elements in symmetric social dilemma games. When either a+d
=/= b+c or, when one looks at average payoff per player, DE method fails much
like the HD approach. NE mapping and numerical agent based method on the other
hand agree really well for both game magnetisation as well as average payoff
per player for the social dilemmas in question, i.e., Hawk-Dove game and Public
goods game. This paper thus bring to light the inconsistency of the DE method
vis-a-vis both NE mapping as well as a numerical agent based approach.

obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system, is to deal with unrealizable
specifications. One means to deal with unrealizability, in the context of
GR(1), an expressive assume-guarantee fragment of LTL that enables efficient
synthesis, is the computation of an unrealizable core, which can be viewed as a
fault-localization approach. Existing solutions, however, are computationally
costly, are limited to computing a single core, and do not correctly support
specifications with constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements.
  In this work we address these limitations. First, we present QuickCore, a
novel algorithm that accelerates unrealizable core computations by relying on
the monotonicity of unrealizability, on an incremental computation, and on
additional properties of GR(1) specifications. Second, we present Punch, a
novel algorithm to efficiently compute all unrealizable cores of a
specification. Finally, we present means to correctly handle specifications
that include higher-level constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements.
  We implemented our ideas on top of Spectra, an open-source language and
synthesis environment. Our evaluation over benchmarks from the literature shows
that QuickCore is in most cases faster than previous algorithms, and that its
relative advantage grows with scale. Moreover, we found that most
specifications include more than one core, and that Punch finds all the cores
significantly faster than a competing naive algorithm.

combined with photon detection based on a 8x8 single-photon-detector-array. The
observed time-bin visibility for scattered photons remained at a high $95\%$
over a wide scattering angle range of -45 degree to +45 degree, while the
individual pixels in the detector array resolve or track an image in its field
of view of ca. 0.5 degrees. Using our method we demonstrate the viability of
two novel applications. Firstly, using scattered photons as an indirect channel
for quantum communication thereby enabling non-line-of-sight quantum
communication with background suppression, and secondly, using the combined
arrival time and quantum coherence to enhance the contrast of low-light imaging
and laser ranging under high background light. We believe our method will

Rather than equipping each layer of a discretized ODE-network with a set of

coefficients are the trainable parameters of the neural network. Decoupling the
trainable parameters from the layers of the neural network enables us to

hyperparameters due to increased stability and accuracy of the network

creep rate and give rise to large internal stresses that can lead to damage
development, e.g. formation of wedge cracks. The present study provides more
insight into the effects of grain-boundary sliding (GBS) on the deformation
behaviour of realistic polycrystalline aggregates during creep, through the
development of a computational framework which combines: i) the use of
interface elements for sliding at grain boundaries, and ii) special triple
point (in 2D) or triple line (in 3D) elements to prevent artificial dilation at
these locations in the microstructure with iii) a physically-based crystal
plasticity constitutive model for time-dependent inelastic deformation of the
individual grains. Experimental data at various scales is used to calibrate the
framework and compare with model predictions. We pay particular consideration
to effects of grain boundary sliding during creep of Type 316 stainless steel,
which is used extensively in structural components of the UK fleet of Advanced
Gas Cooled Nuclear Reactors (AGRs). It is found that the anisotropic
deformation of the grains and the mismatch in crystallographic orientation
between neighbouring grains play a significant role in determining the extent
of sliding on a given boundary. Their effect on the development of stress
within the grains, particularly at triple grain junctions, and the increase in
axial stress along transverse boundaries are quantified. The article
demonstrates that the magnitude of the stress along the facets is
highly-dependent on the crystallographic orientations of the neighbouring
grains and the relative amount of sliding. Boundaries, transverse to the
applied load tend to carry higher normal stresses of the order of 100-180 MPa,
in cases where the neighbouring grains consist of plastically-harder
crystallographic orientations.

is highly questioned, dealing with the micro and nanosystems and biological
tissues. In other words, the results obtained from the classical equations
deviate from the available experimental data. It means that the continuum heat
diffusion equation is insufficient and inappropriate for modeling heat
transport in these cases. There are several techniques for modeling non-Fourier
heat conduction. In the present paper, we place our focus on the dual-phase-lag
(DPL) approach. The DPL model, as a popular modification of Fourier's law, has
already been utilized in numerous situations, such as simulating ultrafast
laser heating and heat conduction in carbon nanotubes. There has been a sharp
increase in research on non-Fourier heat conduction in recent years. Several
studies have been performed in the fields of thermoelasticity, thermodynamics,
transistor modeling, and bioheat transport. This review presents the most
recent non-Fourier bioheat conduction works and the related thermodynamics
background. The various mathematical tools, modeling different thermal
therapies, and relevant criticisms and disputes are discussed. Finally, the
novel and other possible studies are also presented to provide a better
overview, and the roadmap to the future research and challenges ahead is drawn
up.

coefficient model through radial kernel functions in the context of a
longitudinal study. Our proposal is based on a linear combination of weighted
kernel functions involving a bandwidth, centered around a given set of time
points. In addition, we study different alternatives of estimation and
inference including a Frequentist approach using weighted least squares along
with bootstrap methods, and a Bayesian approach through both Markov chain Monte
Carlo and variational methods. We compare the estimation strategies mention
above with each other, and our radial kernel functions proposal with an
expansion based on regression spline, by means of an extensive simulation study
considering multiples scenarios in terms of sample size, number of repeated
measurements, and subject-specific correlation. Our experiments show that the
capabilities of our proposal based on radial kernel functions are indeed
comparable with or even better than those obtained from regression splines. We
illustrate our methodology by analyzing data from two AIDS clinical studies.

attracted great attention in view of electronic and photonic applications due
to its unique properties including a wide band gap exceeding that of the most
stable beta phase (\b{eta}-Ga2O3). However, the lower thermal stability of the
{\alpha}-phase at ambient conditions in comparison with the \b{eta}-phase
requires careful investigation of its resistance to other external influences
such as ion irradiation, ion doping, etc. In this work, the structural changes
under the action of Al+ ion irradiation have been investigated for a
polymorphic gallium oxide layers grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy on
c-plane sapphire and consisting predominantly of {\alpha}-phase with inclusions
of {\alpha}(\k{appa})-phase. It is established by the X-ray diffraction
technique that inclusions of {\alpha}(\k{appa})-phase in the irradiated layer
undergo the expansion along the normal to the substrate surface, while there is
no a noticeable deformation for the {\alpha}-phase. This speaks in favor of the
different radiation tolerance of various Ga2O3 polymorphs, especially the
higher radiation tolerance of the {\alpha}-phase. This fact should be taken
into account when utilizing ion implantation to modify gallium oxide properties

ideas of constructed analogs and ensemble optimal interpolation in the data
assimilation piece. To extend the scalability of cAnEnOI for use in data
assimilation on complex dynamical models, we propose using patching schemes to
divide the global spatial domain into digestible chunks. Using patches makes
training the generative models possible and has the added benefit of being able
to exploit parallelism during the generative step. Testing this new algorithm
on a 1D toy model, we find that larger patch sizes make it harder to train an
accurate generative model (i.e. a model whose reconstruction error is small),
while conversely the data assimilation performance improves at larger patch
sizes. There is thus a sweet spot where the patch size is large enough to
enable good data assimilation performance, but not so large that it becomes
difficult to train an accurate generative model. In our tests the new patched
cAnEnOI method outperforms the original (unpatched) cAnEnOI, as well as the
ensemble square root filter results from [Grooms QJRMS, 2020].

Because speech disorders can negatively affect the lives and the development of
children, clinical intervention is often recommended. To help with diagnosis
and treatment, clinicians use instrumented methods such as spectrograms or
ultrasound tongue imaging to analyse speech articulations. Analysis with these
methods can be laborious for clinicians, therefore there is growing interest in
its automation. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of ultrasound
tongue imaging for the automatic detection of speech articulation errors. Our
systems are trained on typically developing child speech and augmented with a
database of adult speech using audio and ultrasound. Evaluation on typically
developing speech indicates that pre-training on adult speech and jointly using
ultrasound and audio gives the best results with an accuracy of 86.9%. To
evaluate on disordered speech, we collect pronunciation scores from experienced
speech and language therapists, focusing on cases of velar fronting and gliding
of /r/. The scores show good inter-annotator agreement for velar fronting, but
not for gliding errors. For automatic velar fronting error detection, the best
results are obtained when jointly using ultrasound and audio. The best system
correctly detects 86.6% of the errors identified by experienced clinicians. Out
of all the segments identified as errors by the best system, 73.2% match errors
identified by clinicians. Results on automatic gliding detection are harder to
interpret due to poor inter-annotator agreement, but appear promising. Overall
findings suggest that automatic detection of speech articulation errors has
potential to be integrated into ultrasound intervention software for

current with energies as high as several tens of MeV [1-3] in current quench
phase (CQ). These runaway electrons can cause significant damage to the
plasma-facing-components due to their localized energy deposition. To mitigate
these effects, impurity injections of high-Z atoms have been proposed [1-3]. In
this paper, we use a self-consistent 0D tokamak disruption model as implemented
in PREDICT code [6] which has been upgraded to take into account the effect of
impurity injections on RE dynamics as suggested in [4-5]. Dominant RE
generation mechanisms such as the secondary avalanche mechanism as well as
primary RE-generation mechanisms namely Dreicer, hot-tail, tritium decay and
Compton scattering (from {\gamma}-rays emitted from activated walls) have been
taken into account. In these simulations, the effect of impurities is taken
into account considering collisions of REs with free and bound electrons as
well as scattering from full and partially-shielded nuclear charge. These
corrections were also implemented in the relativistic test particle model to
simulate RE-dynamics in momentum space. We show that the presence of impurities
has a non-uniform effect on the Runaway Electron Distribution function. We also
show that the combined effect of pitch-angle scattering induced by the
collisions with impurity ions and synchrotron emission loss results in the
faster dissipation of RE-energy distribution function [7]. The variation of
different RE generation mechanisms during different phases of the disruption,
mainly before and after impurity injections is reported.

  Our proof of strong stability takes place in the ""frequency domain"" and
ultimately appeals to the pointwise resolvent condition introduced by Tomilov

Accordingly, we firstly establish that the semigroup $\{e^{\mathcal

attenuation at THz, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna
systems have been proposed for THz communications to compensate propagation
losses. However, the cost and power associated with fully digital beamformers
of these huge antenna arrays are prohibitive. In this paper, we develop
wideband hybrid beamformers based on both model-based and model-free techniques

radar targets by generating multiple beams toward both RX and the targets. We
formulate the GoSA beamformer design as an optimization problem to provide a
trade-off between the unconstrained communications beamformers and the desired

frequency-independent analog beamformers, we propose a phase correction
technique to align the beams of multiple subcarriers toward a single physical

rotation-powered radio pulsar J0108$-$1431 with the Hubble Space Telescope. We
found a putative candidate for the far-UV (FUV) pulsar counterpart, with the
flux density $f_\nu = 9.0\pm 3.2$ nJy at $\lambda = 1528$ \AA. The pulsar was
not detected, however, at longer wavelengths, with $3\sigma$ upper limits of
52, 37, and 87 nJy at $\lambda =$ 4326, 3355, and 2366 \AA, respectively.
Assuming that the pulsar counterpart was indeed detected in FUV, and the
previously reported marginal $U$ and $B$ detections with the Very Large
Telescope were real, the optical-UV spectrum of the pulsar can be described by
a power-law model with a nearly flat $f_\nu$ spectrum. Similar to younger
pulsars detected in the optical, the slope of the nonthermal spectrum steepens
in the X-ray range. The pulsar's luminosity in the 1500--6000 \AA wavelength
range, $L \sim 1.2\times 10^{27} (d/210\,{\rm pc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponds
to a high efficiency of conversion of pulsar rotation energy loss rate $\dot
{E}$ to the optical-UV radiation, $\eta = L/\dot{E} \sim (1$--$6)\times
10^{-4}$, depending on somewhat uncertain values of distance and spectral
slope. The brightness temperature of the bulk neutron star surface does not
exceed 59,000 K ($3\sigma$ upper bound), as seen by a distant observer. If we
assume that the FUV flux is dominated by a thermal component, then the surface

underperforms compared to modal speech recognition, likely due to a
speaking-mode mismatch between training and testing. We improve silent speech
recognition performance using techniques that address the domain mismatch, such
as fMLLR and unsupervised model adaptation. We also analyse the properties of
silent and modal speech in terms of utterance duration and the size of the
articulatory space. To estimate the articulatory space, we compute the convex
hull of tongue splines, extracted from ultrasound tongue images. Overall, we
observe that the duration of silent speech is longer than that of modal speech,
and that silent speech covers a smaller articulatory space than modal speech.
Although these two properties are statistically significant across speaking
modes, they do not directly correlate with word error rates from speech
recognition.

results in imperfect segmentation near edge regions and low spatial coherence.
As we demonstrate, using a saliency mask as the only label is suboptimal. To
address this limitation, we propose a connectivity-based approach called
bilateral connectivity network (BiconNet), which uses connectivity masks
together with saliency masks as labels for effective modeling of inter-pixel
relationships and object saliency. Moreover, we propose a bilateral voting
module to enhance the output connectivity map, and a novel edge feature
enhancement method that efficiently utilizes edge-specific features. Through
comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our

saliency-based SOD framework to improve its performance with negligible

move towards architectures with structural inductive biases which enable the
model to keep distinct sources of information and routes of processing
well-separated. This structure is linked to the notion of independent
mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to
retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For
example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based
architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to
process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer
architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic
hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the
entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of
information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture
independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with
Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden
representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange
information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism
which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be
more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image
Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically
meaningful specialization as well as improved performance.

to learn collaboratively a common model without sharing their training data.
However, Federated learning has two main drawbacks. First, it is quite
bandwidth inefficient as it involves a lot of message exchanges between the
aggregating server and the participating entities. This bandwidth and
corresponding processing costs could be prohibitive if the participating
entities are, for example, mobile devices. Furthermore, although federated
learning improves privacy by not sharing data, recent attacks have shown that
it still leaks information about the training data. This paper presents a novel
privacy-preserving federated learning scheme. The proposed scheme provides
theoretical privacy guarantees, as it is based on Differential Privacy.
Furthermore, it optimizes the model accuracy by constraining the model learning
phase on few selected weights. Finally, as shown experimentally, it reduces the
upstream and downstream bandwidth by up to 99.9% compared to standard federated
learning, making it practical for mobile systems.

galaxies. Most of them are found in spiral galaxies, rather than in lenticular
ones. We analysed the properties of the ultrafast bars detected in the CALIFA
Survey to investigate whether they are an artefact resulting from an
overestimation of the bar radius and/or an underestimation of the corotation
radius or a new class of bars, whose orbital structure has not yet been
understood. We revised the available measurements of the bar radius based on
ellipse fitting and Fourier analysis and of the bar pattern speed from the
Tremaine-Weinberg method. In addition, we measured the bar radius from the
analysis of the maps tracing the transverse-to-radial force ratio, which we
obtained from the deprojected i-band images of the galaxies retrieved from the
SDSS Survey. We found that nearly all the sample galaxies are spirals with an
inner ring or pseudo-ring circling the bar and/or strong spiral arms, which
hamper the measurement of the bar radius from the ellipse fitting and Fourier
analysis. According to these methods, the bar ends overlap the ring or the
spiral arms making the adopted bar radius unreliable. On the contrary, the bar
radius from the ratio maps are shorter than the corotation radius. This is in
agreement with the theoretical predictions and findings of numerical
simulations about the extension and stability of the stellar orbits supporting
the bars. We conclude that ultrafast bars are no longer observed when the
correct measurement of the bar radius is adopted. Deriving the bar radius in
galaxies with rings and strong spiral arms is not straightforward and a solid
measurement method based on both photometric and kinematic data is still
missing.

total cost: an example might be an insurance company calculating premiums for a
population of mixed-risk individuals. Two natural and competing notions of
fairness might be to a) charge each individual the same price or b) charge each
individual according to the cost that they bring to the pool. In the insurance
literature, these general approaches are referred to as ""solidarity"" and
""actuarial fairness"" and are commonly viewed as opposites. However, in
insurance (and many other natural settings), the cost-sharing game also
exhibits ""externalities of size"": all else being equal, larger groups have
lower average cost. In the insurance case, we analyze a model with
externalities of size due to a reduction in the variability of losses. We
explore how this complicates traditional understandings of fairness, drawing on
literature in cooperative game theory.
  First, we explore solidarity: we show that it is possible for both groups
(high and low risk) to strictly benefit by joining an insurance pool where
costs are evenly split, as opposed to being in separate risk pools. We build on
this by producing a pricing scheme that maximally subsidizes the high risk
group, while maintaining an incentive for lower risk people to stay in the
insurance pool. Next, we demonstrate that with this new model, the price
charged to each individual has to depend on the risk of other participants,
making naive actuarial fairness inefficient. Furthermore, we prove that stable
pricing schemes must be ones where players have the anti-social incentive of
desiring riskier partners, contradicting motivations for using actuarial
fairness. Finally, we describe how these results relate to debates about
fairness in machine learning and potential avenues for future research.

telecommunication networks, where demands for greater bandwidth, network
flexibility, low energy consumption and cost must all be met. The quest for all
optical components has naturally targeted materials with extremely large
nonlinearity, including chalcogenide glasses (ChG) [2] and semiconductors, such
as silicon [3] and AlGaAs [4]. Yet issues such as immature fabrication
technologies for ChG, and high linear and nonlinear losses for semiconductors,
motivate the search for other materials. Here we present the first
demonstration of nonlinear optics in integrated silica based glass waveguides
using continuous wave (CW) light. We demonstrate four wave mixing (FWM), with
low (7mW) CW pump power at a wavelength of 1550nm, in high index doped silica
glass ring resonators capable of performing in photonic telecommunications
networks as linear filters [5]. The high reliability, design flexibility, and
manufacturability of our device raises the possibility of a new platform for
future low cost nonlinear all optical PICs.

draw on this application to present two experiments: (1) a demonstration of how

improvement with deep learning, these approaches may fail to obtain correct
depth if they are exposed to environments not observed during training. Online
adaptation, where the neural network trains while deployed, with
self-supervised learning provides a convenient solution as the network can
learn from the scene where it is deployed without external supervision.
However, online adaptation causes a neural network to forget the past. Thus,
past training is wasted and the network is not able to provide good results if
it observes past scenes. This work deals with practical online-adaptation where
the input is online and temporally-correlated, and training is completely
self-supervised. Regularization and replay-based methods without task
boundaries are proposed to avoid catastrophic forgetting while adapting to

include outdoor, indoor and synthetic scenes. Qualitative and quantitative
results with both structure-from-motion and stereo show superior forgetting as
well as adaptation performance compared to recent methods. Furthermore, the

challenges of having a robust architecture in projects already executed by plan

solar wind at distances less than 0.3 au from the Sun. These deflections are
related to structures commonly called 'switchbacks' (SBs), whose origins and
characteristic properties are currently debated. Here, we use a database of
visually selected SB intervals - and regions of solar wind plasma measured just
before and after each SB - to examine plasma parameters, turbulent spectra from
inertial to dissipation scales, and intermittency effects in these intervals.
We find that many features, such as perpendicular stochastic heating rates and
turbulence spectral slopes are fairly similar inside and outside of SBs.
However, important kinetic properties, such as the characteristic break scale
between the inertial to dissipation ranges differ inside and outside these
intervals, as does the level of intermittency, which is notably enhanced inside
SBs and in their close proximity, most likely due to magnetic field and
velocity shears observed at the edges. We conclude that the plasma inside and
outside of a SB, in most of the observed cases, belongs to the same stream, and
that the evolution of these structures is most likely regulated by kinetic
processes, which dominate small scale structures at the SB edges.

finds MBs of variables connected to the target variable and simultaneously
constructs local causal structures over MBs until the direct causes and direct

original equation is first reformulated into an equivalent form which satisfies
a quadratic energy. The spatial derivatives of the system are then approximated
with the standard Fourier pseudo-spectral method. Subsequently, we apply the
extrapolation technique/prediction-correction strategy to the nonlinear terms
of the semi-discretized system and a linearized energy-conserving system is
obtained. A fully discrete scheme is gained by further using the integrating
factor Runge-Kutta method to the resulting system. We show that, under certain
circumstances for the coefficients of a Runge-Kutta method, the proposed scheme
can produce numerical solutions along which the modified energy is precisely
conserved, as is the case with the analytical solution and is extremely
efficient in the sense that only linear equations with constant coefficients
need to be solved at every time step. Numerical results are addressed to
demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed schemes in comparison
with other existing structure-preserving schemes.

Goldfeld et al., scales to high dimensions in estimation and provides an
alternative to entropy regularization. This paper provides convergence
guarantees for estimating the GOT distance under more general settings. For the
Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance in $d$ dimensions, our results
require only the existence of a moment greater than $d + 2p$. For the special
case of sub-gamma distributions, we quantify the dependence on the dimension
$d$ and establish a phase transition with respect to the scale parameter. We
also prove convergence for dependent samples, only requiring a condition on the
pairwise dependence of the samples measured by the covariance of the feature
map of a kernel space.
  A key step in our analysis is to show that the GOT distance is dominated by a
family of kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) distances with a kernel that
depends on the cost function as well as the amount of Gaussian smoothing. This
insight provides further interpretability for the GOT framework and also
introduces a class of kernel MMD distances with desirable properties. The
theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.

understanding of Bitcoin's volatility. Using daily, weekly, and monthly closing
prices and log-returns data going from September 2014 to January 2021, we find
that Bitcoin is a prime example of an asset for which the two conceptions of
volatility diverge. We show that, historically, Bitcoin allies both high
volatility (high Standard Deviation) and high predictability (low Approximate
Entropy), relative to Gold and S&P 500.
  Moreover, using tools from Extreme Value Theory, we analyze the convergence
of moments, and the mean excess functions of both the closing prices and the
log-returns of the three assets. We find that the closing price of Bitcoin is
consistent with a generalized Pareto distribution, when the closing prices of
the two other assets (Gold and S&P 500) present thin-tailed distributions.
However, returns for all three assets are heavy tailed and second moments
(variance, standard deviation) non-convergent. In the case of Bitcoin, lower
sampling frequencies (monthly vs weekly, weekly vs daily) drastically reduce
the Kurtosis of log-returns and increase the convergence of empirical moments
to their true value. The opposite effect is observed for Gold and S&P 500.
These properties suggest that Bitcoin's volatility is essentially an intra-day
and intra-week phenomenon that is strongly attenuated on a weekly time-scale,
and make it an attractive store of value to investors and speculators, but its
high standard deviation excludes its use a currency.

studies of $B$ meson decays. The contribution to the renormalization constant
of the non-local operator $\bar{q}(z)_\beta [z,0]b(0)_\alpha$ is considered up
to one-loop order in QCD. Since the quark fields in this operator are not
directly coupled fields, momentum can not flow freely through this non-local

dimensional parameter $\epsilon$ cancel with each other, and the evolution
effect vanishes. The matrix element $\langle 0| \bar{q}(z)_\beta

suppression of Sudakov factor to soft contribution depends on the end-point
behavior of $B$ meson wave function, and with the $B$-meson wave function used

contribution to the $B\to\pi$ transition form factor is about 59\%, and soft

image velocimetry in a water channel. First, the mean wake structure of this

and a simple explanation for observed wake deflection is presented. Second, the
unsteady flow is then analyzed via the triple decomposition, with the periodic
component extracted using a combination of traditional techniques and a novel

is shown to outperform conditional averaging and Fourier methods, as well as
uncover frequencies suggesting a transition to bluff-body shedding in the far

constants and by solving off-diagonal components of group velocity operator.
Experimentally observed thermal conductivities have been reasonably reproduced
by considering both lattice and electron contributions. Through the analysis
with the SCP theory, we found that hardening of guest modes leads to an
increase in lattice thermal conductivity at frequencies below those of
framework-dominant flat modes (< 40 cm$^{\rm -1}$), which finally results in
the slow decay and slight increase in the total lattice thermal conductivity
with increasing temperature. Detailed analyses revealed that the increase in
lattice thermal conductivity at low frequency is attributed to (a) the increase
in group velocities of phonon modes located at frequencies below that of the
flat guest modes and (b) abnormal increase in lifetimes of phonon modes located
between frequencies of the flat guest and framework modes with increasing
temperature. From an engineering point of view, this effect may lead to an
intriguing phenomenon, a larger decrease in thermal conductivity due to
nanostructuring at higher temperatures.

consumption due to their biologically sparse computation. Several studies have
shown that the off-chip memory (DRAM) accesses are the most energy-consuming
operations in SNN processing. However, state-of-the-art in SNN systems do not
optimize the DRAM energy-per-access, thereby hindering achieving high
energy-efficiency. To substantially minimize the DRAM energy-per-access, a key
knob is to reduce the DRAM supply voltage but this may lead to DRAM errors
(i.e., the so-called approximate DRAM). Towards this, we propose SparkXD, a
novel framework that provides a comprehensive conjoint solution for resilient
and energy-efficient SNN inference using low-power DRAMs subjected to
voltage-induced errors. The key mechanisms of SparkXD are: (1) improving the
SNN error tolerance through fault-aware training that considers bit errors from
approximate DRAM, (2) analyzing the error tolerance of the improved SNN model
to find the maximum tolerable bit error rate (BER) that meets the targeted
accuracy constraint, and (3) energy-efficient DRAM data mapping for the
resilient SNN model that maps the weights in the appropriate DRAM location to
minimize the DRAM access energy. Through these mechanisms, SparkXD mitigates
the negative impact of DRAM (approximation) errors, and provides the required
accuracy. The experimental results show that, for a target accuracy within 1%
of the baseline design (i.e., SNN without DRAM errors), SparkXD reduces the
DRAM energy by ca. 40% on average across different network sizes.

attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. AED models have achieved competitive performance in offline scenarios
by jointly optimizing all components. They have recently been extended to an
online streaming framework via models such as monotonic chunkwise attention
(MoChA). However, the elaborate attention calculation process is not robust for
long-form speech utterances. Moreover, the sequence-level training objective
and time-restricted streaming encoder cause a nonnegligible delay in token
emission during inference. To address these problems, we propose CTC
synchronous training (CTC-ST), in which CTC alignments are leveraged as a
reference for token boundaries to enable a MoChA model to learn optimal
monotonic input-output alignments. We formulate a purely end-to-end training
objective to synchronize the boundaries of MoChA to those of CTC. The CTC model
shares an encoder with the MoChA model to enhance the encoder representation.
Moreover, the proposed method provides alignment information learned in the CTC
branch to the attention-based decoder. Therefore, CTC-ST can be regarded as
self-distillation of alignment knowledge from CTC to MoChA. Experimental
evaluations on a variety of benchmark datasets show that the proposed method
significantly reduces recognition errors and emission latency simultaneously.
The robustness to long-form and noisy speech is also demonstrated. We compare
CTC-ST with several methods that distill alignment knowledge from a hybrid ASR
system and show that the CTC-ST can achieve a comparable tradeoff of accuracy
and latency without relying on external alignment information. The best MoChA
system shows recognition accuracy comparable to that of RNN-transducer (RNN-T)
while achieving lower emission latency.

exception, robust to changes of numerical electromagnetic solver code or
algorithm. For simulations of the antenna with the actual finite ground plane
and realistic soil properties, we find that two out of three numerical solvers
agree well. Applying our analysis pipeline to a simulated driftscan observation
from an early EDGES low-band instrument that had a 10 m $\times$ 10 m ground
plane, we find residual levels after fitting and removing a five-term
foreground model to data binned in Local Sidereal Time (LST) average about 250
mK with $\pm$40 mK variation between numerical solvers. A similar analysis of
the primary 30 m $\times$ 30 m sawtooth ground plane reduced the LST-averaged
residuals to about 90 mK with $\pm$10 mK between the two viable solvers. More
broadly we show that larger ground planes generally perform better than smaller
ground planes. Simulated data have a power which is within 4$\%$ of real
observations, a limitation of net accuracy of the sky and beam models. We
observe that residual spectral structures after foreground model fits match
qualitatively between simulated data and observations, suggesting that the
frequency dependence of the beam is reasonably represented by the models. We
find that soil conductivity of 0.02 Sm$^{-1}$ and relative permittivity of 3.5

Frobenius complement acts regularly on the elements of prime order in the
Frobenius kernel. The converse is also true.
  Combined with elementary number-theoretic arguments, we use this to provide
characterisations of several important classes of Frobenius groups. The
insoluble Frobenius groups with perfect order classes are fully characterised.
These turn out to be the perfect Frobenius groups whose Frobenius kernel is a

  We also determine precisely which nilpotent Frobenius complements have
perfect order classes, from which it follows that a Frobenius group with
nilpotent complement has perfect order classes only if the Frobenius complement

electron correlation in solids. Of particular interest is the 30 degree twisted
bilayer honeycomb lattice system, which possesses an incommensurate moire
pattern and uncommon electronic behaviors may appear due to the absence of
phase coherence. Such system is extremely sensitive to further twist and many
intriguing phenomena will occur. In this work, based on first-principles
calculations we show that, for further twist near 30 degree, there could induce
dramatically different dielectric behaviors of electron between left and right
twisted cases. Specifically, it is found that the left and right twists show
suppressed and amplified dielectric response under vertical electric field,
respectively. Further analysis demonstrate that such exotic dielectric property
can be attributed to the stacking dependent charge redistribution due to twist,
which forms twist-dependent pseudospin textures. We will show that such
pseudospin textures are robust under small electric field. As a result, for the
right twisted case, there is almost no electric dipole formation exceeding the
monolayer thickness when the electric field is applied. Whereas for the left
case, the system could even demonstrate negative susceptibility, i.e. the
induced polarization is opposite to the applied field, which is very rare in
the nature. Such findings not only enrich our understanding on moire systems
but also open an appealing route toward functional 2D materials design for
electronic, optical and even energy storage devices.

  Unaware Environment -- An Extended Multi-armed Bandit Approach",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Caching high-frequency reuse contents at the edge servers in the mobile edge
computing (MEC) network omits the part of backhaul transmission and further
releases the pressure of data traffic. However, how to efficiently decide the
caching contents for edge servers is still an open problem, which refers to the
cache capacity of edge servers, the popularity of each content, and the
wireless channel quality during transmission. In this paper, we discuss the
influence of unknown user density and popularity of content on the cache
placement solution at the edge server. Specifically, towards the implementation
of the cache placement solution in the practical network, there are two
problems needing to be solved. First, the estimation of unknown users'
preference needs a huge amount of records of users' previous requests. Second,
the overlapping serving regions among edge servers cause the wrong estimation
of users' preference, which hinders the individual decision of caching
placement. To address the first issue, we propose a learning-based solution to
adaptively optimize the cache placement policy. We develop the extended
multi-armed bandit (Extended MAB), which combines the generalized global bandit
(GGB) and Standard Multi-armed bandit (MAB). For the second problem, a
multi-agent Extended MAB-based solution is presented to avoid the
mis-estimation of parameters and achieve the decentralized cache placement
policy. The proposed solution determines the primary time slot and secondary
time slot for each edge server. The proposed strategies are proven to achieve
the bounded regret according to the mathematical analysis. Extensive
simulations verify the optimality of the proposed strategies when comparing
with baselines.

Our approach is based on considering the outer minimization problem as a

inexact solution of the inner problem, which is either minimization or a
maximization problem. Our main assumptions are that the problem is smooth and
the available oracle is mixed: it is only possible to evaluate the gradient
w.r.t. the outer block of variables which corresponds to the outer minimization
problem, whereas for the inner problem only zeroth-order oracle is available.
To solve the inner problem we use accelerated gradient-free method with

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into an on-demand universal framework,
this paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
hybrid network by leveraging the RIS to flexibly adjust the signal processing
order of heterogeneous data. The objective of this work is to maximize the
achievable hybrid rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power, controlling
the receive scalar, and designing the phase shifts. Since the concurrent
transmissions of all computation and communication signals are aided by the
discrete phase shifts at the RIS, the considered problem (P0) is a challenging
mixed integer programming problem. To tackle this intractable issue, we
decompose the original problem (P0) into a non-convex problem (P1) and a
combinatorial problem (P2), which are characterized by the continuous and
discrete variables, respectively. For the transceiver design problem (P1), the
power allocation subproblem is first solved by invoking the
difference-of-convex programming, and then the receive control subproblem is
addressed by using the successive convex approximation, where the closed-form
expressions of simplified cases are derived to obtain deep insights. For the
reflection design problem (P2), the relaxation-then-quantization method is
adopted to find a suboptimal solution for striking a trade-off between
complexity and performance. Afterwards, an alternating optimization algorithm
is developed to solve the non-linear and non-convex problem (P0) iteratively.
Finally, simulation results reveal that 1) the proposed RIS-aided hybrid
network can support the on-demand communication and computation efficiently, 2)
the performance gains can be improved by properly selecting the location of the
RIS, and 3) the designed algorithms are also applicable to conventional
networks with only AirFL or NOMA users.

their CTR given a limited amount of feedback. Factorization machine (FM), which
models inner product interaction between features, can be applied for the CTR
prediction of creatives. However, interactions between creative elements may be
more complex than the inner product, and the FM-estimated CTR may be of high
variance due to limited feedback. To address these two issues, we propose an
Automated Creative Optimization (AutoCO) framework to model complex interaction
between creative elements and to balance between exploration and exploitation.
Specifically, motivated by AutoML, we propose one-shot search algorithms for
searching effective interaction functions between elements. We then develop
stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of
parameters based on the reparameterization trick, and apply Thompson Sampling
for efficiently exploring potentially better creatives. We evaluate the
proposed method with both a synthetic dataset and two public datasets. The

Current methods typically result in a suboptimal policy that learns general
obstacle avoidance and search behaviours. For example, in the target-object
navigation setting, the policies learnt by traditional methods often fail to
complete the task, even when the target is clearly within reach from a human
perspective. In order to address this issue, we propose to learn to imagine a
latent representation of the successful (sub-)goal state. To do so, we have
developed a module which we call Foresight Imagination (ForeSIT). ForeSIT is
trained to imagine the recurrent latent representation of a future state that
leads to success, e.g. either a sub-goal state that is important to reach
before the target, or the goal state itself. By conditioning the policy on the
generated imagination during training, our agent learns how to use this
imagination to achieve its goal robustly. Our agent is able to imagine what the
(sub-)goal state may look like (in the latent space) and can learn to navigate
towards that state. We develop an efficient learning algorithm to train ForeSIT
in an on-policy manner and integrate it into our RL objective. The integration
is not trivial due to the constantly evolving state representation shared
between both the imagination and the policy. We, empirically, observe that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the
commonly accepted benchmark AI2THOR environment. Our method can be readily
integrated or added to other model-free RL navigation frameworks.

problems that result in similar motion plans. Instead of planning each problem
from scratch, it is preferable to leverage previously computed motion plans,
i.e., experiences, to ease the planning. Different approaches have been
proposed to exploit prior information on novel task instances. These methods,
however, rely on a vast repertoire of experiences and fail when none relates
closely to the current problem. Thus, an open challenge is the ability to
generalise prior experiences to task instances that do not necessarily resemble
the prior. This work tackles the above challenge with the proposition that
experiences are ""decomposable"" and ""malleable"", i.e., parts of an experience
are suitable to relevantly explore the connectivity of the robot-task space
even in non-experienced regions. Two new planners result from this insight:
experience-driven random trees (ERT) and its bi-directional version ERTConnect.
These planners adopt a tree sampling-based strategy that incrementally extracts
and modulates parts of a single path experience to compose a valid motion plan.
We demonstrate our method on task instances that significantly differ from the
prior experiences, and compare with related state-of-the-art experience-based
planners. While their repairing strategies fail to generalise priors of tens of
experiences, our planner, with a single experience, significantly outperforms
them in both success rate and planning time. Our planners are implemented and
freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.

total time horizon into several phases such that IHT is executed in each of
these phases using a fixed measurement matrix obtained at the beginning of that
phase. We consider a stochastic setting where the measurement matrices obtained
at each phase are independent samples of a sub Gaussian random matrix. We prove
that if a certain dynamic sample complexity that depends on the sizes of the
measurement matrices at each phase, along with their duration and the number of
phases, satisfy certain lower bound, the estimation error of SIHT over a fixed
time horizon decays rapidly. Interestingly, this bound reveals that the
probability of decay of estimation error is hardly affected even if very small
number measurements are sporadically used in different phases. This theoretical
observation is also corroborated using numerical experiments demonstrating that
SIHT enjoys improved probability of recovery compared to offline IHT.

burgeoning frontier. Here, by studying the collective excitations of a Fermi
superfluid under an imaginary spin-orbit coupling, we uncover an emergent
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in the Anderson-Bogoliubov (AB) modes, whose
quasiparticle spectra undergo a transition from being completely real to
completely imaginary, even though the superfluid ground state retains an
unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. The critical point of the transition is
marked by a non-analytic kink in the speed of sound, as the latter completely
vanishes at the critical point where the system is immune to low-frequency
perturbations.These critical phenomena derive from the presence of a spectral
point gap in the complex quasiparticle dispersion, and are therefore

generation, imitation learning has been viewed as a vital direction in the
context of robot skill learning. In contrast to unconstrained imitation
learning which ignores possible internal and external constraints arising from
environments and robot kinematics/dynamics, recent works on constrained
imitation learning allow for transferring human skills to unstructured
scenarios, further enlarging the application domain of imitation learning.
While various constraints have been studied, e.g., joint limits, obstacle
avoidance and plane constraints, the problem of nonlinear hard constraints has
not been well-addressed. In this paper, we propose extended kernelized movement
primitives (EKMP) to cope with most of the key problems in imitation learning,
including nonlinear hard constraints. Specifically, EKMP is capable of learning
the probabilistic features of multiple demonstrations, adapting the learned
skills towards arbitrary desired points in terms of joint position and
velocity, avoiding obstacles at the level of robot links, as well as satisfying
arbitrary linear and nonlinear, equality and inequality hard constraints.
Besides, the connections between EKMP and state-of-the-art motion planning
approaches are discussed. Several evaluations including the planning of joint
trajectories for a 7-DoF robotic arm are provided to verify the effectiveness
of our framework.

pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the

As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good
performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to
such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:
pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their
undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to
this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a
decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired
behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic
text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely
on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or
changes to the model's parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of
language models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an
important step in this direction.

maintenance and the choice regarding optimal locations to perform maintenance

and Location Choice Problem (MSLCP). It simultaneously determines maintenance
locations and maintenance schedules of rolling stock, while it also considers
the available capacity of maintenance locations, measured in the number of
available teams. To solve the MSLCP, an optimization framework based on
Logic-Based Benders' Decomposition (LBBD) is proposed by combining two models,
the Maintenance Location Choice Problem (MLCP) and the Activity Planning
Problem (APP), to assess the capacity of a MLCP solution. Within the LBBD, four
cut generation procedures are introduced to improve the computational
performance: a naive procedure, two heuristic procedures and the so-called
min-cut procedure that aims to exploit the specific characteristics of the
problem at hand. The framework is demonstrated on a realistic scenarios from
the Dutch railways. It is shown that the best choice for cut generation
procedure depends on the objective: when aiming to find a good but not
necessarily optimal solution, the min-cut procedure performs best, whereas when
aiming for the optimal solution, one of the heuristic procedures is the
preferred option. The techniques used in the current research are new to the
current field and offer interesting next research opportunities.

are not well reported yet, despite the recent progresses of automated test case
generation tools. Proprietary tools for automatically generating test cases are
becoming common practice in large software organisations, and commercial tools
are becoming available for some application domains and testing levels.
However, generating system test cases in small and medium-size software
companies is still largely a manual, inefficient and ad-hoc activity. This
paper reports our experience in introducing techniques for automatically
generating system test suites in a medium-size company. We describe the
technical and organisational obstacles that we faced when introducing automatic
test case generation in the development process of the company, and present the
solutions that we successfully experienced in that context. In particular, the
paper discusses the problems of automating the generation of test cases by
referring to a customised ERP application that the medium-size company
developed for a third party multinational company, and presents ABT2.0, the
test case generator that we developed by tailoring ABT, a research
state-of-the-art GUI test generator, to their industrial environment. This
paper presents the new features of ABT2.0, and discusses how these new features
address the issues that we faced.

optomechanical or electro-optical interactions, have been proposed and
realized, yet the required vanishing added noises and an efficiency approaching
unity, have not yet been attained. Here we present a new transduction scheme
that could in theory satisfy the requirements for quantum coherent
bidirectional transduction. Our scheme relies on an intermediary mechanical
mode, a high overtone bulk acoustic resonance (HBAR), to coherently couple
microwave and optical photons through the piezoelectric and strain-optical
effects. Its efficiency results from the combination of integrated Si3N4
photonic circuits with ultra low loss sustaining high intracavity photon
numbers with the highly efficient microwave to mechanical transduction offered
by piezoelectrically coupled HBAR. We develop a quantum theory for this
multipartite system by first introducing a quantization method for the
piezoelectric interaction between the microwave mode and the mechanical mode
from first principles (which to our knowledge has not been presented in this

HBAR is subsequently coupled to a pair of hybridized optical modes from coupled
optical ring cavities via the strain-optical effect. We analyze the conversion
capabilities of the proposed device using signal flow graphs, and demonstrate
that near quantum coherent transduction is possible, with realistic

eigenmode-based approach to identify hierarchical modules in functional brain

whole-brain resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
with a mean-filed model on the structural network derived from diffusion tensor
imaging and demonstrate that resting brain networks are on average close to a
balanced state. This state allows for a balanced time dwelling at segregated

Furthermore, we employ structural equation modelling to estimate general and
domain-specific cognitive phenotypes from nine tasks, and demonstrate that
network segregation, integration and their balance in resting brains predict
individual differences in diverse cognitive phenotypes. More specifically,
stronger integration is associated with better general cognitive ability,
stronger segregation fosters crystallized intelligence and processing speed,
and individual's tendency towards balance supports better memory. Our findings
provide a comprehensive and deep understanding of the brain's functioning

may emerge from the enhancement required for a more efficient analysis of
retinal images. Here we reassess the relevance of low-level vision tasks in the
explanation of the Contrast Sensitivity Functions (CSFs) in light of (1) the
current trend of using artificial neural networks for studying vision, and (2)
the current knowledge of retinal image representations.
  As a first contribution, we show that a very popular type of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), called autoencoders, may develop human-like CSFs in the
spatio-temporal and chromatic dimensions when trained to perform some basic
low-level vision tasks (like retinal noise and optical blur removal), but not
others (like chromatic adaptation or pure reconstruction after simple
bottlenecks). As an illustrative example, the best CNN (in the considered set
of simple architectures for enhancement of the retinal signal) reproduces the
CSFs with an RMSE error of 11\% of the maximum sensitivity.
  As a second contribution, we provide experimental evidence of the fact that,
for some functional goals (at low abstraction level), deeper CNNs that are
better in reaching the quantitative goal are actually worse in replicating
human-like phenomena (such as the CSFs). This low-level result (for the
explored networks) is not necessarily in contradiction with other works that
report advantages of deeper nets in modeling higher-level vision goals.
However, in line with a growing body of literature, our results suggests
another word of caution about CNNs in vision science since the use of
simplified units or unrealistic architectures in goal optimization may be a
limitation for the modeling and understanding of human vision.

hidden information. The advantage of these channels is that they cannot be
blocked easily as they do not modify header content but instead mimic typical
network behavior such as TCP segments that arrive in a different order than
they were sent.
  Contribution: In this paper, we show a protocol-independent approach to
detect message ordering channels. Our approach is based on a modified
compressibility score. We analyze the detectability of message ordering
channels and whether several types of message ordering channels differ in their
detectability.
  Results: Our results show that the detection of message ordering channels
depends on their number of utilized PDUs. First, we performed a rough threshold
selection by hand, which we later optimized using the C4.5 decision tree
classifier. We were able to detect message ordering covert channels with an
accuracy and F1 score of >= 99.5% and a false-positive rate < 1% and < 0.1% if
they use sequences of 3 or 4 PDUs, respectively. Simpler channels that only
manipulate a sequence of two PDUs were detectable with an accuracy and F1 score
of 94.5% and were linked to a false-positive rate of 5.19%. We thus consider
our approach suitable for real-world detection scenarios with channels
utilizing 3 or 4 PDUs while the detection of channels utilizing 2 PDUs should
be improved further.

  Theory for Deep Neural Networks","36 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the asymptotic risk of a general class of overparameterized
likelihood models, including deep models. The recent empirical success of
large-scale models has motivated several theoretical studies to investigate a
scenario wherein both the number of samples, $n$, and parameters, $p$, diverge
to infinity and derive an asymptotic risk at the limit. However, these theorems
are only valid for linear-in-feature models, such as generalized linear
regression, kernel regression, and shallow neural networks. Hence, it is
difficult to investigate a wider class of nonlinear models, including deep
neural networks with three or more layers. In this study, we consider a
likelihood maximization problem without the model constraints and analyze the
upper bound of an asymptotic risk of an estimator with penalization.
Technically, we combine a property of the Fisher information matrix with an
extended Marchenko-Pastur law and associate the combination with empirical
process techniques. The derived bound is general, as it describes both the
double descent and the regularized risk curves, depending on the penalization.
Our results are valid without the linear-in-feature constraints on models and
allow us to derive the general spectral distributions of a Fisher information
matrix from the likelihood. We demonstrate that several explicit models, such
as parallel deep neural networks, ensemble learning, and residual networks, are
in agreement with our theory. This result indicates that even large and deep
models have a small asymptotic risk if they exhibit a specific structure, such
as divisibility. To verify this finding, we conduct a real-data experiment with
parallel deep neural networks. Our results expand the applicability of the
asymptotic risk analysis, and may also contribute to the understanding and
application of deep learning.

ReLU networks with width $\mathcal{O}\big(\max\{d\lfloor N^{1/d}\rfloor,\,

function on $[0,1]^d$ with an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}\big(\lambda\sqrt{d} (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-\alpha/d}\big)$, where
$\alpha\in (0,1]$ and $\lambda>0$ are H\""older order and constant,
respectively. Such a rate is optimal up to a constant in terms of width and
depth separately, while existing results are only nearly optimal without the
logarithmic factor in the approximation rate. More generally, for an arbitrary
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$, the approximation rate becomes
$\mathcal{O}\big(\,\sqrt{d}\,\omega_f\big( (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-1/d}\big)\,\big)$,
where $\omega_f(\cdot)$ is the modulus of continuity. We also extend our
analysis to any continuous function $f$ on a bounded set. Particularly, if ReLU
networks with depth $31$ and width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ are used to approximate
one-dimensional Lipschitz continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with a Lipschitz
constant $\lambda>0$, the approximation rate in terms of the total number of

obtain a thermodynamic trade-off relation between transition time and the
entropy production. This thermodynamic trade-off relation is regarded as a
thermodynamic speed limit which gives a tighter bound of the entropy
production. We also discuss stochastic thermodynamics for the subsystem and
derive a lower bound on the partial entropy production as a generalization of
the second law of information thermodynamics. Our formalism also provides a

dispersive mean flows subject to nonconvex flux is studied in the framework of
the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, a canonical model for nonlinear
internal gravity wave propagation in stratified fluids. The principal feature
of the studied interaction is that both the solitary wave and the large-scale
mean flow -- a rarefaction wave or a dispersive shock wave (undular bore) --
are described by the same dispersive hydrodynamic equation. A recent
theoretical and experimental study of this new type of dynamic soliton-mean
flow interaction has revealed two main scenarios when the solitary wave either
tunnels through the varying mean flow that connects two constant asymptotic
states, or remains trapped inside it. While the previous work considered convex
systems, in this paper it is demonstrated that the presence of a nonconvex
hydrodynamic flux introduces significant modifications to the scenarios for
transmission and trapping. A reduced set of Whitham modulation equations,
termed the solitonic modulation system, is used to formulate a general,
approximate mathematical framework for solitary wave-mean flow interaction with
nonconvex flux. Solitary wave trapping is conveniently stated in terms of
crossing characteristics for the solitonic system. Numerical simulations of the
mKdV equation agree with the predictions of modulation theory. The developed
theory draws upon general properties of dispersive hydrodynamic partial
differential equations, not on the complete integrability of the mKdV equation.
As such, the mathematical framework developed here enables application to other
fluid dynamic contexts subject to nonconvex flux.

the coupled ocean-atmosphere extratropical module is then investigated through
the analysis of its pullback attractors (PBAs). This analysis focuses on two
types of ENSO forcing generated by the tropical module, one periodic and the
other aperiodic.
  For a substantial range of the ENSO forcing, two chaotic PBAs are found to
coexist for the same set of parameter values. Different types of extratropical
low-frequency variability are associated with either PBA over the parameter
ranges explored. For periodic ENSO forcing, the coexisting PBAs exhibit only
weak nonlinear instability. For chaotic forcing, though, they are quite
unstable and certain extratropical perturbations induce transitions between the
two PBAs. These distinct stability properties may have profound consequences
for extratropical climate predictions: in particular, ensemble averaging may no
longer help isolate the low-frequency variability signal.

learn under uncertainty from only a few examples and generalize these concepts
to solve new problems. The growing interest in explainable machine

this paper, we discuss existing diagnostic tests and test data sets such as

Wassily Kandinksy, who made theoretical contributions to compositivity, i.e.
that all perceptions consist of geometrically elementary individual components.
This was experimentally proven by Hubel &Wiesel in the 1960s and became the
basis for machine learning approaches such as the Neocognitron and the even
later Deep Learning. While KANDINSKYPatterns have computationally controllable
properties on the one hand, bringing ground truth, they are also easily
distinguishable by human observers, i.e., controlled patterns can be described
by both humans and algorithms, making them another important contribution to

to classic image recognition even under a high noisy rate. In medical
applications, learning from datasets with label noise is more challenging since
medical imaging datasets tend to have asymmetric (class-dependent) noise and

expert opinions and single-target label noise from wrong diagnosis record. We
then propose an uncertainty estimation-based framework to handle these two
label noise amid the medical image classification task. We design a

Pearson's pairwise correlation coefficients and Pearson's three-way partial

reduces statistical sample size requirements to compute the correlations, which
translates into the possibility of using shorter time windows and hence into
shorter response time of the real-time climate network analysis. We compare

by the simulation algorithms for max-stable processes, theory and algorithms to

observe that only in 6 cases out of more than 200, gradient compression methods
provide speedup over optimized synchronous data-parallel training in the

feature sizes. This is attributed to local resonances of embedded or branching
substructures. In branched configurations, such as a pillared plate, waves
propagating in the base medium-e.g., the plate portion-experience attenuation
at band-gap frequencies. Considering a simplified lumped-parameter model for a
branched medium, we present a theoretical treatment for a periodic unit cell
comprising a base mass-spring chain with a multi-degree-of-freedom,
mono-coupled branch. Bloch's theorem is applied, combined with a
sub-structuring approach where the resonating branch is modelled separately and
condensed into its effective dynamic stiffness. Thus, the treatment is
generally applicable to an arbitrary branch regardless of its size and
properties. We provide an analysis-with guiding graphical illustrations-that
yields an identification of fundamental bounds for the band-gap edges as
dictated by the dynamical characteristics of the branch. Analytical sensitivity
functions are also derived for the dependence of these bounds on the degree of
coupling between the base and the branch. The sensitivity analysis reveals
further novel findings including the role of the frequency derivative of the
branch dynamic stiffness in providing a direct relation between the band-gap
edge locations and variation in the coupling parameters-the mass and stiffness
ratios between the base chain and the branch root. In additional analysis,
sub-Bragg bounds of an exact model comprising a one-dimensional (1D) continuous
base-modelled as a rod-and a discrete branch are derived and shown to be
tighter than those of the all-discrete model. Finally, the applicability of the
derived bounds and sensitivity functions are shown to be valid for a
corresponding full 2D finite-element model of a pillared waveguide admitting
out-of-plane shear waves.

The paper then explains how a spin-one-half field transforms under rotations.
The momentum-zero spinors are found from the way spin-one-half systems
transform under rotations and from the Dirac equation. Once the momentum-zero
spinors are known, the Dirac equation immediately yields the spinors at finite
momentum. The paper then shows that with these spinors, a Dirac field
transforms appropriately under charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.
  The paper also describes how a Dirac field may be decomposed either into two
4-component Majorana fields or into a 2-component left-handed field and a
2-component right-handed field. Wigner rotations and Weinberg's derivation of
the properties of spinors are also discussed.
