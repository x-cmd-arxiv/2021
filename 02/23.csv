  External Knowledge Bases",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Deep learning models suffer from opaqueness. For Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), current research strategies for explaining models focus on the
target classes within the associated training dataset. As a result, the
understanding of hidden feature map activations is limited by the
discriminative knowledge gleaned during training. The aim of our work is to
explain and expand CNNs models via the mirroring or alignment of CNN to an
external knowledge base. This will allow us to give a semantic context or label
for each visual feature. We can match CNN feature activations to nodes in our
external knowledge base. This supports knowledge-based interpretation of the
features associated with model decisions. To demonstrate our approach, we build
two separate graphs. We use an entity alignment method to align the feature
nodes in a CNN with the nodes in a ConceptNet based knowledge graph. We then
measure the proximity of CNN graph nodes to semantically meaningful knowledge
base nodes. Our results show that in the aligned embedding space, nodes from
the knowledge graph are close to the CNN feature nodes that have similar
meanings, indicating that nodes from an external knowledge base can act as
explanatory semantic references for features in the model. We analyse a variety
of graph building methods in order to improve the results from our embedding
space. We further demonstrate that by using hierarchical relationships from our
external knowledge base, we can locate new unseen classes outside the CNN
training set in our embeddings space, based on visual feature activations. This
suggests that we can adapt our approach to identify unseen classes based on CNN
feature activations. Our demonstrated approach of aligning a CNN with an
external knowledge base paves the way to reason about and beyond the trained
model, with future adaptations to explainable models and zero-shot learning.

intense velocity gradients, which are at the heart of fluid turbulence. This
vorticity amplification comes about through two different instability
mechanisms of the initial vortex tubes, assumed anti-parallel and with a mirror
plane of symmetry. At moderate Reynolds number, the tubes destabilize via a
Crow instability, with the nonlinear development leading to strong flattening
of the cores into thin sheets. These sheets then break down into filaments
which can repeat the process. At higher Reynolds number, the instability
proceeds via the elliptical instability, producing vortex tubes that are
perpendicular to the original tube directions. In this work, we demonstrate
that these same transition between Crow and Elliptical instability occurs at
moderate Reynolds number when we vary the initial angle $\beta$ between two
straight vortex tubes. We demonstrate that when the angle between the two tubes
is close to $\pi/2$, the interaction between tubes leads to the formation of
thin vortex sheets. The subsequent breakdown of these sheets involves a
twisting of the paired sheets, followed by the appearance of a localized cloud
of small scale vortex structures. At smaller values of the angle $\beta$
between the two tubes, the breakdown mechanism changes to an elliptic
cascade-like mechanism. Whereas the interaction of two vortices depends on the
initial condition, the rapid formation of fine-scales vortex structures appears
to be a robust feature, possibly universal at very high Reynolds numbers.

the meaning of entanglement entropy in the single-copy regime has so far

observed environments further complicate the programming task because the

We propose a new approach, model predictive program synthesis (MPPS), that uses
program synthesis to automatically generate the guiding programs. It trains a
generative model to predict the unobserved portions of the world, and then
synthesizes a program based on samples from this model in a way that is robust
to its uncertainty. In our experiments, we show that our approach significantly
outperforms non-program-guided approaches on a set of challenging benchmarks,
including a 2D Minecraft-inspired environment where the agent must complete a
complex sequence of subtasks to achieve its goal, and achieves a similar
performance as using handcrafted programs to guide the agent. Our results

steady states that it cannot reach in a Markovian environment. As these steady

of detecting non-Markovianity, as no information about the system's transient
dynamics is necessary. In particular, we study a driven two-level system (TLS)
in a semi-infinite waveguide. Once the waveguide has been traced out, the TLS
sees an environment with a distinct memory time. The memory time enters the
equations as a time delay that can be varied to compare a Markovian to a

behaviors such as population inversion and steady-state coherence beyond
$1/\sqrt{8}$, neither of which is possible for a driven TLS in the Markovian

species are allowed to interconvert, either naturally (e.g. the equilibrium
interconversion of enantiomers) or forcefully (e.g. via an external source of

In this case, depending on the nature of interconversion, two phenomena could

of another stable phase, or microphase separation, the formation of nongrowing
(steady-state) microphase domains. In this work, we generalize the

health-related sibling spillover effects, or the effect of one individual's
exposure on their sibling's outcome. The health and health care of family
members may be inextricably confounded by unobserved factors, rendering
identification of spillover effects within families particularly challenging.
We demonstrate a gain-score regression method for identifying
exposure-to-outcome spillover effects within sibling pairs in a linear fixed
effects framework. The method can identify the exposure-to-outcome spillover
effect if only one sibling's exposure affects the other's outcome; and it
identifies the difference between the spillover effects if both siblings'
exposures affect the others' outcomes. The method fails in the presence of
outcome-to-exposure spillover and outcome-to-outcome spillover. Analytic
results and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the method and its limitations.
To exercise this method, we estimate the spillover effect of a child's preterm
birth on an older sibling's literacy skills, measured by the Phonological
Awarenesses Literacy Screening-Kindergarten test. We analyze 20,010 sibling
pairs from a population-wide, Wisconsin-based (United States) birth cohort.
Without covariate adjustment, we estimate that preterm birth modestly decreases
an older sibling's test score (-2.11 points; 95% confidence interval: -3.82,
-0.40 points). In conclusion, gain-scores are a promising strategy for
identifying exposure-to-outcome spillovers in sibling pairs while controlling

$\chi$ charged under the $U(1)_{X}$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson
$V$ of $U(1)_{X}$ gauge group can be produced in NS via DM annihilation. The
produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model (SM) particles before it
exits the NS, despite its tiny couplings to SM particles. Thus, we perform a
systematic study on $\chi\bar{\chi}\to2V\to4{\rm SM}$ as a new heating
mechanism for NS in addition to $\chi\bar{\chi}\to2{\rm SM}$ and kinetic
heating from DM-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to $\chi V$ scattering
is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass
mixing terms between $V$ and SM gauge bosons are present. This allows both
vector and axial-vector couplings between $V$ and SM fermions even for $m_V\ll
m_Z$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible
when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches
to DM-induced NS heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses.
Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the NS surface temperature by
the future telescopes are discussed as well.

telescopes which broadly survey the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen (HI)

into the HI intensity mapping (IM) bispectrum using simulations. We present a
model of the redshift space HI IM bispectrum including observational effects
from the radio telescope beam and 21cm foreground contamination. We validate
our modelling prescriptions with measurements from robust IM simulations,
inclusive of these observational effects. Our foreground simulations include
polarisation leakage, on which we use a Principal Component Analysis cleaning
method. We also investigate the effects from a non-Gaussian beam including
side-lobes. For a MeerKAT-like single-dish IM survey at $z=0.39$, we find that
foreground removal causes a 8% reduction in the equilateral bispectrum's
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$, whereas the beam reduces it by 62%. We find our
models perform well, generally providing $\chi^2_\text{dof}\sim 1$, indicating
a good fit to the data. Whilst our focus is on post-reionisation, single-dish
IM, our modelling of observational effects, especially foreground removal, can
also be relevant to interferometers and reionisation studies.

the QCD chiral phase transition in the heavy-ion collisions. Since the QCD
effective theory and the Ising model belong to the same universality class, we
start our discussion by mimicking the QCD effective potential with an
Ising-like effective potential. In contrast to the dynamical slowing down
effects which delays the phase transition from quark-gluon-plasma to hadron
gas, the spatially nonuniform-temperature effects show a possibility to lift
the phase transition temperature. Besides, both the fluctuations and the
correlation length are enhanced in the phase transition region. Furthermore,
the critical phenomena is strongly suppressed like as the critical slowing down
effects. The underlying mechanism is the nonzero-momentum mode fluctuations of
the order parameter induced by the nonuniform temperature. Our study provides a
method to evaluate the nonuniform-temperature effects, and illustrate its
potential influence on analyzing the QCD phase transition signals at RHIC.

Distributions of velocity offsets between galaxies and their host cluster's

$\hat{\Delta}$, the average of the radial velocity difference between the
cluster members and the cluster systemic velocity, reveals information on the
size of a combination of effects on the observed redshift, dominated by
gravitational redshifting. The change of $\hat{\Delta}$ with radial distance is
predicted for SPIDERS galaxies in General Relativity (GR), and $f(R)$ gravity,
and compared to the observations. The values of $\hat{\Delta}=-13.5\pm4.7$ km

preference of one gravity theory over another, but all cases give a clear

fueled a growing interest in spatial modeling and analysis of point processes.
The proposed research is motivated by the intensity estimation problem for
large spatial point patterns on complex domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (e.g.,
domains with irregular boundaries, sharp concavities, and/or interior holes due
to geographic constraints) and linear networks, where many existing spatial
point process models suffer from the problems of ""leakage"" and computation. We
propose an efficient intensity estimation algorithm to estimate the spatially
varying intensity function and to study the varying relationship between
intensity and explanatory variables on complex domains. The method is built
upon a graph regularization technique and hence can be flexibly applied to
point patterns on complex domains such as regions with irregular boundaries and
holes, or linear networks. An efficient proximal gradient optimization
algorithm is proposed to handle large spatial point patterns. We also derive
the asymptotic error bound for the proposed estimator. Numerical studies are
conducted to illustrate the performance of the method. Finally, we apply the
method to study and visualize the intensity patterns of the accidents on the
Western Australia road network, and the spatial variations in the effects of
income, lights condition, and population density on the Toronto homicides

demonstrated that a fraction of ULXs are powered by super-Eddington accretion

hole (BH) ratio within the ULX population and what physical mechanism allows
ULXs to reach luminosities well in excess of their Eddington luminosity: strong
magnetic fields or rather strong outflows that collimate the emission towards
the observer. To distinguish between supercritically accreting BHs, weakly or
strongly magnetised NSs, we study the long-term X-ray spectral evolution of a
sample of 17 ULXs, 6 of which are known to host NSs. We combine archival data
from \chandra, \xmm\ and \nustar\ observatories to sample a wide range of
spectral states for each source and track each source's evolution in a
hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD). We find NS-ULXs to be among the hardest
sources in our sample with highly variable high-energy emission. On this basis,
we identify M81 X-6 as a strong NS-ULX candidate, whose variability is shown to
be akin to that seen in NGC 1313 X-2. Most softer sources with unknown accretor
show the presence of three markedly different spectral states that we interpret
invoking changes in the mass-accretion rate and obscuration by the
supercritical wind/funnel structure. Finally, we report on a lack of
variability at high-energies ($\gtrsim$ 10 keV) in NGC 1313 X-1 and Holmberg IX
X-1, which we argue may offer means to differentiate BH from NS-ULXs. We argue
that the hardest sources in our sample might harbour strongly magnetised NSs,
while softer sources may be explained by weakly magnetised NSs or BHs, in which
the presence of outflows naturally explains their softer spectra through
Compton down-scattering, their spectral transitions and the dilution of the
pulsed-emission, should some of these sources contain NSs.

has a profound impact in a variety of applications ranging from finance,
healthcare to social network analysis. Due to the unbearable labeling cost,
existing methods are predominately developed in an unsupervised manner.
Nonetheless, the anomalies they identify may turn out to be data noises or
uninteresting data instances due to the lack of prior knowledge on the
anomalies of interest. Hence, it is critical to investigate and develop
few-shot learning for network anomaly detection. In real-world scenarios, few
labeled anomalies are also easy to be accessed on similar networks from the
same domain as of the target network, while most of the existing works omit to
leverage them and merely focus on a single network. Taking advantage of this
potential, in this work, we tackle the problem of few-shot network anomaly
detection by (1) proposing a new family of graph neural networks -- Graph
Deviation Networks (GDN) that can leverage a small number of labeled anomalies
for enforcing statistically significant deviations between abnormal and normal
nodes on a network; and (2) equipping the proposed GDN with a new cross-network
meta-learning algorithm to realize few-shot network anomaly detection by
transferring meta-knowledge from multiple auxiliary networks. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on few-shot or
even one-shot network anomaly detection.

during pandemics such as COVID-19. Superspreaders represent a group of people
who have much more social contacts than others. The widespread deployment of
WLAN infrastructure enables non-invasive contact tracing via people's
ubiquitous mobile devices. This technology offers promise for detecting
superspreaders. In this paper, we propose a general framework for
WLAN-log-based superspreader detection. In our framework, we first use WLAN
logs to construct contact graphs by jointly considering human symmetric and
asymmetric interactions. Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurements
over the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates.
Finally, we leverage SEIR simulation to determine groups of superspreaders
among these candidates, who are the most critical individuals for the spread of
disease based on the simulation results. We have implemented our framework and
evaluate it over a WLAN dataset with 41 million log entries from a large-scale
university. Our evaluation shows superspreaders exist on university campuses.
They change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughout
the rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric and
asymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performs
better with daily contact graphs. Further, the evaluation shows no consistent
differences among three vertex centrality measures for long-term (i.e., weekly)
contact graphs, which necessitates the inclusion of SEIR simulation in our
framework. We believe our proposed framework and these results may provide
timely guidance for public health administrators regarding effective testing,
intervention, and vaccination policies.

for studying medium-mass nuclei. So far, the IMSRG was limited to the
approximation in which only up to two-body operators are incorporated in the
renormalization group flow, referred to as the IMSRG(2). In this work, we
extend the IMSRG(2) approach to fully include three-body operators yielding the
IMSRG(3) approximation. We use a perturbative scaling analysis to estimate the
importance of individual terms in this approximation and introduce truncations
that aim to approximate the IMSRG(3) at a lower computational cost. The
IMSRG(3) is systematically benchmarked for different nuclear Hamiltonians for
${}^{4}\text{He}$ and ${}^{16}\text{O}$ in small model spaces. The IMSRG(3)
systematically improves over the IMSRG(2) relative to exact results.
Approximate IMSRG(3) truncations constructed based on computational cost are
able to reproduce much of the systematic improvement offered by the full
IMSRG(3). We also find that the approximate IMSRG(3) truncations behave
consistently with expectations from our perturbative analysis, indicating that
this strategy may also be used to systematically approximate the IMSRG(3).

dislocation dynamics is presented. The continuity of the individual dislocation
loops in a periodic representative crystal volume (RVE) is enforced across the
boundary of the RVE with the help of a dual topological description for
representing dislocation line kinematics in two equivalent spaces representing
the deforming crystal, the RVE and the unbounded crystal spaces. The former
describes the motion of the dislocations in the simulated crystal RVE whereas
the latter represents the motion of dislocations in an infinite space
containing all replicas of the RVE. A mapping between the two spaces forms the
basis of the implementation of flux boundary condition. The implementation
details are discussed in the context of statistical homogeneity of bulk
crystals undergoing macroscopically homogeneous plastic deformation. Some test
cases are presented and discussed to establish the proposed approach. It has
been observed that the boundary nodes associated with dislocation segments bear
no relevance in the motion of the dislocation segments from the standpoint of
bulk crystal plasticity modeling throughout the deformation history of the
crystal.

introduced deep RL architecture is trained offline whereby the controller
predicts a sequence of future states of the wireless access network by
simulating hypothetical bandwidth splits over time starting from the current

assigned. This is realized by predicting the quantities most directly relevant
to planning, i.e., the reward, the action probabilities, and the value for each

nilpotence and solvability graphs, and make some remarks on more general
graphs. Aspects to be discussed include induced subgraphs, forbidden subgraphs,
connectedness, and automorphism groups. We can also ask about the graphs formed
by the edges in one graph but not in an earlier graph in the hierarchy. I have
included some results on intersection graphs of subgroups of various types,
which are often in a dual relation to one of the other graphs considered.
Another actor is the Gruenberg--Kegel graph, or prime graph, of a group: this
very small graph influences various graphs defined on the group. I say little
about Cayley graphs, since (except in special cases) these are not invariant
under the automorphism group of $G$.
  The graphs all have the property that they contain \emph{twins}, pairs of
vertices with the same neighbours (save possibly one another). Being equal or
twins is an equivalence relation, and the automorphism group of the graph has a
normal subgroup inducing the symmetric group on each twin class. For some
purposes, we can merge twin vertices and get a smaller graph. Continuing until
no further twins occur, the result is independent of the reduction, and is the
$1$-vertex graph if and only if the original graph is a \emph{cograph}. So I
devote a section to cographs and twin reduction, and another to consequences
for automorphism groups.
  There are briefer discussions of related matters.

respond to environmental changes and grow without compromising their integrity.
Consequently, they exhibit complex viscoelastic rheological behavior where
constituent cells actively tune their mechanical properties to change the
overall response of the tissue, e.g., from solid-like to fluid-like. Mesoscopic
mechanical properties of epithelia are commonly modeled with the vertex model.
While previous studies have predominantly focused on the rheological properties
of the vertex model at long time scales, we systematically studied the full
dynamic range by applying small oscillatory shear and bulk deformations in both
solid-like and fluid-like phases for regular hexagonal and disordered cell
configurations. We found that the shear and bulk responses in the fluid and
solid phases can be described by standard spring-dashpot viscoelastic models.
Furthermore, the solid-fluid transition can be tuned by applying
pre-deformation to the system. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms
by which epithelia can regulate their rich rheological behavior.

were grouped by physical proximity, supported by the intuitive notion that
competing and same-team players use relative position as a key tactical tool to
contribute to the team's objectives. The model was applied to a set of matches
from a major European national football league, with players' coordinates
sampled at 10Hz, resulting in approx. 60,000 network samples per match. We took
an information theoretic approach to measuring distance between samples and
used it as a proxy for the game dynamics. Significant correlations were found
between measurements and key match events that are empirically known to result
in players jostling for position, such as when striving to get unmarked or to
mark. These events increase the information distance, while breaks in game play
have the opposite effect. By analyzing the frequency spectrum of players'
cluster transitions and their corresponding information distance, it is
possible to build a comprehensive view of player's interactions, useful for
training and strategy development. This analysis can be drilled down to the
level of individual players by quantifying their contribution to cluster
breakup and emergence, building an overall multi-level map that provides
insights into the game dynamics, from the individual player, to the clusters of

the past. In other words such functions must be``processes''. This gives to the
logic a strategic flavor that we usually associate to planning. Indeed we show
that temporally extended planning in nondeterministic domains, as well as LTL
synthesis, are expressed in Behavioral QLTL through formulas with a simple
quantification alternation. While, as this alternation increases, we get to
forms of planning/synthesis in which conditional and conformant planning
aspects get mixed. We study this logic from the computational point of view and

better initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the
objective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation
space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional
turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves
forecast quality for chaotic systems.

these systems in bulk and at interfaces. The adsorption at the boundary of two
phases can provide information about the molecular arrangement. In this way, we
perform Langevin Dynamics simulations of polymer-grafted nanoparticles. We
employed a recently obtained core-softened potential to analyze the relation
between adsorption, structure and dynamic properties of the nanoparticles near
a solid repulsive surface. Two cases were considered: flat or structured walls.
At low temperatures, a maxima is observed in the adsorption. It is related to a
fluid to clusters transition and with a minima in the contact layer diffusion -
and is explained by the competition between the scales in the core-softened
interaction. Due the long range repulsion, the particles stay at the distance
correspondent to this length scale at low densities, and overcome the repulsive
barrier as the packing increases, However, increasing the temperature, the gain
in kinetic energy allows the colloids to overcome the long range repulsion
barrier even at low densities. As consequence, there is no competition and no
maxima was observed in the adsorption.

absorbed energy spectra, in order to apply the trained models to real PA
measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable,

subject at least from late 1954 to the late 1960s, giving several pivotal
contributions to it. Even though he published only three papers, much more
material is available, beginning with the records of his many interventions at
the Chapel Hill conference in 1957, which are here analyzed in detail, and show
that he had already considerably developed his ideas on gravity. In addition he
expressed deep thoughts about fundamental issues in quantum mechanics which
were suggested by the problem of quantum gravity, such as superpositions of the
wave functions of macroscopic objects and the role of the observer. Feynman
also lectured on gravity several times. Besides the famous lectures given at
Caltech in 1962-63, he extensively discussed this subject in a series of
lectures delivered at the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67, whose focus was
on astronomy and astrophysics. All this material allows to reconstruct a
detailed picture of Feynman's ideas on gravity and of their evolution until the
late sixties. According to him, gravity, like electromagnetism, has quantum
foundations, therefore general relativity has to be regarded as the classical
limit of an underlying quantum theory; this quantum theory should be
investigated by computing physical processes, as if they were experimentally
accessible. The same attitude is shown with respect to gravitational waves, as
is evident also from an unpublished letter addressed to Victor F. Weisskopf. In
addition, an original approach to gravity, which closely mimics (and probably
was inspired by) the derivation of the Maxwell equations given by Feynman in
that period, is sketched in the unpublished Hughes lectures.

wireless networks to provide seamless connectivity and extend the coverage, and
can largely benefit from operating in the THz band to achieve high data rates
(such as considered for 6G). However, THz communications are highly susceptible
to channel impairments and blockage effects that become extra challenging when
accounting for drone mobility. RISs offer flexibility to extend coverage by
adapting to channel dynamics. To integrate RISs into THz drone communications,
we propose a novel deep learning solution based on a recurrent neural network,
namely the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), that proactively predicts the serving
base station/RIS and the serving beam for each drone based on the prior
observations of drone location/beam trajectories. This solution has the
potential to extend the coverage of drones and enhance the reliability of
next-generation wireless communications. Predicting future beams based on the
drone beam/position trajectory significantly reduces the beam training overhead

time-critical applications. Numerical results based on realistic 3D ray-tracing
simulations show that the proposed deep learning solution is promising for
future RIS-assisted THz networks by achieving near-optimal proactive hand-off

treatment effects in various fields and in particular social science
disciplines like political science, psychometry, psychology. More specifically,
these are situations where treatment is assigned to an individual based on some
of their characteristics (e.g. scholarship is allocated based on merit or
antihypertensive treatments are allocated based on blood pressure level)
instead of being allocated randomly, as is the case, for example, in randomized
clinical trials. Popular methods that have been largely employed till date for
estimation of such treatment effects suffer from slow rates of convergence
(i.e. slower than $\sqrt{n}$). In this paper, we present a new model coined
SCENTS: Score Explained Non-Randomized Treatment Systems, and a corresponding
method that allows estimation of the treatment effect at $\sqrt{n}$ rate in the
presence of fairly general forms of confoundedness, when the `score' variable
on whose basis treatment is assigned can be explained via certain feature
measurements of the individuals under study. We show that our estimator is
asymptotically normal in general and semi-parametrically efficient under normal
errors. We further extend our analysis to high dimensional covariates and
propose a $\sqrt n$ consistent and asymptotically normal estimator based on a
de-biasing procedure. Our analysis for the high dimensional incarnation can be
readily extended to analyze partial linear models in the presence of noisy
variables corresponding to the non-linear part of the model, where the noise
can be correlated with the variables corresponding to the linear part. We
analyze two real datasets via our method and compare our results with those
obtained by using previous approaches. We conclude this paper with a discussion
on some possible extensions of our approach.

We aimed to find a large cohort of Reddit users interested in discussing the
use of opioids, trace the temporal evolution of their interest, and extensively
characterize patterns of the nonmedical consumption of opioids, with a focus on
routes of administration and drug tampering. We used a semiautomatic
information retrieval algorithm to identify subreddits discussing nonmedical
opioid consumption, finding over 86,000 Reddit users potentially involved in
firsthand opioid usage. We developed a methodology based on word embedding to
select alternative colloquial and nonmedical terms referring to opioid
substances, routes of administration, and drug-tampering methods. We modeled
the preferences of adoption of substances and routes of administration,
estimating their prevalence and temporal unfolding, observing relevant trends
such as the surge in synthetic opioids like fentanyl and an increasing interest
in rectal administration. Ultimately, through the evaluation of odds ratios
based on co-mentions, we measured the strength of association between opioid
substances, routes of administration, and drug tampering, finding evidence of
understudied abusive behaviors like chewing fentanyl patches and dissolving
buprenorphine sublingually. We believe that our approach may provide a novel
perspective for a more comprehensive understanding of nonmedical abuse of
opioids substances and inform the prevention, treatment, and control of the
public health effects.

in ideal MHD. It can be explored in the stellar context by mapping large-scale
magnetic fields across stellar surfaces using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. A recent
study of 51 stars in the mass range 0.1-1.34 M$_\odot$ showed that the
photospheric magnetic helicity density follows a single power law when plotted
against the toroidal field energy, but splits into two branches when plotted
against the poloidal field energy. These two branches divide stars above and
below $\sim$ 0.5 M$_\odot$. We present here a novel method of visualising the
helicity density in terms of the linkage of the toroidal and poloidal fields
that are mapped across the stellar surface. This approach allows us to classify
the field linkages that provide the helicity density for stars of different
masses and rotation rates. We find that stars on the lower-mass branch tend to
have toroidal fields that are non-axisymmetric and so link through regions of
positive and negative poloidal field. A lower-mass star may have the same
helicity density as a higher-mass star, despite having a stronger poloidal
field. Lower-mass stars are therefore less efficient at generating large-scale
helicity.

this paper we argue that, despite satisfying fluctuation theorems and having a
clear resource-theoretic interpretation, this splitting has shortcomings.
First, it predicts that at low temperatures the entropy production will always
be dominated by the classical term, irrespective of the quantum nature of the
process. Second, for infinitesimal quenches, the radius of convergence diverges
exponentially as the temperature decreases, rendering the functions
non-analytic. Motivated by this, we provide here a complementary approach,
where the entropy production is split in a way such that the contributions from
populations and coherences are written in terms of a thermal state of a
specially dephased Hamiltonian. The physical interpretation of our proposal is
discussed in detail. We also contrast the two approaches by studying work
protocols in a transverse field Ising chain, and a macrospin of varying

that SDCs are a systemic issue across generations. We have monitored SDCs for a

reducing silent data corruptions requires not only hardware resiliency and

COVID-19 mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we
correct for the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the
present, with uncertainty? Without this correction, raw data will often mislead
by suggesting an improving situation. We present a flexible approach using a
latent Gaussian process that is capable of describing the changing
auto-correlation structure present in the reporting time-delay surface. This
approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated
nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as
the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a

process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and
against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has
substantial practical utility in disease modelling -- by applying our approach

for realistic populations of signal sources, we compute the fraction of
potential detections which are ""lost"" because the template bank is discrete. We
show that at fixed computational cost, the minimum thickness template bank does
not maximize the expected number of detections. Instead, the most detections
are obtained for a bank which minimizes a particular functional of the
mismatch. For closely spaced templates, the fraction of lost detections is
proportional to a scale-invariant ""quantizer constant"" G, which measures the
average squared distance from the nearest template, i.e., the average expected
mismatch. This provides a straightforward way to characterize and compare the
effectiveness of different template banks. The template bank which minimizes G
is mathematically called the ""optimal quantizer"", and maximizes the expected
number of detections. We review optimal quantizer and minimum thickness
template banks that are built as n-dimensional lattices, showing that even the
best of these offer only a marginal advantage over template banks based on the
humble cubic lattice.

the underlying mechanisms are varied. In this review, we highlight three
independent mechanisms that can potentially drive arrest of cell motion --
crowding, tension-driven rigidity, and reduction of fluctuations -- and propose
a speculative phase diagram that includes all three. Since multiple mechanisms
may be operating simultaneously, this emphasizes that experiments should strive
to identify which mechanism dominates in a given situation. We also discuss how
specific cell-scale and molecular-scale biological processes, such as cell-cell

bigger $\Delta v_{\rm rec}$ and $\omega_a$ to address the Hubble and

interactions, have a relaxing effect on the diffusion-induced stresses thus
improving the mechanical endurance of the particles, whereas, the compressive
effect of surface stresses degrades the electrochemical performance. However,
this straightforward prediction of an improved mechanical performance is
challenged in this work. Silicon nanowires undergoing huge volumetric changes
during lithiation, may undergo significant axial length-increase, which serves
as an important criterion in determining the mechanical performance of SiNWs.
Interestingly, surface stresses tend to reduce the length-increase under
potentiostatic charging condition, but under galvanostatic charging, the
length-increase gets enhanced, thus degrading the mechanical performance of the
SiNWs. To further make the study more inclusive, the nanowire is modelled with
a constraining material at its core, and a competitive analysis is presented
for the overall performance of the anode particles under the combined effects
of surface stresses and constraining material. The mathematical model is based
on large deformation theory, considering two-way coupling of diffusion-induced

remarkable progress has recently been achieved towards establishing global
convergence of softmax PG methods in finding a near-optimal policy. However,
prior results fall short of delineating clear dependencies of convergence rates

technology by expanding the current inter-networking services and enabling the
machine-to-machine communication. IoT massive deployments will create the
problem of optimal power allocation. The objective of the optimization problem
is to obtain a feasible solution that minimizes the total power consumption of
the WSN, when the error probability at the fusion center meets certain
criteria. This work studies the optimization of a wireless sensor network (WNS)
at higher dimensions by focusing to the power allocation of decentralized
detection. More specifically, we apply and compare four algorithms designed to
tackle Large scale global optimization (LGSO) problems. These are the memetic
linear population size reduction and semi-parameter adaptation (MLSHADE-SPA),
the contribution-based cooperative coevolution recursive differential grouping
(CBCC-RDG3), the differential grouping with spectral clustering-differential
evolution cooperative coevolution (DGSC-DECC), and the enhanced adaptive
differential evolution (EADE). To the best of the authors knowledge, this is
the first time that LGSO algorithms are applied to the optimal power allocation
problem in IoT networks. We evaluate the algorithms performance in several
different cases by applying them in cases with 300, 600 and 800 dimensions.

bosons. Constraints on the existence of such particles have been derived from
the observation of highly spinning black holes, absence of continuous
gravitational-wave signals, and of the associated stochastic background.
However, these constraints are only strictly speaking valid in the limit where
the boson's interactions can be neglected. In this work we investigate the
extent to which the superradiant growth of an ultra-light dark photon can be
quenched via scattering processes with ambient electrons. For dark photon
masses $m_{\gamma^\prime} \gtrsim 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$, and for reasonable
values of the ambient electron number density, we find superradiance can be
quenched prior to extracting a significant fraction of the black-hole spin. For
sufficiently large $m_{\gamma^\prime}$ and small electron number densities, the
in-medium suppression of the kinetic mixing can be efficiently removed, and
quenching occurs for mixings $\chi_0 \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$; at low
masses, however, in-medium effects strongly inhibit otherwise efficient
scattering processes from dissipating energy. Intriguingly, this quenching
leads to a time- and energy-oscillating electromagnetic signature, with
luminosities potentially extending up to $\sim 10^{57}\,{\rm erg / s}$,
suggesting that such events should be detectable with existing telescopes. As a
byproduct we also show that superradiance cannot be used to constrain a small
mass for the Standard Model photon.

from their near-IR luminosities (for $M_\star$) and the position-velocity
distributions of their globular cluster systems (for $M_{\rm h}$). Our
individual estimates of $M_{\rm h}$ are based on fitting a dynamical model with
a distribution function expressed in terms of action-angle variables and
imposing a prior on $M_{\rm h}$ from the concentration-mass relation in the
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the SHMR for early-type galaxies
declines with mass beyond a peak at $M_\star\sim 5\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and
$M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$ (near the mass of the Milky Way). This result is
consistent with the standard SHMR derived by abundance matching for the general
population of galaxies, and with previous, less robust derivations of the SHMR
for early types. However, it contrasts sharply with the monotonically rising
SHMR for late types derived from extended HI rotation curves and the same
$\Lambda$CDM prior on $M_{\rm h}$ as we adopt for early types. The SHMR for
massive galaxies varies more or less continuously, from rising to falling, with
decreasing disc fraction and decreasing Hubble type. We also show that the
different SHMRs for late and early types are consistent with the similar
scaling relations between their stellar velocities and masses (Tully-Fisher and
Faber-Jackson relations). Differences in the relations between the stellar and
halo virial velocities account for the similarity of the scaling relations. We
argue that all these empirical findings are natural consequences of a picture
in which galactic discs are built mainly by smooth and gradual inflow,
regulated by feedback from young stars, while galactic spheroids are built by a
cooperation between merging, black-hole fuelling, and feedback from AGNs.

near-ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths (0.3-1.1 $\mu$m) for 12
compact starburst galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. These massive galaxies (M_stellar ~
10^11 M_Sun) are driving very fast outflows ($v_{max}$=1000-3000 km/s), and
their light profiles are dominated by an extremely compact starburst component
(half-light radius ~ 100 pc). Our goal is to constrain the physical mechanisms
responsible for launching these fast outflows by measuring the physical
conditions within the central kiloparsec. Based on our stellar population
analysis, the central component typically contributes $\approx$25% of the total
stellar mass and the central escape velocities $v_{esc,central}\approx900$ km/s
are a factor of two smaller than the observed outflow velocities. This requires
physical mechanisms that can accelerate gas to speeds significantly beyond the
central escape velocities, and it makes clear that these fast outflows are
capable of traveling into the circumgalactic medium, and potentially beyond. We
find central stellar densities comparable to theoretical estimates of the
Eddington limit, and we estimate $\Sigma_1$ surface densities within the
central kpc comparable to those of compact massive galaxies at $0.5<z<3.0$.
Relative to ""red nuggets"" and ""blue nuggets"" at $z\sim2$, we find significantly
smaller $r_e$ values at a given stellar mass, which we attribute to the
dominance of a young stellar component in our sample and the better physical
resolution for rest-frame optical observations at $z\sim0.6$ versus $z\sim2$.
We compare to theoretical scenarios involving major mergers and violent disc
instability, and we speculate that our galaxies are progenitors of power-law
ellipticals in the local universe with prominent stellar cusps.

that quantization-aware pruning yields more computationally efficient models

quantization-aware pruning typically performs similar to or better in terms of
computational efficiency compared to other neural architecture search
techniques like Bayesian optimization. Surprisingly, while networks with
different training configurations can have similar performance for the
benchmark application, the information content in the network can vary
significantly, affecting its generalizability.

a potential not only to make a radical revision of the classical understanding
of space-time but also to achieve enhanced functionalities of quantum
information processing. For example, it is known that indefinite causal
structures provide exponential advantage in communication complexity when
compared to causal protocols. In quantum computation, such structures can
decide whether two unitary gates commute or anticommute with a single call to
each gate, which is impossible with conventional (causal) quantum algorithms. A
generalization of this effect to $n$ unitary gates, originally introduced in M.
Ara\'ujo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 250402 (2014) and often called Fourier
promise problem (FPP), can be solved with the quantum-$n$-switch and a single
call to each gate, while the best known causal algorithm so far calls $O(n^2)$
gates. In this work, we show that this advantage is smaller than expected. In
fact, we present a causal algorithm that solves the only known specific FPP
with $O(n \log(n))$ queries and a causal algorithm that solves every FPP with
$O(n\sqrt{n})$ queries. Besides the interest in such algorithms on their own,
our results limit the expected advantage of indefinite causal structures for
these problems.

of a bound on the quantum Lyapunov exponent. An important question is to
understand what is special about maximally chaotic systems which saturate this
bound. Here we provide further evidence for the `hydrodynamic' origin of chaos
in such systems, and discuss hallmarks of maximally chaotic systems. We first
provide evidence that a hydrodynamic effective field theory of chaos we
previously proposed should be understood as a theory of maximally chaotic
systems. We then emphasize and make explicit a signature of maximal chaos which
was only implicit in prior literature, namely the suppression of exponential
growth in commutator squares of generic few-body operators. We provide a
general argument for this suppression within our chaos effective field theory,
and illustrate it using SYK models and holographic systems. We speculate that
this suppression indicates that the nature of operator scrambling in maximally
chaotic systems is fundamentally different to scrambling in non-maximally
chaotic systems. We also discuss a simplest scenario for the existence of a
maximally chaotic regime at sufficiently large distances even for non-maximally
chaotic systems.

observation. In particular, SWCX events caused by interplanetary coronal mass
ejections (ICMEs) tend to be spectrally rich and to provide critical
information about the metal abundance in the ICME plasma. We analyzed the
SN1006 background data observed with Suzaku on 2005 September 11 shortly after

of the detected ions were found to be consistent with those in past ICME-driven
SWCX events. Thus, we conclude that this event was ICME-driven. In addition, we
detected a sulfur XVI line for the first time as one from the SWCX emission,

L$_{\text{1.4 GHz}}$ $\sim$6 $\cdot$ 10$^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The mean spectral
index between 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz is $\sim$ -1, consistent with the usual indices

We discuss possible causes for these offsets, which suggest that the coolest
gas is not condensing directly from the lowest-entropy gas. In particular, we
argue that the cool ICM was drawn out from the core by sloshing, whereas the
H$\alpha$ filaments were pushed aside from the expanding radio galaxy lobes. We
detect two putative X-ray cavities, spatially associated to the west radio lobe
(cavity A) and to the east radio lobe (cavity B). The cavity power and age of
the system are P$_{\text{cav}} \sim$ 9 $\times$10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and

erratic intrinsic period changes dominate over the light travel-time effect due
to binarity. However, the latter may explain the periodic phase modulation for

numerous applications, such as studying the effect of pregnancy-related factors

simultaneously estimate non-crossing, non-linear quantile curves. We expand the
conditional distribution function of the response in I-spline basis functions

By leveraging the approximation power of splines and neural networks, our model
can approximate any continuous quantile function. Compared to existing models,
our model estimates all rather than a finite subset of quantiles, scales well
to high dimensions, and accounts for estimation uncertainty. While the model is
arbitrarily flexible, interpretable marginal quantile effects are estimated
using accumulative local effect plots and variable importance measures. A
simulation study shows that our model can better recover quantiles of the
response distribution when the data is sparse, and an analysis of birth weight
data is presented.

the energy of a structure, is a more useful notion of rigidity in practice than
two more commonly used rigidity tests: Maxwell-Calladine constraint counting
(first-order rigidity) and second-order rigidity. We find that constraint
counting robustly predicts energetic rigidity only when the system has no
states of self stress. When the system has states of self stress, we show that
second-order rigidity can imply energetic rigidity in systems that are not
considered rigid based on constraint counting, and is even more reliable than
shear modulus. We also show that there may be systems for which neither first

rigidity unifies our understanding of mechanical stability and also suggests
new avenues for material design.

based GL procedural knowledge, adapted to the patient preferences and to their
current context, are projected from a central DSS server, to a local DSS on the
patient mobile device that applies that knowledge. When appropriate, as defined
by a temporal pattern within the projected plan, the local DSS calls back the
central DSS, requesting further assistance, possibly another projection. Thus,
the GL specification includes two levels: one for the central DSS, one for the
local DSS. We successfully evaluated the PCB model within the MobiGuide EU

3.95 days for gestational diabetes, 23.80 days for atrial fibrillation. Most
interactions, 83%, were due to projections to the mDSS. Others were data

approximate the minibatched supervised learning setting; however, unlike
supervised learning where access to lots of training data is crucial to
generalization, replay-based deep RL appears to struggle in the presence of
extraneous data. Recent works have shown that the performance of Deep Q-Network
(DQN) degrades when its replay memory becomes too large.
  This suggests that outdated experiences somehow impact the performance of
deep RL, which should not be the case for off-policy methods like DQN.
Consequently, we re-examine the motivation for sampling uniformly over a replay
memory, and find that it may be flawed when using function approximation. We
show that -- despite conventional wisdom -- sampling from the uniform
distribution does not yield uncorrelated training samples and therefore biases
gradients during training. Our theory prescribes a special non-uniform
distribution to cancel this effect, and we propose a stratified sampling scheme
to efficiently implement it.

low elastic modulus to conform to the surface roughness of the adhered

energy, which release drives the propagation of interfacial flaws prompting
detachment. The ideal adhesive is then soft but rigid. The solution to this
controversial requirement is a bi-material adhesive having a soft tip, for
surface conformation, and a rigid backing, for reduced strain energy release,
hence, better adhesive strength. This design strategy is widely observed in
nature across multiple species. However, the detachment mechanisms of these
adhesives are poorly understood and quantitative analysis of their adhesive
strength is still missing. Based on linear elastic fracture mechanics, we
analyze the strength of axisymmetric bi-material adhesives. We observed two
main detachment mechanisms, namely (i) center crack propagation and (ii) edge
crack propagation. If the soft tip is sufficiently thin, mechanism (i)
dominates and provides stable crack propagation, thereby toughening the

galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in different environments has been studied. The
fractions of radio and optical AGN in four different environments have been
compared using samples of void, isolated, group member, and the brightest group
galaxies (BGGs). Galaxies in voids show significantly lower stellar ages,
concentrations, colours and surface mass densities, and they experience more
one-on-one interactions compared to the isolated galaxies and galaxies in
groups. In order to study pure environmental effects, the biases caused by the
stellar mass and galaxy type quantified by 4000$\AA$ break strength have been
removed. While the results confirm no dependence of the optical AGN activity on
environment in blue galaxies and with lower significance in green galaxies, a
higher fraction of optical AGN has been observed for the massive red galaxies
in voids compared to the galaxies in dense environments. This may be related to
the higher amount of one-on-one interaction observed in the void galaxies, or
it may reflect more fundamental differences in the host galaxies or
environments of the voids. The radio-mode AGN activity increases in dense
environment for red galaxies. No changes in the radio-loud AGN fraction have
been observed for the blue and green galaxies. This shows that the effect of
environment on AGN activity is not significant in the presence of cold gas in

missing data. However, applications of imputation often lack a firm foundation
in statistical theory. This paper originated when we were unable to find
analysis substantiating claims that imputation of missing data has good
frequentist properties when data are missing at random (MAR). We focused on the
use of observed covariates to impute missing covariates when estimating
conditional means of the form E(y|x, w). Here y is an outcome whose
realizations are always observed, x is a covariate whose realizations are
always observed, and w is a covariate whose realizations are sometimes
unobserved. We examine the probability limit of simple imputation estimates of
E(y|x, w) as sample size goes to infinity. We find that these estimates are not
consistent when covariate data are MAR. To the contrary, the estimates suffer
from a shrinkage problem. They converge to points intermediate between the
conditional mean of interest, E(y|x, w), and the mean E(y|x) that conditions
only on x. We use a type of genotype imputation to illustrate.

accounted for in the parameter extraction. The functional dependence of
$\hat{q}$ on jet energy or virtuality and medium temperature is based on a
perturbative picture of in-medium scattering, with components reflecting the
different regimes of applicability of MATTER and LBT. In the multi-stage

$Q_0$. Comparison of the posterior model predictions to the RHIC and LHC hadron

and, crucially, never elucidated in comparison to proteins. Detailed insights
would help understand to what extent PNIPAM microgels can effectively be used
as synthetic biomimetic materials, to reproduce and study, at the colloidal
scale, isolated protein behavior and its sensitivity to interactions with
specific cosolvents or cosolutes. Experiments: The effect of trehalose on the
swelling behavior of PNIPAM microgels was monitored by dynamic light
scattering; Raman spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations were used to
explore changes of solvation and dynamics across the swelling-deswelling
transition at the molecular scale. Findings: Strongly hydrated trehalose
molecules develop water-mediated interactions with PNIPAM microgels, thereby
preserving polymer hydration below and above the transition while drastically
inhibiting local motions of the polymer and of its hydration shell. Our study,
for the first time, demonstrates that slowdown of dynamics and preferential
exclusion are the principal mechanisms governing trehalose effect on PNIPAM
microgels, at odds with preferential adsorption of alcohols, but in full
analogy with the behavior observed in trehalose-protein systems.

motive to classify the gender of celebrities' portraits as an excuse for
exploration in a broad, more artistic sense. Investigation results drove
compelling ideas here discussed. The experiments compared different ways to
represent draws to be input in a network and showed that an absolute format of
coordinates (x, y) was a better performer than a relative one (Dx, Dy) with
respect to prior points, most frequent in the reviewed literature. Experiments
also showed that, due to the recurrent nature of LSTMs, the order of lines
forming a drawing is a relevant factor for input in an LSTM classifier not
studied before. A minimum 'pencil' traveled length criteria for line ordering
proved suitable, possible by reducing it to a TSP particular instance. The best
configuration for gender classification appears with an LSTM layer that returns
the hidden state value for each input point step, followed by a global average
layer along the sequence, before the output dense layer. That result guided the
idea of removing the average in the network pipeline and return a per-point
attribute score just by adjusting tensors dimensions. With this trick, the
model detects an attribute in a drawing and also recognizes the points linked
to it. Moreover, by overlapping filtered lines of portraits, an attribute's

materials relies predominantly on band hybridization between layers. Band-edge
states in transition-metal-dichalcogenide semiconductors are localized around
the metal atoms at the center of the three-atom layer and are therefore not
particularly susceptible to twisting. Here, we report that high-lying excitons
in bilayer WSe2 can be tuned over 235 meV by twisting, with a twist-angle
susceptibility of 8.1 meV/{\deg}, an order of magnitude larger than that of the
band-edge A-exciton. This tunability arises because the electronic states
associated with upper conduction bands delocalize into the chalcogenide atoms.
The effect gives control over excitonic quantum interference, revealed in
selective activation and deactivation of electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in second-harmonic generation. Such a degree of freedom does
not exist in conventional dilute atomic-gas systems, where EIT was originally
established, and allows us to shape the frequency dependence, i.e. the

active regions associated with small (or micro-) flares. This kind of wave
activity was first discovered with the SOHO/SUMER spectrometer from Doppler
velocity measurements of hot emission lines, thus also often called ""SUMER""
oscillations. They were mainly interpreted as global (or fundamental mode)
standing slow magnetoacoustic waves. In addition, increasing evidence has
suggested that the decaying harmonic type of pulsations detected in light
curves of solar and stellar flares are likely caused by standing slow-mode
waves. The study of slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops has become a
topic of particular interest in connection with coronal seismology. We review
recent results from SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT observations that have detected both
standing and reflected intensity oscillations in hot flaring loops showing the
physical properties (e.g., oscillation periods, decay times, and triggers) in
accord with the SUMER oscillations. We also review recent advances in theory
and numerical modeling of slow-mode waves focusing on the wave excitation and
damping mechanisms. MHD simulations in 1D, 2D and 3D have been dedicated to
understanding the physical conditions for the generation of a reflected
propagating or a standing wave by impulsive heating. Various damping mechanisms

Our purpose is to make a new database on \beta-delayed neutron emission and

have to be predicted. Microscopic theoretical approaches based on a nuclear
energy density functional and statistical models are one of the competent tools
for the prediction. To obtain \beta strength function, p-n relativistic QRPA is
adopted. Particle evaporations and fission from nuclear highly excited states
are estimated by the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. \beta-delayed neutron
branching ratios (P_n) are calculated and compared with experimental data.
\beta-delayed fission branching ratio (P_f) are also assessed by using four
different fission barrier data. Calculated P_n values are in a good agreement

to detect small artificial faults, systematically seeded into the tested
program. Mutation analysis is considered one of the strongest test-adequacy
criteria. Mutation testing builds on top of mutation analysis and is a testing
technique that uses mutants as test goals to create or improve a test suite.
Mutation testing has long been considered intractable because the sheer number
of mutants that can be created represents an insurmountable problem -- both in
terms of human and computational effort. This has hindered the adoption of
mutation testing as an industry standard. For example, Google has a codebase of
two billion lines of code and more than 500,000,000 tests are executed on a
daily basis. The traditional approach to mutation testing does not scale to
such an environment. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
scalable approach to mutation testing based on the following main ideas: (1)
Mutation testing is done incrementally, mutating only changed code during code
review, rather than the entire code base; (2) Mutants are filtered, removing
mutants that are likely to be irrelevant to developers, and limiting the number
of mutants per line and per code review process; (3) Mutants are selected based
on the historical performance of mutation operators, further eliminating
irrelevant mutants and improving mutant quality. Evaluation in a
code-review-based setting with more than 24,000 developers on more than 1,000
projects shows that the proposed approach produces orders of magnitude fewer
mutants and that context-based mutant filtering and selection improve mutant
quality and actionability. Overall, the proposed approach represents a mutation
testing framework that seamlessly integrates into the software development
workflow and is applicable up to large-scale industrial settings.

SaBN is motivated by addressing the inherent feature distribution heterogeneity

heterogeneity (multiple input domains) or model heterogeneity (dynamic
architectures, model conditioning, etc.). Our SaBN factorizes the BN affine
layer into one shared sandwich affine layer, cascaded by several parallel
independent affine layers. Concrete analysis reveals that, during optimization,
SaBN promotes balanced gradient norms while still preserving diverse gradient
directions -- a property that many application tasks seem to favor. We
demonstrate the prevailing effectiveness of SaBN as a drop-in replacement in
four tasks: conditional image generation, neural architecture search (NAS),
adversarial training, and arbitrary style transfer. Leveraging SaBN immediately
achieves better Inception Score and FID on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet conditional
image generation with three state-of-the-art GANs; boosts the performance of a
state-of-the-art weight-sharing NAS algorithm significantly on NAS-Bench-201;
substantially improves the robust and standard accuracies for adversarial

clinical target volume (HRCTV), and possible source locations. A sample of
previous T&O treatments comprising 397 cases (273 training:62 validation:62

were interpolated to 1x1x2.5mm3 dose planes with two input channels (source

dose difference (\Delta D)(xyz)=D_(actual)(x,y,z)-D_(predicted)(x,y,z) and dice

range (20-130% of prescription), mean and standard deviation. We also examined
discrete DVH metrics used for T&O plan quality assessment: HRCTV D_90%(dose to
hottest 90% volume) and OAR D_2cc, with \Delta
D_x=D_(x,actual)-D_(x,predicted). Pearson correlation coefficient, standard

Results: Voxel-wise dose difference accuracy for 20-130% dose range for

was [-0.3%+/-2.0% to +1.0%+/-12.0%] ([-0.1%+/-4% to +4.0%+/-26%]). Voxel-wise
dice similarity coefficients for 20-130% dose ranged from [0.96, 0.91]([0.94,
0.87]). DVH metric prediction in the training (test) set were HRCTV(\Delta

information. This is more evident when they are the product of community effort
or automatic fact extraction methods from external sources, such as text. A
special case of the aforementioned phenomenon can be seen in knowledge graphs,
where this mostly appears in the form of missing or incorrect edges and nodes.
  Structured querying on such incomplete graphs will result in incomplete sets
of answers, even if the correct entities exist in the graph, since one or more
edges needed to match the pattern are missing. To overcome this problem,
several algorithms for approximate structured query answering have been
proposed. Inspired by modern Information Retrieval metrics, these algorithms
produce a ranking of all entities in the graph, and their performance is
further evaluated based on how high in this ranking the correct answers appear.
  In this work we take a critical look at this way of evaluation. We argue that
performing a ranking-based evaluation is not sufficient to assess methods for
complex query answering. To solve this, we introduce Message Passing Query
Boxes (MPQB), which takes binary classification metrics back into use and shows
the effect this has on the recently proposed query embedding method MPQE.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2102.09084",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz MIMO systems rely on pre-defined
beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. Being
pre-defined, however, these codebooks are commonly not optimized for specific
environments, user distributions, and/or possible hardware impairments. This
leads to large codebook sizes with high beam training overhead which increases
the initial access/tracking latency and makes it hard for these systems to
support highly mobile applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
develops a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns how to iteratively
optimize the codebook beam patterns (shapes) relying only on the receive power
measurements and without requiring any explicit channel knowledge. The
developed model learns how to autonomously adapt the beam patterns to best
match the surrounding environment, user distribution, hardware impairments, and
array geometry. Further, this approach does not require any knowledge about the
channel, array geometry, RF hardware, or user positions. To reduce the learning
time, the proposed model designs a novel Wolpertinger-variant architecture that
is capable of efficiently searching for an optimal policy in a large discrete
action space, which is important for large antenna arrays with quantized phase
shifters. This complex-valued neural network architecture design respects the
practical RF hardware constraints such as the constant-modulus and quantized
phase shifter constraints. Simulation results based on the publicly available
DeepMIMO dataset confirm the ability of the developed framework to learn
near-optimal beam patterns for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios
and for arrays with hardware impairments without requiring any channel
knowledge.

  Multi-frequency Information and Local-global Naturalness",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CG cs.MM eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  360-degree/omnidirectional images (OIs) have achieved remarkable attentions
due to the increasing applications of virtual reality (VR). Compared to
conventional 2D images, OIs can provide more immersive experience to consumers,
benefitting from the higher resolution and plentiful field of views (FoVs).
Moreover, observing OIs is usually in the head mounted display (HMD) without
references. Therefore, an efficient blind quality assessment method, which is
specifically designed for 360-degree images, is urgently desired. In this
paper, motivated by the characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) and
the viewing process of VR visual contents, we propose a novel and effective
no-reference omnidirectional image quality assessment (NR OIQA) algorithm by
Multi-Frequency Information and Local-Global Naturalness (MFILGN).
Specifically, inspired by the frequency-dependent property of visual cortex, we
first decompose the projected equirectangular projection (ERP) maps into
wavelet subbands. Then, the entropy intensities of low and high frequency
subbands are exploited to measure the multi-frequency information of OIs.
Besides, except for considering the global naturalness of ERP maps, owing to
the browsed FoVs, we extract the natural scene statistics features from each
viewport image as the measure of local naturalness. With the proposed
multi-frequency information measurement and local-global naturalness
measurement, we utilize support vector regression as the final image quality
regressor to train the quality evaluation model from visual quality-related
features to human ratings. To our knowledge, the proposed model is the first
no-reference quality assessment method for 360-degreee images that combines
multi-frequency information and image naturalness. Experimental results on two
publicly available OIQA databases demonstrate that our proposed MFILGN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

representation learning and manifold learning typically requires large data. By
encoding deep representation of the manifolds as regularizing features,
mfTacoma effectively leverages the manifold information that is potentially

outperforms two alternatives -- deep features by linear manifolds with

socio-economic integration as well as natives' attitudes towards globalisation

forfeiting one's ties to the home country and eventually translates into a loss
of diversity (from the viewpoint of host countries) and of global connections
(from the viewpoint of both host and home countries). Cultural integration can
be described using two dimensions: the preservation of links to the home
country and culture, which we call home attachment, and the creation of new
links together with the adoption of cultural traits from the new residence
country, which we call destination attachment. In this paper we introduce a
means to quantify these two aspects based on Twitter data. We build home and
destination attachment indexes and analyse their possible determinants (e.g.,
language proximity, distance between countries), also in relation to Hofstede's
cultural dimension scores. The results stress the importance of host language
proficiency to explain destination attachment, but also the link between
language and home attachment. In particular, the common language between home
and destination countries corresponds to increased home attachment, as does low
proficiency in the host language. Common geographical borders also seem to
increase both home and destination attachment. Regarding cultural dimensions,
larger differences among home and destination country in terms of
Individualism, Masculinity and Uncertainty appear to correspond to larger

that are trained on high-fidelity data (e.g., from direct numerical simulation,
DNS) to outperform baseline physics-based models and accurately capture the
inter-scale transfers, both forward (diffusion) and backscatter. While
promising, instabilities in a posteriori (online) tests and inabilities to
generalize to a different flow (e.g., with a higher Reynolds number, Re) remain
as major obstacles in broadening the applications of such data-driven SGS
models. For example, many of the same aforementioned studies have found
instabilities that required often ad-hoc remedies to stabilize the LES at the
expense of reducing accuracy. Here, using 2D decaying turbulence as the
testbed, we show that deep fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can
accurately predict the SGS forcing terms and the inter-scale transfers in a
priori tests, and if trained with enough samples, lead to stable and accurate a
posteriori LES-CNN. Further analysis attributes these instabilities to the
disproportionally lower accuracy of the CNNs in capturing backscattering when
the training set is small. We also show that transfer learning, which involves
re-training the CNN with a small amount of data (e.g., 1%) from the new flow,
enables accurate and stable a posteriori LES-CNN for flows with 16x higher Re

these metrics as reward function at training time is questionable: they tend to
be sparse and biased towards the specific words used in the reference texts. We
propose to address this problem by making models less reliant on such metrics
in two ways: (a) with an entropy-regularised RL method that does not only
maximise a reward function but also explore the action space to avoid peaky
distributions; (b) with a novel RL method that explores a dynamic unsupervised
reward function to balance between exploration and exploitation. We base our
proposals on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, adapting the off-policy
maximum entropy model for language generation applications such as MT. We
demonstrate that SAC with BLEU reward tends to overfit less to the training

The layered insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ orders as a zigzag antiferromagnet
below $\sim$7 K in zero magnetic field. The zigzag order is destroyed when a

exists. Here we report the observation of oscillations in its thermal
conductivity below 4 K. The oscillation amplitude is very large within the
interval (7.3, 11) T and strongly suppressed on either side. Paradoxically, the
oscillations are periodic in 1/\emph{H}, analogous to quantum oscillations in

1.9 eV. By tilting $\bf H$ out of the plane, we find that the oscillation
period is determined by the in-plane component $H_a$. As the temperature is
raised above 0.5 K, the oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially. The
decrease anticorrelates with the emergence above $\sim$2 K of an anomalous
planar thermal Hall conductivity measured with $\bf H\parallel a$. To exclude
extrinsic artifacts, we carried out several tests. The implications of the
oscillations are discussed.

gradient descent-based algorithms for coverage control tasks involving robot
swarms. We adopt a multiscale approach to analysis and design to ensure
consistency of the algorithms in the large-scale limit. First, we represent the
macroscopic configuration of the swarm as a probability measure and formulate
the macroscopic coverage task as the minimization of a convex objective
function over probability measures. We then construct a macroscopic dynamics
for swarm coverage, which takes the form of a proximal descent scheme in the
$L^2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis exploits the generalized geodesic
convexity of the coverage objective function, proving convergence in the
$L^2$-Wasserstein sense to the target probability measure. We then obtain a
consistent gradient descent algorithm in the Euclidean space that is
implementable by a finite collection of agents, via a ""variational""
discretization of the macroscopic coverage objective function. We establish the
convergence properties of the gradient descent and its behavior in the
continuous-time and large-scale limits. Furthermore, we establish a connection
with well-known Lloyd-based algorithms, seen as a particular class of
algorithms within our framework, and demonstrate our results via numerical
experiments.

this system because this optimization problem can only be solved with a densely

system theoretically, a truncated Wigner stochastic differential equation
(W-SDE) is introduced as a model for the network of degenerate optical
parametric oscillators, and macroscopic equations are derived by applying
statistical mechanics to the W-SDE. We show that the system performance in

mobility due to the highly directional signal beams. The emerging
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) technique can effectively mitigate
the blockage problem by exploring the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path, where the
beam switching is realized by digitally configuring the phases of RIS elements.
To date, most efforts have been made in the stationary scenario. However, when
considering node mobility, beam tracking algorithms designed specifically for
RIS are needed in order to maintain the NLOS link. In this paper, a fast
RIS-based beam tracking algorithm is developed by partly transforming the large
amount of signaling time into the calculation happens at base station in a
mmWave system with mobile users. Specifically, the differential form of optimal
RIS configuration is exploited as the updating beam tracking parameter to avoid
complex channel estimation procedure. The RIS-based beam tracking problem is
then transformed into an optimization problem whose solution is found by a
calculation-based search. Finally, by training on a small set candidate,
RIS-based beam tracking is realized. The effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed RIS-based beam tracking algorithm is evaluated by simulations. It
shows that the proposed algorithm has near-optimal performance with dramatic
savings in terms of signaling time.

purpose, they are used here for quantifying the uncertainty in macroeconomic

capturing most of the data points. Based on these two objectives, we formulated
a bi-objective optimization problem to generate PIs in 2-stages, wherein
reconstructing the phase space using Chaos theory (stage-1) is followed by
generating optimal point prediction using NSGA-II and these point predictions
are in turn used to obtain PIs (stage-2). We also proposed a 3-stage hybrid,

substantially reduced flow artifacts.
  Methods: A projection-reconstruction (PR) trajectory is proposed for a
frequency-modulated cine sequence, facilitating reconstruction of three phase
cycles and a field-map time series from a short, breath-held scan. Data is also
acquired during the gradient rewinders to enable generation of field maps using
BMART, B$_0$ mapping using rewinding trajectories, where the rewind data forms
the second TE image for calculating the field map. A field-map-based
combination method is developed which weights the phase-cycle component images
to include only passband signal in the final cine images, and exclude stopband
and near-band flow artifacts.
  Results: The weights derived from the BMART-generated field maps mask out
banding and near-band flow artifacts in and around the heart. Therefore, the
field-map-based phase-cycle combination, which is facilitated by the PR
acquisition with BMART, results in more homogeneous blood pools and reduced
hyperintense regions than root-sum-of-squares.
  Conclusion: With the proposed techniques, using a non-Cartesian trajectory
for a frequency-modulated cine sequence enables flow-artifact-reduced
banding-free cardiac imaging within a short breath-hold.

existence of a participation cost promotes cooperation in the costly institute.
Despite paying for a participation cost, costly cooperators, who join the
costly institute and cooperate, can out-perform defectors, who predominantly
join a free institute. This, not only promotes cooperation in the costly

that stabilizes the robot and tracks a desired velocity. In non-straight paths,
the robot follows the trajectory that a motion trajectory generator block plans

study a class of recurrent neural networks called combinatorial
threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) whose dynamics are determined by the
structure of a directed graph. They are a special case of TLNs, a popular
framework for modeling neural activity in computational neuroscience. In prior
work, CTLNs were found to be surprisingly tractable mathematically. For small
networks, the fixed points of the network dynamics can often be completely
determined via a series of graph rules that can be applied directly to the
underlying graph. For larger networks, it remains a challenge to understand how
the global structure of the network interacts with local properties. In this
work, we propose a method of covering graphs of CTLNs with a set of smaller
directional graphs that reflect the local flow of activity. While directional
graphs may or may not have a feedforward architecture, their fixed point
structure is indicative of feedforward dynamics. The combinatorial structure of
the graph cover is captured by the nerve of the cover. The nerve is a smaller,
simpler graph that is more amenable to graphical analysis. We present three
nerve theorems that provide strong constraints on the fixed points of the
underlying network from the structure of the nerve. We then illustrate the
power of these theorems with some examples. Remarkably, we find that the nerve
not only constrains the fixed points of CTLNs, but also gives insight into the
transient and asymptotic dynamics. This is because the flow of activity in the
network tends to follow the edges of the nerve.

decades, especially to predict molecular properties for chemistry, material
science and drug design. Recently, machine learning techniques have emerged as
a powerful and cost-effective strategy to learn from existing datasets and
perform predictions on unseen molecules. Accordingly, the explosive rise of
data-driven techniques raises an important question: What confidence can be
assigned to molecular property predictions and what techniques can be used for
that purpose?
  Areas covered: In this work, we discuss popular strategies for predicting
molecular properties relevant to drug design, their corresponding uncertainty
sources and methods to quantify uncertainty and confidence. First, our
considerations for assessing confidence begin with dataset bias and size,
data-driven property prediction and feature design. Next, we discuss property
simulation via molecular docking, and free-energy simulations of binding
affinity in detail. Lastly, we investigate how these uncertainties propagate to
generative models, as they are usually coupled with property predictors.
  Expert opinion: Computational techniques are paramount to reduce the
prohibitive cost and timing of brute-force experimentation when exploring the
enormous chemical space. We believe that assessing uncertainty in property
prediction models is essential whenever closed-loop drug design campaigns
relying on high-throughput virtual screening are deployed. Accordingly,
considering sources of uncertainty leads to better-informed experimental
validations, more reliable predictions and to more realistic expectations of
the entire workflow. Overall, this increases confidence in the predictions and
designs and, ultimately, accelerates drug design.

polymers to erroneously cross each other. A recent solution to these issues,

obtained from integrating an interaction kernel along the lengths of two
polymer segments to describe their repulsion. Here, we extend this model by
re-deriving it for lower-dimensional geometrical configurations, deriving
similar expressions using a steeper interaction kernel, comparing it to other
commonly used potentials, and showing how to parameterize these models. We also
generalize this new integrated style of potential by introducing a segmental
Lennard-Jones potential, which enables modelling both attractive and repulsive

generalized to facilitate the development of effective interaction potentials

downweight it by our estimated uncertainty quantification. Experimental results

electronics. It exhibits premature metallicity on the introduction of a tiny
amount of electrons, the physics behind which remains elusive. Here we report
on transport and dielectric measurements in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se single crystals at
various carrier densities. The temperature-dependent resistivity ($\rho$)
indicates a smooth evolution from the semiconducting to the metallic state. The
critical concentration for the metal-insulator transition (MIT) to occur is
extraordinarily low ($n_\textrm{c}\sim10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$). The relative
permittivity of the insulating sample is huge
($\epsilon_\textrm{r}\approx155(10)$) and varies slowly with temperature.
Combined with the light effective mass, a long effective Bohr radius
($a_\textrm{B}^*\approx36(2)$ $\textrm{nm}$) is derived, which provides a
reasonable interpretation of the metallic prematurity according to Mott's
criterion for MITs. The high electron mobility ($\mu$) at low temperatures may
result from the screening of ionized scattering centers due to the huge
$\epsilon_\textrm{r}$. Our findings shed light on the electron dynamics in two
dimensional (2D) Bi$_2$O$_2$Se devices.

a MiTM attack, an intruder embeds itself within a conversation between two

compromise power system operations, such as state estimation, economic

MR sequences provide complementary information about brain structures. Recent
works have suggested that multi-modal deep learning analysis can benefit from
explicitly disentangling anatomical (shape) and modality (appearance)

mainstream strategies by showing that they do not naturally lead to
representation disentanglement both in theory and in practice. To address this

robust training, we further use a conditional convolution to design a single
model for encoding images of all modalities. Lastly, we propose a fusion
function to combine the disentangled anatomical representations as a set of
modality-invariant features for downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed
method on three multi-modal neuroimaging datasets. Experiments show that our
proposed method can achieve superior disentangled representations compared to
existing disentanglement strategies. Results also indicate that the fused

acoustic scenery. Currently, the mainstream paradigm for AAC is the end-to-end
encoder-decoder architecture, expecting the encoder to learn all levels of
concepts embedded in the audio automatically. This paper first proposes a topic
model for audio descriptions, comprehensively analyzing the hierarchical audio
topics that are commonly covered. We then explore a transfer learning scheme to
access local and global information. Two source tasks are identified to
respectively represent local and global information, being Audio Tagging (AT)
and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC). Experiments are conducted on the AAC

eight metrics with topic transfer learning. Further, it is discovered that
local information and abstract representation learning are more crucial to AAC
than global information and temporal relationship learning.

density ($J_{\text{c}}$) to depairing current density ($J_{\text{d}}$) ratio
around 20 to 30 times lower than that of state-of-the-art $\mathrm{Nb-Ti}$ or

$J_{\text{c}}$ are due to improved connectivity associated with optimization of
the heat treatment process, and most recently due to a transition to a finer
and more uniform powder manufactured by Engi-Mat. One quantitative measure of
connectivity may be the critical current ($I_{\text{c}}$) distribution, since
the local $I_{\text{c}}$ in a wire can vary along the length due to variable
vortex-microstructure interactions and to factors such as filament shape
variations, grain-to-grain connectivity variations and blocking secondary phase
distributions. Here we compare $\sim$ 0.1 m length $I_{\text{c}}$ distributions
of Bi-2212 RWs with recent state-of-the-art very high-$J_{\text{c}}$ Engi-Mat

that the $I_{\text{c}}$ spread for Bi-2212 wires is about twice the relative

We do not yet see any obvious contribution of the Bi-2212 anisotropy to the

wires show relative $I_{\text{c}}$ distributions not too far from
high-$J_{\text{c}}$ $\mathrm{Nb-Ti}$ wires.

Theoretical results show many mutation operators for these problems guarantee
convergence to maximally diverse populations of sufficiently small size within
cubic to quartic expected run-time. On the other hand, the result on QAP
suggests that strong mutations give poor worst-case performance, as mutation
strength contributes exponentially to the expected run-time. Additionally,
experiments are carried out on QAPLIB and synthetic instances in unconstrained

performances, while corroborating the theoretical finding regarding mutation

three-body loss, which is proposed to be used to measure the minute change of a
magnetic field around the resonance. However, the eddy current will cause
ultracold atom experiencing a magnetic field delayed to the desired magnetic
field from the current of the magnetic coils. The elimination of the eddy
current effect will play a key role in any experiments that motivated to
measure the magnetic field to the precision of a part per million stability.
Here, we apply a method to correct the eddy current effect for precision
measurement of the magnetic field. We first record the three-body loss
influenced by the effect of induced eddy current, then use a certain model to
obtain the time constant of the actual magnetic field by fitting the atom loss.
This precisely determines the actual magnetic field according to the time
response of the three-body loss. After that, we implement the desired magnetic
field to the atoms so that we can analyze the three-body loss across the whole
narrow Feshbach resonance. The results show that the three-body recombination
is the dominated loss mechanism near the resonance. We expect this practical
method of correcting the eddy current error of the magnetic field can be
further applied to the future studies of quantum few- and many-body physics
near a narrow Feshbach resonance.

whether a given partially oriented graph can be completed to an oriented graph
in the class by orienting the unoriented edges of the partially oriented graph.
Orientation completion problems have been studied recently for several classes
of oriented graphs, yielding both polynomial time solutions as well as
NP-completeness results. Local tournaments are a well-structured class of
oriented graphs that generalize tournaments and their underlying graphs are
intimately related to proper circular-arc graphs. According to Skrien, a
connected graph can be oriented as a local tournament if and only if it is a
proper circular-arc graph. Proper interval graphs are precisely the graphs
which can be oriented as acyclic local tournaments. It has been proved that the
orientation completion problems for the classes of local tournaments and
acyclic local tournaments are both polynomial time solvable. In this paper we
characterize the partially oriented graphs that can be completed to local
tournaments by determining the complete list of obstructions. These are in a
sense minimal partially oriented graphs that cannot be completed to local
tournaments. The result may be viewed as an extension of the well-known
forbidden subgraph characterization of proper circular-arc graphs obtained by
Tucker. The complete list of obstructions for acyclic local tournament
orientation completions has been given in a companion paper.

the ever-evolving Web data and new emerging categories, instead of the
laborious supervised setting, in this paper, we focus on the
minimally-supervised setting that aims to categorize documents effectively,
with a couple of seed documents annotated per category. We recognize that texts
collected from the Web are often structure-rich, i.e., accompanied by various
metadata. One can easily organize the corpus into a text-rich network, joining
raw text documents with document attributes, high-quality phrases, label
surface names as nodes, and their associations as edges. Such a network
provides a holistic view of the corpus' heterogeneous data sources and enables
a joint optimization for network-based analysis and deep textual model
training. We therefore propose a novel framework for minimally supervised
categorization by learning from the text-rich network. Specifically, we jointly
train two modules with different inductive biases -- a text analysis module for
text understanding and a network learning module for class-discriminative,
scalable network learning. Each module generates pseudo training labels from
the unlabeled document set, and both modules mutually enhance each other by
co-training using pooled pseudo labels. We test our model on two real-world
datasets. On the challenging e-commerce product categorization dataset with 683
categories, our experiments show that given only three seed documents per
category, our framework can achieve an accuracy of about 92%, significantly
outperforming all compared methods; our accuracy is only less than 2% away from

continuum at lambda ~ 878 um. Dust polarization is detected within ~ 44 au of
the central source, where a rotationally supported disk has formed. The
polarized emission forms V-shaped structures opening to the east and probably
west arising from the disk surfaces and arm structures further away in the east
and west that could be due to potential spiral arms excited in the outer disk.
The polarization orientations are mainly parallel to the minor axis of the
disk, with some in the western part tilting slightly away from the minor axis
to form a concave shape with respect to the center. This tilt of polarization
orientations is expected from dust self-scattering, e.g., by 50-75 um grains in
a young disk. The polarized intensity and polarization degree both peak near
the central source with a small dip at the central source and decrease towards
the edges. These decreases of polarized intensity and polarization degree are
expected from dichroic extinction by grains aligned by poloidal fields, but may
also be consistent with dust self-scattering if the grain size decreases toward
the edges. It is possible that both mechanisms are needed to produce the
observed dust polarization, suggesting the presence of both grain growth and
poloidal fields in the disk.

identification fail to find sufficient BCs and general BCs which cover more
combinations of circumstances. From the BCs found by these existing approaches,
we have observed an interesting phenomenon that there are some pairs of BCs are
similar in formula structure, which occurs frequently in the experimental
cases. In other words, once a BC is found, a new BC may be discovered quickly
by slightly changing the former. It inspires us to develop a local search
algorithm named LOGION to find BCs, in which the structural similarity is
captured by the neighborhood relation of formulae. Based on structural
similarity, LOGION can find a lot of BCs in a short time. Moreover, due to the
large number of BCs identified, it potentially selects more general BCs from
them. By taking experiments on a set of cases, we show that LOGION effectively
exploits the structural similarity of BCs. We also compare our algorithm
against the two state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results show that
LOGION produces one order of magnitude more BCs than the state-of-the-art
approaches and confirm that LOGION finds out more general BCs thanks to a large

trajectories of particles crossing the telescope, while the WCD measures their

angular resolution of 32 mrad for an inter-panel distance of 2.5 m. The spatial
resolution can reach $\sim$25.6 m assuming an 800 m distance to the target. The
WCD measures the deposited energy from 50 MeV to 1.5 GeV with a resolution of
0.72 MeV.
  MuTe discriminates muography background sources such as: upward coming muons,
scattered muons, the soft component of Extensive Air Showers (EAS), and
particles arriving simultaneously. They are filtered by using measurements of
deposited energy (WCD) and Time-of-Flight. The WCD differentiates single muons,
electrons/positrons, and multiparticle events. On the other hand, the ToF
measurements allow us to estimate the muon momentum establishing an energy
threshold to decrease the background contribution of scattered muons. Upward
coming muons are rejected by means of the particle arrival direction determined
by the ToF sign.
  We concluded that near 36% of the recorded events belong to the
electromagnetic component (electrons and positrons), roughly 30.4% is caused by
multiple particle events that arrive with time differences < 100 ns and the
last 34% are caused by muons. The muonic soft component (< 1 GeV/c) represents

Since several connected devices work together as a coordinated unit to ensure
efficiency and automation, the individual operations they perform are often
reliant on each other. Therefore, it is important to control what functions or
activities different devices can perform at a particular moment of time, and
how they are related to each other. It is also important to consider additional
factors such as conditions, obligation or mutability of activities, which are
critical in deciding whether or not a device can perform a requested activity.

discuss the notion of activity with respect to the collaborative and

bismuth. However, the conventional semi-empirical approach of adapting bulk
bismuth hoppings fails to capture the topological features of two-dimensional
bismuth allotropes because the electronic band topology is heavily influenced
by crystalline symmetries as well as atom spacings. Here we provide a new

can successfully reproduce the band structures, symmetries and topological
features of these two-dimensional allotropes. We anticipate that these models
can be extended to other similar two-dimensional topological structures such as
antimonene and arsenene. Moreover, these models can serve as a starting point

variability caused by physiological differences in the vocal tract. The dearth
of publicly available datasets makes the task more challenging. In this work,
we propose a feature adaptation approach by exploiting adversarial multi-task
training to minimize acoustic mismatch at the senone (tied triphone states)
level between adult and child speech and leverage large amounts of transcribed
adult speech. We validate the proposed method on three tasks: child speech
recognition, child pronunciation assessment, and child fluency score
prediction. Empirical results indicate that our proposed approach consistently
outperforms competitive baselines, achieving 7.7% relative error reduction on
speech recognition and up to 25.2% relative gains on the evaluation tasks.

whether there exist sorting circuits of size $o(n \log n)$. A recent work by
Asharov, Lin, and Shi (SODA'21) showed that if the elements to be sorted have
short keys whose length $k = o(\log n)$, then one can indeed overcome the
$n\log n$ barrier for sorting circuits, by leveraging non-comparison-based
techniques. More specifically, Asharov et al.~showed that there exist $O(n)
\cdot \min(k, \log n)$-sized sorting circuits for $k$-bit keys, ignoring
$poly\log^*$ factors. Interestingly, the recent works by Farhadi et al.
(STOC'19) and Asharov et al. (SODA'21) also showed that the above result is
essentially optimal for every key length $k$, assuming that the famous Li-Li
network coding conjecture holds. Note also that proving any {\it unconditional}
super-linear circuit lower bound for a wide class of problems is beyond the
reach of current techniques.
  Unfortunately, the approach taken by Asharov et al.~to achieve optimality in
size somewhat crucially relies on sacrificing the depth: specifically, their
circuit is super-{\it poly}logarithmic in depth even for 1-bit keys. Asharov et
al.~phrase it as an open question how to achieve optimality both in size and
depth. In this paper, we close this important gap in our understanding. We
construct a sorting circuit of size $O(n) \cdot \min(k, \log n)$ (ignoring
$poly\log^*$ terms) and depth $O(\log n)$. To achieve this, our approach
departs significantly from the prior works. Our result can be viewed as a
generalization of the landmark result by Ajtai, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi
(STOC'83), simultaneously in terms of size and depth. Specifically, for $k =
o(\log n)$, we achieve asymptotical improvements in size over the AKS sorting
circuit, while preserving optimality in depth.

generic vantage point. Unlike most existing work that has focused on recovering
a low-rank matrix from a subset of the entries with specified values, the only
information available here is just the pattern (i.e., positions) of observed
entries. To be precise, given is an $n\times m$ pattern matrix ($n\le m$) whose
entries take fixed zero, unknown generic values, and missing values that are
free to be chosen from the complex field, the question of interest is whether
there is a matrix completion with rank no more than $n-k$ ($k\ge 1$) for almost
all values of the unknown generic entries, which is called the generic low-rank
matrix completion (GLRMC) associated with $({\cal M},k)$, and abbreviated as
GLRMC$({\cal M},k)$. Leveraging an elementary tool from the theory on systems
of polynomial equations, we give a simple proof for genericity of this problem,
which was first observed by $Kir\'aly et al.$, that is, depending on the
pattern of the observed entries, the answer is either yes or no, for almost all
realizations of the unknown generic entries. We provide necessary and
sufficient conditions ensuring feasibility of GLRMC$({\cal M},1)$. Aso, we
provide a sufficient condition and a necessary condition (which we conjecture
to be sufficient too) for the general case (i.e., $k\ge 1$). In the following,
two randomized algorithms are presented to determine upper and lower bounds for
the generic minimum completion rank. Our approaches are based on the algebraic
geometry theory, and a novel basis preservation principle discovered herein.
Finally, numerical simulations are given to corroborate the theoretical
findings and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

solving multi-agent games with two unique features: (1) The agents are
inherently asymmetric and partitioned into leaders and followers; (2) The
agents have different reward functions, thus the game is general-sum. The
majority of existing results in this field focuses on either symmetric solution
concepts (e.g. Nash equilibrium) or zero-sum games. It remains open how to
learn the Stackelberg equilibrium -- an asymmetric analog of the Nash
equilibrium -- in general-sum games efficiently from noisy samples.
  This paper initiates the theoretical study of sample-efficient learning of
the Stackelberg equilibrium, in the bandit feedback setting where we only
observe noisy samples of the reward. We consider three representative
two-player general-sum games: bandit games, bandit-reinforcement learning
(bandit-RL) games, and linear bandit games. In all these games, we identify a
fundamental gap between the exact value of the Stackelberg equilibrium and its
estimated version using finitely many noisy samples, which can not be closed
information-theoretically regardless of the algorithm. We then establish sharp
positive results on sample-efficient learning of Stackelberg equilibrium with
value optimal up to the gap identified above, with matching lower bounds in the
dependency on the gap, error tolerance, and the size of the action spaces.
Overall, our results unveil unique challenges in learning Stackelberg
equilibria under noisy bandit feedback, which we hope could shed light on
future research on this topic.

generation. The sampling process of these models, however, does not allow
interruptions and cannot adapt to real-time computational resources. This
challenge impedes the deployment of powerful autoregressive models, which
involve a slow sampling process that is sequential in nature and typically
scales linearly with respect to the data dimension. To address this difficulty,
we propose a new family of autoregressive models that enables anytime sampling.
Inspired by Principal Component Analysis, we learn a structured representation
space where dimensions are ordered based on their importance with respect to
reconstruction. Using an autoregressive model in this latent space, we trade
off sample quality for computational efficiency by truncating the generation
process before decoding into the original data space. Experimentally, we
demonstrate in several image and audio generation tasks that sample quality
degrades gracefully as we reduce the computational budget for sampling. The
approach suffers almost no loss in sample quality (measured by FID) using only
60\% to 80\% of all latent dimensions for image data. Code is available at

keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however,
do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For
example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones
first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity
and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable
generative model, called~\textit{Apex}, that uses an algorithm borrowed from
automatic control (namely, a variant of the \textit{proportional, integral, and
derivative (PID) controller}) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy
trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing \textit{Apex} to control both (i) the
order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords
and their order), and (ii) the trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Evaluation results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms existing generative models in terms of diversity and relevance.
Apex is currently deployed to generate production descriptions and item

  We present a novel Transformer-based learning framework (V2W-BERT) in this

group equivariant convolutional neural networks. Much of this work has been

the scaling symmetry of $\mathbf R^d$ and rotational symmetry of the sphere. In
this work, we demonstrate that group equivariant convolutional operations can
naturally be incorporated into learned reconstruction methods for inverse
problems that are motivated by the variational regularisation approach. Indeed,
if the regularisation functional is invariant under a group symmetry, the
corresponding proximal operator will satisfy an equivariance property with

learned iterative methods in which the proximal operators are modelled as group

galaxies is detected as diffuse X-ray emission. The X-ray spectra from the CGM
depend on the temperature and metallicity of the emitting plasma, providing
important information about the feeding and feedback of the galaxy. The
observed spectra are commonly fitted using simple 1-Temperature (1-T) or 2-T
models. However, the actual temperature distribution of the gas can be complex
because of the interaction between galactic outflows and halo gas. Here we
demonstrate this by analysing 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the CGM with a
realistic outflow model. We investigate the physical properties of the
simulated hot CGM, which shows a broad distribution in density, temperature,
and metallicity. By constructing and fitting the simulated spectra, we show
that, while the 1-T and 2-T models are able to fit the synthesized spectra
reasonably well, the inferred temperature(s) does not bear much physical
meaning. Instead, we propose a log-normal distribution as a more physical
model. The log-normal model better fits the simulated spectra while reproducing
the gas temperature distribution. We also show that when the star formation
rate is high, the spectra inside the bi-conical outflows are distinct from that
outside, as outflows are generally hotter and more metal-enriched. Finally, we
produce mock spectra for future missions with the eV-level spectral resolution,
such as Athena, Lynx, HUBS and XRISM.

the Bayesian evidence and hence on Bayesian model comparisons when data provide
only a one-sided bound on a parameter. We investigate two particular examples:
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of primordial perturbations and the mass of
individual neutrinos $m_\nu$, using the cosmic microwave background temperature
and polarisation data from Planck 2018 and the NuFIT 5.0 data from neutrino
oscillation experiments. We argue that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, also
called the relative entropy, mathematically quantifies the Occam penalty. We
further show how the Bayesian evidence stays invariant upon changing the lower
prior bound of an upper constrained parameter. While a uniform prior on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio disfavours the $r$-extension compared to the base LCDM
model with odds of about 1:20, switching to a logarithmic prior renders both
models essentially equally likely. LCDM with a single massive neutrino is
favoured over an extension with variable neutrino masses with odds of 20:1 in
case of a uniform prior on the lightest neutrino mass, which decreases to
roughly 2:1 for a logarithmic prior. For both prior options we get only a very
slight preference for the normal over the inverted neutrino hierarchy with
Bayesian odds of about 3:2 at most.

decision-making. At present, the mainstream RL algorithms are data-driven,
relying on millions of iterations and a large number of empirical data to learn
a policy. Although data-driven RL may have excellent asymptotic performance, it
usually yields slow convergence speed. As a comparison, model-driven RL employs
a differentiable transition model to improve convergence speed, in which the
policy gradient (PG) is calculated by using the backpropagation through time
(BPTT) technique. However, such methods suffer from numerical instability,
model error sensitivity and low computing efficiency, which may lead to poor
policies. In this paper, a mixed policy gradient (MPG) method is proposed,
which uses both empirical data and the transition model to construct the PG, so
as to accelerate the convergence speed without losing the optimality guarantee.
MPG contains two types of PG: 1) data-driven PG, which is obtained by directly
calculating the derivative of the learned Q-value function with respect to
actions, and 2) model-driven PG, which is calculated using BPTT based on the
model-predictive return. We unify them by revealing the correlation between the
upper bound of the unified PG error and the predictive horizon, where the
data-driven PG is regraded as 0-step model-predictive return. Relying on that,
MPG employs a rule-based method to adaptively adjust the weights of data-driven
and model-driven PGs. In particular, to get a more accurate PG, the weight of
the data-driven PG is designed to grow along the learning process while the
other to decrease. Besides, an asynchronous learning framework is proposed to
reduce the wall-clock time needed for each update iteration. Simulation results
show that the MPG method achieves the best asymptotic performance and
convergence speed compared with other baseline algorithms.

mass--metallicity relation at a sequence of epochs in cosmic history, to track
the evolving mass--metallicity relation with time. Through comparison with
observations of gas-phase metallicity over a large range of redshifts, we show
that, remarkably, our forensic SED analysis has produced an evolving
mass--metallicity relationship that is consistent with observations at all
epochs. We additionally analyse the three dimensional mass--metallicity--SFR
space, showing that galaxies occupy a clearly defined plane. This plane is
shown to be subtly evolving, displaying an increased tilt with time caused by
general enrichment, and also the slowing down of star formation with cosmic
time. This evolution is most apparent at lookback times greater than 7 Gyr. The
trends in metallicity recovered in this work highlight that the evolving

reasonable metallicity results over the history of a galaxy. This is expected
to provide a significant improvement to the accuracy of the SED fitting

self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We give a simple and direct Fokker-Planck
derivation of dynamical friction, new in the case of DDM and reproducing
previous results in the literature for ULDM and cold DM. ULDM, DDM and SIDM
were considered in the past as leading to cores in dSphs, a feature that acts
to suppress dynamical friction and prolong GC orbits. For DDM we derive a
version of the cosmological free streaming limit that is independent of the DM
production mechanism, finding that DDM cannot produce an appreciable core in
Fornax without violating Ly-$\alpha$ limits. If the Ly-$\alpha$ limit is
discounted for some reason, then stellar kinematics data does allow a DDM core
which could prolong GC orbits. For SIDM we find that significant prolongation
of GC orbits could be obtained for values of the self-interaction cross section
considered in previous works. In addition to reassessing the inspiral time
using updated observational data, we give a new perspective on the so-called GC
timing problem, demonstrating that for a cuspy cold DM profile dynamical
friction predicts a $z=0$ radial distribution for the innermost GCs that is
independent of initial conditions. The observed orbits of Fornax GCs are
consistent with this expectation with a mild apparent fine-tuning at the level
of $\sim25\%$.

multi-speaker speech separation and recognition in both single-channel and
multichannel conditions. However, severe performance degradation is still
observed in the reverberant and noisy scenarios, and there is still a large
performance gap between anechoic and reverberant conditions. In this work, we
focus on the multichannel multi-speaker reverberant condition, and propose to
extend our previous framework for end-to-end dereverberation, beamforming, and
speech recognition with improved numerical stability and advanced frontend
subnetworks including voice activity detection like masks. The techniques
significantly stabilize the end-to-end training process. The experiments on the
spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus show that the proposed system achieves about 35%
WER relative reduction compared to our conventional multi-channel E2E ASR
system, and also obtains decent speech dereverberation and separation
performance (SDR=12.5 dB) in the reverberant multi-speaker condition while
trained only with the ASR criterion.

targets at automatically describing an image with an informative and coherent
sentence. To generate the captions, the previous encoder-decoder frameworks
directly forward the visual vectors to the recurrent language model, forcing
the recurrent units to generate a sentence based on the visual features.
Although these sentences are generally readable, they still suffer from the
lack of details and highlights, due to the fact that the substantial gap
between the image and text modalities is not sufficiently addressed. In this
work, we explicitly build a Modality Transition Module (MTM) to transfer visual
features into semantic representations before forwarding them to the language
model. During the training phase, the modality transition network is optimised
by the proposed modality loss, which compares the generated preliminary textual
encodings with the target sentence vectors from a pre-trained text
auto-encoder. In this way, the visual vectors are transited into the textual
subspace for more contextual and precise language generation. The novel MTM can
be incorporated into most of the existing methods. Extensive experiments have
been conducted on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework, improving the performance by 3.4% comparing to the

performance of applications running on multi-core architectures. With workload
consolidation this becomes increasingly challenging due to shared resource

contention and reduce the average memory access time. However, existing
proposals only employ a single or a subset of these techniques and are
therefore not able to exploit the full potential of coordinated management of

application performance, in several cases, is sensitive to prefetching, cache

together provides higher performance potential during workload consolidation as
it enables more resource trade-offs. In this paper, we propose CBP a
coordination mechanism for dynamically managing prefetching throttling, cache

improve performance. CBP works by employing individual resource managers to
determine the appropriate setting for each resource and a coordinating
mechanism in order to enable inter-resource trade-offs. Our evaluation on a

impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet,
obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling
function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple
sum or average over all node representations considers all node features
equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural
dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,
on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs
that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally
preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of
existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as
a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph
structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head
attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between
nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies
both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as
powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods
can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for
hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph
classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains
even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.

fireballs in seismic time series data recorded by the Australian National
Seismograph Network (ANSN). This corresponds to 1.8% of surveyed fireballs, at
the kinetic energy range of 10$^6$ to 10$^{10}$ J. The peaks observed in the
seismic time series data were consistent with calculated arrival times of the
direct airwave or ground-coupled Rayleigh wave caused by shock waves by the
fireball in the atmosphere (either due to fragmentation or the passage of the
Mach cone). Our work suggests that identification of fireball events in the
seismic time series data depends both on physical properties of a fireball
(such as fireball energy and entry angle in the atmosphere) and the sensitivity
of a seismic instrument. This work suggests that fireballs are likely
detectable within 200 km direct air distance between a fireball and seismic
station, for sensors used in the ANSN. If each DFN observatory had been
accompanied by a seismic sensor of similar sensitivity, 50% of surveyed
fireballs could have been detected. These statistics justify the future
consideration of expanding the DFN camera network into the seismic domain.

involving any training and eliminate a drastic portion of the search cost? We
provide an affirmative answer, by proposing a novel framework called
training-free neural architecture search (TE-NAS). TE-NAS ranks architectures
by analyzing the spectrum of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and the number of
linear regions in the input space. Both are motivated by recent theory advances
in deep networks and can be computed without any training and any label. We
show that: (1) these two measurements imply the trainability and expressivity
of a neural network; (2) they strongly correlate with the network's test
accuracy. Further on, we design a pruning-based NAS mechanism to achieve a more
flexible and superior trade-off between the trainability and expressivity
during the search. In NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces, TE-NAS completes
high-quality search but only costs 0.5 and 4 GPU hours with one 1080Ti on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively. We hope our work inspires more attempts in
bridging the theoretical findings of deep networks and practical impacts in

the isogeometric matrix to minimize the computational cost. These
preconditioners use a diagonal-scaled Kronecker product of univariate
parametric mass matrices; they have a robust performance with respect to the

their application is faster than a matrix-vector product involving the

achieved at the cost of expensive computational resources and huge labor
tuning. Data-driven techniques make efforts to reduce the computation

synthesize fitted garments which cannot be applied to general cloth. Another
type of methods adds details to the coarse meshes without such restrictions.
However, existing works usually utilize coordinate-based representations which
cannot cope with large-scale deformation, and requires dense vertex
correspondences between coarse and fine meshes. Moreover, as such methods only
add details, they require coarse meshes to be close to fine meshes, which can
be either impossible, or require unrealistic constraints when generating fine
meshes. To address these challenges, we develop a temporally and spatially
as-consistent-as-possible deformation representation (named TS-ACAP) and a
DeformTransformer network to learn the mapping from low-resolution meshes to
detailed ones. This TS-ACAP representation is designed to ensure both spatial
and temporal consistency for sequential large-scale deformations from cloth
animations. With this representation, our DeformTransformer network first
utilizes two mesh-based encoders to extract the coarse and fine features,
respectively. To transduct the coarse features to the fine ones, we leverage
the Transformer network that consists of frame-level attention mechanisms to
ensure temporal coherence of the prediction. Experimental results show that our
method is able to produce reliable and realistic animations in various datasets

based on ordinary differential equations (NLME-ODEs). The method presented here
aims at regularizing the estimation problem in presence of model
misspecifications, practical identifiability issues and unknown initial
conditions. For doing so, we define our estimator as the minimizer of a cost
function which incorporates a possible gap between the assumed model at the
population level and the specific individual dynamic. The cost function
computation leads to formulate and solve optimal control problems at the
subject level. This control theory approach allows to bypass the need to know
or estimate initial conditions for each subject and it regularizes the
estimation problem in presence of poorly identifiable parameters. Comparing to
maximum likelihood, we show on simulation examples that our method improves
estimation accuracy in possibly partially observed systems with unknown initial
conditions or poorly identifiable parameters with or without model error. We
conclude this work with a real application on antibody concentration data after
vaccination against Ebola virus coming from phase 1 trials. We use the
estimated model discrepancy at the subject level to analyze the presence of
model misspecification.

processes with concise yet well-generalized mathematical expressions. A
well-modeled Hamiltonian makes it easy for researchers to analyze and forecast
many related phenomena that are governed by the same physical law. However, in
general, identifying a functional or shared expression of the Hamiltonian is
very difficult. It requires carefully designed experiments and the researcher's
insight that comes from years of experience. We propose that meta-learning
algorithms can be potentially powerful data-driven tools for identifying the
physical law governing Hamiltonian systems without any mathematical assumptions

the same physical law. We show that a well meta-trained learner can identify
the shared representation of the Hamiltonian by evaluating our method on

solve well-known causal decision making and prediction problems associated with
those real-world applications. Recently, recursive causal discovery algorithms
have gained particular attention among the research community due to their
ability to provide good results by using Conditional Independent (CI) tests in
smaller sub-problems. However, each of such algorithms needs a refinement
function to remove undesired causal relations of the discovered graphs.
Notably, with the increase of the problem size, the computation cost (i.e., the
number of CI-tests) of the refinement function makes an algorithm expensive to
deploy in practice. This paper proposes a generic causal structure refinement
strategy that can locate the undesired relations with a small number of
CI-tests, thus speeding up the algorithm for large and complex problems. We
theoretically prove the correctness of our algorithm. We then empirically
evaluate its performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of
solution quality and completion time in synthetic and real datasets.

$kR$~$\sim$ 0.65 between droplet size and driving frequency that leads to a
3-fold pressure amplification inside the droplet. Classical nucleation theory
shows that this pressure amplification increases the nucleation rate by several

Such spacetimes are generalizations of spherically symmetric black hole
spacetimes where the central mass can vary with time, like in black hole
collapse or black hole evaporation. These spacetimes possess in general no
timelike Killing vector field, but admit a Kodama vector field which provides a
replacement. Spherically symmetric spacelike cross-sections of the outer
trapping horizon define in- and outgoing lightlike congruences. We investigate
a scaling limit of Hadamard 2-point functions of a quantum field on the
spacetime onto the ingoing lightlike congruence. The scaling limit 2-point
function has a universal form and a thermal spectrum with respect to the
time-parameter of the Kodama flow, where the inverse temperature is related to
the surface gravity of the horizon cross-section in the same way as in the
Hawking effect for an asymptotically static black hole. Similarly, the
tunneling probability in the scaling limit between in- and outgoing Fourier
modes with respect to the the Kodama time shows a thermal distribution with the
same inverse temperature, determined by the surface gravity. This can be seen
as a local counterpart of the Hawking effect for a dynamical horizon in the
scaling limit. The scaling limit 2-point function as well as the 2-point
functions of coherent states of the scaling-limit-theory have relative
entropies behaving proportional to the cross-sectional horizon area. Thereby,
we establish a local counterpart, and microscopic interpretation in the setting

set (e.g., pairwise comparisons, similar/dissimilar pairs, or ancestry
structure of triples of points), and the goal is to aggregate this information
into a global structure (e.g., a ranking, a clustering, or a hierarchical

problems such as rank aggregation, correlation clustering, and hierarchical

  We study these problems on stochastic instances with a hidden embedded ground

uses the maximum cut problem in graphs to approximately solve these problems.
Using this technique, we can often get approximation guarantees in the
stochastic setting that are better than the known worst case inapproximability

blowups of the irregular-shaped fluids with vacuum (molecular clouds) comes
from the initial irregular configurations of its density (multiple centers of
gravity). This inevitably causes far more complicated movements during the
evolution than the one with spherical symmetry. The spherical symmetric case
has been well studied. However, for the non-spherical symmetric case with the
gravity, it is very rare in the references due to a very complicate nonlinear
interaction between the gravity and the fluids. This article concludes, under
the admissible data (i.e., large scale, irregularly-shaped, expanding and
rotational molecular clouds), the developments of the solution (molecular
clouds) are either global (the first class) with near-boundary mass accretions
(leads to star formations), or blowup at finite time. In addition, certain
singularities can be removed from the boundary if the data is strongly
admissible. This paper partially answers Makino's conjecture [37] in 1992 on
the finite time blowup of any tame solution without symmetries for some data

established in the companion article [30].

origin. So far several hundred events have been detected, mostly at
extragalactic distances, and this number is expected to grow significantly over
the next years. The radio signals from the burst experience dispersion as they
travel through the free electrons along the line-of-sight characterised by the
dispersion measure (DM) of the radio pulse. In addition, each photon also
experiences a gravitational Shapiro time delay while travelling through the
potentials generated by the large-scale structure. If the equivalence principle
(EP) holds, the Shapiro delay is the same for photons of all frequencies. In
case the EP is broken, one would expect an additional dispersion to occur which
could be either positive or negative for individual sources. Here we suggest to
use angular statistics of the DM fluctuations to put constraints on the EP
parametrized by the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$. Previous studies suffer
from the problem that the gravitational potential responsible for the delay
diverges in a cosmological setting, which our approach avoids. We carry out a
forecast for a population of FRBs observable within the next years and show
that any significant detection of the DM angular power spectrum will place
constraints on the EP that are by a few orders of magnitude more stringent than
current limits.

the techniques, the roles involved, and the challenges associated to the
process. Method. We conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24
practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies. Results. We found that
group interaction techniques, including meetings and workshops, are the most
popular type of elicitation techniques that are employed by the practitioners,
except in the case of small projects. We noted that customers are frequently
involved in the elicitation process, except in the case of market-driven
organizations. Technical staff (for example, developers and architects) are
more frequently involved in the elicitation process compared to the involvement
of business- or strategic staff. Finally, we identified a number of challenges
with respect to stakeholders. These challenges include difficulties in
understanding and prioritizing their needs. Further, it was noted that
requirements instability (i.e., caused by changing needs or priorities) was a
predominant challenge. These observations need to be interpreted in the context
of the study. Conclusion. The relevant observations regarding the survey

that should be analyzed in the practitioners' context. Researchers may find
evidence for the use of academic results in practice, thereby inspiring future

Such applications involve running test suite against a large number of program
mutants leading to poor scalability. Much research has been aimed at speeding
up this process, focusing on reducing the number of mutants, the number of
executed tests, or the execution time of the mutants. This paper presents a
novel approach, named MeMu, for reducing the execution time of the mutants, by
memoizing the most expensive methods in the system. Memoization is an
optimization technique that allows bypassing the execution of expensive
methods, when repeated inputs are detected. MeMu can be used in conjunction
with existing acceleration techniques. We implemented MeMu on top of PITest, a
well-known JVM bytecode-level mutation analysis system, and obtained, on
average, an 18.15% speed-up over PITest, in the execution time of the mutants
for 12 real-world programs. These promising results and the fact that MeMu
could also be used for other applications that involve repeated execution of
tests (e.g., automatic program repair and regression testing), strongly support
future research for improving its efficiency.

witness. We also extend the scheme to the situation of two degrees of freedom,
first constructing a hybrid quantum delayed-choice experiment which enables
simultaneous observation of a photon's wave and particle behaviors in different
degrees of freedom, and then proposing a scheme to prepare the single-photon
wave-particle entanglement. This study is not only meaningful to explore the
wave and particle properties of photons, but also provides potential for the
research of the single-particle nonlocality from the perspective of the
wave-particle degree of freedom.

of $R$ so that the difference of labels on adjacent vertices is an element of
the corresponding edge ideal. The set of all generalized splines on a graph $G$

  In this paper, we focus on the freeness of generalized spline modules over
certain graphs with the base ring $R = k[x_1 , \ldots , x_d]$ where $k$ is a
field. We first show the freeness of generalized spline modules on graphs with
no interior edges over $k[x,y]$ such as cycles or a disjoint union of cycles
with free edges. Later, we consider graphs that can be decomposed into disjoint
cycles without changing the isomorphism class of the syzygy modules. Then we
use this decomposition to show that generalized spline modules are free over

  This paper presents getsf, a new method for extracting sources and filaments
in astronomical images using separation of their structural components,
designed to handle multiwavelength sets of images and very complex filamentary
backgrounds. The method spatially decomposes the original images and separates
the structural components of sources and filaments from each other and from
their backgrounds, flattening their resulting images. It spatially decomposes
the flattened components, combines them over wavelengths, detects the positions
of sources and skeletons of filaments, and measures the detected sources and
filaments. This paper presents a realistic multiwavelength set of simulated
benchmark images that can serve as the standard benchmark problem to evaluate
qualities of source- and filament-extraction methods.
  This paper describes hires, an improved algorithm for the derivation of
high-resolution surface densities from the multiwavelength far-infrared
Herschel images. The algorithm allows creating the surface densities with
angular resolutions that reach 5.6 arcsec, when the 70 micron image is used.
The codes getsf and hires are illustrated by their applications to a variety of
images, from the X-ray domain to the millimeter wavelengths.

enables more relevant semantic features to be trained for semantic-to-visual

fusing visual features from different knowledge domain. The proposed New
Feature Generator (NFG) with adaptive genetic strategy is used to enrich
semantic information on the one hand, and on the other hand it greatly improves
the intersection of visual feature generated by MKFNet and unseen visual

impact on a large number of users that communicate, compute, and store

reliability, security, safe operation, and mitigation of losses in these
increasingly important systems. Recently, the evolution of the software
industry opens up several problems that need to be tackled including (1)
addressing the software evolution due software upgrades, and (2) solving the
cold-start problem, where data from the system of interest is not available. In
this paper, we propose a framework for anomaly detection in log data, as a
major troubleshooting source of system information. To that end, we utilize
pre-trained general-purpose language models to preserve the semantics of log
messages and map them into log vector embeddings. The key idea is that these
representations for the logs are robust and less invariant to changes in the
logs, and therefore, result in a better generalization of the anomaly detection
models. We perform several experiments on a cloud dataset evaluating different
language models for obtaining numerical log representations such as BERT,
GPT-2, and XL. The robustness is evaluated by gradually altering log messages,
to simulate a change in semantics. Our results show that the proposed approach
achieves high performance and robustness, which opens up possibilities for
future research in this direction.

145 cm-1. They have been attributed to the own sample, to oxidation, to the
folding of Brillouin-edge modes onto the zone center, to the existence of a
double resonance, like that of graphene, or to the formation of Te
precipitates. In this paper, we provide arguments to demonstrate that such
bands correspond to clusters or precipitates of trigonal Te in form of nanosize
or microsize grains or layers that are segregated either inside or at the
surface of the samples. Several mechanisms for Te segregation are discussed and
sample heating caused by excessive laser power during Raman scattering
measurements is emphasized. Finally, we show that anomalous Raman modes related
to Se precipitates also occur in selenides, thus providing a general vision for
a better characterization of selenides and tellurides by means of Raman
scattering measurements and for a better understanding of chalcogenides in
general.

jet, or in the close vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at
sub-parsec distances. Gamma rays have to pass through the surrounding massive
stellar cluster which luminous stars can accidentally appear close to the
observer's line of sight. In such a case, soft radiation of massive stars can
create enough target for transient absorption of the gamma rays in multi-GeV to
TeV energy range. We consider the effect of such stellar encounters on the
gamma-ray spectrum produced within the massive stellar cluster surrounding a
central SMBH. We predict characteristic, time-dependent effects on the
gamma-ray spectra due to the encounter with the single luminous star and also
stellar binary system. We conclude that during the encounter, the gamma-ray
spectrum of an active galaxy should steepen at tens of GeV and harden in the
range of hundreds of GeV. As an example, we consider such effects on the
spectra observed from a typical blazar, 1ES\ 1959+650 (in an active state) and
also in the case of a radio galaxy M87 (in a low state). It is shown that
observation of such transient characteristic features in the gamma-ray spectra,
observed from blazars and radio galaxies, lays within the sensitivity of the

modulation by small inertial particles, much denser than the fluid, in
dilute/semi-dilute conditions. We considered three bulk solid mass fractions,
$\Psi=0.34\%$, $3.37\%$ and $33.7\%$, with only the latter two showing
turbulence modulation. The increase of the drag is strong at $\Psi=3.37\%$, but
mild in the densest case. Actually, two distinct regimes of turbulence
modulation emerge: for smaller mass fractions, the turbulence statistics are
weakly affected and the near-wall particle accumulation increases the drag so
the flow appears as a single phase flow at slightly higher Reynolds number.
Conversely, at higher mass fractions, the particles modulate the turbulent
dynamics over the entire flow, and the interphase coupling becomes more
complex. In this case, fluid Reynolds stresses are attenuated, but the inertial
particle dynamics increases the drag via correlated velocity fluctuations
leading to an overall drag increase. Hence, we conclude that, although
particles at high mass fractions reduce the fluid turbulent drag, the solid
phase inertial dynamics may still increase the overall drag. However,
inspection of the streamwise momentum budget in the two-way coupling limit of
vanishing volume fraction, but finite mass fraction, indicates that this trend
could reverse at even higher particle load.

fueled by the highly successful backpropagation of error (BP) algorithm, which
efficiently solves the credit assignment problem in artificial neural networks.
However, it is unlikely that BP is implemented in its usual form within
biological neural networks, because of its reliance on non-local information in
propagating error gradients. Since biological neural networks are capable of
highly efficient learning and responses from BP trained models can be related
to neural responses, it seems reasonable that a biologically viable
approximation of BP underlies synaptic plasticity in the brain.
Gradient-adjusted incremental target propagation (GAIT-prop or GP for short)
has recently been derived directly from BP and has been shown to successfully
train networks in a more biologically plausible manner. However, so far, GP has

plasma-facing components. The classical cosine model representative of the
convective parallel heat flux was coded within the standard finite element code
of the CEA Castem 2000. Two perturbations to the idealised magnetic surfaces
were taken into account: the Shafranov shift and the ripple of the toroidal
magnetic field. The calculation scheme -- named Tokaflu -- was confronted to
previous computations on bottom modular limiters and to experiments on the
inner first wall. The code was used to optimise the shape of future
plasma-facing components in Tore Supra designed for the CIEL project, namely
the toroidal pumped limiter and its neutralisers. Developments are under way to
include the shadowing of the components, other power deposition schemes and
possibly later plasma sections other than circular.

effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art
performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed
radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the
loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and
generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive
sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization
bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware
minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental
results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant
improvement of model generalization performance.

transmission rates. We develop numerical methods to determine the epidemic
threshold, the epidemic probability and epidemic size close to the threshold
for configuration model contact networks with arbitrary degree distribution and
an arbitrary matrix of transmission rates (dependent on transmitting and
receiving node degree). For the special case of separable transmission rates we
obtain analytical expressions for these quantities. We propose a categorization
of spreading processes based on the ratio of the probability of an epidemic and
the expected size of an epidemic, and demonstrate that this ratio has a complex
dependence on the degree distribution and the degree-dependent transmission
rates.
  For scale-free contact networks and transmission rates that are power
functions of transmitting and receiving node degrees, the epidemic threshold
may be finite even when the degree distribution powerlaw exponent is below
$\gamma < 3$. We give an expression, in terms of the degree distribution and
transmission rate exponents, for the limit at which the epidemic threshold
vanishes. We find that the expected epidemic size and the probability of an
epidemic may grow nonlinearly above the epidemic threshold, with exponents that
depend not only on the degree distribution powerlaw exponent, but on the
parameters of the transmission rate degree dependence functions, in contrast to
ordinary directed percolation and previously studied variations of the SIR
model.

initial VPR systems used simple direct image methods or hand-crafted visual

further improving performance through either some form of sequential matcher /

initial single-image based system is still far from perfect, putting
significant pressure on the sequence matching or (in the case of hierarchical

that creates a high performance initial match hypothesis generator using short
learnt sequential descriptors, which enable selective control sequential score
aggregation using single image learnt descriptors. Sequential descriptors are
generated using a temporal convolutional network dubbed SeqNet, encoding short
image sequences using 1-D convolutions, which are then matched against the
corresponding temporal descriptors from the reference dataset to provide an
ordered list of place match hypotheses. We then perform selective sequential

the evolution of laser generated plasma plume in a moderate external magnetic
field (0.13 T) oriented perpendicular to the flow direction of the plasma
plume. The simulation shows that the plasma plume pushes the external magnetic
field lines outward in the direction of the expansion. This leads to
compression and bending of the magnetic field lines.The force resulting from
the change in shape and the density of magnetic field lines opposes the
expansion of the plume. An elliptic layer of shocked plasma is formed at the
plasma/external field interface leaving a cavity in the plume core due to the
outward expansion and the inertia of the plume. As the plasma pressure drops
due to expansion, the imbalance between the magnetic energy and the internal
energy results in the collapse of the cavity. These observations have striking
similarities with the observations of the experiments [Phys. Plasmas 24, 033511
(2017)] performed recently to study the plasma plume expansion in the presence
of an external transverse magnetic field. This similarity indicates that the
physical mechanisms dominantly governing the plasma plume expansion in the
moderate magnetic field are aptly described in the ideal MHD regime. The
studies thus show that the laser generated plasma plume can be utilized to
carry out interesting experiments on MHD phenomena in a simple laboratory set

dramatically exaggerated. Several attempts were made to fix this issue, either
based on simple a posteriori correction or by improving the description of the
liquid introducing bridge terms. By studying two model half reactions in water,

established benchmarks, and each study tends to use its own dataset, motion
visualisation, and evaluation methodology. To address this situation, we
launched the GENEA Challenge, a gesture-generation challenge wherein
participating teams built automatic gesture-generation systems on a common
dataset, and the resulting systems were evaluated in parallel in a large,
crowdsourced user study using the same motion-rendering pipeline. Since
differences in evaluation outcomes between systems now are solely attributable
to differences between the motion-generation methods, this enables benchmarking
recent approaches against one another in order to get a better impression of
the state of the art in the field. This paper reports on the purpose, design,
results, and implications of our challenge.

step toward novel spintronic devices, while seeking desirable materials
exhibiting persistent spin texture (PST) remains a key challenge. The PST is
the property of materials preserving a unidirectional spin orientation in the
momentum space, which has been predicted to support an extraordinarily long
spin lifetime of carriers. Herein, by using first-principles density functional
theory calculations, we report the emergence of the PST in the two-dimensional
(2D) germanium monochalcogenides (GeMC). By considering two stable formations
of the 2D GeMC, namely the pure GeX and Janus Ge2XY monolayers (X, Y = S, Se,
and Te), we observed the PST around the valence band maximum where the spin
orientation is enforced by the lower point group symmetry of the crystal. In
the case of the pure GeX monolayers, we found that the PST is characterized by
fully out-of-plane spin orientation protected by C2v point group, while the
canted PST in the y-z plane is observed in the case of the Janus Ge2XY
monolayers due to the lowering symmetry into Cs point group. More importantly,
we find large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) parameter in which the PST sustains,
which could be effectively tuned by in-plane strain. The large SOC parameter
observed in the present systems leads to the small wavelength of the spatially
periodic mode of the spin polarization, which is promising for short spin
channel in the spin Hall transistor devices.

allows to study the regime of strong interaction between quantized light and
complex matter systems. Due to the coherent coupling between photons and
matter-degrees of freedom, polaritons -- hybrid light-matter quasiparticles --
emerge, which can significantly influence matter properties and complex
processes such as chemical reactions (strong coupling). In this thesis we
propose a way to overcome these problems by reformulating the coupled
electron-photon problem in an exact way in a different, purpose-build Hilbert
space, where no longer electrons and photons are the basic physical entities
but the polaritons. Representing an N-electron-M-mode system by an N-polariton
wave function with hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics, we show explicitly how to turn
electronic-structure methods into polaritonic-structure methods that are
accurate from the weak to the strong-coupling regime. We elucidate this
paradigmatic shift by a comprehensive review of light-matter coupling, as well
as by highlighting the connection between different electronic-structure
methods and quantum-optical models. This extensive discussion accentuates that
the polariton description is not only a mathematical trick, but it is grounded
in a simple and intuitive physical argument: when the excitations of a system
are hybrid entities a formulation of the theory in terms of these new entities
is natural. Finally, we discuss in great detail how to adopt standard
algorithms of electronic-structure methods to adhere to the new hybrid
Fermi-Bose statistics. Guaranteeing the corresponding nonlinear inequality
constraints in practice requires a careful development, implementation and
validation of numerical algorithms. This extra numerical complexity is the
price we pay for making the coupled matter-photon problem feasible for
first-principle methods.

using noise-cleansing methods by detecting the noisy data. Recently,
noise-cleansing methods have been considered as the most competitive
noisy-label learning algorithms. Despite their success, their noisy label
detectors are often based on heuristics more than a theory, requiring a robust
classifier to predict the noisy data with loss values. In this paper, we
propose a novel detector for filtering label noise. Unlike most existing
methods, we focus on each data's latent representation dynamics and measure the
alignment between the latent distribution and each representation using the
eigendecomposition of the data gram matrix. Our framework, coined as filtering
noisy instances via their eigenvectors (FINE), provides a robust detector with
derivative-free simple methods having theoretical guarantees. Under our
framework, we propose three applications of the FINE: sample-selection
approach, semi-supervised learning approach, and collaboration with
noise-robust loss functions. Experimental results show that the proposed
methods consistently outperform corresponding baselines for all three
applications on various benchmark datasets.

into seven equivalence classes with respect to their decision power, i.e. the
properties that the automata of each class can decide. However, Esparza and
Reiter only show (proper) inclusions between the classes, and so do not

not on the structure of the graph. In particular, majority (whether more nodes
carry label $a$ than $b$) is a labelling property. Our results show that only
one of the seven equivalence classes identified by Esparza and Reiter can
decide majority for arbitrary networks. We then study the expressive power of

signals. If the source (and hence its $n$ parameters) are unknown, many filters
must be employed. These form a grid in the $n$-dimensional parameter space,
known as a template bank. It is often convenient to construct these grids as a
lattice. Here, we examine some of the properties of these template banks for
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $A_n^*$ lattices. In particular, we focus on the
distribution of the mismatch function, both in the traditional quadratic
approximation and in the recently-proposed spherical approximation. The
fraction of signals which are lost is determined by the even moments of this
distribution, which we calculate. Many of these quantities we examine have a
simple and well-defined $n\to\infty$ limit, which often gives an accurate
estimate even for small $n$. Our main conclusions are the following: (i) a
fairly effective template-based search can be constructed at mismatch values
that are shockingly high in the quadratic approximation; (ii) the minor
advantage offered by an $A_n^*$ template bank (compared to $\mathbb{Z}^n$) at
small template separation becomes even less significant at large mismatch. So
there is little motivation for using template banks based on the $A_n^*$
lattice.

optical-UV, and X-ray bands that were performed by ATCA, the Neil Gehrels Swift
observatory, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, respectively, and our multi-wavelength
analysis. We study the variability across all energy bands and additionally
produce $\gamma$-ray light curves with different time binnings to study the
variability on short timescales during the flare. We examine the X-ray spectrum
from 0.5$-$50 keV by describing the spectral shape with an absorbed power law.
We analyse multi-wavelength datasets before, during, and after the flare and
compare these with a low activity state of the source by modelling the
respective SEDs with a one-zone synchrotron inverse Compton radiative model.
Finally, we compare our results to gamma-ray flares previously observed from
other $\gamma$-loud NLSy 1 galaxies. At gamma-ray energies (0.1$-$300 GeV) the
flare reached a total maximum flux of
$(2.7\pm0.6)\times10^{-6}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ in 3-hour binning. With a
photon index of $\Gamma_{0.1-300\mathrm{GeV}}=2.42\pm0.09$ during the flare,
this corresponds to an isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of
$(2.9\pm0.8)\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The $\gamma$-ray,
X-ray, and optical-UV light curves covering the end of September to the middle
of November show significant variability, and we find indications for
flux-doubling times of $\sim 2.2$~hours at $\gamma$-ray energies. During the
flare, the SED exhibits large Compton dominance. While the increase in the
optical-UV range can be explained by enhanced synchrotron emission, the
elevated $\gamma$-ray flux can be accounted for by an increase in the bulk
Lorentz factor of the jet, similarly observed for flaring gamma-ray blazars.

sources from a long, partially overlapped recording, which involves a varying
number of speakers. A straightforward extension of conventional utterance-level
speech separation to the CSS task is to segment the long recording with a
size-fixed window and process each window separately. Though effective, this
extension fails to model the long dependency in speech and thus leads to
sub-optimum performance. The recent proposed dual-path modeling could be a
remedy to this problem, thanks to its capability in jointly modeling the
cross-window dependency and the local-window processing. In this work, we
further extend the dual-path modeling framework for CSS task. A
transformer-based dual-path system is proposed, which integrates transform
layers for global modeling. The proposed models are applied to LibriCSS, a real
recorded multi-talk dataset, and consistent WER reduction can be observed in
the ASR evaluation for separated speech. Also, a dual-path transformer equipped

with the one corresponding to the shortest variability time scales displaying
the hardest spectrum. Both the variability spectra and the time-averaged

the presence of (at least) two Comptonization zones with different temperatures

Unfitted finite element methods with ghost-penalty stabilisation are well
suited to fluid-structure-interaction problems as posed by this setting, due to
the flexible and accurate geometry handling and for allowing topology changes

accurate computations of the forces by their boundary integral formulation are
not viable. Furthermore, analytical laws are not available due to the shape of
the particles. However, accurate values of the forces are essential for
realistic motion of the particles. To obtain these forces accurately, we train
an artificial deep neural network using data from prototypical resolved

information which can be obtained accurately in an under-resolved setting. As a
result, we obtain forces on very coarse and under-resolved meshes which are on
average an order of magnitude more accurate compared to the direct
boundary-integral computation from the Navier-Stokes solution, leading to solid
motion comparable to that obtained on highly resolved meshes that would
substantially increase the simulation costs.

of 1.949 days. We combined the TESS data with three ground-based transit
measurements, 57 radial velocity (RV) measurements from CARMENES, and 13 RV
measurements from IRD, determining that the signal is produced by a planet with

MgSiO$_3$-dominated composition. Although the planet would be too hot to
sustain liquid water on its surface (its equilibrium temperature is about
$\sim$595\,K, suggesting a Venus-like atmosphere), spectroscopic metrics based
on the capabilities of the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope and the fact
that the host star is rather inactive indicate that this is one of the most

notion of analytic calculi (i.e. those calculi that support general and modular
proof-strategies for cut elimination), and at identifying classes of logics
that can be captured in terms of these calculi. In this context, Wansing
introduced the notion of proper display calculi as one possible design
framework for proof calculi in which the analiticity desiderata are realized in
a particularly transparent way. Recently, the theory of properly displayable
logics (i.e. those logics that can be equivalently presented with some proper
display calculus) has been developed in connection with generalized Sahlqvist
theory (aka unified correspondence). Specifically, properly displayable logics
have been syntactically characterized as those axiomatized by analytic
inductive axioms, which can be equivalently and algorithmically transformed
into analytic structural rules so that the resulting proper display calculi
enjoy a set of basic properties: soundness, completeness, conservativity, cut
elimination and subformula property. In this context, the proof that the given
calculus is complete w.r.t. the original logic is usually carried out
syntactically, i.e. by showing that a (cut free) derivation exists of each
given axiom of the logic in the basic system to which the analytic structural
rules algorithmically generated from the given axiom have been added. However,
so far this proof strategy for syntactic completeness has been implemented on a
case-by-case base, and not in general. In this paper, we address this gap by
proving syntactic completeness for properly displayable logics in any normal
(distributive) lattice expansion signature. Specifically, we show that for
every analytic inductive axiom a cut free derivation can be effectively
generated which has a specific shape, referred to as pre-normal form.

systems. Phase averaging is a technique to filter fast motions from the
dynamics whilst still accounting for their effect on the slow dynamics. Phase
averaging is useful for deriving reduced models that can be solved numerically
with more efficiency, since larger timesteps can be taken. Recently, Haut and
Wingate (2014) introduced the idea of computing finite window numerical phase
averages in parallel as the basis for a coarse propagator for a
parallel-in-time algorithm. In this contribution, we provide a framework for
higher order phase averages that aims to better approximate the unaveraged
system whilst still filtering fast motions. Whilst the basic phase average
assumes that the solution independent of changes of phase, the higher order
method expands the phase dependency in a basis which the equations are
projected onto. In this new framework, the original numerical phase averaging
formulation arises as the lowest order version of this expansion. Our new
projection onto functions that are $k$th degree polynomials in the phase gives
rise to higher order corrections to the phase averaging formulation. We
illustrate the properties of this method on an ODE that describes the dynamics
of a swinging spring due to Lynch (2002). Although idealized, this model shows
an interesting analogy to geophysical flows as it exhibits a slow dynamics that
arises through the resonance between fast oscillations. On this example, we
show convergence to the non-averaged (exact) solution with increasing
approximation order also for finite averaging windows. At zeroth order, our
method coincides with a standard phase average, but at higher order it is more
accurate in the sense that solutions of the phase averaged model track the
solutions of the unaveraged equations more accurately.

constraints on temporal or spatial changes of fundamental constants in the

concerns model non-uniqueness. The absorption structure is generally
complicated, comprising many blended lines. This characteristic means any given
system can be fitted equally well by many slightly different models, each
having a different value of \alpha, the fine structure constant. We use AI
Monte Carlo modelling to quantify non-uniqueness. Extensive supercomputer
calculations are reported, revealing new systematic effects that guide future
analyses: (i) Whilst higher signal to noise and improved spectral resolution
produces a smaller statistical uncertainty for \alpha, model non-uniqueness
adds a significant additional uncertainty. (ii) Non-uniqueness depends on the
line broadening mechanism used. We show that modelling the spectral data using
turbulent line broadening results in far greater non-uniqueness, hence this
should no longer be done. Instead, for varying \alpha studies, it is important
to use the more physically appropriate compound broadening. (iii) We have
studied two absorption systems in detail. Generalising thus requires caution.
Nevertheless, if non-uniqueness is present in all or most quasar absorption
systems, it seems unavoidable that attempts to determine the existence (or
non-existence) of spacetime variations of fundamental constants is best
approached using a statistical sample.

break the security of the entire system. As shown before, sophisticated
side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks, using chip failure analysis (FA)
techniques, can extract data from on-chip memory cells. However, since the
chip's layout is unknown to the adversary in practice, secret key localization
and reverse engineering are onerous tasks. Consequently, hardware vendors
commonly believe that the ever-growing physical complexity of the integrated
circuit (IC) designs can be a natural barrier against potential adversaries. In
this work, we present a novel approach that can extract the secret key without
any knowledge of the IC's layout, and independent from the employed memory
technology as key storage. We automate the -- traditionally very
labor-intensive -- reverse engineering and data extraction process. To that
end, we demonstrate that black-box measurements captured using laser-assisted
SCA techniques from a training device with known key can be used to profile the
device for a later key prediction on other victim devices with unknown keys. To
showcase the potential of our approach, we target keys on three different
hardware platforms, which are utilized as RoT in different products.

consider finite-time behavior of the engine with and without utilizing a

dynamics of a system follows the adiabatic path, at the expense of introducing
an external control. We compare the performance of the non-adiabatic and STA

irreversibility, as measured by the efficiency lags, due to finite-time driving
is so low that non-adiabatic engine performs quite close to the adiabatic

spare the difficulty of dealing with an external control protocol.

observed matrix, and it is an effective tool for relational data analysis.
Although there are many studies that estimate the underlying bicluster
structure of a matrix, few have enabled us to determine the appropriate number
of biclusters in an observed matrix. Recently, a statistical test on the number
of biclusters has been proposed for a regular-grid bicluster structure, where
we assume that the latent bicluster structure can be represented by row-column
clustering. However, when the latent bicluster structure does not satisfy such
regular-grid assumption, the previous test requires a larger number of
biclusters than necessary (i.e., a finer bicluster structure than necessary)
for the null hypothesis to be accepted, which is not desirable in terms of
interpreting the accepted bicluster structure. In this study, we propose a new
statistical test on the number of biclusters that does not require the
regular-grid assumption and derive the asymptotic behavior of the proposed test
statistic in both null and alternative cases. We illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method by applying it to both synthetic and practical
relational data matrices.

amplification is obtained by tightly focusing the seed into the crystal, rather

analysis. With the immense growth of data and physical limitations on single
processor speed, it is necessary to find efficient parallel algorithms for
clustering tasks. In this paper, we study the problem of correlation clustering
in bounded arboricity graphs with respect to the Massively Parallel Computation
(MPC) model. More specifically, we are given a complete graph where the edges
are either positive or negative, indicating whether pairs of vertices are
similar or dissimilar. The task is to partition the vertices into clusters with
as few disagreements as possible. That is, we want to minimize the number of
positive inter-cluster edges and negative intra-cluster edges.
  Consider an input graph $G$ on $n$ vertices such that the positive edges
induce a $\lambda$-arboric graph. Our main result is a 3-approximation
($\textit{in expectation}$) algorithm to correlation clustering that runs in
$\mathcal{O}(\log \lambda \cdot \textrm{poly}(\log \log n))$ MPC rounds in the
$\textit{strongly sublinear memory regime}$. This is obtained by combining
structural properties of correlation clustering on bounded arboricity graphs
with the insights of Fischer and Noever (SODA '18) on randomized greedy MIS and
the $\texttt{PIVOT}$ algorithm of Ailon, Charikar, and Newman (STOC '05).
Combined with known graph matching algorithms, our structural property also
implies an exact algorithm and algorithms with $\textit{worst case}$
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation guarantees in the special case of forests, where
$\lambda=1$.

evaporation (PAPVD) and plasma pulsed nitriding. By deconvolution of the Raman
spectrum we identified two peaks corresponding to the D and G modes
characteristic of a-C:H. After the N$_2$-H$_2$ plasma treating, the peaks
narrowed and shifted to the right, which we associated with the incorporation
of N into the structure. We compared the sensitivity to the relative humidity
(RH) of the films before and after the N$_2$-H$_2$ plasma treatment. The
nitriding improved the humidity sensitivity measured as the low frequency
resistance.
  By impedance spectroscopy we studied the frequency dependence of the AC
conductivity $\sigma$ at different RH conditions. Before nitriding
$\sigma(\omega)\sim A \omega^s$, it seemed to have the universal behaviour seen
in other amorphous systems. The humidity changed the overall scale $A$. After
nitriding, the exponent $s$ increased, and became RH dependent. We associated
this behaviour to the change of the interaction mechanism between the water
molecule and the substrate when the samples were nitriding.

large-scale MHR problems because the matrix size of the learned mutual
inhibition matrix exhibits quadratic growth with the signal length. These large
matrices consume costly memory/computation resources and require a huge amount
of labeled data for training, restricting the applicability of the LISTA
method. In this paper, we show that the mutual inhibition matrix of a MHR
problem naturally has a Toeplitz structure, which means that the degrees of
freedom (DoF) of the matrix can be reduced from a quadratic order to a linear
order. By exploiting this characteristic, we propose a structured
LISTA-Toeplitz network, which imposes a Toeplitz structure restriction on the
mutual inhibition matrices and applies linear convolution instead of the
matrix-vector multiplication involved in the traditional LISTA network. Both
simulation and field test for air target detection with radar are carried out
to validate the performance of the proposed network. For small-scale MHR
problems, LISTAToeplitz exhibits close or even better recovery accuracy than
traditional LISTA, while the former significantly reduces the network
complexity and requires much less training data. For large-scale MHR problems,

threatened by poaching? It is one of the most controversial ideas in
biodiversity conservation. Perhaps the most convincing reason for legalizing
wildlife trade is that trade revenue could fund the protection and conservation
of poached species. In this paper, we examine the possible poacher-population
dynamic consequences of legal trade funding conservation. The model consists of
a manager scavenging carcasses for wildlife products, who then sells the
products, and directs a portion of the revenue towards funding anti-poaching
law enforcement. Through a global analysis of the model, we derive the critical
proportion of product the manager must scavenge, and the critical proportion of
trade revenue the manager must allocate towards increased enforcement, in order
for legal trade to lead to abundant long-term wildlife populations. We
illustrate how the model could inform management with parameter values derived
from the African elephant literature, under a hypothetical scenario where a
manager scavenges elephant carcasses to sell ivory. We find that there is a
large region of parameter space where populations go extinct under legal trade,
unless a significant portion of trade revenue is directed towards protecting
populations from poaching. The model is general and therefore can be used as a
starting point for exploring the consequences of funding many conservation
programs using wildlife trade revenue.

Birman-Schwinger principle first used by Mathur to derive a general criterion
for the existence of an eigenvalue inside the first gap of the essential

follows in particular that no linear Landau damping can occur in the
neighborhood of steady states satisfying our criterion. Verification of this
criterion requires a good understanding of the so-called period function
associated with each steady state. In the plane symmetric case we verify the
criterion rigorously, while in the spherically symmetric case we do so under a
natural monotonicity assumption for the associated period function. Our results
explain the pulsating behavior triggered by perturbing such steady states,

We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of

motivate Fisher information loss through the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound and delineate

debated; however, geological evidence supports at least two major episodes
where O$_2$ increased by an order of magnitude or more: the Great Oxidation
Event (GOE) and the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event. O$_2$ concentrations have
likely fluctuated (between $10^{-3}$ and $1.5$ times the present atmospheric
level) since the GOE $\sim 2.4$ Gyr ago, resulting in a time-varying ozone
(O$_3$) layer. Using a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model, we simulate
changes in O$_3$ in Earth's atmosphere since the GOE and consider the
implications for surface habitability, and glaciation during the
Mesoproterozoic. We find lower O$_3$ columns (reduced by up to $4.68$ times for
a given O$_2$ level) compared to previous work; hence, higher fluxes of
biologically harmful UV radiation would have reached the surface. Reduced O$_3$
leads to enhanced tropospheric production of the hydroxyl radical (OH) which
then substantially reduces the lifetime of methane (CH$_4$). We show that a
CH$_4$ supported greenhouse effect during the Mesoproterozoic is highly
unlikely. The reduced O$_3$ columns we simulate have important implications for
astrobiological and terrestrial habitability, demonstrating the relevance of
three-dimensional chemistry-climate simulations when assessing paleoclimates

results with values of p derived in the literature suggest that the density
profiles remain unchanged from clump to core scales. The column densities
relative to N(C18O) between pairs of dense gas tracers show tight correlations.
We apply the physical-chemical model MUSCLE to the derived column densities of

obtain the best possible prognosis for the patient. This article identifies
shortcomings associated with qualitative-only evaluation of fracture severity
and provides new quantitative metrics that serve to address these shortcomings.
We propose a system to semi-automatically extract quantitative metrics that are
major indicators of fracture severity. These include: (i) fracture surface
area, i.e., how much surface area was generated when the bone broke apart, and
(ii) dispersion, i.e., how far the fragments have rotated and translated from
their original anatomic positions. This article describes new computational
tools to extract these metrics by computationally reconstructing 3D bone
anatomy from CT images with a focus on tibial plafond fracture cases where
difficult qualitative fracture severity cases are more prevalent.
Reconstruction is accomplished within a single system that integrates several
novel algorithms that identify, extract and piece-together fractured fragments
in a virtual environment. Doing so provides objective quantitative measures for
these fracture severity indicators. The availability of such measures provides
new tools for fracture severity assessment which may lead to improved fracture
treatment. This paper describes the system, the underlying algorithms and the

formation. We explore trends in cloud properties for a sample of five giant gas
planets: WASP-43b, WASP-18b, HAT-P-7b, WASP-103b, and WASP-121b. This provides
a reference frame for cloud properties for the JWST targets WASP-43b and
WASP-121b. We further explore chemically inert tracers to observe geometrical
asymmetries, and if the location of inner boundary of a 3D GCM matters for the
clouds that form. The large day/night temperature differences of ultra-hot
Jupiters cause large chemical asymmetries: cloud-free days but cloudy nights,
atomic vs. molecular gases and respectively different mean molecular weights,
deep thermal ionospheres vs. low-ionised atmospheres, undepleted vs enhanced
C/O. WASP-18b, as the heaviest planet in the sample, has the lowest global C/O.
The global climate may be considered as similar amongst ultra-hot Jupiters, but
different to that of hot gas giants. The local weather, however, is individual
for each planet since the local thermodynamic conditions, and hence the local
cloud and gas properties, differ. The morning and the evening terminator of
ultra-hot Jupiters will carry signatures of their strong chemical asymmetry
such that ingress/egress asymmetries can be expected. An increased C/O ratio is
a clear sign of cloud formation, making cloud modelling a necessity when
utilizing C/O (or other mineral ratios) as tracer for planet formation. The
changing geometrical extension of the atmosphere from the day to the nightside
may be probed through chemically inert species like helium. Ultra-hot Jupiters

effectively following a free energy landscape, such as protein folding, stem
cell differentiation and reprogramming, and social systems involving human

data-points are gathered from a system in (local) equilibrium. The result is a
set of stochastic differential equations which capture the temporal dynamics,
by assuming that groups of data-points are subject to the same free energy
landscape and amount of noise. Our method is a 'baseline' method which
initiates the development of computational models which can be iteratively
enhanced through the inclusion of expert knowledge. We validate the proposed
method against two population-based longitudinal datasets and observe
significant predictive power in comparison with random choice algorithms. We
also show how the predictive power of our 'baseline' model can be enhanced by
incorporating domain expert knowledge. Our method addresses an important

porosity and affect the evolution of the infiltration. We study this problem in
two- and three-dimensional lattices with randomly distributed porous sites at
the critical percolation thresholds and with a border in contact with a
reservoir of an aggressive solute. The solute infiltrates that medium by
diffusion and the reactions with the impermeable sites produce new porous sites
with a probability $r$, which is proportional to the ratio of reaction and
diffusion rates at the scale of a lattice site. Numerical simulations for
$r\ll1$ show initial subdiffusive scaling and long time Fickean scaling of the
infiltrated volumes or areas, but with an intermediate regime with time
increasing rates of infiltration and reaction. The anomalous exponent of the
initial regime agrees with a relation previously applied to infinitely ramified
fractals. We develop a scaling approach that explains the subsequent time
increase of the infiltration rate, the dependence of this rate on $r$, and the
crossover to the Fickean regime. The exponents of the scaling relations depend
on the fractal dimensions of the critical percolation clusters and on the
dimensions of random walks in those clusters. The time increase of the reaction
rate is also justified by that reasoning. As $r$ decreases, there is an
increase in the number of time decades of the intermediate regime, which
suggests that the time increasing rates are more likely to be observed is

optimization problems involving a large number of decision variables, many
attempts have been made to simplify the problem solution space of a given
problem for the evolutionary search. In the literature, the existing approaches
can generally be categorized as decomposition-based methods and
dimension-reduction-based methods. The former decomposes a large-scale problem
into several smaller subproblems, while the latter transforms the original
high-dimensional solution space into a low-dimensional space. However, it is
worth noting that a given large-scale optimization problem may not always be
decomposable, and it is also difficult to guarantee that the global optimum of
the original problem is preserved in the reduced low-dimensional problem space.
This paper thus proposes a new search paradigm, namely the multi-space
evolutionary search, to enhance the existing evolutionary search methods for
solving large-scale optimization problems. In contrast to existing approaches
that perform an evolutionary search in a single search space, the proposed
paradigm is designed to conduct a search in multiple solution spaces that are
derived from the given problem, each possessing a unique landscape. The
proposed paradigm makes no assumptions about the large-scale optimization
problem of interest, such as that the problem is decomposable or that a certain
relationship exists among the decision variables. To verify the efficacy of the
proposed paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies in comparison to four
state-of-the-art algorithms were conducted using the CEC2013 large-scale

The MCS equation of motion derived from this Lagrangian consists of a modified
current, including a chiral magnetic (CM) and an anomalous Hall (AH) current,
in addition to the ordinary Ohm current of resistive magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD). The former consists of an axial chemical potential, which is given in
terms of the temporal comoving derivative of $\Theta$, and the latter arises
from the spatial gradient of $\Theta$. As it turns out, the existence of the
axial chemical potential is a nonequilibrium effect that plays no role in the
linear stability analysis, whereas the AH current arises as in the first-order
linear perturbation of the thermal equilibrium. We analyze the linear stability
and causality of the CSMHD in a resistive and chiral medium. We show that the
Alfven modes propagating sufficiently close to the direction of the magnetic
field are unstable but causal. They are also accompanied by a genuine nonhydro
mode. A stable mode in a particular direction can correspond to an unstable
mode propagating in the exact opposite direction. The AH instability is a
manifestation of a breakdown of the parity. A numerical analysis of the phase
velocity confirms these results.

from restricted diffusion and/or structural disorder - remains a controversial
issue in contemporary diffusion MRI (dMRI). Recently, Correlation Tensor MRI
(CTI) was introduced to disentangle the sources contributing to diffusional
kurtosis, without relying on a-priori assumptions. Here, we aimed to
investigate $\mu K$ in in vivo rat brains and assess its impact on
state-of-the-art methods ignoring $\mu K$. Methods: CTI harnesses double
diffusion encoding (DDE) experiments, which were here improved for speed and
minimal bias using four different sets of acquisition parameters. The
robustness of CTI estimates from the improved protocol is assessed in
simulations. The in vivo CTI acquisitions were performed in healthy rat brains
using a 9.4T pre-clinical scanner equipped with a cryogenic coil, and targeted
the estimation of $\mu K$, anisotropic kurtosis, and isotropic kurtosis.
Results: The improved CTI acquisition scheme substantially reduces scan time
and importantly, also minimizes higher-order-term biases, thus enabling robust
$\mu K$ estimation, alongside Kaniso and Kiso metrics. Our CTI experiments
revealed positive $\mu K$ both in white and grey matter of the rat brain in
vivo; $\mu K$ is the dominant kurtosis source in healthy grey matter tissue.
The non-negligible $\mu K$ substantially biases prior state-of-the-art analyses
of Kiso and Kaniso. Conclusion: Correlation Tensor MRI offers a more accurate
and robust characterization of kurtosis sources than its predecessors. $\mu K$
is non-negligible in vivo in healthy white and grey matter tissues and could be
an important biomarker for future studies. Our findings thus have both
theoretical and practical implications for future experiments.

searches, coherent periodicities originating from accreting neutron star
magnetospheres have been detected only at X-ray energies and in ~10% of the
presently known systems. Here we report the detection of optical and
ultraviolet coherent pulsations at the X-ray period of the transient low mass
X-ray binary system SAX J1808.4-3658, during an accretion outburst that
occurred in August 2019. At the time of the observations, the pulsar was
surrounded by an accretion disc, displayed X-ray pulsations and its luminosity
was consistent with magnetically funneled accretion onto the neutron star.
Current accretion models fail to account for the luminosity of both optical and
ultraviolet pulsations; these are instead more likely driven by
synchro-curvature radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere or just outside of it.
This interpretation would imply that particle acceleration can take place even
when mass accretion is going on, and opens up new perspectives in the study of
coherent optical/UV pulsations from fast spinning accreting neutron stars in

we show that a second-order phase transition is present in this model which is
not captured by first-order mean-field approximations. Moreover, we propose and
explore a modified version of the Maki-Thompson model that includes a
forgetting mechanism. This modification changes the Markov chain's nature from
infinitely many absorbing states in the classical setup to a single absorbing

methods that permit the models' characterization. In particular, we find a
counter-intuitive behavior in the subcritical regime of these models, where the
lifespan of a rumor increases as the spreading rate drops, following a
power-law relationship. This means that, even below the critical threshold,
rumors can survive for a long time. Together, our findings suggest that the

able to express viscosity solutions of linear partial integrodifferental
equations (PIDEs) on state spaces of possibly high dimension $d$. Admissible
PIDEs comprise Kolmogorov equations for high-dimensional diffusion, advection,
and for pure jump L\'{e}vy processes. We prove for such PIDEs arising from a
class of jump-diffusions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that for any suitable measure
$\mu^d$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ there exist constants
$C,{\mathfrak{p}},{\mathfrak{q}}>0$ such that for every $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$
and for every $d\in \mathbb{N}$ the DNN $L^2(\mu^d)$-expression error of
viscosity solutions of the PIDE is of size $\varepsilon$ with DNN size bounded
by $Cd^{\mathfrak{p}}\varepsilon^{-\mathfrak{q}}$.
  In particular, the constant $C>0$ is independent of $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and of
$\varepsilon \in (0,1]$ and depends only on the coefficients in the PIDE and
the measure used to quantify the error. This establishes that ReLU DNNs can
break the curse of dimensionality (CoD for short) for viscosity solutions of
linear, possibly degenerate PIDEs corresponding to suitable Markovian
jump-diffusion processes.
  As a consequence of the employed techniques we also obtain that expectations

stochastic systems on networks is presented and applied to many well-known
compartmental models of epidemiology. The state of the population is described
as a vector in the tensor product space of $N$ individual probability vector
spaces, whose dimension equals the number of compartments of the
epidemiological model $n_c$. The transition rate matrix for the
$n_c^N$-dimensional Markov chain is obtained by taking suitable linear
combinations of tensor products of $n_c$-dimensional matrices. The resulting
transition rate matrix is a sum over bilocal linear operators, which gives
insight in the microscopic dynamics of the system. The more familiar and
non-linear node-based mean-field approximations are recovered by restricting
the exact models to uncorrelated (separable) states. We show how the exact
transition rate matrix for the susceptible-infected (SI) model can be used to
find analytic solutions for SI outbreaks on trees and the cycle graph for
finite $N$.

If the self-interactions of the scalar field are non-zero, a cosmological
constant is generated, which can be potentially quite large. To avoid
fine-tuning at late times, we introduce another scalar field which drives the
classical cosmological constant to zero during inflation. Working in the
Einstein-frame, we find that due to a conserved Noether current the
corresponding three-field inflationary model (consisting of the two scalar
fields plus the scalaron) becomes effectively a two-field model. The prize to
be paid for introducing the field which cancels the classical cosmological
constant at the end of inflation is that the running of the spectral index and
the running of the running can be quite large due to entropy perturbations
during inflation, making the model testable with future cosmological
experiments.

algorithms that can exploit prior knowledge on image formation and assumptions
on the motion. However, these classical methods struggle at incorporating
complex statistics from natural images. Furthermore, VSR has recently benefited
from the improvement brought by deep learning (DL) algorithms. These techniques
can efficiently learn spatial patterns from large collections of images. Yet,
they fail to incorporate some knowledge about the image formation model, which
limits their flexibility. Unrolled optimization algorithms, developed for
inverse problems resolution, allow to include prior information into deep
learning architectures. They have been used mainly for single image restoration
tasks. Adapting an unrolled neural network structure can bring the following
benefits. First, this may increase performance of the super-resolution task.
Then, this gives neural networks better interpretability. Finally, this allows
flexibility in learning a single model to nonblindly deal with multiple
degradations. In this paper, we propose a new VSR neural network based on

problems in the setting in which the input graph excludes a fixed minor, i.e.,
is a minor-free graph. In particular, we provide the following algorithms for
minor-free unbounded degree graphs. (1) A tester for Hamiltonicity with
two-sided error with $poly(1/\epsilon)$-query complexity, where $\epsilon$ is
the proximity parameter. (2) A local algorithm, as defined by Rubinfeld et al.
(ICS 2011), for constructing a spanning subgraph with almost minimum weight,
specifically, at most a factor $(1+\epsilon)$ of the optimum, with
$poly(1/\epsilon)$-query complexity. Both our algorithms use partition oracles,
a tool introduced by Hassidim et al. (FOCS 2009), which are oracles that
provide access to a partition of the graph such that the number of cut-edges is
small and each part of the partition is small. The polynomial dependence in
$1/\epsilon$ of our algorithms is achieved by combining the recent
$poly(d/\epsilon)$-query partition oracle of Kumar-Seshadhri-Stolman (ECCC
2021) for minor-free graphs with degree bounded by $d$.
  For bounded degree minor-free graphs we introduce the notion of covering
partition oracles which is a relaxed version of partition oracles and design a
$poly(d/\epsilon)$-time covering partition oracle. Using our covering partition
oracle we provide the same results as above (except that the tester for
Hamiltonicity has one-sided error) for minor-free bounded degree graphs, as
well as showing that any property which is monotone and additive (e.g.
bipartiteness) can be tested in minor-free graphs by making
$poly(d/\epsilon)$-queries.
  The benefit of using the covering partition oracle rather than the partition
oracle in our algorithms is its simplicity and an improved polynomial
dependence in $1/\epsilon$ in the obtained query complexity.

modifications can fool machine learning models, and such examples are called
""natural adversarial examples"". ImageNet-A is a famous dataset of natural
adversarial examples. By analyzing this dataset, we hypothesized that large,
cluttered and/or unusual background is an important reason why the images in
this dataset are difficult to be classified. We validated the hypothesis by
reducing the background influence in ImageNet-A examples with object detection
techniques. Experiments showed that the object detection models with various
classification models as backbones obtained much higher accuracy than their
corresponding classification models. A detection model based on the
classification model EfficientNet-B7 achieved a top-1 accuracy of 53.95%,
surpassing previous state-of-the-art classification models trained on ImageNet,
suggesting that accurate localization information can significantly boost the
performance of classification models on ImageNet-A. We then manually cropped
the objects in images from ImageNet-A and created a new dataset, named
ImageNet-A-Plus. A human test on the new dataset showed that the deep
learning-based classifiers still performed quite poorly compared with humans.
Therefore, the new dataset can be used to study the robustness of
classification models to the internal variance of objects without considering
the background disturbance.

limit for the maximum achievable gradient-climbing speed given a cell's
information acquisition rate. Next, we measure cells' gradient-climbing speeds
and the rate of information acquisition by the chemotaxis pathway. We find that
E. coli make behavioral decisions with much less than the 1 bit required to
determine whether they are swimming up-gradient. However, they use this
information efficiently, performing near the theoretical limit. Thus,
information can limit organisms' performance, and sensory-motor pathways may
have evolved to efficiently use information from the environment.

dilute surface of neutron-rich nuclei is one of the interesting subjects in the
study of neutron-rich nuclei and nuclear clustering. A theoretical model has
predicted that the growth of neutron skin will prevent the alpha clustering at
the nuclear surface. Quite recently, this theoretical perspective; the
suppression of alpha clustering by the neutron-skin formation was first
confirmed experimentally in Sn isotopes as the reduction of the (p, p alpha)
reaction cross-section. Motivated by the novel discovery, in this work, we have
investigated the relationship between the neutron-skin thickness and alpha
clustering in C isotopes. Based on the analysis by the antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics, we show that the alpha spectroscopic factor at nuclear
exterior decreases in neutron-rich C isotopes, and the clustering suppression
looks correlated with the growth of the neutron-skin thickness.

\ell^+\nu)$, where $\ell^+$ is either $\mu^+$ or
$\tau^+(\to\pi^+\bar{\nu}_\tau)$, based on $6.32$ fb$^{-1}$ of
electron-positron annihilation data collected by the BESIII experiment at six
center-of-mass energy points between $4.178$ and $4.226$ GeV. Simultaneously
floating the $D_s^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+\to\tau^+\nu_\tau$ components
yields $\cal B(D_s^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau) = (5.21\pm0.25\pm0.17)\times10^{-2}$,
$\cal B(D_s^+\to \mu^+\nu_\mu) = (5.35\pm0.13\pm0.16)\times10^{-3}$, and the
ratio of decay widths $R=\frac{\Gamma(D_s^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau)}{\Gamma(D_s^+\to
\mu^+\nu_\mu)} = 9.73^{+0.61}_{-0.58}\pm 0.36$, where the first uncertainties
are statistical and the second systematic. No evidence of ${\it CP}$ asymmetry
is observed in the decay rates $D_s^\pm\to\mu^\pm\nu_\mu$ and
$D_s^\pm\to\tau^\pm\nu_\tau$: $A_{\it CP}(\mu^\pm\nu) = (-1.2\pm2.5\pm1.0)\%$
and $A_{\it CP}(\tau^\pm\nu) = (+2.9\pm4.8\pm1.0)\%$. Constraining our
measurement to the Standard Model expectation of lepton universality
($R=9.75$), we find the more precise results $\cal B(D_s^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau) =
(5.22\pm0.10\pm 0.14)\times10^{-2}$ and $A_{\it CP}(\tau^\pm\nu_\tau) =
(-0.1\pm1.9\pm1.0)\%$. Combining our results with inputs external to our
analysis, we determine the $c\to \bar{s}$ quark mixing matrix element, $D_s^+$
decay constant, and ratio of the decay constants to be $|V_{cs}| =
0.973\pm0.009\pm0.014$, $f_{D^+_s} = 249.9\pm2.4\pm3.5~\text{MeV}$, and
$f_{D^+_s}/f_{D^+} = 1.232\pm0.035$, respectively.

the presence of a matter inhomogeneity. To do so, we study linear perturbations
of a flat FLRW background containing dust and a slowly rolling scalar field.
Under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and a static density contrast,
\textit{i.e.} $\dot{\delta}=0$, we obtain simple analytical solutions for
perturbations in the matter and dark energy-dominated epochs. As a consequence,
we show that perturbations of the scalar field, if a coupling \textit{\`a la}
Bekenstein is assumed, trigger a spatial dependence of the fine-structure
""constant"" which then varies as $\Delta \alpha \propto 1/r$. We finally
highlight that such variations can be constrained with spectroscopic
observations of stars from within our galaxy, therefore offering a new probe of
the nature of Dark Energy.

Control (RMPC), to solve general nonlinear finite-horizon optimal control

make full use of the current computing resources and adaptively select the
longest model prediction horizon. Our algorithm employs a recurrent function to
approximate the optimal policy, which maps the system states and reference
values directly to the control inputs. The number of prediction steps is equal
to the number of recurrent cycles of the learned policy function. With an
arbitrary initial policy function, the proposed RMPC algorithm can converge to
the optimal policy by directly minimizing the designed loss function. We
further prove the convergence and optimality of the RMPC algorithm thorough
Bellman optimality principle, and demonstrate its generality and efficiency
using two numerical examples.

sensitivity to weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) interacting via
nuclear recoils with a ~7-tonne xenon target mass. This manuscript presents
sensitivity projections to several low-energy signals of the complementary
electron recoil signal type: 1) an effective neutrino magnetic moment and 2) an
effective neutrino millicharge, both for pp-chain solar neutrinos, 3) an axion
flux generated by the Sun, 4) axion-like particles forming the galactic dark

matter. World-leading sensitivities are expected in each case, a result of the
large 5.6t 1000d exposure and low expected rate of electron recoil backgrounds

Concurrent empirical work demonstrated that kernel methods can come close to

if kernels also learn successfully, despite neural networks being more
expressive. Here, we show theoretically that two-layer neural networks (2LNN)

this task, lazy training approaches such as random features and kernel methods
do not. Our analysis is based on the derivation of a closed set of equations

asymptotic performance of the network as a function of signal-to-noise ratio

found to be crucial in low redshift clusters to explain the observed
thermodynamic properties of their ICM. We investigate this interaction at an
epoch featuring high levels of AGN activity and a transitional phase of ICM in
regards to the likelihood of residual cold-gas accretion. We measure a total
flux of $\rm 30.6 \pm 3.3~\mu Jy$ from the 6 detected jets. Their power
contribution is estimated to be $1.2 ~(\pm 0.6)~ \times 10^{44} ~\rm ergs~

instantaneous energy injection into the ICM of CLJ1449+0856 from AGN outflows
and star formation, that have already been found to be sufficient in globally
offsetting the cooling flows in the cluster core. In line with the already
detected abundance of star formation, this mode of feedback being distributed
over multiple sites, contrary to a single central source observed at low
redshifts, points to accretion of gas into the cluster centre. This also
suggests a 'steady state' of the cluster featuring non cool-core like
behaviour. Finally, we also examine the TIR-radio luminosity ratio for the

converges extremely slowly, the current understanding of maximum likelihood
training, which assumes approximate samples from the model can be drawn, is
problematic. In this paper, we try to understand this training procedure by
replacing Langevin dynamics with deterministic solutions of the associated
gradient descent ODE. Doing so allows us to study the density induced by the
dynamics (if the dynamics are invertible), and connect with GANs by treating
the dynamics as generator models, the initial values as latent variables and
the loss as optimizing a critic defined by the very same energy that determines
the generator through its gradient. Hence the term - self-adversarial loss. We
show that reintroducing the noise in the dynamics does not lead to a
qualitative change in the behavior, and merely reduces the quality of the
generator. We thus show that EBM training is effectively a self-adversarial
procedure rather than maximum likelihood estimation.

come for free, i.e., without any adjustment of the alpha-level, whenever a

simultaneity ensures control of the TDP even when the subset of interest is

desired power properties. We present an iterative shortcut for the closed
testing procedure, based on the branch and bound algorithm, which converges to
the full closed testing results, often after few iterations; even if it is
stopped early, it controls the TDP. We compare the properties of different

superrotating equatorial jet, planetary-scale stationary waves and
thermally-driven overturning circulation. In this work, we show that each of
these features can be separated from the total circulation by using a Helmholtz
decomposition, which splits the circulation into rotational (divergence free)
and divergent (vorticity free) components. This technique is applied to the
simulated circulation of a terrestrial planet and a gaseous hot Jupiter. For
both planets, the rotational component comprises the equatorial jet and
stationary waves, and the divergent component contains the overturning
circulation. Separating out each component allows us to evaluate their spatial
structure and relative contribution to the total flow. In contrast with
previous work, we show that divergent velocities are not negligible when
compared with rotational velocities, and that divergent, overturning
circulation takes the form of a single, roughly isotropic cell that ascends on
the day-side and descends on the night-side. These conclusions are drawn for
both the terrestrial case and the hot Jupiter. To illustrate the utility of the
Helmholtz decomposition for studying atmospheric processes, we compute the
contribution of each of the circulation components to heat transport from day-
to night-side. Surprisingly, we find that the divergent circulation dominates
day-night heat transport in the terrestrial case and accounts for around half
of the heat transport for the hot Jupiter. The relative contributions of the
rotational and divergent components to day-night heat transport are likely
sensitive to multiple planetary parameters and atmospheric processes, and merit
further study.

show that within constrained computational budgets, it is in fact better to

spin glass phase present in magnetic systems characterized by disorder,
dilution and competitive interactions where magnetic frustration can take
place, resembling the way as an individual or agent in a society is able to
face a decision. In this sense, agents are identified as Ising spins, which can
take two possible values ($\sigma = \pm 1$), in correspondence with a two-state
system where agents can be tax compliant or not. Such an identification between
social and physical variables, as well as parameters like an external applied
magnetic field or temperature, are topic of discussion in this investigation.
Thermalization of the observables is carried out by means of the heat bath

correlations solely from observational data even without interventions has come
to the forefront of machine learning, neuroscience and social sciences. As new
large scale quantum systems go online, it opens interesting questions of
whether a quantum framework exists on isolating causal correlations without any
interventions on a quantum system. We put forth a theoretical framework for
merging quantum information science and causal inference by exploiting entropic
principles. At the root of our approach is the proposition that the true causal
direction minimizes the entropy of exogenous variables in a non-local hidden
variable theory. The proposed framework uses a quantum causal structural
equation model to build the connection between two fields: entropic causal
inference and the quantum marginal problem. First, inspired by the definition
of geometric quantum discord, we fill the gap between classical and quantum
conditional density matrices to define quantum causal models. Subsequently,
using a greedy approach, we develop a scalable algorithm for quantum entropic
causal inference unifying classical and quantum causality in a principled way.
We apply our proposed algorithm to an experimentally relevant scenario of
identifying the subsystem impacted by noise starting from an entangled state.
This successful inference on a synthetic quantum dataset can have practical
applications in identifying originators of malicious activity on future
multi-node quantum networks as well as quantum error correction. As quantum
datasets and systems grow in complexity, our framework can play a foundational
role in bringing observational causal inference from the classical to the
quantum domain.

at the lunar south pole, have been suggested as a source of solar power for
mining the water and other volatiles in the nearby permanently dark regions. As
mining is a power-intensive activity, it is interesting to estimate the maximum
solar power that could be generated at the PELs. Here we use average percentage
illumination maps for a range of heights above the local topography from 2 m to
2 km to determine the total power available as a function of time of lunar day.
Overshadowing of highly illuminated areas by towers placed in sunward locations
(at a given time of day) limits the total power to much smaller values than the
highly illuminated area would suggest. We find that for near-term realizable
towers (up to 20 m), the upper limit to the time-averaged power available is
~55 MW at >70% illumination, and ~6 MW at >90% illumination. For the more
distant future a maximum time-averaged power of order 21000 MW at >70%
illumination could be realizable for towers up to 2 km in height, and ~5270 MW,
respectively, at 90% illumination. Towers 1 km high provide about a factor 2.7
times less power. The variation with lunar time of day ranges from a factor of
1.1 to ~ 3.

binary classification studies. However, real-life scenarios oftentimes share
complexities that prevent from the use of the as-is LR model, and instead
highlight the need to include high-order interactions to capture data
variability. This becomes even more challenging because of: (i) datasets
growing wider, with more and more variables; (ii) studies being typically
conducted in strongly imbalanced settings; (iii) samples going from very large
to extremely small; (iv) the need of providing both predictive models and
interpretable results. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Learning
high-order Interactions via targeted Pattern Search (LIPS), to select
interaction terms of varying order to include in a LR model for an imbalanced
binary classification task when input data are categorical. LIPS's rationale
stems from the duality between item sets and categorical interactions. The
algorithm relies on an interaction learning step based on a well-known frequent
item set mining algorithm, and a novel dissimilarity-based interaction
selection step that allows the user to specify the number of interactions to be
included in the LR model. In addition, we particularize two variants (Scores
LIPS and Clusters LIPS), that can address even more specific needs. Through a

two edge-correlated graphs are independently edge-sampled from a common parent
graph with a power-law degree distribution. A set of correctly matched
vertex-pairs is chosen at random and revealed as initial seeds. Our goal is to
use the seeds to recover the remaining latent vertex correspondence between the
two graphs. Departing from the existing approaches that focus on the use of
high-degree seeds in $1$-hop neighborhoods, we develop an efficient algorithm
that exploits the low-degree seeds in suitably-defined $D$-hop neighborhoods.
Specifically, we first match a set of vertex-pairs with appropriate degrees
(which we refer to as the first slice) based on the number of low-degree seeds
in their $D$-hop neighborhoods. This significantly reduces the number of
initial seeds needed to trigger a cascading process to match the rest of the
graphs. Under the Chung-Lu random graph model with $n$ vertices, max degree
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, and the power-law exponent $2<\beta<3$, we show that as
soon as $D> \frac{4-\beta}{3-\beta}$, by optimally choosing the first slice,
with high probability our algorithm can correctly match a constant fraction of
the true pairs without any error, provided with only $\Omega((\log
n)^{4-\beta})$ initial seeds. Our result achieves an exponential reduction in
the seed size requirement, as the best previously known result requires
$n^{1/2+\epsilon}$ seeds (for any small constant $\epsilon>0$). Performance
evaluation with synthetic and real data further corroborates the improved

accumulated and helps to study urban dynamics and human mobility. GPS
coordinates and other location indicators are normally low dimensional and only
representing spatial proximity, thus difficult to be effectively utilized by
machine learning models in Geo-aware applications. Existing location embedding
methods are mostly tailored for specific problems that are taken place within
areas of interest. When it comes to the scale of a city or even a country,
existing approaches always suffer from extensive computational cost and
significant data sparsity. Different from existing studies, we propose to learn
representations through a GCN-aided skip-gram model named GCN-L2V by
considering both spatial connection and human mobility. With a flow graph and a
spatial graph, it embeds context information into vector representations.
GCN-L2V is able to capture relationships among locations and provide a better
notion of similarity in a spatial environment. Across quantitative experiments
and case studies, we empirically demonstrate that representations learned by
GCN-L2V are effective. As far as we know, this is the first study that provides
a fine-grained location embedding at the city level using only LBS records.
GCN-L2V is a general-purpose embedding model with high flexibility and can be
applied in down-streaming Geo-aware applications.

powerful centrality to measure the local influence of node in a complex
network. Preferential attachment based on node degree has been widely adopted
for modeling network growth. However, many evidences exist which show deviation
of real network growth from what a pure degree-based model suggests. It seems
that node degree is not a reliable measure for predicting the preference of
newcomers in attaching to the network, or at least, it does not tell the whole
story. In this paper, we argue that there is another dimension to network
growth, one that we call node ""coreness"". The new dimension gives insights on
the global influence of nodes, in comparison to the local view the degree
metric provides. We found that the probability of existing nodes attracting new
nodes generally follows an exponential dependence on node coreness, while at
the same time, follows a power-law dependence on node degree. That is to say,
high-coreness nodes are more powerful than high-degree nodes in attracting
newcomers. The new dimension further discloses some hidden phenomena which
happen in the process of network growth. The power of node degree in attracting
newcomers increases over time while the influence of coreness decreases, and
finally, they reach a state of equilibrium in the growth. All these theories
have been tested on real-world networks.

hydrodynamic method to simulate material dynamics (for e.g., gasses, fluids,

such as specific volume, velocity, specific total energy, and deformation
gradient fields within a cell, are represented with a polynomial constructed
from a novel hierarchical orthogonal basis about the center of mass, which
decouples the moments of the solution because the mass matrix is diagonal. The
discontinuity in the polynomials at the cell boundary is addressed by solving a
multi-directional Riemann problem at the vertices of the cell and a 1D Riemann
problem at additional non-vertex quadrature points along the edges so that the
surface integral is exact for the polynomial order. The uniqueness lies in that
the vertices of the curvilinear grid work as the quadrature points for the
surface integral of DG methods. To ensure robust mesh motion, the pressure for
the Riemann problem accounts for the difference between the density variation
over the cell and a density field from subcell mesh stabilization (SMS). The
accuracy and robustness of the new high-order accurate Lagrangian DG
hydrodynamic method is demonstrated by simulating a diverse suite of
challenging test problems covering gas and solid dynamic problems on curved

to its tremendous potential for passively exploiting the coldness of deep-sky
as clean and renewable energy. Many advanced materials with novel photonic
micro-nanostructures have already been developed to enable highly efficient
daytime radiative coolers, among which the flexible hierarchical porous
coatings (HPCs) are a more distinguished category. However, it is still hard to
precisely control the size distribution of the randomized pores within the
HPCs, usually resulting in a deficient solar reflection at the near-infrared
optical regime under diverse fabrication conditions of the coatings. We report
here a three-phase (i.e., air pore-phase, microsphere-phase and polymer-phase)
self-assembled hybrid porous composite coating which dramatically increases the
average solar reflectance and yields a remarkable temperature drop of ~10 degC
and 30 degC compared to the ambient circumstance and black paint, respectively,
according to the rooftop measurements. Mie theory and Monte Carlo simulations
reveal the origin of the low reflectivity of as-prepared two-phase porous HPCs,
and the optical cooling improvement of the three-phase porous composite
coatings is attributed to the newly generated interfaces possessing the high
scattering efficiency between the hierarchical pores and silica microspheres
hybridized with appropriate mass fractions. As a result, the hybrid porous
composite approach enhances the whole performance of the coatings, which
provides a promising alternative to the flexible daytime radiative cooler.

immersed in a fluid interact with the ambient flow, altering their
trajectories. In surface gravity waves, a common goal for microswimmers is
vertical migration (e.g., to reach the free surface or to dive to deeper
depths). By modelling microswimmers as spheroidal bodies with an intrinsic
swimming velocity that supplements advection and reorientation by the flow, we
investigate how shape and swimming affect vertical transport of microswimmers
in waves. We find that it is possible for microswimmers to be initially
swimming downwards, but to recover and head back to the surface, and vice
versa. This is because the coupling between swimming and flow-induced
reorientations introduces a shape dependency in the vertical transport. From a
wave-averaged analysis of microswimmer trajectories, we show that each
trajectory is bounded by critical planes in the position-orientation phase
space that depend only on the shape. We also give explicit solutions to these
trajectories and determine the fraction of microswimmers that begin within the
water column and eventually reach the surface. For microswimmers that are
initially randomly oriented, the fraction that reach the surface increases
monotonically as the starting depth decreases, as expected, but also varies
with shape and swimming speed. In the limit of small swimming speed, the
fraction of highly prolate microswimmers reaching the surface is 0.5,
suggesting that these swimmers would be able to choose direction of vertical
transport with small changes in swimming behaviour.
