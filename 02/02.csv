method known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimizing general
non-convex loss functions. Our main contribution is providing upper bounds on
the generalization error that depend on local statistics of the stochastic
gradients evaluated along the path of iterates calculated by SGD. The key
factors our bounds depend on are the variance of the gradients (with respect to
the data distribution) and the local smoothness of the objective function along
the SGD path, and the sensitivity of the loss function to perturbations to the
final output. Our key technical tool is combining the information-theoretic
generalization bounds previously used for analyzing randomized variants of SGD
with a perturbation analysis of the iterates.

single-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) and convolutions are bound by
L1-cache-read bandwidth. Explorations of 8-bit and bit-serial quantized

Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale, but it has also been

are solved in a local frame centered on the planet. Ignoring small oscillations
that average to zero over time, the simulations converge to a steady state
where the velocity field of the gas becomes constant in time. In a steady
state, the energy loss by radiative cooling is fully compensated by the
recycling of the low entropy gas in the planetary atmosphere with high entropy
gas from the circumstellar disk. For close-in planets, recycling naturally
halts the cooling of planetary proto-atmospheres, preventing them from
contracting toward the runaway regime and collapsing into gas giants.

meta-learning, or ""learning to learn"" a distribution of tasks, where ""learning""
is represented by an outer loop, and ""to learn"" by an inner loop of gradient
descent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner
loop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better. We
study the performance of MAML as a function of the learning rate of the inner
loop, where zero learning rate implies that there is no inner loop. Using
random matrix theory and exact solutions of linear models, we calculate an
algebraic expression for the test loss of MAML applied to mixed linear
regression and nonlinear regression with overparameterized models.
Surprisingly, while the optimal learning rate for adaptation is positive, we
find that the optimal learning rate for training is always negative, a setting
that has never been considered before. Therefore, not only does the performance
increase by decreasing the learning rate to zero, as suggested by recent work,

post-processing procedure to select a pre-specified number of solutions as the

usually efficiently handle subset selection. However, when a large number of
solutions are given (e.g., subset selection from tens of thousands of solutions
in an unbounded external archive), they often become time-consuming. Our idea
is to use the submodular property, which is known for the hypervolume
indicator, to improve their efficiency. First, we prove that the IGD and IGD+

propose an efficient greedy inclusion algorithm for each indicator. Then, we
demonstrate through computational experiments that the proposed algorithms are

With the SIR code, we consider two inversion schemes: scheme 1 (S1), where a
magnetic atmosphere is embedded in a field free medium, and scheme 2 (S2), with
two magnetic models and a fixed stray light component. S1 inversions returned a
median magnetic field strength of 200 and 240 G for the two datasets,

component, among pixels with Stokes V, above a noise threshold. We determined
the former to be 263 G and 267 G, and the latter to be 131 G and 145 G, for the

tracking the dynamics of small scale magnetic features. We apply S1 and S2

the diffusional behavior of copper in silicon. The ReaxFF Cu/Si parameter set

copper atoms has a direct relationship with the temperature. Moreover, it is
also shown that individual copper atoms start to clusterize inside bulk silicon

increasing level of Cu-impurity concentration. We observe spontaneous
microcracking of the Si during the stress-strain tests as a consequence of the

especially in domains where these directly affect human lives. Counterfactual
explanations of already trained neural networks can be generated by perturbing
input features and attributing importance according to the change in the
classifier's outcome after perturbation. Perturbation can be done by replacing
features using heuristic or generative in-filling methods. The choice of
in-filling function significantly impacts the number of artifacts, i.e.,
false-positive attributions. Heuristic methods result in false-positive
artifacts because the image after the perturbation is far from the original
data distribution. Generative in-filling methods reduce artifacts by producing
in-filling values that respect the original data distribution. However, current
generative in-filling methods may also increase false-negatives due to the high
correlation of in-filling values with the original data. In this paper, we
propose to alleviate this by generating in-fillings with the
statistically-grounded Knockoffs framework, which was developed by Barber and
Cand\`es in 2015 as a tool for variable selection with controllable false
discovery rate. Knockoffs are statistically null-variables as decorrelated as
possible from the original data, which can be swapped with the originals
without changing the underlying data distribution. A comparison of different
in-filling methods indicates that in-filling with knockoffs can reveal
explanations in a more causal sense while still maintaining the compactness of
the explanations.

broadcast or NACK transmission in VANET with the combination theory and
investigate the potential influence of miss my packets (MMP) problem. (2) Based
on the software define vehicular network (SDVN) framework and QoS requirement,
a novel link-level scheduling strategy, which determines the start-sending time

communication model assumes that all messages between honest parties are
delayed at most by a known constant $\Delta$. Recent literature establishes
that the longest-chain blockchain protocol is secure under the synchronous
model. However, for a fixed mining rate, the security guarantees degrade with
$\Delta$. We analyze the performance of the longest-chain protocol under the
assumption that the communication delays are random, independent, and
identically distributed. This communication model allows for distributions with
unbounded support and is a strict generalization of the synchronous model. We
provide safety and liveness guarantees with simple, explicit bounds on the
failure probabilities. These bounds hold for infinite-horizon executions and
decay exponentially with the security parameter. In particular, we show that
the longest-chain protocol has good security guarantees when delays are
sporadically large and possibly unbounded, which is reflective of real-world

line in the solar spectrum, detecting increases in irradiance due to solar
flares at this wavelength can be challenging due to the very high background.
Previous studies that have focused on the largest flares have shown that even
these extreme cases generate enhancements in Lya of only a few percent above
the background. In this study, a superposed-epoch analysis was performed on
~8500 flares greater than B1 class to determine the contribution that flares
make to changes in the solar EUV irradiance. Using the peak of the 1-8A X-ray
emission as a fiducial time, the corresponding time series of 3123 B- and 4972
C-class flares observed in Lya emission by the EUV Sensor on GOES-15 were
averaged to reduce background fluctuations and improve the flare signal. The
summation of these weaker events showed that they produced a 0.1-0.3%
enhancement to the solar Lya irradiance. For comparison on average, the same
technique was applied to 453 M- and 31 X-class flares, which resulted in a 1-4%
increase in Lya emission. Flares were also averaged with respect to their
heliographic angle to investigate any potential center-to-limb variation. For
each GOES class, the relative enhancement in Lya at the flare peak was found to
diminish for flares that occurred closer to the solar limb due to the opacity
of the line, and/or foreshortening of the footpoints. One modest event included
in the study, a C6.6 flare, exhibited an unusually high increase in Lya of 7%
that may have been attributed to a failed filament eruption. Increases of this
magnitude have hitherto only been associated with a small number of X-class
flares.

(CMB) observations; the cross-correlation between fluctuations in the CMB
optical depth which probes the integrated electron density, $\delta\tau$, and
the Compton $y$-map which probes the integrated electron pressure. This
cross-correlation is much less contaminated than the $y$-map power spectrum by
late-time cluster contributions. In addition, this cross-correlation can
constrain the temperature of ionized bubbles while the optical-depth
fluctuations and kinetic SZ effect can not. We measure this new observable
using a Planck $y$-map as well as a map of optical-depth fluctuations that we
reconstruct from Planck CMB temperature data. We use our measurements to derive
a first CMB-only upper limit on the temperature inside ionized bubbles, $T_{\rm
b}\lesssim 7.0\times10^5\,$K ($2\,\sigma$). We also present future forecasts,
assuming a fiducial model with characteristic reionization bubble size $R_{\rm
b}=5\,$Mpc and $T_{\rm b}=5\times10^4\,$K. The signal-to-noise ratio of the
fiducial cross-correlation using a signal dominated PICO-like $y$-map becomes
$\simeq7$ with CMB-S4 $\delta\tau$ and $\simeq13$ with CMB-HD $\delta\tau$. For
the fiducial model, we predict that the CMB-HD $-$ PICO cross-correlation
should achieve an accurate measurement of the reionization parameters; $T_{\rm
b}\simeq 49800^{+4500}_{-5100}\,$K and $R_{\rm b}\simeq
5.09^{+0.66}_{-0.79}\,$Mpc. Since the power spectrum of the electron density
fluctuations is constrained by the $\delta\tau$ auto spectrum, the temperature
constraints should be only weakly model-dependent on the details of the
electron distributions and should be statistically representative of the
temperature in ionized bubbles during reionization. This cross-correlation
could, therefore, become an important observable for future CMB experiments.

appropriate prevention behaviors. It is urgent to suppress the misinformation
to prevent negative public health consequences. Although an array of studies
has proposed misinformation suppression strategies, few have investigated the
role of predominant credible information during crises. None has examined its
effect quantitatively using longitudinal social media data. Therefore, this
research investigates the temporal correlations between credible information
and misinformation, and whether predominant credible information can suppress
misinformation for two prevention measures (i.e. topics), i.e. wearing masks
and social distancing using tweets collected from February 15 to June 30, 2020.
We trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and
classify tweets containing credible information and misinformation for each
topic. Based on cross-correlation analyses of credible and misinformation time
series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant credible
information can lead to the decrease of misinformation (i.e. suppression) with
a time lag. The research findings provide empirical evidence for suppressing
misinformation with credible information in complex online environments and
suggest practical strategies for future information management during crises
and emergencies.

X-rays, $L_{\rm{X}}$, and the total (unsigned) magnetic flux at the stellar
surface, $\Phi$. The physics basis for this relation is poorly understood. We
use three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical models of the
coronae above active regions, that is, strong concentrations of magnetic field,
to investigate the $L_{\rm{X}}$ versus $\Phi$ relation and illustrate this
relation with an analytical model based on simple well-established scaling
relations. In the 3D MHD model horizontal (convective) motions near the surface
induce currents in the coronal magnetic field that are dissipated and heat the
plasma. This self-consistently creates a corona with a temperature of 1 MK. We
run a series of models that differ in terms of the (unsigned) magnetic flux at
the surface by changing the (peak) magnetic field strength while keeping all
other parameters fixed. In the 3D MHD models we find that the energy input into
the corona, characterized by either the Poynting flux or the total volumetric
heating, scales roughly quadratically with the unsigned surface flux $\Phi$.
This is expected from heating through field-line braiding. Our central result
is the nonlinear scaling of the X-ray emission as $L_{\rm{X}}\propto
\Phi^{3.44}$. This scaling is slightly steeper than found in recent
observations that give power-law indices of up to only 2 or 3. Assuming that on
a real star, not only the peak magnetic field strength in the active regions
changes but also their number (or surface filling factor), our results are
consistent with observations. Our model provides indications of what causes the
steep increase in X-ray luminosity by four orders of magnitude from solar-type
activity to fast rotating active stars.

closes the gap characterized by Sudakov's inequality between the entropy and

the caption. Previous work did not use the caption text information, but a
manually provided relation holding between the subject and the object. In fact,
the used evaluation datasets contain manually annotated ontological triplets
but no captions, making the exercise unrealistic: a manual step was required;
and systems did not leverage the richer information in captions. Here we
present a system that uses the full caption, and Relations in Captions
(REC-COCO), a dataset derived from MS-COCO which allows to evaluate spatial
relation inference from captions directly. Our experiments show that: (1) it is
possible to infer the size and location of an object with respect to a given
subject directly from the caption; (2) the use of full text allows to place the
object better than using a manually annotated relation. Our work paves the way
for systems that, given a caption, decide which entities need to be depicted
and their respective location and sizes, in order to then generate the final

This paper optimizes the deployment of NFV and content caching in 5G networks
and focuses on the associated power consumption savings. In addition, it
introduces an approach to combine content caching with NFV in one integrated
architecture for energy aware 5G networks. A mixed integer linear programming
(MILP) model has been developed to minimize the total power consumption by
jointly optimizing the cache size, virtual machine (VM) workload, and the
locations of both cache nodes and VMs. The results were investigated under the
impact of core network virtual machines (CNVMs) inter-traffic. The result show
that the optical line terminal (OLT) access network nodes are the optimum
location for content caching and for hosting VMs during busy times of the day
whilst IP over WDM core network nodes are the optimum locations for caching and
VM placement during off-peak time. Furthermore, the results reveal that a
virtualization-only approach is better than a caching-only approach for video
streaming services where the virtualization-only approach compared to
caching-only approach, achieves a maximum power saving of 7% (average 5%) when
no CNVMs inter-traffic is considered and 6% (average 4%) with CNVMs
inter-traffic at 10% of the total backhaul traffic. On the other hand, the
integrated approach has a maximum power saving of 15% (average 9%) with and
without CNVMs inter-traffic compared to the virtualization-only approach, and
it achieves a maximum power saving of 21% (average 13%) without CNVMs
inter-traffic and 20% (average 12%) when CNVMs inter-traffic is considered
compared with the caching-only approach. In order to validate the MILP models
and achieve real-time operation in our approaches, a heuristic was developed.

thus can be solved by (any) solver capable to handle conic problems on cones
from K (e.g., Mosek or SDPT3 in the case of semidefinite cones). We also show

large-scale distributed multi-agent systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a
promising alternative which can find approximate solutions to distributed

volume(CTV) segmentation in postoperative settings, where there is no gross
tumor present. In this scenario, the CTV is not an anatomically established
structure, but one determined by the physician based on the clinical guideline
used, the preferred tradeoff between tumor control and toxicity, their
experience and training background, and other factors. This results in high
inter-observer variability between physicians. This variability has been
considered an issue, but the absence of multiple physician CTV contours for
each patient and the significant amount of time required for dose planning have
made it impractical to study its dosimetric consequences. In this study, we
analyze the impact that variations in physician style have on dose to
organs-at-risk(OAR) by simulating the clinical workflow via deep learning. For
a given patient previously treated by one physician, we use deep learning-based
tools to simulate how other physicians would contour the CTV and how the
corresponding dose distributions would look for this patient. To simulate
multiple physician styles, we use a previously developed in-house CTV
segmentation model that can produce physician style-aware segmentations. The
corresponding dose distribution is predicted using another in-house deep
learning tool, which, can predict dose within 3% of the prescription dose, on
average, on the test data. For every test patient, four different physician
style CTVs are considered, and four different dose distributions are analyzed.
OAR dose metrics are compared, showing that even though physician style
variations result in organs getting different doses, all the important dose
metrics except Maximum Dose point are within the clinically acceptable limit.

accelerating grain growth in polycrystalline perovskite-oxide ceramics. In
order to advance the fundamental understanding of growth mechanisms at the
atomic scale, classical atomistic simulations were carried out to investigate
the atomistic structures and oxygen vacancy formation energies at grain
boundaries in the prototypical perovskite-oxide material SrTiO$_3$. In this
work, we focus on two symmetric tilt grain boundaries, namely
$\Sigma$5(310)[001] and $\Sigma$5(210)[001]. A one-dimensional continuum model
is adapted to determine the electrostatic potential induced by charged lattice
planes in atomistic structure models containing grain boundaries and point
defects. By means of this model, electrostatic artifacts, which are inherent to
supercell models with periodic or open boundary conditions, can be taken into
account and corrected properly. We report calculated formation energies of
oxygen vacancies on all the oxygen sites across boundaries between two
misoriented grains, and we analyze and discuss the formation-energy values with
respect to local charge densities at the vacant sites.

Using ParaRel, we show that the consistency of all PLMs we experiment with is

are currently not suitable for representing knowledge robustly. Finally, we
propose a method for improving model consistency and experimentally demonstrate

Bell basis and convey the measurement outcome to Bob via noisy classical

teleportation fidelity and corresponding fidelity deviation where the resource
state and the classical communication, both of them can be noisy. We further
find conditions for non-classical fidelity and dispersion-free teleportation

where it is possible to achieve the dispersion-free teleportation without
compromising the non-classical fidelity. We also exhibit scenarios where the
increase of entanglement in the resource state, may degrade the quality of

from first principles require the use of the same nucleon-nucleon interaction
in the structure and reaction calculations, as well as a consistent treatment
of the relevant operators at each order.
  Purpose: Previous work using these interactions has shown good agreement with
available data. Here, we study the physical relevance of one of these
operators, which involves the spin of the struck nucleon, and examine the
interpretation of this quantity in a nuclear structure context.
  Methods: Using the framework of the spectator expansion and the underlying
framework of the no-core shell model, we calculate and examine spin-projected,
one-body momentum distributions required for effective nucleon-nucleus
interactions in $J=0$ nuclear states.
  Results: The calculated spin-projected, one-body momentum distributions for
$^4$He, $^6$He, and $^8$He display characteristic behavior based on the
occupation of protons and neutrons in single particle levels, with more
nucleons of one type yielding momentum distributions with larger values.
Additionally, we find this quantity is strongly correlated to the magnetic
moment of the $2^+$ excited state in the ground state rotational band for each
nucleus considered.
  Conclusions: We find that spin-projected, one-body momentum distributions can
probe the spin content of a $J=0$ wave function. This feature may allow future
\textit{ab initio} nucleon-nucleus scattering studies to inform spin properties
of the underlying nucleon-nucleon interactions. The observed correlation to the
magnetic moment of excited states illustrates a previously unknown connection
between reaction observables such as the analyzing power and structure
observables like the magnetic moment.

seen impressive progress in the hands of deep learning-based methods, trained
to map directly from blurry to sharp images. Characterization of the motion
blur, on the other hand, has received less attention, and progress in
model-based methods for deblurring lags behind that of data-driven end-to-end
approaches. In this work we revisit the problem of characterizing dense,
non-uniform motion blur in a single image and propose a general non-parametric
model for this task. Given a blurry image, a neural network is trained to
estimate a set of image-adaptive basis motion kernels as well as the mixing
coefficients at the pixel level, producing a per-pixel motion blur field. We
show that our approach overcomes the limitations of existing non-uniform motion
blur estimation methods and leads to extremely accurate motion blur kernels.
When applied to real motion-blurred images, a variational non-uniform blur
removal method fed with the estimated blur kernels produces high-quality
restored images. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that these
results are competitive or superior to results obtained with existing
end-to-end deep learning (DL) based methods, thus bridging the gap between

period of accelerated expansion in the very early Universe that is required to
explain the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background.
Inflation, when combined with quantum mechanics, also provides the
over-densities that grow into the structure of the modern Universe.
Understanding perturbations during this period of inflation is important, and
we study these perturbations in detail in this work. We will assume that
inflation is driven by a single scalar field, called the inflaton. When the
shape of the potential energy is flat, the inflaton can enter a phase of
""ultra-slow-roll inflation"". We study the stability of such a period of
inflation, and find that it can be stable and long-lived, although it has a
dependence on the initial velocity of the inflaton field. This is different to
the slow-roll regime of inflation, which is always stable, but has no
dependence on the initial velocity. In the second part of this thesis, we use
the stochastic formalism for inflation in order to take account of the
non-perturbative backreaction of quantum fluctuations during inflation. We use
this formalism to study curvature fluctuations during inflation, and we derive
full probability distributions of these fluctuations. This allows us to study
the statistics of large fluctuations that can lead to the formation of rare
objects, such as primordial black holes. In general, we find that when the
quantum effects modelled by the stochastic formalism are correctly accounted
for, many more primordial black holes can be formed than one would expect if
these quantum effects were not taken into account.

states we consider can be prepared by inducing two-mode Jaynes-Cummings and

advantageously employed to sense arbitrary displacements of the mode in phase
space. The Wigner function of this reduced state exhibits a symmetrical peak

the relevant time-scale in the coarsening regime, which turns out to be of
Arrhenius form and independent of q for large q. Once taken into account
dynamic scaling is universal.

Two shapes of random weights are considered, one motivated by a Bayesian

non-asymptotic upper bounds for the quadratic risk and the maximal quadratic
risk over Sobolev-like ellipsoids of the fully data-driven estimator. We
compute rates which can be obtained in different configurations for the
smoothness of the density of interest and the error density. The rates

Method (GFEM) to approximate the solutions of quasilinear elliptic equations
with multiple interfaces in one dimensional space. The problem is characterized
by spatial discontinuity of the elliptic coefficient that depends on the
unknown solution. It is known that unless the partition of the domain matches
the discontinuity configuration, accuracy of standard finite element techniques
significantly deteriorates and standard refinement of the partition may not
suffice. The GFEM is a viable alternative to overcome this predicament. It is
based on the construction of certain enrichment functions supplied to the
standard space that capture effects of the discontinuity. This approach is
called stable (SGFEM) if it maintains an optimal rate of convergence and the
conditioning of GFEM is not worse than that of the standard FEM. A convergence
analysis is derived and performance of the method is illustrated by several
numerical examples. Furthermore, it is known that typical global formulations
such as FEMs do not enjoy the numerical local conservation property that is
crucial in many conservation law-based applications. To remedy this issue, a
Lagrange multiplier technique is adopted to enforce the local conservation. A
numerical example is given to demonstrate the performance of proposed
technique.

integrated piezoelectric thin-film transducers constituting less than 0.1% of
the device work equally well. The simulations are done using a well-tested and
experimentally validated numerical model. Our proof-of-concept example is a
water-filled straight channel embedded in a mm-sized glass chip with a 1-um
thick thin-film transducer made of (Al,Sc)N. We compute the acoustic energy,
streaming, and radiation force, and show that it is comparable to that of a
conventional silicon-glass device actuated by a bulk PZT transducer. The
ability of the thin-film transducer to create the desired acoustofluidic
effects in bulk acoustofluidic devices rely on three physical aspects: The
in-plane-expansion of the thin-film transducer under the orthogonal applied
electric field, the acoustic whole-system resonance of the device, and the high
Q-factor of the elastic solid constituting the bulk part of the device.
Consequently, the thin-film device is surprisingly insensitive to the Q-factor

anharmonicity and their effect on phonon frequencies. Nevertheless, the current

that the impact of thermal electronic excitations on vibrational properties is
not significant up to ~ 4,000 K at 200 GPa but should not be ignored at higher

list and relies on CPU's Time Stamp Counter register to generate version
numbers at minimal cost. For faster skip list traversals and better utilization
of the CPU caches, key-value entries are grouped into immutable objects called
revisions. Moreover, by changing the size of revisions and thus modifying the
synchronization granularity, our index can adapt to varying contentions levels
(smaller revisions are more suited for write-heavy workloads whereas large
revisions benefit read-dominated workloads, especially when they feature many
range scan operations). Structure modifications to the index, which result in
changing the size of revisions, happen through (lock-free) skip list node split
and merge operations that are carefully coordinated with the update operations.
Despite rich semantics, Jiffy offers highly scalable performance, which is

cosmic inflation is through measurements of degree-scale CMB $B$-mode
polarisation. This approach must face the challenge posed by gravitational
lensing of the CMB, which obscures the signal of interest. Fortunately, the
lensing effects can be partially removed by combining high-resolution $E$-mode
measurements with an estimate of the projected matter distribution. For
near-future experiments, the best estimate of the latter will arise from
co-adding internal reconstructions (derived from the CMB itself) with external
tracers such as the cosmic infrared background (CIB). In this work, we
characterise how foregrounds impact the delensing procedure when CIB intensity,
$I$, is used as the matter tracer. We find that higher-point functions of the
CIB and Galactic dust such as $\langle BEI \rangle_{c}$ and $\langle EIEI
\rangle_{c}$ can, in principle, bias the power spectrum of delensed $B$-modes.
To quantify these, we first estimate the dust residuals in currently-available
CIB maps and upcoming, foreground-cleaned Simons Observatory CMB data. Then,
using non-Gaussian simulations of Galactic dust -- extrapolated to the relevant
frequencies, assuming the spectral index of polarised dust emission to be fixed
at the value determined by Planck -- we show that the bias to any primordial
signal is small compared to statistical errors for ground-based experiments,
but might be significant for space-based experiments probing very large angular
scales. However, mitigation techniques based on multi-frequency cleaning appear
to be very effective. We also show, by means of an analytic model, that the
bias arising from the higher-point functions of the CIB itself ought to be
negligible.

distinguished by their breaking of the approximate SU(4) isospin symmetry.
Recent experiments have observed an even denominator fractional quantum Hall
state thought to be associated with a transition in the underlying isospin
order from a spin-singlet charge density wave at low magnetic fields to an
antiferromagnet at high magnetic fields, implying that a similar transition
must occur at charge neutrality. However, this transition does not generate
contrast in typical electrical transport or thermodynamic measurements and no
direct evidence for it has been reported, despite theoretical interest arising
from its potentially unconventional nature. Here, we measure the transmission
of ferromagnetic magnons through the two dimensional bulk of clean monolayer
graphene. Using spin polarized fractional quantum Hall states as a benchmark,
we find that magnon transmission is controlled by the detailed properties of
the low-momentum spin waves in the intervening Hall fluid, which is highly
density dependent. Remarkably, as the system is driven into the
antiferromagnetic regime, robust magnon transmission is restored across a wide
range of filling factors consistent with Pauli blocking of fractional quantum
hall spin-wave excitations and their replacement by conventional ferromagnetic
magnons confined to the minority graphene sublattice. Finally, using devices in
which spin waves are launched directly into the insulating charge-neutral bulk,
we directly detect the hidden phase transition between bulk insulating charge
density wave and a canted antiferromagnetic phases at charge neutrality,
completing the experimental map of broken-symmetry phases in monolayer
graphene.

On one hand, this is desirable as it treats all classes equally. On the other

real-world use cases. Unfortunately, under important conditions (i.e., large
vocabulary, high instance counts) the default implementation of AP is neither

ensuring that it is independent across categories as originally intended. We
benchmark recent LVIS detection advances and find that many reported gains do
not translate to improvements under our new evaluation, suggesting recent
improvements may arise from difficult to interpret changes to cross-category

rankings, we consider a pooled version of AP (AP-Pool) that rewards properly
calibrated detectors by directly comparing cross-category rankings. Finally, we
revisit classical approaches for calibration and find that explicitly

ionized gas traced by infrared-selected galaxies from the \emph{unWISE}
catalog. We employ the ""projected-field"" kSZ estimator, which does not require
spectroscopic galaxy redshifts. To suppress non-kSZ foreground signals

have average halo mass $\sim 1$-$5\times 10^{13}$ $h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, and in

difficult to measure for non-degenerate stars, since its amplitude is small in
comparison with the typical Doppler shift induced by stellar radial velocity.
In this study, we make use of the large observational data set of the Gaia
mission to achieve a significant reduction of noise caused by these random
stellar motions. By measuring the differences in velocities between the
components of pairs of co-moving stars and wide binaries, we are able to
statistically measure the combined effects of gravitational redshift and
convective blueshifting of spectral lines, and nullify the effect of the
peculiar motions of the stars. For the subset of stars considered in this
study, we find a positive correlation between the observed differences in Gaia
radial velocities and the differences in surface gravity and convective
blueshift inferred from effective temperature and luminosity measurements. The
results rule out a null signal at the $5\sigma$ level for our full data-set.
Additionally, we study the sub-dominant effects of binary motion, and possible
systematic errors in radial velocity measurements within Gaia. Results from the
technique presented in this study are expected to improve significantly with
data from the next Gaia data release. Such improvements could be used to
constrain the mass-luminosity relation and stellar models which predict the
magnitude of convective blueshift.

also find that the average light quark condensate is in agreement with the

in agreement up to $eB=0.3 {\rm\ GeV^{2}}$, while three-flavor $\chi$PT, which

  Revised version following the referee report",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abf8af",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hot stars with hot Jupiters have a wide range of obliquities, while cool
stars with hot Jupiters tend to have low obliquities. An enticing explanation
for this pattern is tidal realignment of the cool host stars, although this
explanation assumes that obliquity damping occurs faster than orbital decay, an
assumption that needs further exploration. Here we revisit this tidal
realignment problem, building on previous work identifying a low-frequency
component of the time-variable tidal potential that affects the obliquity but
not the orbital separation. We adopt a recent empirically-based model for the
stellar tidal quality factor and its sharp increase with forcing frequency.
This leads to enhanced dissipation at low frequencies, and efficient obliquity
damping. We model the tidal evolution of 46 observed hot Jupiters orbiting cool
stars. A key parameter is the stellar age, which we determine in a homogeneous
manner for the sample, taking advantage of Gaia DR2 data. We explore a variety
of tidal histories and futures for each system, finding in most cases that the
stellar obliquity is successfully damped before the planet is destroyed. A
testable prediction of our model is that hot-Jupiter hosts with orbital periods
shorter than 2--3 days should have obliquities much smaller than $1^\circ$.
With the possible exception of WASP-19b, the predicted future lifetimes of the
planets range from $10^8$\,yr to more than $10^{10}$\,yr. Thus, our model
implies that these hot Jupiters are probably not in immediate danger of being
devoured by their host stars while they are on the main sequence.

the first proposal of a ""fuzzy dark matter"" QCD axion with $m_a\sim10^{-22}$
eV. A novel misalignment mechanism occurs --{\it trapped misalignment}-- due to
the peculiar temperature dependence of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ axion potential.
The dark matter relic density is enhanced because the axion field undergoes two
stages of oscillations: it is first trapped in the wrong minimum, which
effectively delays the onset of true oscillations. Trapped misalignment is more
general than the setup discussed here, and may hold whenever an extra source of
Peccei-Quinn breaking appears at high temperatures. Furthermore, it will be
shown that trapped misalignment can dynamically source the recently proposed
kinetic misalignment mechanism. All the parameter space is within tantalizing
reach of the experimental projects for the next decades. For instance, even
Phase I of CASPEr-Electric could discover this axion.

catalogs containing the flux and size of galaxies extracted from multiband deep
fields carrying inevitable observational and extraction-related biases which
can be highly correlated. In practice, taking all of these effects
simultaneously into account is difficult, and derived models are inevitably
biased. To address this issue, we use robust likelihood-free methods for the
inference of luminosity function parameters, made possible via massive
compression of multiband images using artificial neural networks. This
technique makes the use of catalogs unnecessary when comparing observed and
simulated multiband deep fields and constraining model parameters. A forward
modeling approach generates galaxies of multiple types depending on luminosity
function parameters and paints them on photometric multiband deep fields
including both the instrumental and observational characteristics. The
simulated and the observed images present the same selection effects and can
therefore be properly compared. We train a fully-convolutional neural network
to extract the most model-parameter-sensitive summary statistics out of these
realistic simulations, shrinking down the dimensionality of the summary space.
Finally, using the trained network to compress both observed and simulated deep
fields, the model parameter values are constrained through Population Monte
Carlo likelihood-free inference. Using synthetic photometric multiband deep
fields similar to the CFHTLS and D1/D2 deep fields and massively compressing
them through the convolutional neural network, we demonstrate the robustness,
accuracy and consistency of this new catalog-free inference method. We are able
to constrain the parameters of luminosity functions of different types of
galaxies and our results are fully compatible with the classic catalog
extraction approaches.

which are usually weaker but much more numerous than the well-established class
of FR 1 and FR 2 galaxies. The latter classes have been proposed as sources of
the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies reaching up to
${\sim}10^{20}$ eV. Based on this conjecture, the possibility of UHECR
acceleration and survival in an FR 0 source environment is examined in this
work.
  In doing so, an average spectral energy distribution (SED) based on data from
the FR 0 catalog (FR0CAT) is compiled. The resulting photon fields are used as
targets for UHECRs, which suffer from electromagnetic pair production,
photo-disintegration, photo-meson production losses, and synchrotron radiation.
Multiple mechanisms are discussed to assess the UHECR acceleration probability,
including Fermi-I order and gradual shear accelerations, and particle escape
from the source region.
  This work shows that in a hybrid scenario, combining Fermi and shear
accelerations, FR 0 galaxies can contribute to the observed UHECR flux, as long
as $\Gamma_\mathrm{j}\gtrsim 1.6$, where shear acceleration starts to dominate
over escape. Even in less optimistic scenarios, FR 0s can be expected to
contribute to the cosmic-ray flux between the knee and the ankle. Our results
are relatively robust with respect to the realized magnetic turbulence model
and the speed of the accelerating shocks.

This makes VVV~CL001 possibly the most metal-poor globular cluster identified
so far within the Sun's galactocentric distance and likely one of the most
metal-deficient clusters in the Galaxy after ESO280-SC06. Applying statistical
isochrone fitting, we derive self-consistent age, distance, and reddening
values, yielding an estimated age of $11.9^{+3.12}_{-4.05}$ Gyr at a distance

both the stream RR~Lyrae and Grus II are on a prograde orbit with similar
orbital properties, although the large uncertainties on the dynamical
properties render an unambiguous claim of connection difficult. At the same
time, the chemical analysis strongly weakens the connection between both. We
argue that Grus II in combination with the Orphan stream would have to exhibit
a strong inverse metallicity gradient, which to date has not been detected in

checks, we find that around half (10) of these stellar mass-based measurements
are reliable. For those galaxies, we find good agreement between our results
and previously published pattern speeds, and use rotation curves to calculate
major resonance locations (co-rotation radii and Lindblad resonances). We also
compare these stellar-mass derived pattern speeds with H$\alpha$ (from MUSE)
and CO($J=2{-}1$) emission from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We find that in the
case of these clumpy ISM tracers, this method erroneously gives a signal that
is simply the angular frequency at a representative radius set by the
distribution of these clumps ($\Omega_{\rm clump}$), and that this $\Omega_{\rm
clump}$ is significantly different to $\Omega_{\rm P}$ ($\sim$20% in the case
of H$\alpha$, and $\sim$50% in the case of CO). Thus, we conclude that it is
inadvisable to use ""pattern speeds"" derived from ISM kinematics. Finally, we
compare our derived pattern speeds and co-rotation radii, along with bar
properties, to the global parameters of these galaxies. Consistent with
previous studies, we find that galaxies with a later Hubble type have a larger
ratio of co-rotation radius to bar length, more molecular-gas rich galaxies
have higher $\Omega_{\rm P}$, and more bulge-dominated galaxies have lower
$\Omega_{\rm P}$. Unlike earlier works, however, there are no clear trends
between the bar strength and $\Omega_{\rm P}$, nor between the total stellar

collimated and launched. The high nebular excitation of NGC 2392, which implies
a He$^{++}$/He ionization fraction too high to be attributed to the known
effective temperature of the star, has been proposed in the past to hint at the
presence of a hot white dwarf companion. In conjunction with the hard X-ray
emission from the central star, the present-day jet collimation would support
the presence of such a double-degenerate system where one component undergoes
accretion from a remnant circumbinary disk of the common envelope phase.

challenging because large pixels average fine-scale spatial information. This
is problematic when fine-resolution details are necessary, as in optimal
photometry where knowledge of the illumination pattern beyond the native
spatial resolution of the image may be required. Here, we introduce a method of
PSF reconstruction where point sources are artificially sampled beyond the
native resolution of an image and combined together via stacking to return a
finely sampled estimate of the PSF. This estimate is then deconvolved from the
pixel-gridding function to return a superresolution kernel that can be used for
optimally weighted photometry. We benchmark against the < 1% photometric error
requirement of the upcoming SPHEREx mission to assess performance in a concrete
example. We find that standard methods like Richardson--Lucy deconvolution are
not sufficient to achieve this stringent requirement. We investigate a more
advanced method with significant heritage in image analysis called iterative
back-projection (IBP) and demonstrate it using idealized Gaussian cases and
simulated SPHEREx images. In testing this method on real images recorded by the
LORRI instrument on New Horizons, we are able to identify systematic pointing
drift. Our IBP-derived PSF kernels allow photometric accuracy significantly
better than the requirement in individual SPHEREx exposures. This PSF
reconstruction method is broadly applicable to a variety of problems and
combines computationally simple techniques in a way that is robust to
complicating factors such as severe undersampling, spatially complex PSFs,
noise, crowded fields, or limited source numbers.

obtained taking a combination of both left and right eigenstates shows an
exponential divergence with system size at the transition point. While in the

environment of coupled Ising chains by both effective internal and applied
external fields, which can be both longitudinal and transverse, and thus to
demonstrate how the resulting magnetic phase transitions and the nature of the
associated excited states obey fundamental symmetry properties. In RbCoCl$_3$,
the weakly coupled Ising chains form a triangular lattice whose frustrated
geometry and magnetic ordering transitions at low temperature open new
possibilities for the Ising-chain environment. We have investigated the
structure and magnetism in RbCoCl$_3$ by high-resolution x-ray diffraction and
neutron scattering measurements on powder and single crystal samples between
1.5 K and 300 K. Upon cooling, the Co$^{2+}$ spins develop one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic correlations along the chain axis ($c$-axis) below 90 K.
Below the first N\'eel temperature, $T_{N1}$ = 28 K, a partial 3D magnetic
order sets in, with propagation vector ${\vec k}_1$ = (1/3,1/3,1), the moments
aligned along the $c$-axis and every third chain uncorrelated from its
neighbours. Only below a second magnetic phase transition at $T_{N2}$ = 13 K
does the system achieve a fully ordered state, with two additional propagation
vectors: ${\vec k}_2$ = (0,0,1) establishes a ""honeycomb"" $c$-axis order, in
which 1/3 of the chains are subject to a strong effective mean field due to
their neighbours whereas 2/3 experience no net field, while ${\vec k}_3$ =
(1/2,0,1) governs a small, staggered in-plane ordered moment. We conclude that
RbCoCl$_3$ is an excellent material to study the physics of Ising chains in a
wide variety of temperature-controlled environments.

testing its ability to carry out challenging quantum measurements outside of a
free set of measurements $\mathcal{M}$. A very simple way to do so is to set up
a binary state discrimination task that cannot be solved efficiently by means
of free measurements. If one can find pairs of orthogonal states that become
arbitrarily indistinguishable under measurements in $\mathcal{M}$, in the sense
that the error probability in discrimination approaches that of a random guess,
one says that there is data hiding against $\mathcal{M}$. Here we investigate
data hiding in the context of continuous variable quantum systems. First, we
look at the case where $\mathcal{M}=\mathrm{LOCC}$, the set of measurements
implementable with local operations and classical communication. While previous
studies have placed upper bounds on the maximum efficiency of data hiding in
terms of the local dimension and are thus not applicable to continuous variable
systems, we establish more general bounds that rely solely on the local mean
photon number of the states employed. Along the way, we perform a rigorous
quantitative analysis of the error introduced by the non-ideal
Braunstein-Kimble quantum teleportation protocol, determining how much
squeezing and local detection efficiency is needed in order to teleport an
arbitrary multi-mode local state of known mean energy with a prescribed
accuracy. Finally, following a seminal proposal by Sabapathy and Winter, we
look at data hiding against Gaussian operations assisted by feed-forward of
measurement outcomes, providing the first example of a relatively simple scheme
that works with a single mode only.

catalysis of the intervalley gap generation by the flat band in the electron

(PPDs) is governed by wind-driven accretion, and the resulting accretion flow
showing complex vertical profiles. Such complex flow structures are further
enhanced due to the Hall effect, especially when the background magnetic field
is aligned with disk rotation. We investigate how such flow structures impact
global dust transport via Monte-Carlo simulations, focusing on two scenarios.
In the first scenario, the toroidal magnetic field is maximized in the miplane,
leading to accretion and decretion flows above and below. In the second
scenario, the toroidal field changes sign across the midplane, leading to an
accretion flow at the disk midplane, with decretion flows above and below. We
find that in both cases, the contribution from additional gas flows can still
be accurately incorporated into the advection-diffusion framework for
vertically-integrated dust transport, with enhanced dust radial diffusion up to
an effective $\alpha^{\rm eff}\sim10^{-2}$ for strongly coupled dust, even when
background turbulence is weak $\alpha<10^{-4}$. Dust radial drift is also
modestly enhanced in the second scenario. We provide a general analytical
theory that accurately reproduces our simulation results, thus establishing a
framework to model global dust transport that realistically incorporates
vertical gas flow structures. We also note that the theory is equally
applicable to the transport of chemical species.

substances, be it an overdose, a medication error, or a scorpion sting. The
volume of toxicological knowledge and research has, as with other medical
specialties, outstripped the ability of the individual clinician to entirely
master and stay current with it. The application of machine learning techniques
to medical toxicology is challenging because initial treatment decisions are
often based on a few pieces of textual data and rely heavily on prior
knowledge. ML techniques often do not represent knowledge in a way that is
transparent for the physician, raising barriers to usability. Rule-based
systems and decision tree learning are more transparent approaches, but often
generalize poorly and require expert curation to implement and maintain. Here,
we construct a probabilistic logic network to represent a portion of the

knowledge representation and clinical decision-making of practicing clinicians.
The software, dubbed Tak, performs comparably to humans on straightforward

information about the dynamics of the supernova ejecta and its composition but
very little direct information about the progenitor. Constraining properties of
the progenitor and the explosion requires coupling the observations with a
theoretical model of the explosion. Here, we begin with the CCSN simulations of
Couch et al 2020 ApJ 890 127, which use a non-parametric treatment of the
neutrino transport while also accounting for turbulence and convection. In this
work we use the SuperNova Explosion Code to evolve the CCSN hydrodynamics to
later times and compute bolometric light curves. Focusing on SNe IIP, we then
(1) directly compare the theoretical STIR explosions to observations and (2)
assess how properties of the progenitor's core can be estimated from optical
photometry in the plateau phase alone. First, the distribution of plateau
luminosities (L$_{50}$) and ejecta velocities achieved by our simulations is
similar to the observed distributions. Second, we fit our models to the light
curves and velocity evolution of some well-observed SNe. Third, we recover
well-known correlations, as well as the difficulty of connecting any one SN
property to zero-age main sequence mass. Finally, we show that there is a
usable, linear correlation between iron core mass and L$_{50}$ such that
optical photometry alone of SNe IIP can give us insights into the cores of
massive stars. Illustrating this by application to a few SNe, we find iron core
masses of 1.3-1.5 solar masses with typical errors of ~0.05 solar masses. Data

thin film patterned element and a range of superconducting Nb half-wavelength
co-planar waveguide (CPW) resonators. By varying the volume of the ferromagnet
we demonstrate that the coupling rate scales linearly with the square root of
the number of spins and achieve a coupling rate over 700 MHz, approaching the
ultrastrong coupling regime. Experiments varying the center conductor width
while maintaining constant magnetic volume verify that decreasing the center
conductor width increases coupling and cooperativity. Our results show that the
frequency dependence of the coupling rate is linear with the fundamental and
higher order odd harmonics of the CPW, but with differing efficiencies. The
results show promise for scaling planar superconducting resonator/magnetic
hybrid systems to smaller dimensions.

choice models (DCMs) in predicting travel behavior, but the generalizability of
the findings is limited by the specifics of data, contexts, and authors'
expertise. This study seeks to provide a generalizable empirical benchmark by
comparing hundreds of ML and DCM classifiers in a highly structured manner. The
experiments evaluate both prediction accuracy and computational cost by
spanning four hyper-dimensions, including 105 ML and DCM classifiers from 12
model families, 3 datasets, 3 sample sizes, and 3 outputs. This experimental
design leads to an immense number of 6,970 experiments, which are corroborated
with a meta dataset of 136 experiment points from 35 previous studies. This
study is hitherto the most comprehensive and almost exhaustive comparison of
the classifiers for travel behavioral prediction. We found that the ensemble
methods and deep neural networks achieve the highest predictive performance,
but at a relatively high computational cost. Random forests are the most
computationally efficient, balancing between prediction and computation. While
discrete choice models offer accuracy with only 3-4 percentage points lower
than the top ML classifiers, they have much longer computational time and
become computationally impossible with large sample size, high input
dimensions, or simulation-based estimation. The relative ranking of the ML and
DCM classifiers is highly stable, while the absolute values of the prediction
accuracy and computational time have large variations. Overall, this paper
suggests using deep neural networks, model ensembles, and random forests as
baseline models for future travel behavior prediction. For choice modeling, the
DCM community should switch more attention from fitting models to improving
computational efficiency, so that the DCMs can be widely adopted in the big
data context.

based on the DFT+U method can reduce these errors, but the parameterization and
validation of the correction terms remains an on-going challenge. We develop a
systematic methodology to determine the parameters and to statistically assess
the results by considering thermochemical data across a set of transition metal
compounds. We consider three interconnected levels of correction terms: (1) a
constant oxygen binding correction, (2) Hubbard-U correction, and (3) DFT/DFT+U
compatibility correction. The parameterization is expressed as a unified
optimization problem. We demonstrate this approach for 3d transition metal
oxides, considering a target set of binary and ternary oxides. With a total of
37 measured formation enthalpies taken from the literature, the dataset is
augmented by the reaction energies of 1,710 unique reactions that were derived
from the formation energies by systematic enumeration. To ensure a balanced
dataset across the available data, the reactions were grouped by their
similarity using clustering and suitably weighted. The parameterization is
validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (CV), a standard technique for
the validation of statistical models. We apply the methodology to the SCAN
density functional. Based on the CV score, the error of binary (ternary) oxide
formation energies is reduced by 40% (75%) to 0.10 (0.03) eV/atom. The method
and tools demonstrated here can be applied to other classes of materials or to
parameterize the corrections to optimize DFT+U performance for other target
physical properties.

this paper we introduce a novel framework that we call Deep Musical Information
Dynamics, which combines two parallel streams - a low rate latent
representation stream that is assumed to capture the dynamics of a thought
process contrasted with a higher rate information dynamics derived from the
musical data itself. Motivated by rate-distortion theories of human cognition
we propose a framework for exploring possible relations between imaginary
anticipations existing in the listener's mind and information dynamics of the
musical surface itself. This model is demonstrated for the case of symbolic
(MIDI) data, as accounting for acoustic surface would require many more layers
to capture instrument properties and performance expressive inflections. The
mathematical framework is based on variational encoding that first establishes
a high rate representation of the musical observations, which is then reduced
using a bit-allocation method into a parallel low rate data stream. The
combined loss considered here includes both the information rate in terms of
time evolution for each stream, and the fidelity of encoding measured in terms
of mutual information between the high and low rate representations. In the
simulations presented in the paper we are able to juxtapose aspects of
latent/imaginary surprisal versus surprisal of the music surface in a manner
that is quantifiable and computationally tractable. The set of computational

means that allocating individuals to risk groups based on standard approaches
to risk assessment, in large part, results in creating distinctions among
individuals who are not meaningfully different in terms of their likelihood of

probability of requiring mechanical ventilation. A challenge in the risk
prediction for COVID-19 patients lies in the great variability and irregular
sampling of patient's vitals and labs observed in the clinical setting.
Existing methods have strong limitations in handling time-dependent features'
complex dynamics, either oversimplifying temporal data with summary statistics
that lose information or over-engineering features that lead to less robust
outcomes. We propose a novel in-time risk trajectory predictive model to handle
the irregular sampling rate in the data, which follows the dynamics of risk of
performing mechanical ventilation for individual patients. The model
incorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process using observed values to learn the
posterior joint multi-variant conditional probability and infer the missing
values on a unified time grid. The temporal imputed data is fed into a
multi-objective self-attention network for the prediction task. A novel
positional encoding layer is proposed and added to the network for producing
in-time predictions. The positional layer outputs a risk score at each
user-defined time point during the entire hospital stay of an inpatient. We
frame the prediction task into a multi-objective learning framework, and the
risk scores at all time points are optimized altogether, which adds robustness
and consistency to the risk score trajectory prediction. Our experimental
evaluation on a large database with nationwide in-hospital patients with
COVID-19 also demonstrates that it improved the state-of-the-art performance in

marginal increase in utility deliverable by an item. (For integer-valued
utility functions, we show a bound of $H(Q)$, where $H(Q)$ is the $Q^{th}$

Nan and Saligrama (2017). The subsequent corrected proof of Golovin and Krause
(2017) gives a quadratic bound of $(\ln(Q/\eta) + 1)^2$. Other previous bounds
for the problem are $56(\ln(Q/\eta) + 1)$, implied by work of Im et al. (2016)

$f$-mirror symmetry is induced by framed duality of framed toric varieties
extending Batyrev-Borisov polar duality between Fano toric varieties. Framed
duality has been defined and essentially well described for families of
hypersurfaces in toric varieties in the previous \cite{R-fTV}. Here it is
developed for families of complete intersections, allowing us to strengthening
some previous results on hypersurfaces. In particular, the class of projective
complete intersections and their mirror partners are studied in detail.
Moreover, a (generalized) Landau-Ginzburg/Complete-Intersection correspondence

relevance for meeting global energy needs and mitigating the environmental
consequences of fossil-fuel-based transportation. Water photoelectrolysis has
been proposed as a viable approach for generating hydrogen, provided that
stable and inexpensive photocatalysts with conversion efficiencies over 10% can
be discovered, synthesized at scale, and successfully deployed (Pinaud et al.,
Energy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 1983). While a number of first-principles
studies have focused on the data-driven discovery of photocatalysts, in the
absence of systematic experimental validation, the success rate of these
predictions may be limited. We address this problem by developing a screening
procedure with co-validation between experiment and theory to expedite the
synthesis, characterization, and testing of the computationally predicted, most
desirable materials. Starting with 70,150 compounds in the Materials Project
database, the proposed protocol yielded 71 candidate photocatalysts, 11 of
which were synthesized as single-phase materials. Experiments confirmed
hydrogen generation and favorable band alignment for 6 of the 11 compounds,
with the most promising ones belonging to the families of alkali and
alkaline-earth indates and orthoplumbates. This study shows the accuracy of a
nonempirical, Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory method to predict
band gaps and band offsets at a fraction of the computational cost of hybrid
functionals, and outlines an effective strategy to identify photocatalysts for
solar hydrogen generation.

prevention measures is important to the field of public health. In infectious
disease studies, one person's treatment may affect another individual's
outcome, i.e., there may be interference between units. For example, use of bed
nets to prevent malaria by one individual may have an indirect or spillover
effect to other individuals living in close proximity. In some settings,
individuals may form groups or clusters where interference only occurs within
groups, i.e., there is partial interference. Inverse probability weighted
estimators have previously been developed for observational studies with
partial interference. Unfortunately, these estimators are not well suited for
studies with large clusters. Therefore, in this paper, the parametric g-formula
is extended to allow for partial interference. G-formula estimators are
proposed of overall effects, spillover effects when treated, and spillover
effects when untreated. The proposed estimators can accommodate large clusters
and do not suffer from the g-null paradox that may occur in the absence of
interference. The large sample properties of the proposed estimators are
derived, and simulation studies are presented demonstrating the finite-sample
performance of the proposed estimators. The Demographic and Health Survey from
the Democratic Republic of the Congo is then analyzed using the proposed
g-formula estimators to assess the overall and spillover effects of bed net use
on malaria.

BERT's pre-trained model, and the relationship between labels and entities,

fine-tuning BERT on a structured input, including the sub-tree connecting an
entity pair and the entities' types. Using the extracted informative vectors,
we shape label embeddings, which we also use as attention mechanism over
instances to further reduce noise. Finally, we represent sentences by
concatenating relation and instance embeddings. Experiments in the NYT-10

as the most practical real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) approach.
Among the proposed unsupervised techniques in the literature, there are still
obstacles to robust and real-time health monitoring. These barriers include
loss of information from dimensionality reduction in feature extraction steps,
case-dependency of those steps, lack of a dynamic clustering, and detection
results' sensitivity to user-defined parameters. This study introduces an
unsupervised real-time SHM method with a mixture of low- and high-dimensional
features without a case-dependent extraction scheme. Both features are used to
train multi-ensembles of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and one-class
joint Gaussian distribution models (1-CG). A novelty detection system of
limit-state functions based on GAN and 1-CG models' detection scores is
constructed. The Resistance of those limit-state functions (detection
thresholds) is tuned to user-defined parameters with the GAN-generated data
objects by employing the Monte Carlo histogram sampling through a
reliability-based analysis. The tuning makes the method robust to user-defined
parameters, which is crucial as there is no rule for selecting those parameters
in a real-time SHM. The proposed novelty detection framework is applied to two
standard SHM datasets to illustrate its generalizability: Yellow Frame (twenty
damage classes) and Z24 Bridge (fifteen damage classes). All different damage
categories are identified with low sensitivity to the initial choice of
user-defined parameters with both introduced dynamic and static baseline
approaches with few or no false alarms.

Despite the tremendous growth of computational power in the past decades,
modeling of fluid flows at engineering and system scales with a direct

result, several different physics-based methodologies were historically
suggested in an attempt to ""bridge"" the existing scaling gaps. In this paper,
the origin of the scaling gaps in computational fluid dynamics and thermal

The discussion is supplemented by a review, classification, and discussion of
the physics-based multiscale modeling approaches. The classification is based
on the existing in literature ones and distinguishes serial and concurrent
approaches (based on the information flow between micro- and macro-models) with
their variations. Possible applications of the data-driven (machine learning
and statistics-based) methods for enabling and / or improving multiscale

classification distinguishes error correction (hybrid) models; closure modeling
(turbulence models, two-phase and thermal fluid closures); and approaches aimed
at the facilitation of the concurrent physics-based multiscale modeling
approaches. A comprehensive review of data-driven approaches for turbulence

self-supervision and a rotation equivariance constraint on predicted rotations.
The remarkable result is that with only self-supervision, ART facilitates
learning a unique canonical orientation for both rigid and nonrigid shapes,
which leads to a notable boost in performance of aforementioned tasks. We will

geminal-product wavefunctions. The universality of this framework suggests a
programming structure that allows for the easy construction and optimization of
arbitrary wavefunctions. Here, we will discuss the structures of the FANCI

accuracy, cost, and size-consistency. We demonstrate the flexibility of this

domain deep network for calibrationless recovery of undersampled PMRI data. The
proposed approach is the deep-learning (DL) based generalization of local
low-rank based approaches for uncalibrated PMRI recovery including CLEAR [6].
Since the image domain approach exploits additional annihilation relations
compared to k-space based approaches, we expect it to offer improved
performance. To minimize segmentation errors resulting from undersampling
artifacts, we combined the proposed scheme with a segmentation network and
trained it in an end-to-end fashion. In addition to reducing segmentation
errors, this approach also offers improved reconstruction performance by
reducing overfitting; the reconstructed images exhibit reduced blurring and
sharper edges than independently trained reconstruction network.

many researchers have adopted alternative data sources from private data

available and dynamically evolving as real-world events are happening, making
it more likely to capture the real-time sentiments and responses of
populations. However, precisely-geolocated geosocial data is scarce and biased
toward urban population centers. In this research, we developed a big geosocial
data analytical framework for extracting human movement dynamics in response to
large-scale events from publicly available georeferenced tweets. The framework
includes a two-stage data collection module that collects data in a more
targeted fashion in order to mitigate the data scarcity issue of georeferenced
tweets; in addition, a variable bandwidth kernel density estimation(VB-KDE)
approach was adopted to fuse georeference information at different spatial
scales, further augmenting the signals of human movement dynamics contained in
georeferenced tweets. To correct for the sampling bias of georeferenced tweets,
we adjusted the number of tweets for different spatial units (e.g., county,
state) by population. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed analytic
framework, we chose an astronomical event that occurred nationwide across the
United States, i.e., the 2017 Great American Eclipse, as an example event and
studied the human movement dynamics in response to this event. However, this
analytic framework can easily be applied to other types of large-scale events

using endomorphisms of $M$, which produce a decomposition of the ring

this can be done, in the commutative case in a simple way using the support,
$\textrm{Supp}(M)$, of $M$; but, in general, it is not so easy. Once we know
when a module decomposes, we look for characterizing its decompositions. We

the NS surface. We also report the discovery of a downward frequency drift in
three observations of 4U 1608--52, making it the third source that shows this
behaviour. We only find strong evidence of frequency drift in one occasion in
Aql X--1, probably because the observations were too short to measure a
significant drift. Finally, the mHz QPOs are mainly detected when both sources
are in the soft or intermediate states; the cases that show frequency drift
only occur when the sources are in intermediate states. Our results are
consistent with the phenomenology observed for the NS systems 4U 1636--53 and

to 1.5x10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$. They avoid the central, virialised region of the
cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are
recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, ~2 Gyr.
Half of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several
cases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case
of a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have been interacting within or on
their way to Fornax. Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars at a lower
rate than non-cluster galaxies in the same $M_\star$ range. Low mass galaxies
are more strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster. The
MHI/$M_\star$ ratio of Fornax galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo
cluster. At fixed $M_\star$, our HI detections follow the non-cluster relation
between MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies that so
far they have lost their HI on a timescale $\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr. Deeper inside the
cluster HI removal is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of
HI-undetected but H$_2$-detected star-forming galaxies. Based on ALMA data, we
find a large scatter in H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies showing
an unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal.
  We identify an HI-rich subgroup of possible interacting galaxies dominated by
NGC 1365, where pre-processing is likey to have taken place.

astrophysics, chemistry, biology, economics, engineering and social science. A
complex system is featured with a large number of interacting components
(agents, processes, etc.), whose aggregate activities are nonlinear and
self-organized. Complex systems are hard to be simulated or modelled by using
traditional computational approaches due to complex relationships among system
components, distributed features of resources, and dynamics of environments.
Meanwhile, smart systems such as multi-agent systems have demonstrated
advantages and great potentials in modelling and simulating complex systems.

previously built map. The integration of the relocalization poses is threefold.
Firstly, they are incorporated as pose priors in the direct image alignment of
the front-end tracking. Secondly, they are tightly integrated into the back-end
bundle adjustment. Thirdly, an online fusion module is further proposed to
combine relative VO poses and global relocalization poses in a pose graph to
estimate keyframe-wise smooth and globally accurate poses. We evaluate our
method on two multi-weather datasets showing the benefits of integrating
different handcrafted and learned features and demonstrating promising
improvements on camera tracking accuracy.

compare the adoption of traditional server (TS) and disaggregated server (DS)

that the adoption of DS improves the energy efficiency of the fog network and
enables up to 18% reduction in total fog computing power consumption. More
instances of interactive fog apps are provisioned in a fog network that is
implemented over a network topology with high delay penalty. This ensures that
minimal delay is experienced by distributed users. Our result also shows that
the proximity of fog computing sites such as metro-central offices and radio
cell sites to geo-distributed users of interactive fog applications make them
important edge locations for provisioning moderately delay sensitive fog apps.
However, fog applications with more stringent delay thresholds require in situ
processing at directly connected radio cell sites or at the location of the
requesting users. Finally, we propose a heuristic for energy efficient and
delay aware placement of interactive fog apps in a fog network which replicates
the trends observed during comprehensive analysis of the exact results obtained

instrumental variables (IV) quantile regression (QR) model. The quantile
first-stage is analogous to the least squares case, i.e., a linear projection
of the endogenous variables on the instruments and other exogenous covariates,
with the difference that the QR case is a weighted projection. The weights are
given by the conditional density function of the innovation term in the QR
structural model, conditional on the endogeneous and exogenous covariates, and
the instruments as well, at a given quantile. We also show that the required
Jacobian identification conditions for IVQR models are embedded in the quantile
first-stage. We then suggest inference procedures to evaluate the adequacy of
instruments by evaluating their statistical significance using the first-stage
result. The test is developed in an over-identification context, since
consistent estimation of the weights for implementation of the first-stage
requires at least one valid instrument to be available. Monte Carlo experiments
provide numerical evidence that the proposed tests work as expected in terms of
empirical size and power in finite samples. An empirical application
illustrates that checking for the statistical significance of the instruments
at different quantiles is important. The proposed procedures may be specially
useful in QR since the instruments may be relevant at some quantiles but not at

depinning, and many other systems can be modelled as an elastic system subject
to quenched disorder. Its field theory possesses a well-controlled perturbative
expansion around its upper critical dimension. Contrary to standard field
theory, the renormalization group flow involves a function, the disorder
correlator $\Delta(w)$, therefore termed the functional renormalization group
(FRG). $\Delta(w)$ is a physical observable, the auto-correlation function of
the centre of mass of the elastic manifold. In this review, we give a
pedagogical introduction into its phenomenology and techniques. This allows us
to treat both equilibrium (statics), and depinning (dynamics). Building on
these techniques, avalanche observables are accessible: distributions of size,
duration, and velocity, as well as the spatial and temporal shape. Various
equivalences between disordered elastic manifolds, and sandpile models exist:
an elastic string driven at a point and the Oslo model; disordered elastic
manifolds and Manna sandpiles; charge density waves and Abelian sandpiles or
loop-erased random walks. Each of these mappings requires specific techniques,
which we develop, including modelling of discrete stochastic systems via
coarse-grained stochastic equations of motion, super-symmetry techniques, and
cellular automata. Stronger than quadratic nearest-neighbour interactions lead
to directed percolation, and non-linear surface growth with additional KPZ
terms. On the other hand, KPZ without disorder can be mapped back to disordered
elastic manifolds, either on the directed polymer for its steady state, or a
single particle for its decay. Other topics covered are the relation between
functional RG and replica symmetry breaking, and random field magnets. Emphasis
is given to numerical and experimental tests of the theory.

envelope of evolved solar-like stars could be the signature of a strong
magnetic field trapped inside the radiative interior. The population of
intermediate-mass red giants presenting a surprisingly low-amplitude of their
mixed modes could also arise from the effect of an internal magnetic field.
Indeed, stars more massive than about 1.1Ms are known to develop a convective
core during their main sequence, which could relax into a strong fossil
magnetic field trapped inside the core of the star for the rest of its
evolution. The observations of mixed modes can constitute an excellent probe of
the deepest layers of evolved solar-like stars. The magnetic perturbation on
mixed modes may thus be visible in asteroseismic data. To unravel which
constraints can be obtained from observations, we theoretically investigate the
effects of a plausible mixed axisymmetric magnetic field with various
amplitudes on the mixed-mode frequencies of evolved solar-like stars. The
first-order frequency perturbations are computed for dipolar and quadrupolar
mixed modes. These computations are carried out for a range of stellar ages,
masses, and metallicities. We show that typical fossil-field strengths of 0.1-1
MG, consistent with the presence of a dynamo in the convective core during the
main sequence, provoke significant asymmetries on mixed-mode frequency
multiplets during the red-giant branch. We show that these signatures may be
detectable in asteroseismic data for field amplitudes small enough for the
amplitude of the modes not to be affected by the conversion of gravity into
Alfven waves inside the magnetised interior. Finally, we infer an upper limit
for the strength of the field, and the associated lower limit for the timescale
of its action, to redistribute angular momentum in stellar interiors.

between a pair of cells based on their gene expression profiles obtained via
single-cell RNA sequencing. The underlying idea of the proposed distance is to
interpret the gene expression array of a single cell as a discrete probability
measure. The distance between two cells is hence computed by solving an Optimal
Transport problem between the two corresponding discrete measures. In the
Optimal Transport model, we use two types of cost function for measuring the
distance between a pair of genes. The first cost function exploits a gene
embedding, called gene2vec, which is used to map each gene to a high
dimensional vector: the cost of moving a unit of mass of gene expression from a
gene to another is set to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding
embedded vectors. The second cost function is based on a Pearson distance among
pairs of genes. In both cost functions, the more two genes are correlated, the
lower is their distance. We exploit the Gene Mover's Distance to solve two
classification problems: the classification of cells according to their
condition and according to their type. To assess the impact of our new metric,
we compare the performances of a $k$-Nearest Neighbor classifier using
different distances. The computational results show that the Gene Mover's
Distance is competitive with the state-of-the-art distances used in the
literature.

interfacial strain. Nanocrystals that have a fully pseudomorphic interface with
the substrate (i.e. the epitaxial strain is not relaxed) form an embedded
smooth ball-crown morphology with {001}, {011}, {111} and high-index {113}

recently introduced Flexible Ansatz for N-electron Configuration Interaction

with Slater determinants of orthonormal spin-orbitals. In the simplest case, a
new wavefunction ansatz can be implemented by simply writing a function for

in both implementation and theory: the wavefunction model, the system's
Hamiltonian, and the choice of objective function are all independent modules.
This modular structure makes it easy for users to mix and match different
methods and for developers to quickly try new ideas. Fanpy is written purely in
Python with standard dependencies, making it accessible for most operating
systems; it adheres to principles of modern software development, including
comprehensive documentation, extensive testing, and continuous integration and
delivery protocols. This article is considered to be the official release notes

the complexity of regret analysis. We propose a novel multi-armed contextual
bandit algorithm called Doubly Robust (DR) Thompson Sampling employing the
doubly-robust estimator used in missing data literature to Thompson Sampling
with contexts (\texttt{LinTS}). Different from previous works relying on
missing data techniques (\citet{dimakopoulou2019balanced},
\citet{kim2019doubly}), the proposed algorithm is designed to allow a novel
additive regret decomposition leading to an improved regret bound with the
order of $\tilde{O}(\phi^{-2}\sqrt{T})$, where $\phi^2$ is the minimum
eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of contexts. This is the first regret bound
of \texttt{LinTS} using $\phi^2$ without the dimension of the context, $d$.
Applying the relationship between $\phi^2$ and $d$, the regret bound of the
proposed algorithm is $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ in many practical scenarios,
improving the bound of \texttt{LinTS} by a factor of $\sqrt{d}$. A benefit of
the proposed method is that it utilizes all the context data, chosen or not
chosen, thus allowing to circumvent the technical definition of unsaturated
arms used in theoretical analysis of \texttt{LinTS}. Empirical studies show the

maximize spectral efficiency of the users by minimizing the mean square error

formulated under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. First, block
coordinate descent (BCD) is used to decouple the joint optimization into two
sub-optimization problems to separately find the optimal active precoder at the
base station (BS) and the optimal matrix of phase shifters for the IRS. While
the MMSE active precoder is obtained in a closed form, the optimal phase

oxidizing environments at high temperatures. Measurements of the thermal

process with high spatial resolution. We use time domain thermoreflectance
(TDTR) to map the thermal conductance of the oxide layer and the thermal
conductivity of the SiC SiC composite with a spatial resolution of 3 {\mu}m.
Heterodyne detection using a 50 kHz modulated probe beam and a 10 MHz modulated
pump suppresses the coherent pick-up and enables faster data acquisition than
what has previously been possible using sequential demodulation. By analyzing
the noise of the measured signals, we find that in the limit of small
integration time constants or low laser powers, the dominant source of noise is
the input noise of the preamplifier. The thermal conductance of the oxide that
forms on the fiber region is lower than the oxide on the matrix due to small
differences in thickness and thermal conductivity.

in galaxies from first principles. We show that metallicity gradients depend on
four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration timescale,
production, transport, consumption, and loss. Our model finds that most galaxy
metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts. When normalized by
metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between
radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the
cosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in
local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We use
the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing
that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good
agreement with both observations and simulations. We also predict the evolution
of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both
matched stellar masses and matched abundances. Our model shows that massive
galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated
regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from
gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence. Lastly, we show
that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and
inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be
in equilibrium. In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model
also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity
gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.

transients is analogous to GN-z11-flash, and none of them is positionally
coincident with a known object in their imaging data. In Jiang et al., we
performed a comprehensive analysis of the origin of GN-z11-flash and ruled out,
to the best of our knowledge, the possibility of known man-made objects or
moving objects in the Solar system, based on all available information and our
current understanding of these objects. Steinhardt et al. did not use such
information and did not analyse the GN-z11-flash event itself. The majority of
their transients are apparently low-Earth orbit satellites or aircrafts.
Therefore, their analysis can neither prove nor disprove our results. Finally,
we present a method to estimate the chance probability of finding

by an irrevocable, one-time allocation. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence
of demands, we establish upper bounds on the expected minimum fill rate
(ex-post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness)
achievable by any policy. Our upper bounds are parameterized by the number of
agents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, yet we design a simple adaptive

achieves matching lower bounds for both objectives (ex-post and ex-ante

accumulated energy or maximum energy per node. We prove that the hop count for
an end-to-end transmission is bounded by $O(n^{1-\alpha/(d_F-1)})$ where
$\alpha<1$ and $d_F>2$ is the fractal dimension of the mobile nodes process.
This proves that for both constraints the energy decreases as we allow choosing
routing paths of higher length. The asymptotic limit of the energy becomes
significantly small when the number of nodes becomes asymptotically large. A
lower bound on the network throughput capacity with constraints on path energy
is also given. We show that our model fits real deployments where open data

defined by referring to stretch resulting in removing faulty links. We develop
algorithms that rely only on nodes knowing their own names and the ability to
associate communication with local ports. A network has $n$ nodes and it starts
with $m$ functional links. We give a general algorithm operating in time $n$

driving current. In the SyAF multilayer with a given total thickness, the
current-induced deformation of the SyAF skyrmion tube decreases with an
increasing number of interfaces; namely, the rigidity of the SyAF skyrmion tube
with a given thickness increases with the number of ferromagnetic (FM) layers.
For the SyAF multilayer with an even number of FM layers, the skyrmion Hall
effect can be eliminated when the thicknesses of all FM layers are identical.
Larger damping parameter leads to smaller deformation and slower speed of the
SyAF skyrmion tube. Larger fieldlike torque leads to larger deformation and a
higher speed of the SyAF skyrmion tube. Our results are useful for
understanding the dynamic behaviors of three-dimensional topological spin
textures and may provide guidelines for building SyAF spintronic devices.

the spacetime with a boundary. However, the anomalous current is suppressed by
the mass of charge carriers and the distance to the boundary, which makes it
difficult to be measured. In this paper, we explore the possible mechanisms for
the enhancement of anomalous currents. Interestingly, we find that the
anomalous current can be significantly enhanced by the high temperature, which
makes easier the experimental detection. For free theories, the anomalous
current is proportional to the temperature in the high temperature limit. Note
that the currents can be enhanced by thermal effects only at high temperatures.
In general, this is not the case at low temperatures. For general temperatures,
the absolute value of the current of Neumann boundary condition first decreases
and then increases with the temperature, while the current of Dirichlet
boundary condition always increases with the temperature. It should be
mentioned that the enhancement does not have an anomalous nature. In fact, the
so-called anomalous current in this paper is not always related to Weyl
anomaly. Instead, it is an anomalous effect due to the boundary.

various anatomical segmentation tasks. Despite the success, these methods can
be sensitive to data appearance variations. Considering the large variability
of scans caused by artifacts, pathologies, and scanning setups, robust ConvNets
are vital for clinical applications, while have not been fully explored. In
this paper, we propose to mitigate the challenge by enabling ConvNets'
awareness of the underlying anatomical invariances among imaging scans.
Specifically, we introduce a fully convolutional Constraint Adoption Module
(CAM) that incorporates probabilistic atlas priors as explicit constraints for
predictions over a locally connected Conditional Random Field (CFR), which
effectively reinforces the anatomical consistency of the labeling outputs. We
design the CAM to be flexible for boosting various ConvNet, and compact for
co-optimizing with ConvNets for fusion parameters that leads to the optimal
performance. We show the advantage of such atlas priors fusion is two-fold with
two brain parcellation tasks. First, our models achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy among ConvNet-based methods on both datasets, by significantly
reducing structural abnormalities of predictions. Second, we can largely boost
the robustness of existing ConvNets, proved by: (i) testing on scans with
synthetic pathologies, and (ii) training and evaluation on scans of different
scanning setups across datasets. Our method is proposing to be easily adopted
to existing ConvNets by fine-tuning with CAM plugged in for accuracy and
robustness boosts.

asymmetric solution for axisymmetric strain ($a = 1/2$) in which half of the

symmetric and antisymmetric steady solutions $\forall a \ge 0$, it is shown
that for $a < 1$, i.e., anything less than the Townsend case, the vorticity
inherently decays in time: only boundary conditions that maintain a supply of
vorticity at one or both ends lead to a non-zero steady state. For the
super-Townsend case $a > 1$, steady states have a sheath of opposite sign
vorticity. Comparison is made with homogeneous-isotropic turbulence in which
case the average vorticity in the strain eigenframe is layer-like, has wings of
opposite vorticity, and the strain configuration is found to be super-Townsend.
Only zero-integral perturbations of the $a > 1$ steady solutions are stable;

  Transformation","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) based image coding has become a hot
topic in image processing field. However, since the bit depth required for
encoding each CS sample is too large, the compression performance of this
paradigm is unattractive. To address this issue, a novel CS-based image coding
system by using gray transformation is proposed. In the proposed system, we use
a gray transformation to preprocess the original image firstly and then use CS
to sample the transformed image. Since gray transformation makes the
probability distribution of CS samples centralized, the bit depth required for
encoding each CS sample is reduced significantly. Consequently, the proposed
system can considerably improve the compression performance of CS-based image
coding. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms the
traditional one without using gray transformation in terms of compression
performance.

thermodynamic equilibrium in the limit that $N \to \infty$. We show that the
values of the critical exponents obtained by varying $\lambda$ for a fixed

language-based setting of this task allows for an open set of target
activities, resulting in a large variation of the temporal lengths of video
moments. Most existing methods prefer to first sample sufficient candidate
moments with various temporal lengths, and then match them with the given query
to determine the target moment. However, candidate moments generated with a
fixed temporal granularity may be suboptimal to handle the large variation in
moment lengths. To this end, we propose a novel multi-stage Progressive
Localization Network (PLN) which progressively localizes the target moment in a
coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, each stage of PLN has a localization
branch, and focuses on candidate moments that are generated with a specific
temporal granularity. The temporal granularities of candidate moments are
different across the stages. Moreover, we devise a conditional feature
manipulation module and an upsampling connection to bridge the multiple
localization branches. In this fashion, the later stages are able to absorb the
previously learned information, thus facilitating the more fine-grained
localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed PLN for language-based moment localization,
especially for localizing short moments in long videos.

normal and monotonically increases with decreasing effective magnetic layer
thickness ($t_\mathrm{eff}$). The magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
exchange constant ($|D|$) increases with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$ until
$t_\mathrm{eff} \sim$1 nm, below which $|D|$ decreases. The MCA and $|D|$ scale
with $1/t_\mathrm{eff}$ for $t_\mathrm{eff}$ larger than $\sim$1 nm, indicating
an interfacial origin. The increase of MCA with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$
continues below $t_\mathrm{eff}$ $\sim$ 1 nm, but with a slower rate. To
clarify the cause of the $t_\mathrm{eff}$ dependences of MCA and DMI, the OMA
of Co in W/Co/Pt trilayers is studied using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD). We find non-zero OMA when $t_\mathrm{eff}$ is smaller than $\sim$0.8
nm. The OMA increases with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$ more rapidly than what

the MCA at small $t_\mathrm{eff}$. The $t_\mathrm{eff}$ dependence of the OMA
also suggests that $|D|$ at $t_\mathrm{eff}$ smaller than $\sim$1 nm is not
related to the OMA at the interface. We propose that the growth of Co on W
results in a strain and/or texture that reduces the interfacial DMI, and, to
some extent, MCA at small $t_\mathrm{eff}$.

implementation of DCNN in skin disease detection is hindered by small size and
data imbalance of the publically accessible skin lesion datasets. This paper
proposes a novel single-model based strategy for classification of skin lesions

introduced to overcome the challenge of uneven sample size and classification

combining Modified RandAugment, MWNL and CLS, our single DCNN model method
achieved the classification accuracy comparable or superior to those of
multiple ensembling models on different dermoscopic image datasets. Our study
shows that this method is able to achieve a high classification performance at

bands will provide precise measurements on $H(z)$ covering the redshift ranges
of $2<z<5$ and $0<z<0.3$. In addition, gravitational wave (GW) standard siren
observations could make measurements on the dipole anisotropy of luminosity
distance, which will also provide the $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range
of $0<z<3$. In this work, we propose a multi-messenger and multi-wavelength
observational strategy to measure $H(z)$ based on the three next-generation
projects, E-ELT, SKA, and DECIGO, and we wish to see whether the future $H(z)$
measurements could provide tight constraints on dark-energy parameters. The
dark energy models we consider include $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, CPL, HDE, and
I$\Lambda$CDM models. It is found that E-ELT, SKA1, and DECIGO are highly
complementary in constraining dark energy models. Although any one of these
three data sets can only give rather weak constraints on each model we
consider, the combination of them could significantly break the parameter
degeneracies and give much tighter constraints on almost all the cosmological
parameters. Moreover, we find that the combination of E-ELT, SKA1, DECIGO, and
CMB could further improve the constraints on dark energy parameters, e.g.,
$\sigma(w_0)=0.024$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.17$ in the CPL model, which means that
these three promising probes will play a key role in helping reveal the nature
of dark energy.

in an unsupervised, fine-tuning setting. When we train increasingly large
neural networks from-scratch on a fixed-size dataset, they eventually become
data-limited and stop improving in performance (cross-entropy loss). When we do
the same for models pre-trained on a large language dataset, the slope in
performance gains is merely reduced rather than going to zero. We calculate the
effective data ""transferred"" from pre-training by determining how much data a
transformer of the same size would have required to achieve the same loss when
training from scratch. In other words, we focus on units of data while holding
everything else fixed. We find that the effective data transferred is described
well in the low data regime by a power-law of parameter count and fine-tuning
dataset size. We believe the exponents in these power-laws correspond to
measures of the generality of a model and proximity of distributions (in a
directed rather than symmetric sense). We find that pre-training effectively
multiplies the fine-tuning dataset size. Transfer, like overall performance,
scales predictably in terms of parameters, data, and compute.

two-dimensional circular cylinder using numerical simulations in the laminar
regime. The aim is to explore one of the passive control techniques, which
involves the introduction of a slit to the geometry of the cylinder. The two
parameters, slit width ratio S/D (slit width/diameter) and slit angle (measured
with respect to the incoming flow direction), play an essential role in
determining the trend of critical Reynolds number (Rec). Most of the analysis
invokes flow visualization and saturation amplitude methods to obtain the
critical Reynolds number (indicative of the onset of vortex shedding) for
different cases. Further, Hopf bifurcation analysis using Stuart-Landau
equation and global stability analysis confirm the accuracy and consistency in
the predicted solutions. The additional amount of flow through slit increases
the pressure downstream of the cylinder, which consequently leads to an
increase in Rec of the modified cylinder. The critical Reynolds number
increases with S/D of the modified cylinder at 0 deg slit angle (as an
additional amount of flow grows with S/D). The critical Reynolds number shows
an increasing trend with the slit angle in the range of S/D (0.05-0.15) as the
fluctuation intensity reduces with slit angle in this range. For S/D=
0.15-0.25, the extra amount of flow through slit induces the instability in
wake which causes a decrease in Rec with slit angle. A correlation is obtained
that estimates the critical Reynolds number for a given S/D and slit angle.

inviscid theoretical model is utilized to calculate the lift coefficient for

early neural responses to stimuli in fast-changing displays contain remarkable
information about the sensory environment but are also modulated by attention

an inhomogeneous external magnetic field. The Lagrangian and the equations of
motion of antiferromagnetic spins under an inhomogeneous magnetic field are
derived, first in terms of the N\'eel vector, and then using collective
coordinates of the domain wall. A solution is found that describes the
actuation of a domain wall by an inhomogeneous field, in which the motion is
initiated by a paramagnetic response of wall magnetization, which is then
driven by a Stern-Gerlach like force. The effects of pinning potential are also
investigated. These results are in good agreement with atomistic simulations.
While the present formulation contains the so-called intrinsic magnetization
associated with N\'eel texture, a supplementary discussion is given to
reformulate the theory in terms of physical magnetization without the intrinsic

magnetic island coalescence problem is studied in the presence of in-plane,
parallel shear flows. Extending the analytical work of Waelbroeck et al [33]
and Throumoulopoulos et al [34] in the sub-Alfv\'enic flow shear regime for
Fadeev equilibrium, the super-Alfv\'enic regime is studied for the first time
numerically. A wide range of values of shear flow amplitudes and shear scale
lengths have been considered to understand the effect of sub-Alfv\'enic and
super-Alfv\'enic flows on the coalescence instability and its nonlinear fate.
We find that for flow shear length scales greater than the magnetic island
size, the maximum reconnection rate decreases monotonically from sub-Alfv\'enic
to super- Alfv\'enic flow speeds. For scale lengths smaller than the island
size, the reconnection rate decreases upto a critical value $v_{0c}$, beyond
which, the shear flow is found to destabilize the islands. The value of v0c
decreases with decrease in the value of shear flow length scale. Interestingly,
for our range of parameters, we find suppression of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in super-Alfv\'enic flows even when the shear scale length is
smaller than the island width. Observation of velocity streamlines shows that
the plasma circulation inside the islands has a stabilizing influence in strong
shear flow cases. Plasma circulation is also found to be responsible for
decrease in upstream velocity, causing less pile-up of magnetic flux on both
sides of the reconnection sheet.

tomography images are preoperative prerequisites for orthodontic treatments.
Instance segmentation methods using convolutional neural networks have
demonstrated ground-breaking results on individual tooth segmentation tasks,
and are used in various medical imaging applications. While point-based
detection networks achieve superior results on dental images, it is still a
challenging task to distinguish adjacent teeth because of their similar
topologies and proximate nature. In this study, we propose a point-based tooth
localization network that effectively disentangles each individual tooth based
on a Gaussian disentanglement objective function. The proposed network first
performs heatmap regression accompanied by box regression for all the
anatomical teeth. A novel Gaussian disentanglement penalty is employed by
minimizing the sum of the pixel-wise multiplication of the heatmaps for all
adjacent teeth pairs. Subsequently, individual tooth segmentation is performed
by converting a pixel-wise labeling task to a distance map regression task to
minimize false positives in adjacent regions of the teeth. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
by increasing the average precision of detection by 9.1%, which results in a
high performance in terms of individual tooth segmentation. The primary
significance of the proposed method is two-fold: 1) the introduction of a
point-based tooth detection framework that does not require additional
classification and 2) the design of a novel loss function that effectively
separates Gaussian distributions based on heatmap responses in the point-based
detection framework.

conveying information to an information receiver and delivering energy to an
energy harvesting receiver. For the special case of static PP constraints, we
study the information-energy capacity region and the associated input
distribution under: average-power and PP constraints at the transmitter, an HPA
nonlinearity at the transmitter, and nonlinearity of the energy harvesting
circuit at the energy receiver. By extending Smith \' mathematical framework,
we show that the optimal input distribution under those constraints is discrete
with a finite number of mass points. We show that HPA significantly reduces the

there is no trade-off between information and energy transfer. For the case

Specifically, our model parameterizes mean and variance for each time-stamp
with flexible neural networks, resulting in a non-stationary model that can
work without the assumption of constant noise as commonly made by existing
Markov models. However, such a flexibility may cause the model fragile to
anomalies. To achieve robust density estimation which can also benefit
detection tasks, we propose a smoothness-inducing prior over possible
estimations. The proposed prior works as a regularizer that places penalty at
non-smooth reconstructions. Our model is learned efficiently with a novel

and out-of distribution inputs is an important step towards faithful deep
learning systems. Some of the successful approaches for this, resort to
architectural novelties, such as ensembles, with increased complexities in
terms of the number of parameters and training procedures. Whereas some other
approaches make use of surrogate samples, which are easy to create and work as
proxies for actual out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, to train the networks for
OOD detection. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach for enhancing
the ability of a pretrained network to detect OOD inputs without even altering
the original parameter values. We define a probabilistic trust interval for
each weight parameter of the network and optimize its size according to the
in-distribution (ID) inputs. It allows the network to sample additional weight
values along with the original values at the time of inference and use the
observed disagreement among the corresponding outputs for OOD detection. In
order to capture the disagreement effectively, we also propose a measure and
establish its suitability using empirical evidence. Our approach outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art methods on various OOD datasets by considerable
margins without using any real or surrogate OOD samples. We also analyze the
performance of our approach on adversarial and corrupted inputs such as
CIFAR-10-C and demonstrate its ability to clearly distinguish such inputs as
well. By using fundamental theorem of calculus on neural networks, we explain
why our technique doesn't need to observe OOD samples during training to
achieve results better than the previous works.

provide an elegant and easy way to locally manipulate different attributes of

generation of exotic structured light beams. The fabrication of such doubly
inhomogeneous waveplates (d-plates) is more complex, compared to that of singly
inhomogeneous waveplates (s-plates) having uniform retardance, which can be
easily fabricated by different means such as photoalignment of liquid crystals,
metasurfaces etc. Here, exploiting the SU(2) formalism, we establish
analytically that any d-plate can be equivalently implemented using a pair of
quarter-wave s-plates and a half-wave s-plate. An important advantage of this
method is that it gives the flexibility to realize a whole family of distinct
d-plates using the same triplet of s-plates. To underline the scope of this
method, we propose novel d-plates for spatially tailoring the phase and complex
amplitudes of light beams. Towards complex amplitude shaping, we present a
generic method for carving out higher-order eigenmodes of light using a d-plate
in conjugation with a polarizer. A generalized q-plate-like gadget, for
imparting a polarization-dependent phase profile to a scalar light beam, is
proposed as a demonstration of phase-polarization interplay. For these two
illustrations, the corresponding three-s-plate gadget is constructed, and its
functioning is validated with extensive numerical simulations. The main result
and its illustrations are generic and agnostic to the way the s-plates are

has been proposed to use approximate memory, in which the supply voltage and

performance. Tuning these parameters aggressively leads to bit errors, which
can be tolerated by NNs when bit flips are injected during training. However,
bit flip training, which is the state of the art for achieving bit error
tolerance, does not scale well; it leads to massive overheads and cannot be
applied for high bit error rates (BERs). Alternative methods to achieve bit
error tolerance in NNs are needed, but the underlying principles behind the bit
error tolerance of NNs have not been reported yet. With this lack of
understanding, further progress in the research on NN bit error tolerance will
be restrained.
  In this study, our objective is to investigate the internal changes in the
NNs that bit flip training causes, with a focus on binarized NNs (BNNs). To
this end, we quantify the properties of bit error tolerant BNNs with two
metrics. First, we propose a neuron-level bit error tolerance metric, which
calculates the margin between the pre-activation values and batch normalization
thresholds. Secondly, to capture the effects of bit error tolerance on the

general relativity are performed for a massive neutron star formed as a remnant
of binary neutron star mergers. Neutrino radiation transport effects are taken
into account as in our previous papers. The simulation is performed in axial
symmetry and without considering dynamo effects as a first step. In the ideal
MHD, the differential rotation of the remnant neutron star amplifies the
magnetic-field strength by the winding in the presence of a seed poloidal field
until the electromagnetic energy reaches $\sim 10\%$ of the rotational kinetic
energy, $E_{\rm kin}$, of the neutron star. The timescale until the maximum
electromagnetic energy is reached depends on the initial magnetic-field
strength and it is $\sim 1$ s for the case that the initial maximum
magnetic-field strength is $\sim 10^{15}$ G. After a significant amplification
of the magnetic-field strength by the winding, the magnetic braking enforces
the initially differentially rotating state approximately to a rigidly rotating
state. In the presence of the resistivity, the amplification is continued only
for the resistive timescale, and if the maximum electromagnetic energy reached
is smaller than $\sim 3\%$ of $E_{\rm kin}$, the initial differential rotation
state is approximately preserved. In the present context, the post-merger mass
ejection is induced primarily by the neutrino irradiation/heating and the

Astrophysics), we calculate yields of heavy elements from massive stars via
stellar wind and core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) ejecta to interstellar medium
(ISM). In our models, the initial masses ($M_{\rm ini}$) of massive stars are
taken from 13 to 80 $M_\odot$, their initial rotational velocities (V) are 0,
300 and 500 km s$^{-1}$, and their metallicities are [Fe/H] = -3, -2, -1, and
0. The yields of heavy elements coming from stellar winds are mainly affected
by the stellar rotation which changes the chemical abundances of stellar
surfaces via chemically homogeneous evolution, and enhances mass-loss rate. We
estimate that the stellar wind can produce heavy element yields of about
$10^{-2}$ (for low metallicity models) to several $M_\odot$ (for low
metallicity and rapid rotation models) mass. The yields of heavy element
produced by CCSN ejecta also depend on the remnant mass of massive mass which
is mainly determined by the mass of CO-core. Our models calculate that the
yields of heavy elements produced by CCSN ejecta can get up to several
$M_\odot$. Compared with stellar wind, CCSN ejecta has a greater contribution
to the heavy elements in ISM. We also compare the $^{56}$Ni yields by
calculated in this work with observational estimate. Our models only explain
the $^{56}$Ni masses produced by faint SNe or normal SNe with progenitor mass
lower than about 25 $M_\odot$, and greatly underestimate the $^{56}$Ni masses
produced by stars with masses higher than about 30 $M_\odot$.

optimizes a single objective, such as path length. Many applications, however,
may require multiple objectives, say time-to-completion and fuel use, to be
simultaneously optimized in the planning process. Often, these criteria may not
be readily compared and sometimes lie in competition with each other. Simply
applying standard multi-objective search algorithms to multi-agent path finding
may prove to be inefficient because the size of the space of possible
solutions, i.e., the Pareto-optimal set, can grow exponentially with the number
of agents (the dimension of the search space). This paper presents an approach
that bypasses this so-called curse of dimensionality by leveraging our prior
multi-agent work with a framework called subdimensional expansion. One example
of subdimensional expansion, when applied to A*, is called M* and M* was
limited to a single objective function. We combine principles of dominance and
subdimensional expansion to create a new algorithm named multi-objective M*
(MOM*), which dynamically couples agents for planning only when those agents
have to ""interact"" with each other. MOM* computes the complete Pareto-optimal
set for multiple agents efficiently and naturally trades off sub-optimal
approximations of the Pareto-optimal set and computational efficiency. Our
approach is able to find the complete Pareto-optimal set for problem instances
with hundreds of solutions which the standard multi-objective A* algorithms
could not find within a bounded time.

association rules are primarily designed for use on binary or categorical data,
due to their use of rule-based machine learning. A large proportion of

to inaccurate and less informative association rules. In this paper, we propose
an alternative approach called feature relationship mining (FRM), which uses a
genetic programming approach to automatically discover symbolic relationships
between continuous or categorical features in data. To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed approach is the first such symbolic approach with the
goal of explicitly discovering relationships between features. Empirical

BAL-like profiles with velocity blueshifts $<$ $-$4000 km/s and widths in the
range 70 $\lesssim$ FWHM(1548) $\lesssim$ 2000 km/s (for $\lambda$1548 alone).
We find 105 mini-BALs in 44 quasars from a total sample of 638 quasars. The
fraction of quasars with at least one mini-BAL meeting our criteria is roughly
$\sim9$% after correcting for incomplete velocity coverage. However, the
numbers of systems rise sharply at lower velocities and narrower FWHMs,
suggesting that many outflow lines are missed by our study. All of the systems
are highly ionized based on the strong presence of NV and OVI and/or the
absence of SiII and CII when within the wavelength coverage. Two of the
mini-BAL systems in our catalog, plus three others at smaller velocity shifts,
have PV $\lambda$1118,1128 absorption indicating highly saturated CIV
absorption and total hydrogen column densities $\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$.
Most of the mini-BALs are confirmed to have optical depths $\gtrsim$1 with
partial covering of the quasar continuum source. The covering fractions are as
small as 0.06 in CIV and 0.03 in SiIV , corresponding to outflow absorbing
structures $<0.002$ pc across. When multiple lines are measured, the lines of
less abundant ions tend to have narrower profiles and smaller covering
fractions indicative of inhomogeneous absorbers where higher column densities
occur in smaller clumps. This picture might extend to BAL outflows if the
broader and generally deeper BALs form in either the largest clumps or
collections of many mini-BAL-like clumps that blend together in observed quasar
spectra.

solutions. The time-dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface is
used to calculate the fluxes for the updating the cell-averaged flow variables
and to evaluate the time accurate cell-averaged flow variables as well for
evolving the cell-averaged gradients of flow variables. With the accurate
evolution model for both flow variables and their slopes, the quality of the
scheme depends closely on the accuracy and reliability of the initial
reconstruction of flow variables. The reconstruction scheme becomes more
challenge on tetrahedral mesh, where the conventional second-order unlimited
least-square reconstruction can make the scheme be linearly unstable when using
cell-averaged conservative variables alone with von Neumann neighbors.
Benefiting from the evolved cell-averaged slopes, on tetrahedral mesh the GKS
is linearly stable from a compact third-order smooth reconstruction with a
large CFL number. In order to further increase the robustness of the high-order
compact GKS for capturing discontinuous solution, a new two-step
multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction
will be proposed. The novelty of the reconstruction includes the following.
Firstly, it releases the stability issue from a second-order compact
reconstruction through the introduction of a pre-reconstruction step. Secondly,
in the third-order non-linear reconstruction, only one more large stencil is
added beside those in the second-order one, which significantly simplifies the
high-order reconstruction. The proposed third-order scheme shows good
robustness in high speed flow computation and favorable mesh adaptability in

model of Brownian motion when the key parameter of the time interval of
\textit{free jump} degenerates. Fluids will be characterized by the number of
particles per unit volume (density of fluid) at the point of observation.
Degeneration of the phenomenon manifests in two scenarios: a) flow of the
fluid, which is highly dispersing like a non-dense gas, and b) flow of fluid
far away from the source of flow, when the velocity of the flow is incomparably
smaller than the gradient of the density. First, we will show that both types
of flows can be modeled using the Einstein paradigm. We will investigate the
question: What features will particle flow exhibit if the time interval of
the\textit{ free jump} is inverse proportional to the density and its gradient?
We will show that in this scenario, the flow exhibits localization property,
namely: if at some moment of time $t_0$ in the region, the gradient of the
density or density itself is equal to zero, then for some time $T$ during t
interval $[ t_{0}, t_0+T]$ there is no flow in the region. This directly links
to Barenblatt's finite speed of propagation property for the degenerate
equation. The method of the proof is very different from Barenblatt's method

preconditioned conjugate gradient method with a preconditioner based on the
sine transform is employed to solve the resulting linear system. Theoretically,
we prove that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded
in the open interval (1/2,3/2) and thus the preconditioned conjugate gradient
method converges linearly. The proposed method can be extended to multi-level
Toeplitz matrices generated by functions with zeros of fractional order. Our
theoretical results fill in a vacancy in the literature. Numerical examples are
presented to demonstrate our new theoretical results in the literature and show
the convergence performance of the proposed preconditioner that is better than
other existing preconditioners.

set of a hypergraph into k disjoint blocks of bounded weight, while minimizing
an objective function defined on the hyperedges. Whereas real-world
applications often use vertex and edge weights to accurately model the
underlying problem, the HGP research community commonly works with unweighted
instances.
  In this paper, we argue that, in the presence of vertex weights, current
balance constraint definitions either yield infeasible partitioning problems or
allow unnecessarily large imbalances and propose a new definition that
overcomes these problems. We show that state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners
often struggle considerably with weighted instances and tight balance
constraints (even with our new balance definition). Thus, we present a
recursive-bipartitioning technique that is able to reliably compute balanced
(and hence feasible) solutions. The proposed method balances the partition by
pre-assigning a small subset of the heaviest vertices to the two blocks of each
bipartition (using an algorithm originally developed for the job scheduling
problem) and optimizes the actual partitioning objective on the remaining
vertices. We integrate our algorithm into the multilevel hypergraph partitioner
KaHyPar and show that our approach is able to compute balanced partitions of
high quality on a diverse set of benchmark instances.

detectors. The main limitations in plasmonic nanopore technology are the too
fast translocation velocity of the molecule through the pore and the consequent
very short analysis times, as well as the possible instabilities due to local
heating. The most interesting approach to control the translocation of
molecules and enable longer acquisition times is represented by the ability to
efficiently trap and tune the motion of nanoparticles that can be used to tag
molecules. Here, we theoretically investigate the performance of a
magneto-plasmonic nanopore prepared with a thin layer of cobalt sandwiched
between two gold layers. A nanopore is then coupled with a translocating
magnetic nanoparticle. By setting the magnetic configuration of the cobalt
layer around the pore by an external magnetic field, it is possible to generate
a nanoscale magnetic tweezer to trap the nanoparticle at a specific point.
Considering a 10 nm magnetite nanoparticle we calculate a trapping force up to
28 pN, an order of magnitude above the force that can be obtained with standard
optical or plasmonic trapping approaches. Moreover, the magnetic force pulls
the nanoparticle in close contact with the plasmonic nanopore's wall, thus
enabling the formation of a nanocavity enclosing a deeply sub-wavelength
confined electromagnetic field with an average field intensity enhancement up
to 230 at near-infrared wavelengths. The presented hybrid magneto-plasmonic
system points towards a strategy to improve nanopore-based biosensors for
single-molecule detection and potentially for analysis of various biomolecules.

The stability theory for MPC is most mature for the undiscounted MPC case.
Hence, we will first show in this paper that stable discounted MDPs can be

transferred from the turbulent flow to the LIS provided that there is a

AutoFreeze, with caching enabled, can improve fine-tuning on a single GPU by up

develops mass scales that render the propagator finite at all momentum scales
and no volume dependence is observed for the simulations performed.
Furthermore, for the confined phase the propagator is compatible with a Yukawa
massive type functional form. For the deconfined phase the photon propagator
seems to approach a free field propagator as the lattice volume is increased.
In both cases, we also investigate the static potential and the average value
of the number of Dirac strings in the gauge configurations $m$. In the confined
phase the mass gap translates into a linearly growing static potential, while
in the deconfined phase the static potential approaches a constant at large

described, and the paper shows how to perform approximate Bayesian inference

are pretrained on large GPU clusters and have enough parameters to generalise

personalised model can be employed to fit a specific scenario, resulting in
both higher accuracy and faster execution. Nevertheless, on-device training is
extremely challenging, imposing excessive computational and memory requirements
even for flagship smartphones. At the same time, on-device data availability
might be limited and samples are most frequently unlabelled. To this end, we
introduce PersEPhonEE, a framework that attaches early exits on the model and
personalises them on-device. These allow the model to progressively bypass a
larger part of the computation as more personalised data become available.
Moreover, we introduce an efficient on-device algorithm that trains the early
exits in a semi-supervised manner at a fraction of the whole network's
personalisation time. Results show that PersEPhonEE boosts accuracy by up to
15.9% while dropping the training cost by up to 2.2x and inference latency by
2.2-3.2x on average for the same accuracy, depending on the availability of

two square-shaped sheets of the Fermi surface. One is a hole-like $\alpha$

available to an intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer. We assume
that the system has a ""secret"" that does not want to be revealed to the
intruder. Our goal is to synthesize a supervisor that controls the system in a
least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system meets the privacy
requirement. For the qualitative case, we adopt the notion of infinite-step
opacity as the privacy specification by requiring that the intruder can never
determine for sure that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific
instant. If the qualitative synthesis problem is not solvable or the
synthesized solution is too restrictive, then we further investigate the
quantitative synthesis problem so that the secret is revealed (if unavoidable)
as late as possible. Effective algorithms are provided to solve both the
qualitative and quantitative synthesis problems. Specifically, by building
suitable information structures that involve information delays, we show that
the optimal qualitative synthesis problem can be solved as a safety-game. The
optimal quantitative synthesis problem can also be solved as an optimal
total-cost control problem over an augmented information structure. Our work
provides a complete solution to the standard infinite-step opacity control
problem, which has not been solved without assumption on the relationship
between controllable events and observable events. Furthermore, we generalize
the opacity enforcement problem to the numerical setting by introducing the

typically useful when users know some object types which are relevant for their
information need, but do not (yet) know how they are related in the conceptual
schema. Part of the point to point query mechanism is therefore the selection
of the most appropriate path between object types (points) in the conceptual
schema. This article both discusses some of the pragmatic issues involved in
the point to point query mechanism, and the theoretical issues involved in
finding the relevant paths between selected object types.

information strings are observed only through their (multisets of) substrings.
Because of applications to DNA-based data storage, due to DNA sequencing
techniques, interest in this channel has renewed in recent years. In contrast
to existing literature, we consider a noisy channel model, where information is
subject to noise \emph{before} its substrings are sampled, motivated by in-vivo
storage.
  We study two separate noise models, substitutions or deletions. In both
cases, we examine families of codes which may be utilized for error-correction
and present combinatorial bounds. Through a generalization of the concept of
repeat-free strings, we show that the added required redundancy due to this
imperfect observation assumption is sublinear, either when the fraction of
errors in the observed substring length is sufficiently small, or when that
length is sufficiently long. This suggests that no asymptotic cost in rate is
incurred by this channel model in these cases.

efficiency (SE) of wireless communications by allowing the secondary users
(SUs) to share spectrum with primary users (PUs). Meanwhile, intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) has been recently proposed as a promising approach to
enhance SE and energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communication systems through
intelligently reconfiguring the channel environment. In this paper, we consider
an IRS-assisted downlink CR system, in which a secondary access point (SAP)
communicates with multiple SUs without affecting multiple PUs in the primary
network and all nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Our design objective
is to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate (WSR) of SUs subject to the
total transmit power constraint at the SAP and the interference constraints at
PUs, by jointly optimizing the transmit precoding at the SAP and the reflecting
coefficients at the IRS. To deal with the complex objective function, the
problem is reformulated by employing the well-known weighted minimum
mean-square error (WMMSE) method and an alternating optimization (AO)-based
algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, a special scenario with only one PU is
considered and AO algorithm is adopted again. It is worth mentioning that the
proposed algorithm has a much lower computational complexity than the above
algorithm without the performance loss. Finally, some numerical simulations
have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other
benchmark schemes.

electromagnetic fields. A component of these fields is phase-coherent with the

fluorescence detection of spins is hampered {by their low spontaneous emission

using superconducting quantum devices, we demonstrate the detection of a small
ensemble of donor spins in silicon by their fluorescence at microwave frequency

coupling them to a high-quality-factor and small-mode-volume superconducting

field can affect the wind, which in turn can back-react on the boundary
conditions of the star, creating a feedback loop. We have developed a
2.5-dimensional numerical set-up to model this essential coupling. We have
implemented an alpha-Omega mean-field dynamo in the PLUTO code, and then
coupled it to a spherical polytropic wind model via an interface composed of
four grid layers with dedicated boundary conditions. We present here a dynamo
model close to a young Sun with cyclic magnetic activity. First we show how
this model allows to track the influence of the dynamo activity on the corona
by displaying the correlation between the activity cycle, the coronal structure
and the time evolution of integrated quantities. Then we add the feedback of
the wind on the dynamo and discuss the changes observed in the dynamo symmetry
and the wind variations. We explain these changes in terms of dynamo modes : in
this parameter regime, the feedback loop leads to a coupling between the dynamo
families via a preferred growth of the quadrupolar mode. We also study our
interface in terms of magnetic helicity, and show that it leads to a small
injection in the dynamo. This model confirms the importance of coupling
physically internal and external stellar layers, as it has a direct impact on
both the dynamo and the wind.

Moreover, it is shown that under certain further assumptions on congruence

Bayesian group Lasso with spike and slab priors for the discovery of partial

the posterior distribution with a Gibbs sampler, we are able to estimate the
values of coefficients, together with their standard errors and confidence
intervals. Apart from constructing the error bars, uncertainty quantification
can also be employed for designing new criteria of model selection and
threshold setting. This enables our method more adjustable and robust in
learning equations with time-dependent coefficients. Three criteria are
introduced for model selection and threshold setting to identify the correct
terms: the root mean square, total error bar, and group error bar. Moreover,
three noise filters are integrated with the robust Bayesian sparse learning
algorithm for better results with larger noise. Numerical results demonstrate
that our method is more robust than sequential grouped threshold ridge
regression and group Lasso in noisy situations through three examples.

(FOPFDD) model, capable of modeling delay dominant systems with high accuracy.
The novelty of the FOPFDD is the Fractional Diffusive Delay (FDD) term, an
exponential delay of non-integer order $\alpha$, i.e. $e^{-(Ls)^{\alpha}}$ in
Laplace domain. The special cases of $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\alpha = 1$ have
already been investigated thoroughly. In this work $\alpha$ is generalized to
any real number in the interval $]0,1[$. For $\alpha=0.5$, this term appears in
the solution of distributed diffusion systems, which will serve as a source of
inspiration for this work. Both frequency and time domain are investigated.
However, regarding the latter, no closed-form expression of the inverse Laplace
transform of the FDD can be found for all $\alpha$, so numerical tools are used
to obtain an impulse response of the FDD. To establish the algorithm, several
properties of the FDD term have been proven: firstly, existence of the term,
secondly, invariance of the time integral of the impulse response, and thirdly,
dependency of the impulse response's energy on $\alpha$. To conclude, the
FOPFDD model is fitted to several delay-dominant, diffusive-like
resistors-capacitors (RC) circuits to show the increased modeling accuracy
compared to other state-of-the-art models found in literature. The FOPFDD model
outperforms the other approximation models in accurately tracking frequency
response functions as well as in mimicing the peculiar delay/diffusive-like
time responses, coming from the interconnection of a large number of discrete
subsystems. The fractional character of the FOPFDD makes it an ideal candidate
for an approximate model to these large and complex systems with only a few
parameters.

that combines formal verification with (deep) RL algorithms to guarantee the
satisfaction of formally-specified safety constraints both in training and

Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) and builds an abstract
representation of the system to reduce the complexity of the verification step.
This abstract model allows for model checking techniques to identify a set of
abstract policies that meet the safety constraints expressed in PCTL. Then, the
agents' behaviours are restricted according to these safe abstract policies. We
provide formal guarantees that by using this method, the actions of the agents
always meet the safety constraints, and provide a procedure to generate an
abstract model automatically. We empirically evaluate and show the
effectiveness of our method in a multi-agent environment.

producers and end-users based on the expansive character of the in-situ Mg(OH)2
formation. Considering that magnesia undergoes hydration when exposed to water
and the generated hydrated phase needs to be properly accommodated in the
resulting microstructure to inhibit the generation of cracks, it is very
important to find out alternatives to control the MgO hydration reaction rate.
This research investigated the use of aluminum lactate (AL) as a likely
additive to change the hydration and drying behavior of vibratable castables
bonded with different MgO sources (dead burnt, caustic or fumed one). Firstly,
XRD, TG and DSC measurements of magnesia-based aqueous suspensions were
evaluated to identify the AL effect on changing the hydration reaction products
during the curing and drying steps. After that, Al2O3-MgO refractories were
prepared and their flowability, curing behavior, cold flexural strength,
apparent porosity, permeability and explosion resistance were evaluated. The
results indicated that, instead of Mg(OH)2, Mg6Al2(OH)16(OH)2.4.5H2O/
Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3).4H2O was the main hydrated phase identified in the
AL-containing compositions. Due to this change in the hydration behavior of the
refractories, the mixtures prepared with dead-burnt or magnesia fumes plus
organic salt presented a longer setting time. Besides that, crack-free samples
with improved permeability and green mechanical strength could be obtained when
adding 0.5 wt.% or 1.0 wt.% of aluminum lactate to the tested castable
compositions. Consequently, 1.0 wt.% of the selected additive favored the
design of refractories with enhanced properties and greater spalling
resistance, as no explosion could be observed even when subjecting the prepared
samples to severe heating conditions (20C/min).

extremely critical when the computation, storage and communication resources

We first extend the asymmetric CDC (ACDC) scheme proposed by Yu et al. to the
cascade case where each output function is computed by multiple servers. Then
we demonstrate that whether CDC or ACDC is better depends on system parameters
(e.g., number of computing servers) and task parameters (e.g., number of input
files), implying that neither CDC nor ACDC is optimal. By merging the ideas of
CDC and ACDC, we propose a hybrid scheme and show that it can strictly
outperform CDC and ACDC. Furthermore, we derive an information-theoretic
converse showing that for the MapReduce task using a type of weakly symmetric
Reduce assignment, which includes the Reduce assignments of CDC and ACDC as
special cases, the hybrid scheme with a corresponding resource allocation
strategy is optimal, i.e., achieves the minimum execution time, for an

Yet, to characterise its long-time behaviour is a knotty problem. The fluid
evolves according to Euler's equations: a non-linear Hamiltonian system with
infinitely many conservation laws. In both experiments and numerical
simulations, coherent vortex structures, or blobs, emerge after an initial
stage. These formations dominate the large-scale dynamics, but small scales
also persist. Kraichnan describes in his classical work a forward cascade of
enstrophy into smaller scales, and a backward cascade of energy into larger
scales. Previous attempts to model Kraichnan's double cascade use filtering
techniques that enforce separation from the outset. Here we show that Euler's
equations posses an intrinsic, canonical splitting of the vorticity function.
The splitting is remarkable in four ways: (i) it is defined solely via the
Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian, (ii) it characterises steady flows, (iii)
without imposition it yields a separation of scales, enabling the dynamics
behind Kraichnan's qualitative description, and (iv) it accounts for the
""broken line"" in the power law for the energy spectrum, observed in both
experiments and numerical simulations. The splitting originates from Zeitlin's
truncated model of Euler's equations in combination with a standard
quantum-tool: the spectral decomposition of Hermitian matrices. In addition to
theoretical insight, the scale separation dynamics could be used for stochastic
model reduction, where small scales are modelled by multiplicative noise.

and states during its run-time. Therefore, detecting anomalies in software logs
reflect anomalies in the software's execution path or state. So, it has become
a notable concern in software engineering. We use LSTM like many prior works,
and on top of LSTM, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach based on the
Siamese network. This paper also provides an authentic validation of the
approach on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) log dataset. To the best
of our knowledge, the proposed approach outperforms other methods on the same
dataset at the F1 score of 0.996, resulting in a new state-of-the-art
performance on the dataset. Along with the primary method, we introduce a novel
training pair generation algorithm that reduces generated training pairs by the
factor of 3000 while maintaining the F1 score, merely a modest decay from 0.996
to 0.995. Additionally, we propose a hybrid model by combining the Siamese
network with a traditional feedforward neural network to make end-to-end
training possible, reducing engineering effort in setting up a
deep-learning-based log anomaly detector. Furthermore, we examine our method's
robustness to log evolutions by evaluating the model on synthetically evolved
log sequences; we got the F1 score of 0.95 at the noise ratio of 20%. Finally,
we dive deep into some of the side benefits of the Siamese network.
Accordingly, we introduce a method of monitoring the evolutions of logs without
label requirements at run-time. Additionally, we present a visualization
technique that facilitates human administrations of log anomaly detection.

information for assessing the risk of a clinical event, and eventually for
adapting a therapeutic strategy. Joint models and landmark models have been
proposed to compute individual dynamic predictions from repeated measures to
one or two markers. However, they hardly extend to the case where the complete
patient history includes much more repeated markers possibly. Our objective was
thus to propose a solution for the dynamic prediction of a health event that
may exploit repeated measures of a possibly large number of markers. We
combined a landmark approach extended to endogenous markers history with
machine learning methods adapted to survival data. Each marker trajectory is
modeled using the information collected up to landmark time, and summary
variables that best capture the individual trajectories are derived. These
summaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction
methods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine
learning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and
random survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we
show how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are
evaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We
demonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival
methods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous
and/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then
applied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the
prediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public
health context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population
at different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of
an event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of
repeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the
repeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our
method can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the
markers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting.

system to an extended solution. In this paper we present sufficient conditions
for the absence of an infimum gap and for controllability for a wide class of

conditions are based on a nondegenerate version of the nonsmooth constrained
maximum principle, expressed in terms of subdifferentials. In particular, under

2dF/AAOmega on the AAT, we have obtained kinematic information for the globular
cluster NGC3201. Our new observations confirm the presence of a significant
velocity gradient across the cluster which can almost entirely be explained by
the high proper motion of the cluster. After subtracting the contribution of
this perspective rotation, we found a remaining rotation signal with an
amplitude of $\sim1\ km/s$ around a different axis to what we expect from the
tidal tails and the potential escapers, suggesting that this rotation is
internal and can be a remnant of its formation process. At the outer part, we
found a rotational signal that is likely a result from potential escapers. The
proper motion dispersion at large radii reported by Bianchini et al. has
previously been attributed to dark matter. Here we show that the LOS dispersion
between 0.5-1 Jacobi radius is lower, yet above the predictions from an N-body
model of NGC3201 that we ran for this study. Based on the simulation, we find
that potential escapers cannot fully explain the observed velocity dispersion.
We also estimate the effect on the velocity dispersion of different amounts of
stellar-mass black holes and unbound stars from the tidal tails with varying
escape rates and find that these effects cannot explain the difference between
the LOS dispersion and the N-body model. Given the recent discovery of tidal
tail stars at large distances from the cluster, a dark matter halo is an
unlikely explanation. We show that the effect of binary stars, which is not
included in the N-body model, is important and can explain part of the
difference in dispersion. We speculate that the remaining difference must be
the result of effects not included in the N-body model, such as initial cluster
rotation, velocity anisotropy and Galactic substructure.

group invariant relations between seemingly independent parameters of a theory
that hold to all orders of perturbation theory. This concept can be applied to
$N=1$ GUTs and make them all-loop finite. In the first part of this thesis,
after a review of the reduction of couplings method and the properties of
finiteness, four models are analysed: a reduced version of the minimal $N=1$
$SU(5)$, a finite $N=1$ $SU(5)$, a two-loop finite $N=1$ $SU(3)^3$ and a
reduced version of the MSSM. An update in the phenomenological evaluation is
the improved light Higgs-boson mass prediction as provided by the FeynHiggs
code. The first three models predict heavy SUSY spectra (produced using the
FeynHiggs and SPheno codes) that start just above the TeV scale, consistent
with the non-observation LHC results, while the reduced MSSM results in a
pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass $M_A$ that is ruled out by recent results of the
ATLAS experiment. The three models have very dim prospects of discovery at the
HL-LHC. The FCC-hh, however, could be able to test large parts of their
predicted spectra.
  In the second part of the thesis, after a review of the Coset Space
Dimensional Reduction, an extension of the SM is presented that results from
the dimensional reduction of the $N=1$, $10D$ $E_8$ group over a $M_4 \times
B_0/ \mathbf{Z}_3 $ space, where $B_0$ is the nearly-K\""ahler manifold
$SU(3)/U(1)\times U(1)$ and $\mathbf{Z}_3$ is a discrete group on $B_0$. Using
the Wilson breaking mechanism we get a $4D$ $N=1$ $SU(3)^3$ model plus two
global $U(1)$s. Below the GUT scale we have a two Higgs doublet model in a
split-like SUSY version of the SM which is phenomenologically consistent, since
it produces masses of the top, bottom and light Higgs particles within the
experimental limits and predicts the LSP $\sim 1500 GeV$.

carrying out pricing on the basis of real-time energy usage is considered to be
the most vital tool because it is directly linked with the finances associated
with smart meters. Hence, every smart meter user wants to pay the minimum
possible amount along with getting maximum benefits. In this context, usage
based dynamic pricing strategies of DSM plays their role and provide users with
specific incentives that help shaping their load curve according to the
forecasted load. However, these reported real-time values can leak privacy of
smart meter users, which can lead to serious consequences such as spying, etc.
Moreover, most dynamic pricing algorithms charge all users equally irrespective
of their contribution in causing peak factor. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a modified usage based dynamic pricing mechanism that only charges the
users responsible for causing peak factor. We further integrate the concept of
differential privacy to protect the privacy of real-time smart metering data.
To calculate accurate billing, we also propose a noise adjustment method.
Finally, we propose Demand Response enhancing Differential Pricing (DRDP)
strategy that effectively enhances demand response along with providing dynamic
pricing to smart meter users. We also carry out theoretical analysis for
differential privacy guarantees and for cooperative state probability to
analyze behavior of cooperative smart meters. The performance evaluation of
DRDP strategy at various privacy parameters show that the proposed strategy
outperforms previous mechanisms in terms of dynamic pricing and privacy
preservation.

find or even design new organic semiconductors with higher charge carrier
mobility, computational approaches, in particular multiscale models, are
becoming increasingly important. However, such models are computationally very
costly, especially when large systems and long time scales are required, which
is the case to compute static and dynamic energy disorder, i.e. dominant factor
to determine charge transport. Here we overcome this drawback by integrating
machine learning models into multiscale simulations. This allows us to obtain
unprecedented insight into relevant microscopic materials properties, in
particular static and dynamic disorder contributions for a series of
application-relevant molecules. We find that static disorder and thus the
distribution of shallow traps is highly asymmetrical for many materials,
impacting widely considered Gaussian disorder models. We furthermore analyse
characteristic energy level fluctuation times and compare them to typical
hopping rates to evaluate the importance of dynamic disorder for charge
transport. We hope that our findings will significantly improve the accuracy of
computational methods used to predict application relevant materials properties
of organic semiconductors, and thus make these methods applicable for virtual
materials design.

new rank-consistency objective is applied to align the similarity orders from
two spaces, the original space and the hamming space. A powerful loss function
is designed to penalize the samples whose semantic similarity and hamming

accurately predict unseen practical flows remains an important challenge. At
the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) level, NN-based turbulence closure
modeling is rendered difficult due to two important reasons: inherent
complexity of the constitutive relation arising from flow-dependent
non-linearity and bifurcations; and, inordinate difficulty in obtaining
high-fidelity data covering the entire parameter space of interest. In this
context, the objective of the work is to investigate the approximation
capabilities of standard moderate-sized fully-connected NNs. We seek to
systematically investigate the effects of: (i) intrinsic complexity of the
solution manifold; (ii) sampling procedure (interpolation vs. extrapolation)
and (iii) optimization procedure. To overcome the data acquisition challenges,
three proxy-physics turbulence surrogates of different degrees of complexity
(yet significantly simpler than turbulence physics) are employed to generate
the parameter-to-solution maps. Even for this simple proxy-physics system, it
is demonstrated that feed-forward NNs require more degrees of freedom than the
original proxy-physics model to accurately approximate the true model even when
trained with data over the entire parameter space (interpolation).
Additionally, if deep fully-connected NNs are trained with data only from part
of the parameter space (extrapolation), their approximation capability reduces
considerably and it is not straightforward to find an optimal architecture.
Overall, the findings provide a realistic perspective on the utility of ML
turbulence closures for practical applications and identify areas for
improvement.

controlled independently, permitting to explore percolated networks ranging
from a single nanosheet to some billions with room temperature resistivity
spanning from 10-5 to 10-1 ohm m. We systematically observe a clear transition
between two different regimes at a critical temperature T*: Efros-Shklovskii
variable range hopping (ESVRH) below T* and power law (PL) behavior above.
Firstly, we demonstrate that the two regimes are strongly correlated with each
other, both depending on the charge localization length xi, calculated by
ES-VRH model, which corresponds to the characteristic size of overlapping sp2
domains belonging to different nanosheets. Thus, we propose a microscopic model
describing the charge transport as a geometrical phase transition, given by the
metal-insulator transition associated with the percolation of quasi-1D
nanofillers with length xi, showing that the charge transport behavior of the
networks is valid for all geometries and defects of the nanosheets, ultimately
suggesting a generalized description on vdW and disordered thin films.

non-functional properties of a system (reliability, performance, etc.) as
rational functions of the system and environment parameters. In software
engineering, PMC formulae can be used during design, e.g., to analyse the
sensitivity of different system architectures to parametric variability, or to
find optimal system configurations. They can also be used at runtime, e.g., to
check if non-functional requirements are still satisfied after environmental
changes, or to select new configurations after such changes. However, current
PMC techniques do not scale well to systems with complex behaviour and more
than a few parameters. Our paper introduces a fast PMC (fPMC) approach that
overcomes this limitation, extending the applicability of PMC to a broader
class of systems than previously possible. To this end, fPMC partitions the
Markov models that PMC operates with into \emph{fragments} whose reachability
properties are analysed independently, and obtains PMC reachability formulae by
combining the results of these fragment analyses. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of fPMC, we show how our fPMC tool can analyse three systems
(taken from the research literature, and belonging to different application
domains) with which current PMC techniques and tools struggle.

systems. We do this by including non-Hermitian bilinear terms into the 3+1
dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Two possible bilinear
modifications give rise to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric theories; this happens when
the standard NJL model is extended either by a pseudovector background field
$ig \bar\psi\gamma_5 B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi$ or by an antisymmetric-tensor
background field $g \bar\psi F_{\mu\nu}\gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu \psi$. The three
remaining bilinears are {\it anti}-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric in nature, $ig
\bar\psi B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi, ig\bar\psi \gamma_5 \psi$ and $ig\bar\psi
{1}\psi$, so that the Hamiltonian then has no overall symmetry. The
pseudovector $ig \bar\psi\gamma_5 B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi$ and the vector $ig
\bar\psi B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi$ combinations, are, in addition, chirally
symmetric. Thus, within this framework we are able to examine the effects that
the various combinations of non-Hermiticity, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, chiral
symmetry and the two-body interactions of the NJL model have on the existence
and dynamical generation of a real effective fermion mass (a feature which is
absent in the corresponding modified massless free Dirac models) as well as on
the masses of the composite particles, the pseudoscalar and scalar mesonic
modes ($\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons). Our findings demonstrate that $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry is not necessary for real fermion mass solutions to exist, rather the
two-body interactions of the NJL model supersede the non-Hermitian bilinear
effects. The effects of chiral symmetry are evident most clearly in the meson
modes, the pseudoscalar of which will always be Goldstone in nature if the
system is chirally symmetric. Second solutions of the mesonic equations are
also discussed.

laser pulses in a Mach-Zehnder type electro-optical modulator. With the
emerging demand for future experiments with ultra-short FEL shots, fs precision
is required for the synchronization systems even with 1 pC bunches. Since the
sensitivity of the BAM depends in particular on the slope of the bipolar signal
at the zero-crossing and thus, also on the bunch charge, a redesign with the

inevitable. In this contribution the theoretical foundations of the pickup

performance is compared to the previous concept. A significant improvement of
slope and voltage is found. The improvement is mainly achieved by the reduced

supernova remnants (SNR) can still reflect asymmetries from the initial
supernova explosion. Thus, their study provides a great means to test and
constrain model predictions in relation to the distributions of heavy elements
or the neutron star kicks, both of which are key to better understanding the
explosion mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae. The use of a novel blind
source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the
well-known Cassiopeia A SNR has revealed maps of the distribution of the ejecta
endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clearly separated from
continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional view of the
ejecta by disentangling the red- and blue-shifted spectral components and
associated images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe, providing insights into the
morphology of the ejecta distribution in Cassiopeia A. These mappings allow us
to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the heavy elements distribution
and probe simulation predictions about the neutron star kicks and the relative
asymmetries between the different elements. We find in our study that most of
the ejecta X-ray flux stems from the red-shifted component, suggesting an
asymmetry in the explosion. In addition, the red-shifted ejecta can physically
be described as a broad, relatively symmetric plume, whereas the blue-shifted
ejecta is more similar to a dense knot. The neutron star also moves directly
opposite to the red-shifted parts of the ejecta similar to what is seen with
44Ti. Regarding the morphological asymmetries, it appears that heavier elements
have more asymmetrical distributions, which confirms predictions made by
simulations. This study is a showcase of the capacities of new analysis methods
to revisit archival observations to fully exploit their scientific content.

individuals, we simulate the meiosis process including crossing-over and
unilateral conversions of chromosomal sequences. Mutation of the genetic
information from cosmic ray bombardments is also included. In this first paper
of a series of two, we use the neutral hypothesis: mutations (genetic changes)
have only neutral phenotypic effects (physical manifestations), implying no
natural selection on variations. We will relax this assumption in the second

multi-generational crews can be affected by genetic drift and mutations. It
appears that centuries-long deep space travels have small but unavoidable
effects on the genetic composition/diversity of the traveling populations that
herald substantial genetic differentiation on longer time-scales if the annual
equivalent dose of cosmic ray radiation is similar to the Earth radioactivity
background at sea level. For larger doses, genomes in the final populations can
deviate more strongly with significant genetic differentiation that arises

spread around the world and infected hundreds of millions of people with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While this viral species was unknown prior
to January 2020, its similarity to other coronaviruses that infect humans has
allowed for rapid insight into the mechanisms that it uses to infect human
hosts, as well as the ways in which the human immune system can respond. Here,
we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is
known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host.
Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus's
structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant
head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential
differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into
symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally,
prior research into interactions between the human immune system and
coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system's
protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the
regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune
response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to
contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence
efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.

'loud' aliens who are born according to a hard steps power law, expand at a
common rate, change their volumes' appearances, and prevent advanced life like
us from appearing in their volumes. 'Quiet' aliens, in contrast, are much
harder to see. We fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data: 1)
birth power from the number of hard steps seen in Earth history, 2) birth
constant by assuming a inform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth
dates, and 3) expansion speed from our not seeing alien volumes in our sky. We
estimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume,
each will later control ~10^5 - 3x10^7 galaxies, and we could meet them in
~200Myr - 2Gyr. If loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low
transition chance (~10^-4) is required to expect that even one other quiet
alien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. Which seems bad news for
SETI. But perhaps alien volume appearances are subtle, and their expansion
speed lower, in which case we predict many long circular arcs to find in our

image representations, which have attracted great attentions in image

Networks (OCNs) for image recognition based on the proposed Landmark Gabor
Filters (LGFs) that the robustness of the learned representation against
changed of orientation can be enhanced. By modulating the convolutional filter
with LGFs, OCNs can be compatible with any existing deep learning networks.
LGFs act as a Gabor filter bank achieved by selecting $ p $ $ \left( \ll
n\right) $ representative Gabor filters as andmarks and express the original
Gabor filters as sparse linear combinations of these landmarks. Specifically,
based on a matrix factorization framework, a flexible integration for the local
and the global structure of original Gabor filters by sparsity and low-rank
constraints is utilized. With the propogation of the low-rank structure, the
corresponding sparsity for representation of original Gabor filter bank can be
significantly promoted. Experimental results over several benchmarks
demonstrate that our method is less sensitive to the orientation and produce
higher performance both in accuracy and cost, compared with the existing
state-of-art methods. Besides, our OCNs have few parameters to learn and can
significantly reduce the complexity of training network.

equivalent scalar-tensor formulation, the matter fields in the Einstein frame
interact as usual with an effective dark energy component, whose dynamics is
presumably governed by a scalar field that sources a torsion mode. As a
consequence, the matter density ceases to be self-conserved, thereby making an
impact not only on the background cosmological evolution but also on the
perturbative spectrum of the local inhomogeneities. In order to estimate the
effect on the growth of the linear matter perturbations, with the least
possible alteration of the standard parametric form of the growth factor, we
resort to a suitable Taylor expansion of the corresponding exponent, known as
the growth index, about the value of the cosmic scale factor at the present
epoch. In particular, we obtain an appropriate fitting formula for the growth
index in terms of the coupling function and the matter density parameter. While
the overall parametric formulation of the growth factor is found to fit well
with the latest redshift-space-distortion (RSD) and the observational Hubble

the necessity of nonlinear coding for the UIC problem, but only for achieving
the entire capacity region. Nevertheless, the question of whether nonlinear
coding is required to achieve the symmetric capacity (broadcast rate) of the

insufficiency of linear coding, by directly building a UIC instance with only
36users for which there exists a nonlinear index code outperforming the optimal

recurring issues in the field of computational catalyst discovery. First,
calculating macro-scale catalyst properties is not straight-forward when using
ensembles of atomic-scale calculations (e.g., density functional theory). We
attempt to address this issue by creating a multiscale model that estimates
bulk catalyst activity using adsorption energy predictions from both density
functional theory and machine learning models. The second issue is that many
catalyst discovery efforts seek to optimize catalyst properties, but
optimization is an inherently exploitative objective that is in tension with
the explorative nature of early-stage discovery projects. In other words: why
invest so much time finding a ""best"" catalyst when it is likely to fail for
some other, unforeseen problem? We address this issue by relaxing the catalyst
discovery goal into a classification problem: ""What is the set of catalysts
that is worth testing experimentally?"" Here we present a catalyst discovery
method called myopic multiscale sampling, which combines multiscale modeling
with automated selection of density functional theory calculations. It is an
active classification strategy that seeks to classify catalysts as ""worth
investigating"" or ""not worth investigating"" experimentally. Our results show a
~7-16 times speedup in catalyst classification relative to random sampling.

$P(n+m)\equiv P(n) \mod m$ for all integers $n, m\ge 0$. An integer valued
sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is called a pseudo-polynomial when it satisfies these
congruences. Hall characterized pseudo-polynomials and proved that they are not
necessarily polynomials. A long standing conjecture of Ruzsa says that a
pseudo-polynomial $a_n$ is a polynomial as soon as $\limsup_n \vert
a_n\vert^{1/n}<e$. Under this growth assumption, Perelli and Zannier proved
that the generating series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ is a $G$-function. A
primary pseudo-polynomial is an integer valued sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ such
that $a_{n+p}\equiv a_n \mod p$ for all integers $n\ge 0$ and all prime numbers

This leads us to formulate a conjecture on diagonals of rational fractions and
primary pseudo-polynomials, which is related to classic conjectures of Christol

P\'olya type result: if there exists a function $F$ analytic in a right-half
plane with not too large exponential growth (in a precise sense) and such that
for all large $n$ the primary pseudo-polynomial $a_n=F(n)$, then $a_n$ is a
polynomial. Finally, we show how to construct a non-polynomial primary
pseudo-polynomial starting from any primary pseudo-polynomial generated by a
$G$-function different of $1/(1-x)$.

the influence of surface tension hinders the temperature-induced volume phase
transition. In addition, we observed a hysteresis behavior upon temperature
cycling, i.e. a different evolution in microgel size and shape depending on
whether the microgel was initially adsorbed to the interface in expanded or
collapsed state. Here, we model the volume phase transition of such microgels
at an air/water interface by monomer-resolved Brownian dynamics simulations and
compare the observed behavior with experiments. We reproduce the experimentally
observed hysteresis in the microgel dimensions upon temperature variation. Our
simulations did not observe any hysteresis for microgels dispersed in the bulk
liquid, suggesting that it results from the distinct interfacial morphology of
the microgel adsorbed at the liquid interface. An initially collapsed microgel
brought to the interface and subjected to subsequent swelling and collapsing
(resp. cooling and heating) will end up in a larger size than it had in the
original collapsed state. Further temperature cycling, however, only shows a
much reduced hysteresis, in agreement with our experimental observations. We
attribute the hysteretic behavior to a kinetically trapped initial collapsed

similar behavior for linear PNiPAm chains adsorbed to an interface. Our

the most successful algorithms for this problem are based on the
branch-and-bound or branch-and-reduce paradigms. In particular,
branch-and-reduce algorithms, which combine branch-and-bound with reduction
rules, achieved substantial results, solving many previously infeasible
instances. These results were to a large part achieved by developing new, more
practical reduction rules. However, other components that have been shown to
have an impact on the performance of these algorithms have not received as much
attention. One of these is the branching strategy, which determines what vertex
is included or excluded in a potential solution. The most commonly used
strategy selects vertices based on their degree and does not take into account
other factors that contribute to the performance. In this work, we develop and
evaluate several novel branching strategies for both branch-and-bound and

introduced that yields efficient representations of ground states for
interacting Hamiltonians on near-term quantum computers. It is based on
McLachlan's variational principle applied to imaginary time evolution of
variational wave functions. The variational parameters evolve deterministically
according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact
imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather
than working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is
constrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands
the ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a
chosen threshold. This ensures the state is able to follow the quantum
imaginary time evolution path in the system Hilbert space rather than in a
restricted variational manifold set by a predefined fixed ansatz. AVQITE is
used to prepare ground states of H$_4$, H$_2$O and BeH$_2$ molecules, where it
yields compact variational ans\""atze and ground state energies within chemical
accuracy. Polynomial scaling of circuit depth with system size is demonstrated
through a set of AVQITE calculations of quantum spin models. Finally, it is
shown that quantum Lanczos calculations can also be naturally performed
alongside AVQITE without additional quantum resource costs.

that $$ \limsup_{k\to \infty}x^*(x_{n_k})-\liminf_{k\to\infty}x^*(x_{n_k}) \leq

aspects of $\varepsilon$-weakly precompact sets. On the one hand, we give
quantitative versions of the following known results: (a) the absolutely convex
hull of a weakly precompact set is weakly precompact (Stegall), and (b) for any
probability measure $\mu$, the set of all Bochner $\mu$-integrable functions
taking values in a weakly precompact subset of $X$ is weakly precompact in
$L_1(\mu,X)$ (Bourgain, Maurey, Pisier). On the other hand, we introduce a
relative of a Banach space property considered by Kampoukos and Mercourakis
when studying subspaces of strongly weakly compactly generated spaces. We say
that a Banach space $X$ has property $\mathfrak{KM}_w$ if there is a family
$\{M_{n,p}:n,p\in \mathbb{N}\}$ of subsets of $X$ such that: (i) $M_{n,p}$ is

computationally efficient description of spallation and cavitation in pure
liquids within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. Aiming at ultra-fast
dynamic loads, the spall failure of a liquid under tension is approximated as
an instantaneous decomposition of metastable states upon reaching the spinodal
stability limit of an appropriate two-phase liquid-gas equation of state. The
spall energy dissipation occurs as entropy jumps in two types of discontinuous
solutions, namely, in hypersonic spall fronts and in pull-back compression
shocks. Practical application of the proposed model is illustrated with
numerical simulations and a detailed analysis of a particular problem of
symmetric plate impact. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement
with the previously published molecular-dynamics simulations. Also, new
approximate nonlinear formulae are derived for evaluation of the strain rate,
fractured mass, and spall strength in terms of the observed variation of the
free-surface velocity. The new formula for the spall strength clarifies complex
interplay of the three first-order nonlinear correction terms and establishes a
universal value of the correction factor for attenuation of the spall pulse,
which in the limit of weak initial loads is independent of the equation of
state.

galaxies and can be used as tracers of cluster formation and evolution in the
cosmic web. However, there is still a controversy on the main epoch of
formation of BCGs, since some authors believe they have already formed before
redshift z=2, while others still find them to evolve at more recent epochs. We
aim to analyse the physical properties of a large sample of BCGs covering a
wide redshift range up to z=1.8 and analysed in a homogeneous way, to see if
their characteristics vary with redshift. As a first step, we also present a
new tool to define for each cluster which galaxy is the BCG. For a sample of
137 clusters with HST images in the optical and/or infrared, we analyse the BCG
properties by applying GALFIT with one or two Sersic components. For each BCG,
we compute the Sersic index, effective radius, major axis position angle,
surface brightness. We then search for correlations of these quantities with
redshift. We find that BCGs follow the Kormendy relation (between the effective
radius and the mean surface brightness), with a slope that remains constant
with redshift, but with a variation with redshift of the ordinate at the
origin. Although the trends are faint, we find that both the absolute
magnitudes and effective radii tend to become respectively brighter and bigger
with decreasing redshift. On the other hand, we find no significant correlation
of the mean surface brightnesses or Sersic indices with redshift. The major
axes of the cluster elongations and of the BCGs agree within 30 degrees for 73%
of our clusters at redshift z <= 0.9. Our results agree with the BCGs being
mainly formed before redshift z=2. The alignment of the major axes of BCGs with
their clusters agree with the general idea that BCGs form at the same time as
clusters by accreting matter along the filaments of the cosmic web.

understanding of the growth processes of functional proteins as well as
disease-causing amyloids. Inside cells, intrinsic molecular fluctuations are so
high that they cast doubt on the validity of the deterministic rate equation
approach. Furthermore, the protein environments inside cells are often crowded
with other macromolecules, with volume fractions of the crowders as high as
40%. We study protein self-aggregation at the cellular level using Gillespie's
stochastic algorithm and investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding
using models built on scaled-particle and transition-state theories. The
stochastic kinetic method can be formulated to provide information on the
dominating aggregation mechanisms in a method called reaction frequency (or
propensity) analysis. This method reveals that the change of scaling laws
related to the lag time can be directly related to the change in the
frequencies of reaction mechanisms. Further examination of the time evolution
of the fibril mass and length quantities unveils that maximal fluctuations
occur in the periods of rapid fibril growth and the fluctuations of both
quantities can be sensitive functions of rate constants. The presence of
crowders often amplifies the roles of primary and secondary nucleation and
causes shifting in the relative importance of elongation, shrinking,
fragmentation and coagulation of linear aggregates. Comparison of the results
of stochastic simulations with those of rate equations gives us information on
the convergence relation between them and how the roles of reaction mechanisms
change as the system volume is varied.

\mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^\top \|_0$ is minimized among all $\mathbf{W}$ for which
each row is $k$-sparse. This question turns out to be closely related to a
number of questions like recovering a hypergraph from its line graph, as well
as reconstruction attacks for private neural network training.
  As this problem is hard in the worst-case, we study a natural average-case
variant that arises in the context of these reconstruction attacks: $\mathbf{M}
= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^{\top}$ for $\mathbf{W}$ a random Boolean matrix with
$k$-sparse rows, and the goal is to recover $\mathbf{W}$ up to column
permutation. Equivalently, this can be thought of as recovering a uniformly
random $k$-uniform hypergraph from its line graph.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem based on
bootstrapping higher-order information about $\mathbf{W}$ and then decomposing
an appropriate tensor. The key ingredient in our analysis, which may be of
independent interest, is to show that such a matrix $\mathbf{W}$ has full
column rank with high probability as soon as $m = \widetilde{\Omega}(r)$, which

coordinated planning model of renewable energy, HVDCs, P2Gs and hydrogen
pipelines is proposed considering both variability and uncertainty, rendering a
distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) program. Then this model is
applied in the case study based on the real Inner Mongolia-Shandong system.
Compared with energy transmission via HVDC only, P2G can provide operation
supplement with its operational flexibility and long term economic supplement
with increasing demand in high-valued transportation sector, which stimulates
an extra 24 GW renewable energy exploration. Sensitivity analysis for both
technical and economic factors further verifies the advantages of P2G in the
presence of high variability due to renewable energy and downward tendency of
prices of renewable energy generators. However, since the additional levelized
cost of the P2G (0.04 RMB/kWh) is approximately twice the HVDC (0.02 RMB/kWh),
P2G is more sensitive to uncertainty from both renewable energy and hydrogen
demand.

the clustering method allows a combination with a broader representation
learning method. In this paper, we adopt deep learning for topic detection by
using a deep autoencoder and fuzzy c-means called deep autoencoder-based fuzzy
c-means (DFCM). The encoder of the autoencoder performs a lower-dimensional

representation to identify the centroids. The autoencoder's decoder transforms
back the centroids into the original representation to be interpreted as the

helping nearly all fields of business to increase operational efficiency or to
develop new value propositions. Besides the challenges of deploying and
maintaining ML models, picking the right edge device (e.g., GPGPUs) to run
these models (e.g., CNN with the massive computational process) is one of the
most pressing challenges faced by organizations today. As the cost of renting
(on Cloud) or purchasing an edge device is directly connected to the cost of
final products or services, choosing the most efficient device is essential.
However, this decision making requires deep knowledge about performance and
power consumption of the ML models running on edge devices that must be
identified at the early stage of ML workflow.
  In this paper, we present a novel ML-based approach that provides ML
engineers with the early estimation of both power consumption and performance
of CUDA-based CNNs on GPGPUs. The proposed approach empowers ML engineers to
pick the most efficient GPGPU for a given CNN model at the early stage of
development.

progress of machine learning. This has particularly affected the development of

additional effort for developers each time they want to make use of a new deep

  In this paper we propose a toolflow using TensorFlow as frontend, thus
offering developers the opportunity of using a familiar environment. On the
backend we use an FPGA, which is addressable via an HSA runtime environment. In
this way we are able to hide the complexity of controlling new hardware from
the user, while at the same time maintaining a high amount of flexibility. This
can be achieved by our HSA toolflow, since the hardware is not statically
configured with the structure of the network. Instead, it can be dynamically
reconfigured during runtime with the respective kernels executed by the network
and simultaneously from other sources e.g. OpenCL/OpenMP.

emerge in networks of globally coupled robust-chaos oscillators. We describe
the collective behavior of a model of globally coupled robust-chaos maps in
terms of statistical quantities, and characterize clusters, chimera states,
synchronization, and incoherence on the space of parameters of the system. We
employ the analogy between the local dynamics of a system of globally coupled

occurrence of clusters and chimeras in a globally coupled system of
robust-chaos maps in terms of windows of periodicity and multistability induced
by a drive on the local robust-chaos map. Our results show that robust-chaos
dynamics does not limit the formation of cluster and chimera states in networks
of coupled systems, as it had been previously conjectured.

increasing battery capacities and a growing fast-charging infrastructure, they
are becoming suitable for long distance travel. However, queues at charging
stations could lead to long waiting times, making efficient route planning even
more important. In general, optimal multi-objective route planning is extremely
computationally expensive. We propose an adaptive charging and routing
strategy, which considers driving, waiting, and charging time. For this, we
developed a multi-criterion shortest-path search algorithm using contraction
hierarchies. To further reduce the computational effort, we precompute
shortest-path trees between the known locations of the charging stations. We
propose a central charging station database (CSDB) that helps estimating
waiting times at charging stations ahead of time. This enables our adaptive
charging and routing strategy to reduce these waiting times. In an extensive
set of simulation experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our concept,
which reduces average waiting times at charging stations by up to 97 %. Even if
only a subset of the cars uses the CSDB approach, we can substantially reduce
waiting times and thereby the total travel time of electric vehicles.

healthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several
diagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical
settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,
and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have
been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to
gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their
acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of
using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases
from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple
orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard
cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies
have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep
learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that
the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic
localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,
and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in
accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,
respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation
applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new
application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc
interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19
classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We
also identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further
research in future.

with a bulk motion, one comes across a couple of pressure-dependent terms,
which though well known, are to an extent, lacking in their conceptual basis
and the ensuing physical interpretation. In the expression for the energy
density, the rest mass density along with the kinetic energy density of the
fluid constituents due to their random motion, which contributes to the
pressure as well, are already included. However, in a fluid with a bulk motion,
there are, in addition, a couple of explicit, pressure-dependent terms in the
energy-momentum densities, whose presence to an extent, is shrouded in mystery,
especially from a physical perspective. We show here that one such
pressure-dependent term appearing in the energy density, represents the work
done by the fluid pressure against the Lorentz contraction during transition
from the rest frame of the fluid to another frame in which the fluid has a bulk
motion. This applies equally to the electromagnetic energy density of
electrically charged systems in motion and explains in a natural manner an
apparently paradoxical result that the field energy of a charged capacitor
system decreases with an increase in the system velocity. The momentum density
includes another pressure-dependent term, that represents an energy flow across
the system, due to the opposite signs of work being done by pressure on two
opposite sides of the moving fluid. From Maxwell's stress tensor we demonstrate
that in the expression for electromagnetic momentum of an electric charged
particle, it is the presence of a similar pressure term, arising from
electrical self-repulsion forces in the charged sphere, that yields a natural
solution for the notorious, more than a century old but thought by many as
still unresolved, 4/3 problem in the electromagnetic momentum.
