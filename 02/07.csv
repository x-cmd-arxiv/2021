outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) populating the so-called star
cluster age gap, a space of time (~ 4-12 Gyr) where the only known star cluster
is up-to-date ESO121-SC\,03. We used Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History
(SMASH) DR2 data sets, as well as those employed to identify these star cluster
candidates, to produce relatively deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 17
out of 20 discovered age gap star clusters with the aim of investigating them
in detail. Our analysis relies on a thorough CMD cleaning procedure of the
field star contamination, which presents variations in its stellar density and
astrophysical properties, such as luminosity and effective temperature, around
the star cluster fields. We built star cluster CMDs from stars with membership
probabilities assigned from the cleaning procedure. These CMDs and their
respective spatial distribution maps favor the existence of LMC star field
density fluctuations rather than age gap star clusters, although a definitive
assessment on them will be possible from further deeper photometry.

stereo, or monocular cameras. Lidar-based methods achieve the best accuracy,
but have a large footprint, high cost, and mechanically-limited angular
sampling rates, resulting in low spatial resolution at long ranges. Recent
approaches based on low-cost monocular or stereo cameras promise to overcome
these limitations but struggle in low-light or low-contrast regions as they
rely on passive CMOS sensors. In this work, we propose a novel 3D object
detection modality that exploits temporal illumination cues from a low-cost
monocular gated imager. We propose a novel deep detector architecture, Gated3D,
that is tailored to temporal illumination cues from three gated images. Gated
images allow us to exploit mature 2D object feature extractors that guide the
3D predictions through a frustum segment estimation. We assess the proposed
method on a novel 3D detection dataset that includes gated imagery captured in
over 10,000 km of driving data. We validate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art monocular and stereo approaches at long distances. We will
release our code and dataset, opening up a new sensor modality as an avenue to
replace lidar in autonomous driving.

model order reduction of linear time-invariant systems are considered within

possible to satisfy all the necessary conditions for the local minimizer in the
oblique projection framework. The conditions for exact satisfaction of the
optimality conditions are also discussed. Further, the equivalence between the
tangential interpolation conditions and the gramians-based necessary condition
for the local optimum is established. Based on this equivalence, iterative
algorithms that nearly satisfy these interpolation-based necessary conditions
are proposed. The deviation in satisfaction of the optimality conditions decay
as the order of the reduced-model is increased in the proposed algorithms.
Moreover, stationary point iteration algorithms that satisfy two out of three
necessary conditions for the local minimizer are also proposed. There also, the
deviation in satisfaction of the third optimality conditions decay as the order
of the reduced-model is increased in the proposed algorithms. The efficacy of
the proposed algorithms is validated by considering one illustrative and three
high-order models that are considered a benchmark for testing model order

  Complex based Kernel Estimation Approach",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dynamic graphs are rife with higher-order interactions, such as co-authorship
relationships and protein-protein interactions in biological networks, that
naturally arise between more than two nodes at once. In spite of the ubiquitous
presence of such higher-order interactions, limited attention has been paid to
the higher-order counterpart of the popular pairwise link prediction problem.
Existing higher-order structure prediction methods are mostly based on
heuristic feature extraction procedures, which work well in practice but lack
theoretical guarantees. Such heuristics are primarily focused on predicting
links in a static snapshot of the graph. Moreover, these heuristic-based
methods fail to effectively utilize and benefit from the knowledge of latent
substructures already present within the higher-order structures. In this
paper, we overcome these obstacles by capturing higher-order interactions
succinctly as \textit{simplices}, model their neighborhood by face-vectors, and
develop a nonparametric kernel estimator for simplices that views the evolving
graph from the perspective of a time process (i.e., a sequence of graph
snapshots). Our method substantially outperforms several baseline higher-order
prediction methods. As a theoretical achievement, we prove the consistency and
asymptotic normality in terms of the Wasserstein distance of our estimator

However, especially for premixed combustion configurations, characterized by
high reaction rates and thin reaction zones, a fine PDF resolution is required,
both in physical and in composition space, leading to high numerical costs. An
alternative approach to solve a PDF is the method of moments, which has shown
to be numerically efficient in a wide range of applications. In this work, two
Quadrature-based Moment closures are evaluated in the context of turbulent
premixed combustion. The Quadrature-based Moment Methods (QMOM) and the
recently developed Extended QMOM (EQMOM) are used in combination with a
tabulated chemistry approach to approximate the composition PDF. Both closures
are first applied to an established benchmark case for PDF methods, a plug-flow
reactor with imperfect mixing, and compared to reference results obtained from
Lagrangian particle and SF approaches. Second, a set of turbulent premixed
methane-air flames are simulated, varying the Karlovitz number and the
turbulent length scale. The turbulent flame speeds obtained are compared with
SF reference solutions. Further, spatial resolution requirements for simulating
these premixed flames using QMOM are investigated and compared with the
requirements of SF. The results demonstrate that both QMOM and EQMOM approaches
are well suited to reproduce the turbulent flame properties. Additionally, it
is shown that moment methods require lower spatial resolution compared to SF

obtained should be tighter than the unitarity bounds, otherwise the results are
meaningless, therefore there exists a minimal luminosity for a $e^+e^-$
collider such as the CEPC to study the nTGCs. To derive the minimal luminosity,
the kinematic features and event selection strategy are studied by Monte-Carlo
simulation. Both the processes $e^+e^-\to \ell^+\ell^-\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\to
jj\gamma$ are studied, event selection strategies are discussed. Based on the
statistical significance, the expected constraints in experiments are
estimated. The required luminosities for the experiments to reach the unitarity
bounds are presented.

investigated in ferromagnet/ heavy metal (HM) heterostructures. Recently
antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are found to be good replacement of HMs
because AFMs exhibit terahertz spin dynamics, high spin-orbit coupling, and
absence of stray field. In this context we have performed the ISHE in CoFeB/
IrMn heterostructures. Spin pumping study is carried out for
$Co_{40}Fe_{40}B_{20} (12\ nm)/ Cu (3\ nm)/ Ir_{50}Mn_{50} (t\ nm)/ AlO_{x} (3\
nm)$ samples where \textit{t} value varies from 0 to 10 nm. Damping of all the
samples are higher than the single layer CoFeB which indicates that spin
pumping due to IrMn is the underneath mechanism. Further the spin pumping in
the samples are confirmed by angle dependent ISHE measurements. We have also
disentangled other spin rectifications effects and found that the spin pumping
is dominant in all the samples. From the ISHE analysis the real part of spin
mixing conductance (\textit{$g_{r}^{\uparrow \downarrow}$}) is found to be
0.704 $\pm$ 0.003 $\times$ $10^{18}$ $m^{-2}$.

devices are mainly powered by low-cost microcontrollers (MCUs) that typically
lack basic hardware security mechanisms to separate security-critical
applications from less critical components. Recently, Arm has started to
release Cortex-M MCUs enhanced with TrustZone technology (i.e., TrustZone-M), a
system-wide security solution aiming at providing robust protection for IoT
devices. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) relying on TrustZone hardware
have been perceived as safe havens for securing mobile devices. However, for
the past few years, considerable effort has gone into unveiling hundreds of
vulnerabilities and proposing a collection of relevant defense techniques to
address several issues. While new TEE solutions built on TrustZone-M start
flourishing, the lessons gathered from the research community appear to be
falling short, as these new systems are trapping into the same pitfalls of the
past.
  In this paper, we present uTango, the first multi-world TEE for modern IoT
devices. uTango proposes a novel architecture aiming at tackling the major
architectural deficiencies currently affecting TrustZone(-M)-assisted TEEs. In
particular, we leverage the very same TrustZone hardware primitives used by
dual-world implementations to create multiple and equally secure execution
environments within the normal world. We demonstrate the benefits of uTango by
conducting an extensive evaluation on a real TrustZone-M hardware platform,
i.e., Arm Musca-B1. uTango will be open-sourced and freely available on GitHub
in hopes of engaging academia and industry on securing the foreseeable trillion
IoT devices.

study their life-cycle. Spatially and temporally resolved direct numerical
simulation data is used to analyze the strong wall-parallel movements
conditioned to low-speed streamwise flow. The analysis of the streaks shows
that there is a clear distinction between wall-attached and detached streaks,
and that the former can be further categorized into streaks that are contained
in the buffer layer and the ones that reach the outer region. The results
reveal that streaks are born in the buffer layer, coalescing with each other to
create larger streaks that are still attached to the wall. Once the streak
becomes large enough, it starts to meander due to the large
streamwise-to-wall-normal aspect ratio, and consequently the elongation in the
streamwise direction, which makes it more difficult for the streak to be
oriented strictly in the streamwise direction. While the continuous interaction
of the streaks allows the super-structure to span extremely long temporal and
length scales, individual streak components are relatively small and
short-lived. Tall-attached streaks eventually split into wall-attached and
wall-detached components. These wall-detached streaks have a strong wall-normal
velocity away from the wall, similar to ejections or bursts observed in the
literature. Conditionally averaging the flow fields to these split events show
that the detached streak has not only a larger wall-normal velocity compared to
the wall-attached counterpart, it also has a larger (less negative) streamwise
velocity, similar to the velocity field at the tip of a vortex cluster.

segments from voice profiles are represented by labeled nodes while segments
from test utterances are unlabeled nodes. The weight of edges between nodes is
evaluated by the similarities between the pretrained speaker embeddings of

problem on graphs, on which two graph-based methods are applied: label

able to utilize the structural information of the graph to improve speaker

the graph based approaches reduce speaker attribution error by up to 68%

activation detection can be guided by the fact that very few voxels are, in
reality, truly activated and that these voxels are spatially localized, but it
is challenging to incorporate both these facts. We address these twin
challenges to single-subject and low-signal fMRI by developing a
computationally feasible and methodologically sound model-based approach,
implemented in the R package MixfMRI, that bounds the a priori expected
proportion of activated voxels while also incorporating spatial context. An
added benefit of our methodology is the ability to distinguish voxels and
regions having different intensities of activation. Our suggested approach is
evaluated in realistic two- and three-dimensional simulation experiments as
well as on multiple real-world datasets. Finally, the value of our suggested
approach in low-signal and single-subject fMRI studies is illustrated on a

improve treatment in patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS). Our ability
to reliably distinguish activation in this experiment potentially opens the
door to the adoption of fMRI as a clinical tool for the improved treatment and

self-limiting nature of the chemical reactions during ALD provides excellent
control over the layer thickness. However, in contrast to idealized growth
models, it is experimentally challenging to create continuous monolayers by ALD
because surface inhomogeneities and precursor steric interactions result in
island growth during film nucleation. Thus, the ability to create pin-hole free

charge and mass transport in semiconductor devices, as well as for tailoring
surface chemistry. Here, we report full encapsulation of c-plane gallium

into AlOx using a combination of trimethylaluminum deposition and hydrogen

(DP) which kinetically mixes (KM) with the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge
field is a very attractive scenario. For DM in the interesting mass range below
$\sim 1$ GeV, it is well known that bounds from the CMB provide a very strong
model building constraint forcing the DM annihilation cross section to be
roughly 3 orders of magnitude below that needed to reproduce the observed relic
density. Under most circumstances this removes the possibility of an $s$-wave
annihilation process for DM in this mass range as would be the case, e.g., if
the DM were a Dirac fermion. In an extra-dimensional setup explored previously,
it was found that the $s$-channel exchange of multiple gauge bosons could
simultaneously encompass a suppressed annihilation cross section during the CMB
era while also producing a sufficiently large annihilation rate during
freeze-out to recover the DM relic density. In this paper, we analyze more
globally the necessary requirements for this mechanism to work successfully and
then realize them within the context of a simple model with two `dark' gauge
bosons having masses of a similar magnitude and whose contributions to the
annihilation amplitude destructively interfere. We show that if the DM mass
threshold lies appropriately in the saddle region of this destructive
interference between the two resonance humps it then becomes possible to
satisfy these requirements simultaneously provided several ancillary conditions
are met. The multiple constraints on the parameter space of this setup are then
explored in detail to identify the phenomenologically successful regions.

wrapping occurs at certain DOA angles leading to phase-difference ambiguities.
Existing phase unwrapping methods exploit either frequency or spatial
diversity. These techniques work by imposing restrictions on the utilized
frequencies or the receiver array geometry. In addition to sensitivity to noise
and calibration errors, these methods may also have high computational
complexity. We propose a grid-less \emph{phase-difference projection} (PDP) DOA

phased-difference pattern} (WPDP) is introduced, which allows the proposed
algorithm to compute most of the parameters required for DOA estimation in an

Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed

dynamic contact problems in linear elasticity. Instead of the augmented
Lagrangian method that is widely used for mechanical contact problems, we
prefer here the Linear Complementarity Programming (LCP) method as basic
methodology. It has the advantage of resulting in the much smaller dual problem
that is associated with the governing variational principle and that turns out
to be beneficial for the model order reduction. Since the shape of the contact
zone depends strongly on the acting outer forces, the LCP for the Lagrange
multipliers has to be solved in each time step. The model order reduction
scheme, on the other hand, is applied to the large linear system for the
displacements and computed in advance by means of an Arnoldi process. In terms
of computational effort the reduction scheme is very appealing because the
contact constraints are fully satisfied while the reduction acts only on the
displacements. As an extension of our approach, we furthermore take up the idea
of the Craig-Bampton method in order to distinguish between interior nodes and
the nodes in the contact zone. A careful performance analysis closes the paper.

Among these solutions, re-configurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which are
newly proposed modules, may be exploited to reflect the incident signal in the
direction of dead zones, increase communication coverage, and make the channel
smarter and controllable. In this paper, we tackle the skip-zone problem in
near-terrestrial free-space optical (nT-FSO) systems using RIS. We carry out a
performance analysis of RIS-aided nT-FSO links affected by turbulence and
pointing errors, for both heterodyne detection (HD) and intensity
modulation-direct detection (IM/DD) techniques. Turbulence is modeled using the
Gamma-Gamma (G-G) distribution. We analyze the model and provide exact
closed-form expressions of the probability density function, cumulative
distribution function, and moment generating function of the end-to-end
signal-to-noise ratio, $\gamma$. Capitalizing on these statistics, we evaluate
the system performance through the outage probability, $ P_{out} $, ergodic
channel capacity, $\overline{C}$, and average bit-error-rate, $\overline{P}_b$,
for selected binary modulation schemes. Numerical results obtained for
different turbulence levels and pointing errors confirm that the HD technique
outperforms IM/DD even in RIS-aided nT-FSO systems. These results also show
that using a blue color offers better channel capacity and communication
performance compared to red and green colors.

this paper, we point out that a model-dependent determination of polarization
calibration can be achieved by the joint fit of the TE and EE CMB power
spectra. This provides a valuable cross-check to band-averaged polarization
efficiency measurements determined using other approaches. We demonstrate that,
in $\Lambda$CDM, the combination of the TE and EE constrain polarization
calibration with sub-percent uncertainty with Planck data and 2% uncertainty
with SPTpol data. We arrive at similar conclusions when extending $\Lambda$CDM
to include the amplitude of lensing $A_{\rm L}$, the number of relativistic
species $N_{\rm eff}$, or the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}$. The
uncertainties on cosmological parameters are minimally impacted when
marginalizing over polarization calibration, except, as can be expected, for
the uncertainty on the amplitude of the primordial scalar power spectrum
$\ln(10^{10} A_{\rm s})$, which increases by $20-50$%. However, this
information can be fully recovered by adding TT data. For current and future
ground-based experiments, SPT-3G and CMB-S4, we forecast the cosmological
parameter uncertainties to be minimally degraded when marginalizing over
polarization calibration parameters. In addition, CMB-S4 could constrain its
polarization calibration at the level of $\sim$0.2% by combining TE and EE, and
reach $\sim$0.06% by also including TT. We therefore conclude that relying on
calibrating against Planck polarization maps, whose statistical uncertainty is
limited to $\sim$0.5%, would be insufficient for upcoming experiments.

  COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model",,,,,"q-bio.PE cs.LG cs.SI stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential
for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing
the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID-19 tests performed in
every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect
of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in
managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. Methods: We introduce
COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that
evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and
provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should
be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a
geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused
by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as
environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation
measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates
that if the policy-makers relax the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days then
both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths
increase exponentially by an average of 5.1x, who may occupy ICU beds and
ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model
accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations,
and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to
modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental
conditions and mitigation measures. Availability: We release the source code of
the COVIDHunter implementation at https://github.com/CMU- SAFARI/COVIDHunter
and show how to flexibly configure our model for any scenario and easily extend
it for different measures and conditions than we account for.

accelerated quantum simulations of condensed matter due to its enhanced
computational efficiency over standard Density Functional Theory approaches.
However, DFTB models can be challenging to determine for individual systems of
interest, especially for metallic and interfacial systems where different
bonding arrangements can lead to significant changes in electronic states. In
this regard, we have created a rapid-screening approach for determining
systematically improvable DFTB interaction potentials that can yield
transferable models for a variety of conditions. Our method leverages a recent
reactive molecular dynamics force field where many-body interactions are
represented by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. This allows for
the efficient creation of multi-center representations with relative ease,
requiring only a small investment in initial DFT calculations. We have focused
our workflow on TiH$_2$ as a model system and show that a relatively small
training set based on unit-cell sized calculations yields a model accurate for
both bulk and surface properties. Our approach is easy to implement and can
yield accurate DFTB models over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions,
where physical and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly
and there is historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for
interpretation and validation of experimental results.

components on multiple scales, driven by changing environment and inherent
stochasticity. Such models are often analytically and numerically intractable.
We revisit a dynamic maximum entropy method that combines a static maximum
entropy and a quasi-stationary approximation. This allows us to reduce
stochastic non-equilibrium dynamics expressed by the Fokker-Planck equation to
a simpler low-dimensional deterministic dynamics, without the need to track
microscopic details. Although the method has been previously applied to a few
(rather complicated) applications in population genetics, our main goal here is
to explain and to better understand how the method works. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the method for two widely studied stochastic problems,
highlighting its accuracy in capturing important macroscopic quantities even in
rapidly changing non-stationary conditions. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
the method recovers the exact dynamics whilst for a stochastic island model
with migration from other habitats, the approximation retains high macroscopic
accuracy under a wide range of scenarios for a dynamic environment.

fission recycling is responsible for the robustness of this site against many
astrophysical uncertainties. Here, we introduce new improvements to our
scission-point model, called SPY, to derive the fission fragment distribution
for all neutron-rich fissioning nuclei of relevance in r-process calculations.
These improvements include a phenomenological modification of the scission
distance and a smoothing procedure of the distribution. Such corrections lead
to a much better agreement with experimental fission yields. Those yields are
also used to estimate the number of neutrons emitted by the excited fragments
on the basis of different neutron evaporation models. Our new fission yields
are extensively compared to those predicted by the so-called GEF model. The
impact of fission on the r-process nucleosynthesis in binary neutron mergers is
also reanalyzed. Two scenarios are considered, the first one with low initial
electron fraction is subject to intense fission recycling, in contrast to the
second one which includes weak interactions on nucleons. The various regions of
the nuclear chart responsible for fission recycling during the neutron
irradiation as well as after freeze-out are discussed. The contribution fission
processes may have to the final abundance distribution is also studied in
detail in the light of newly defined quantitative indicators describing the
fission recycling, the fission seeds and the fission progenitors. In

liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), are important for physiological
function, with electrostatics -- among other interaction types -- being a
prominent force in their assembly. Charge interactions of intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) and other biomolecules are sensitive to the aqueous
dielectric environment. Because the relative permittivity of protein is
significantly lower than that of water, the interior of an IDP condensate is a
relatively low-dielectric regime, which, aside from its possible functional
effects on client molecules, should facilitate stronger electrostatic
interactions among the scaffold IDPs. To gain insight into this LLPS-induced
dielectric heterogeneity, addressing in particular whether a low-dielectric
condensed phase entails more favorable LLPS than that posited by assuming IDP
electrostatic interactions are uniformly modulated by the higher dielectric
constant of the pure solvent, we consider a simplified multiple-chain model of
polyampholytes immersed in explicit solvents that are either polarizable or
possess a permanent dipole. Notably, simulated phase behaviors of these systems
exhibit only minor to moderate differences from those obtained using
implicit-solvent models with a uniform relative permittivity equals to that of
pure solvent. Buttressed by theoretical treatments developed here using random
phase approximation and polymer field-theoretic simulations, these observations
indicate a partial compensation of effects between favorable solvent-mediated
interactions among the polyampholytes in the condensed phase and favorable
polyampholyte-solvent interactions in the dilute phase, often netting only a
minor enhancement of overall LLPS propensity from the very dielectric
heterogeneity that arises from the LLPS itself. Further ramifications of this
principle are discussed.

two key features. Firstly, the common manipulation task is represented by the
proposed nominal task ellipsoid, which is used to maximize each robot force
capability online via optimizing its configuration. Secondly, a decentralized
adaptive controller is designed to be Lyapunov stable in spite of heterogeneous
actuation constraints of the robots and uncertain physical parameters of the
object and environment. In the proposed framework, decentralized coordination
and load distribution between the robots is achieved without communication,
while only the control deficiency is broadcast if any of the robots reaches its
force limits. In this case, the object reference trajectory is modified in a
decentralized manner to guarantee stable interaction. Finally, we perform
several numerical and physical simulations to analyse and verify the proposed
method with heterogeneous multi-robot teams in collaborative manipulation

current (SHC) method, and a method we propose called homogeneous nonequilibrium
modal analysis (HNEMA). First, we derive a convenient per-atom virial

compact representations of the heat current, each velocity decomposition

calculating the spectral TC for carbon nanotubes, graphene, and silicon. We
show that each method qualitatively agrees except at optical phonon
frequencies, where a combination of mismatched eigenvectors and a large density

calculations also show that the HNEMA and SHC methods converge much faster than
the GKMA method, with the SHC method being the most computationally efficient.

$2^3S_1$-$1^3D_1$ mixing, or the pure $B(2^3S_1)$ state, or $B(2^1S_0)$. (ii)
The $B_J(5970)$ resonance may be assigned as the $1^3D_3$ state in the $B$
meson family, although it as a pure $2^3S_1$ state cannot be excluded. (iii)
The narrow structure around 6064 MeV observed in the $B^+K^-$ mass spectrum at
LHCb may be mainly caused by the $B_{sJ}(6109)$ resonance decaying into
$B^{*+}K^-$, and favors the assignment of the high mass $1D$-wave mixed state
$B_s(1D'_2)$ with $J^P=2^-$, although it as the $1^3D_3$ state cannot be

associated large and one-sided transverse flows in the solar wind observed by
Parker Solar Probe. The more radial, Sub-Parker Spiral structure of the
heliospheric magnetic field observed previously by Ulysses, ACE, and STEREO is
created within rarefaction regions where footpoint motion from the source of
fast into slow wind at the Sun creates a magnetic field line connection across
solar wind speed shear. Conversely, when foot-points move from the source of
slow wind into faster wind, a Super-Parker Spiral field structure is formed:
below the Alfven critical point, one-sided transverse field-aligned flows
develop; above the Alfven critical point, the field structure contracts between
adjacent solar wind flows, and the radial field component decreases in
magnitude with distance from the Sun, eventually reversing into a switchback.
The Sub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals behave functionally as opposites.
Observations from Parker Solar Probe confirm the paucity of switchbacks within
rarefaction regions and immediately outside these rarefaction regions, we
observe numerous switchbacks in the magnetic field that are directly associated
with abrupt transients in solar wind speed. The radial component of the
magnetic field, the speed gradients, radial Alfven speed, and the ratio of the
sound speed to the radial Alfven speed all conform to predictions based on the
Sub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals within rarefaction regions and solar wind
speed enhancements (spikes or jets), respectively. Critically, the predictions
associated with the Super- Parker Spiral naturally explain the observations of
switchbacks being associated with unexpectedly large and one-sided tangential
flows.

among these groups. We introduce an aggregate Contact Exposure Index (CEI) to
measure exposure due to this interpersonal contact and combine it with social
distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of
structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of exposure on case
growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in
lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth
via contact exposure. Using the CEI, schools and restaurants are identified as
high-exposure industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing

preventing overcrowding, improving canopy access to light and promoting

typically made using tradition or rules of thumb rather than data-driven
analysis. Many existing algorithmic, simulation-based approaches rely on
high-fidelity digital captures or purely computer-generated fruit trees, and
are unable to provide specific results on an orchard scale. We present a
framework for suggesting pruning strategies on LiDAR-scanned commercial fruit
trees using a scoring function with a focus on improving light distribution
throughout the canopy. A scoring function to assess the quality of the tree
shape based on its light availability and size was developed for comparative
analysis between trees, and was validated against yield characteristics,
demonstrating a reasonable correlation against fruit count with an $R^2$ score
of 0.615 for avocado and 0.506 for mango. A tool was implemented for simulating
pruning by algorithmically estimating which parts of a tree point cloud would
be removed given specific cut points using structural analysis of the tree,
validated experimentally with an average F1 score of 0.78 across 144
experiments. Finally, new pruning locations were suggested and we used the
previous two stages to estimate the improvement of the tree given these
suggestions. The light distribution was improved by up to 25.15\%,
demonstrating a 16\% improvement over commercial pruning on a real tree, and
certain cut points were discovered which improved light distribution with a
smaller negative impact on tree volume. The final results suggest value in the
framework as a decision making tool for commercial growers, or as a starting
point for automated pruning since the entire process can be performed with
little human intervention.

better accuracy. It is shown that the progressive learning method can be used
for fine-tuning of weights from convergence point of view. The effectiveness of
the proposed framework is illustrated based on classical benchmark recognition

sense state at regular intervals of $d$ time steps, $d > 1$, ignoring state
information in between sensing steps. While it is clear that this practice can
reduce sensing and compute costs, recent results indicate a further benefit. On
many Atari console games, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms deliver
substantially better policies when run with $d > 1$ -- in fact with $d$ even as
high as $180$. In this paper, we investigate the role of the parameter $d$ in
RL; $d$ is called the ""frame-skip"" parameter, since states in the Atari domain
are images. For evaluating a fixed policy, we observe that under standard
conditions, frame-skipping does not affect asymptotic consistency. Depending on
other parameters, it can possibly even benefit learning. To use $d > 1$ in the
control setting, one must first specify which $d$-step open-loop action
sequences can be executed in between sensing steps. We focus on
""action-repetition"", the common restriction of this choice to $d$-length
sequences of the same action. We define a task-dependent quantity called the
""price of inertia"", in terms of which we upper-bound the loss incurred by
action-repetition. We show that this loss may be offset by the gain brought to
learning by a smaller task horizon. Our analysis is supported by experiments on

Thompson sampling approximation for DQNs which uses a deep network whose

interpret the successful NoisyNets method \cite{fortunato2018noisy} as an
approximation to the variational Thompson sampling method that we derive.
Further, we propose State Aware Noisy Exploration (SANE) which seeks to improve
on NoisyNets by allowing a non-uniform perturbation, where the amount of
parameter perturbation is conditioned on the state of the agent. This is done
with the help of an auxiliary perturbation module, whose output is state
dependent and is learnt end to end with gradient descent. We hypothesize that
such state-aware noisy exploration is particularly useful in problems where
exploration in certain \textit{high risk} states may result in the agent
failing badly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the state-aware exploration

image plays a central role in replicating a realistic virtual hand in
human-computer interaction and virtual reality applications. The results of
current methods are lacking in accuracy and fidelity due to various hand poses
and severe occlusions. In this study, we propose an I2UV-HandNet model for
accurate hand pose and shape estimation as well as 3D hand super-resolution
reconstruction. Specifically, we present the first UV-based 3D hand shape
representation. To recover a 3D hand mesh from an RGB image, we design an
AffineNet to predict a UV position map from the input in an image-to-image
translation fashion. To obtain a higher fidelity shape, we exploit an
additional SRNet to transform the low-resolution UV map outputted by AffineNet
into a high-resolution one. For the first time, we demonstrate the
characterization capability of the UV-based hand shape representation. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on several challenging benchmarks.

crafted by applying small, human-imperceptible perturbations on the original
images, so as to mislead deep neural networks to output inaccurate predictions.
Adversarial attacks can thus be an important method to evaluate and select
robust models in safety-critical applications. However, under the challenging
black-box setting, most existing adversarial attacks often achieve relatively
low success rates on adversarially trained networks and advanced defense
models. In this paper, we propose AdaBelief Iterative Fast Gradient Method
(ABI-FGM) and Crop-Invariant attack Method (CIM) to improves the
transferability of adversarial examples. ABI-FGM and CIM can be readily
integrated to build a strong gradient-based attack to further boost the success
rates of adversarial examples for black-box attacks. Moreover, our method can
also be naturally combined with other gradient-based attack methods to build a
more robust attack to generate more transferable adversarial examples against
the defense models. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate
the method's effectiveness. Whether on adversarially trained networks or
advanced defense models, our method has higher success rates than
state-of-the-art gradient-based attack methods.

exceptional points and lines. The positive and negative resistive couplings Rg
in the circuit provide loss and gain factors which break the Hermiticity of the
circuit Laplacian. By controlling Rg, the exceptional lines of the circuit can
be modulated, e.g., from open curves to closed ellipses in the Brillouin zone.
In practice, the topology of the exceptional lines can be detected by the
impedance spectra of the circuit. We also considered finite TE systems with
open boundary conditions, the admittance spectrum of which exhibits highly
tunable zero-admittance states demarcated by boundary points (BPs). The phase
diagram of the system shows topological phases which are characterized by the
number of their BPs. The transition between different phases can be controlled
by varying the circuit parameters and tracked via impedance readout between the
terminal nodes. Our TE model offers an accessible and tunable means of
realizing different topological phases in a non-Hermitian framework, and
characterizing them based on their boundary point and exceptional line

network predictions and improving their robustness. Existing attack methods aim
to deceive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers by manipulating
RGB images that are fed directly to the classifiers. However, these approaches
typically neglect the influence of the camera optics and image processing
pipeline (ISP) that produce the network inputs. ISPs transform RAW measurements
to RGB images and traditionally are assumed to preserve adversarial patterns.
However, these low-level pipelines can, in fact, destroy, introduce or amplify
adversarial patterns that can deceive a downstream detector. As a result,
optimized patterns can become adversarial for the classifier after being
transformed by a certain camera ISP and optic but not for others. In this work,
we examine and develop such an attack that deceives a specific camera ISP while
leaving others intact, using the same down-stream classifier. We frame
camera-specific attacks as a multi-task optimization problem, relying on a
differentiable approximation for the ISP itself. We validate the proposed

such that a concise $L^2$ norm error estimate is established at the first time

shown to be mesh-robustly convergent in the sense that the convergence constant

ratios. The suggested method is proved to preserve a modified energy
dissipation law at the discrete levels if $0<r_k\le r_{\mathrm{user}}$, such

howardite fall. Cosmogenic isotopes show that Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek experienced a
complex cosmic ray exposure history, exposed during ~12-14 Ma in a regolith
near the surface of a parent asteroid, and that an ca.1 m sized meteoroid was
launched by an impact 22 +/- 2 Ma ago to Earth (as did one third of all HED
meteorites). SIMS dating of zircon and baddeleyite yielded 4550.4 +/- 2.5 Ma
and 4553 +/- 8.8 Ma crystallization ages for the basaltic magma clasts. The
apatite U-Pb age of 4525 +/- 17 Ma, K-Ar age of ~3.9 Ga, and the U,Th-He ages
of 1.8 +/- 0.7 and 2.6 +/- 0.3 Ga are interpreted to represent thermal
metamorphic and impact-related resetting ages, respectively. Petrographic,
geochemical and O-, Cr- and Ti- isotopic studies confirm that Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek
belongs to the normal clan of HED meteorites. Petrographic observations and
analysis of organic material indicate a small portion of carbonaceous chondrite
material in the Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek regolith and organic contamination of the
meteorite after a few days on soil. Video observations of the fall show an
atmospheric entry at 17.3 +/- 0.8 kms-1 from NW, fragmentations at 37, 33, 31
and 27 km altitude, and provide a pre-atmospheric orbit that is the first
dynamical link between the normal HED meteorite clan and the inner Main Belt.
Spectral data indicate the similarity of Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek with the Vesta
asteroid family spectra, a group of asteroids stretching to delivery
resonances, which includes (4) Vesta. Dynamical modeling of meteoroid delivery
to Earth shows that the disruption of a ca.1 km sized Vesta family asteroid or
a ~10 km sized impact crater on Vesta is required to provide sufficient
meteoroids <4 m in size to account for the influx of meteorites from this HED
clan.

demanding. To address this, we develop a batch-based algorithm that is optimal
up to a multiplicative constant depending on the batch size. We hence provide a

estimates of tokens' frequencies in a large data stream using a compressed

the stream are drawn from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed
with a normalized inverse Gaussian process (NIGP) prior. Then, using

a token's frequency in the stream, given the hashed data, and in turn
corresponding BNP estimates. Applications to synthetic and real data show that
our approach achieves a remarkable performance in the estimation of

the residual black hematite/magnetite sand that remains after gold panning,
there is a unique set of associated diverse indicator minerals. These indicator

houses, buildings, etc.). It aims to minimize the total operational cost of the
MG community and maximize the individual benefit of each MG simultaneously. At
the local level inside each MG, with the detailed modeling of various energy
resources including photovoltaics (PVs), energy storages (ESs), electric
vehicles (EVs) and dispatchable loads, the individual optimization problem is
formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Local EMSs makes power
dispatch decisions for all the controllable units to minimize the operational
cost in individual MGs. At the community level, a novel pairing algorithm is
proposed to explicitly find the MG pairings with surplus and deficit. The
community-level EMS employs the pairing algorithm to determine specific power
exchanges among MGs and minimizes the energy transactions with the upstream
grid. The operational cost of each individual MG is further reduced by
additional economic benefits procured by the community-level EMS. The proposed
method has distinguishing advantages on modeling generality, computational
complexity and privacy protection, and its performance is verified by the
simulation results.

Recently, many new phages have been revealed using high throughput sequencing,
particularly metagenomic sequencing. Compared to the fast accumulation of
phage-like sequences, there is a serious lag in taxonomic classification of
phages. High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great
challenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have
difficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic
data. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,
named PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this
learning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence
features learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence
similarity gained from gene-sharing network. Then we apply graph convolutional

enhance the learning ability. We tested PhaGCN on both simulated and real
sequencing data. The results clearly show that our method competes favorably

believe that the same technology can empower applications that have extremely
different requirements and exhibit dissimilar performance and security. This
position paper elaborates on the theory of distributed systems to advance a
clear definition of blockchain that allows us to clarify its role in the IoT.
This definition inextricably binds together three elements that, as a whole,
provide the blockchain with those unique features that distinguish it from
other distributed ledger technologies: immutability, transparency and
anonimity. We note however that immutability comes at the expense of remarkable
resource consumption, transparency demands no confidentiality and anonymity
prevents user identification and registration. This is in stark contrast to the
requirements of most IoT applications that are made up of resource constrained
devices, whose data need to be kept confidential and users to be clearly known.
Building on the proposed definition, we derive new guidelines for selecting the
proper distributed ledger technology depending on application requirements and
trust models, identifying common pitfalls leading to improper applications of
the blockchain. We finally indicate a feasible role of the blockchain for the
IoT: myriads of local, IoT transactions can be aggregated off-chain and then be
successfully recorded on an external blockchain as a means of public

and estimated during experiments, thus the approach is fully data-driven. The
goal is to obtain an input-output low dimensional linear model which
approximates the system across its operating range. Since the dynamics of
aeroservoelastic systems markedly changes in operation (e.g. due to change in
flight speed or altitude), time-varying features are retained in the
constructed models. This is achieved by generating a Linear Parameter-Varying
representation made of a collection of state-consistent linear time-invariant
reduced-order models. The algorithm formulation hinges on the idea of replacing
the orthogonal projection onto the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition modes, used
in Dynamic Mode Decomposition-based approaches, with a balancing oblique
projection constructed entirely from data. As a consequence, the input-output
information captured in the lower-dimensional representation is increased
compared to other projections onto subspaces of same or lower size. Moreover, a
parameter-varying projection is possible while also achieving
state-consistency. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a
morphing wing for airborne wind energy applications by comparing the
performance against two algorithms recently proposed in the literature.
Comparisons cover both prediction accuracy and performance in model predictive
control applications.

dominant approach to reinforcement learning for continuous control. One of the
primary drivers of this improved performance is the use of pessimistic value

disappointing performance. However, a direct consequence of pessimism is
reduced exploration, running counter to theoretical support for the efficacy of
optimism in the face of uncertainty. So which approach is best? In this work,
we show that the most effective degree of optimism can vary both across tasks

deep actor-critic framework, Tactical Optimistic and Pessimistic (TOP)
estimation, which switches between optimistic and pessimistic value learning
online. This is achieved by formulating the selection as a multi-arm bandit
problem. We show in a series of continuous control tasks that TOP outperforms
existing methods which rely on a fixed degree of optimism, setting a new state

simple to implement, we believe these insights can easily be incorporated into
a multitude of off-policy algorithms.

Navier-Stokes simulations are facing the ever-growing demand for more accurate

promising impact in turbulence modeling, but in their infancy for widespread
industrial adoption. Towards this end, this work proposes a universal,
inherently interpretable machine learning framework of turbulence modeling,
which mainly consists of two parallel machine-learning-based modules to
respectively infer the integrity basis and closure coefficients. At every phase
of the model development, both data representing the evolution dynamics of
turbulence and domain-knowledge representing prior physical considerations are
properly fed and reasonably converted into modeling knowledge. Thus, the
developed model is both data- and knowledge-driven. Specifically, a version
with pre-constrained integrity basis is provided to demonstrate detailedly how
to integrate domain-knowledge, how to design a fair and robust training
strategy, and how to evaluate the data-driven model. Plain neural network and
residual neural network as the building blocks in each module are compared.
Emphases are made on three-fold: (i) a compact input feature parameterizing the
newly-proposed turbulent timescale is introduced to release nonunique mappings
between conventional input arguments and output Reynolds stress; (ii) the
realizability limiter is developed to overcome under-constraint of modeled
stress; and (iii) constraints of fairness and noisy-sensitivity are first
included in the training procedure. In such endeavors, an invariant,
realizable, unbiased and robust data-driven turbulence model is achieved, and
does gain good generalization across channel flows at different Reynolds

the chemical matrix effect, and the difference in morphology between laboratory
standard samples (in pressed pellet, glass or ceramics) used to establish
calibration models and natural rocks encountered on Mars, leading to the
physical matric effect. The chemical matrix effect has been tackled in the

with the physical matrix effect which is still expecting a satisfactory

coupled direct numerical simulations of inertialess spheroids in turbulent
channel flow by an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The additional stress accounts
for the feedback from inertialess spheroids on the fluid phase. The results
demonstrate that both rigid elongated fibers (prolate spheroids) and thin disks
(oblate spheroids) can lead to significant turbulence modulations and drag
reduction. However, the disk-induced drag reduction is less pronounced than
that of rigid fibers with the same volume fraction. Typical features of
drag-reduced flows by additives are observed in both flow statistics and
turbulence coherent structures. Moreover, in contrast to one-way simulations,
the two-way coupled results of spheroidal particles exhibit stronger
preferential alignments and lower rotation rates. At the end we propose a drag
reduction mechanism by inertialess spheroids and explain the different
performance for drag reduction by fibers and disks. We find that the spheroidal
particles weaken the quasistreamwise vortices through negative work and,
therefore, the Reynolds shear stress is reduced. However, the mean shear stress
generated by particles, which is shape-dependent, partly compensates for the
reduction of Reynolds shear stress and thus affects the efficiency of drag
reduction. The present study implies that tiny disk-like particles can be an

non-Hermitian skin effects can survive when deviating from the open boundary

solutions for one-dimensional non-Hermitian models with generalized boundary

boundary terms. Besides the open boundary condition, we identify the existence
of non-Hermitian skin effect when one of the boundary hopping terms vanishes.
Apart from this critical line on the boundary parameter space, we find that the
skin effect is fragile under any tiny boundary perturbation in the
thermodynamic limit, although it can survive in a finite size system. Moreover,
we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian Su-Schreieffer-Heeger model exhibits a
new phase diagram in the boundary critical line, which is different from either

models. Engineers and scientists can often hypothesise several rival models to
explain a specific process or phenomenon. Consider a model discrimination
setting where we wish to find the best mechanistic, dynamic model candidate and
the best model parameter estimates. Typically, several rival mechanistic models
can explain the available data, so design of dynamic experiments for model
discrimination helps optimally collect additional data by finding experimental
settings that maximise model prediction divergence. We argue there are two main
approaches in the literature for solving the optimal design problem: (i) the
analytical approach, using linear and Gaussian approximations to find
closed-form expressions for the design objective, and (ii) the data-driven
approach, which often relies on computationally intensive Monte Carlo
techniques. Olofsson et al. (ICML 35, 2018) introduced Gaussian process (GP)
surrogate models to hybridise the analytical and data-driven approaches, which
allowed for computationally efficient design of experiments for discriminating
between black-box models. In this study, we demonstrate that we can extend
existing methods for optimal design of dynamic experiments to incorporate a
wider range of problem uncertainty. We also extend the Olofsson et al. (2018)
method of using GP surrogate models for discriminating between dynamic
black-box models. We evaluate our approach on a well-known case study from

location uncertainty (LU), conserves the global energy of any realization and
provides the possibility to generate an ensemble of physically relevant random
simulations with a good trade-off between the model error representation and
the ensemble's spread. To maintain numerically the energy conservation feature,
we combine an energy (in space) preserving discretization of the underlying
deterministic model with approximations of the stochastic terms that are based
on standard finite volume/difference operators. The LU derivation, built from
the very same conservation principles as the usual geophysical models, together

weights. For such classifiers, counterfactual explanations need to be robust
against the uncertainties in the SVM weights in order to ensure, with high
confidence, that the classification of the data instance to be explained is

characterize the problem's deterministic equivalent and study its solution. For
linear SVMs, the problem is a convex second-order cone program. For non-linear

candidates. It is extremely challenging to conduct sophisticated end-to-end
algorithms on the entire corpus due to the tremendous computation costs.
Therefore, conventional recommendation systems usually contain two modules. The
matching module focuses on the coverage, which aims to efficiently retrieve
hundreds of items from large corpora, while the ranking module generates
specific ranks for these items. Recommendation diversity is an essential factor
that impacts user experience. Most efforts have explored recommendation
diversity in ranking, while the matching module should take more responsibility
for diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph neural
network framework for diversified recommendation (GraphDR) in matching to
improve both recommendation accuracy and diversity. Specifically, GraphDR
builds a huge heterogeneous preference network to record different types of
user preferences, and conduct a field-level heterogeneous graph attention
network for node aggregation. We also innovatively conduct a
neighbor-similarity based loss to balance both recommendation accuracy and
diversity for the diversified matching task. In experiments, we conduct
extensive online and offline evaluations on a real-world recommendation system
with various accuracy and diversity metrics and achieve significant
improvements. We also conduct model analyses and case study for a better
understanding of our model. Moreover, GraphDR has been deployed on a well-known
recommendation system, which affects millions of users. The source code will be

cyclically during training to emphasize one class at a time. In
underparameterized networks, such dynamical loss functions can lead to
successful training for networks that fail to find a deep minima of the
standard cross-entropy loss. In overparameterized networks, dynamical loss
functions can lead to better generalization. Improvement arises from the
interplay of the changing loss landscape with the dynamics of the system as it
evolves to minimize the loss. In particular, as the loss function oscillates,
instabilities develop in the form of bifurcation cascades, which we study using
the Hessian and Neural Tangent Kernel. Valleys in the landscape widen and
deepen, and then narrow and rise as the loss landscape changes during a cycle.
As the landscape narrows, the learning rate becomes too large and the network
becomes unstable and bounces around the valley. This process ultimately pushes
the system into deeper and wider regions of the loss landscape and is
characterized by decreasing eigenvalues of the Hessian. This results in better
regularized models with improved generalization performance.

Recently, the solid-state LiDAR is introduced and becomes popular since it

Compared to mechanical LiDAR, solid-state LiDAR sensors have higher update
frequency and angular resolution, but also have smaller field of view (FoV),
which is very challenging for existing LiDAR SLAM algorithms. Therefore, it is
necessary to have a more robust and computationally efficient SLAM method for

  Region Preserving Numerical Methods for Relativistic Hydrodynamics","51 pages, 13 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper explores Tadmor's minimum entropy principle for the relativistic
hydrodynamics (RHD) equations and incorporates this principle into the design
of robust high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite volume schemes for
RHD on general meshes. The schemes are proven to preserve numerical solutions
in a global invariant region constituted by all the known intrinsic
constraints: minimum entropy principle, the subluminal constraint on fluid
velocity, and the positivity of pressure and rest-mass density. Relativistic
effects lead to some essential difficulties in the present study, which are not
encountered in the non-relativistic case. Most notably, in the RHD case the
specific entropy is a highly nonlinear implicit function of the conservative
variables, and, moreover, there is also no explicit formula of the flux in
terms of the conservative variables. In order to overcome the resulting
challenges, we first propose a novel equivalent form of the invariant region,
by skillfully introducing two auxiliary variables. As a notable feature, all
the constraints in the novel form are explicit and linear with respect to the
conservative variables. This provides a highly effective approach to
theoretically analyze the invariant-region-preserving (IRP) property of schemes
for RHD, without any assumption on the IRP property of the exact Riemann
solver. Based on this, we prove the convexity of the invariant region and
establish the generalized Lax--Friedrichs splitting properties via technical
estimates, lying the foundation for our IRP analysis. It is shown that the
first-order Lax--Friedrichs scheme for RHD satisfies a local minimum entropy
principle and is IRP under a CFL condition. Provably IRP high-order DG and
finite volume methods are developed for the RHD with the help of a simple
scaling limiter. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed schemes.

problem, where the metric is induced by a neural network type embedding of the
data. Specifically, we provide uniform generalization bounds for two regimes --
the sparse regime, and a non-sparse regime which we term \emph{bounded
amplification}. The sparse regime bounds correspond to situations where
$\ell_1$-type norms of the parameters are small. Similarly to the situation in
classification, solutions satisfying such bounds can be obtained by an
appropriate regularization of the problem. On the other hand, unregularized SGD
optimization of a metric learning loss typically does not produce sparse
solutions. We show that despite this lack of sparsity, by relying on a
different, new property of the solutions, it is still possible to provide
dimension free generalization guarantees. Consequently, these bounds can
explain generalization in non sparse real experimental situations. We
illustrate the studied phenomena on the MNIST and 20newsgroups datasets.

filtering techniques in modern control systems. Yet, nearly all current
variants of Kalman filters are formulated in the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^n$, while many real-world systems (e.g., robotic systems) are
really evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a method to develop
Kalman filters for such on-manifold systems. Utilizing $\boxplus$, $\boxminus$
operations and further defining an oplus operation on the respective manifold,
we propose a canonical representation of the on-manifold system. Such a
canonical form enables us to separate the manifold constraints from the system
behaviors in each step of the Kalman filter, ultimately leading to a generic
and symbolic Kalman filter framework that are naturally evolving on the
manifold. Furthermore, the on-manifold Kalman filter is implemented as a
toolkit in $C$++ packages which enables users to implement an on-manifold
Kalman filter just like the normal one in $\mathbb{R}^n$: the user needs only
to provide the system-specific descriptions, and then call the respective
filter steps (e.g., predict, update) without dealing with any of the manifold
constraints. The existing implementation supports full iterated Kalman
filtering for systems on any manifold composed of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $SO(3)$ and
$\mathbb{S}^2$, and is extendable to other types of manifold when necessary.
The proposed symbolic Kalman filter and the developed toolkit are verified by
implementing a tightly-coupled lidar-inertial navigation system. Results show
that the developed toolkit leads to superior filtering performances and
computation efficiency comparable to hand-engineered counterparts. Finally, the
toolkit is opened sourced at https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM to assist
practitioners to quickly deploy an on-manifold Kalman filter.

chromodynamics (QCD). Extending previous work at heavier quark masses,
calculations are performed using three ensembles of gauge field configurations
generated with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 450 MeV.
Finite-volume energy levels for the triton, as well as for the deuteron and
diproton systems, are extracted from analysis of correlation functions computed
on these ensembles, and the corresponding energies are extrapolated to infinite
volume using finite-volume pionless effective field theory (FVEFT). It is found
with high likelihood that there is a compact bound state with the quantum
numbers of the triton at these quark masses. The axial current matrix elements
are computed using background field techniques on one of the ensembles and
FVEFT is again used to determine the axial charge of the proton and triton. A
simple quark mass extrapolation of these results and earlier calculations at
heavier quark masses leads to a value of the ratio of the triton to proton
axial charges at the physical quark masses of $g_A^{^{3}{\rm

ratio determined from experiment and prefers values less than unity (in which
case the triton axial charge would be unmodified from that of the proton),
thereby demonstrating that QCD can explain the modification of the axial charge
of the triton.

polymers used in fused deposition modeling (FDM), in order to predict the
residual stresses and the accompanying distortion of the geometry of the
printed part (warping). When a polymeric melt is cooled, the inhomogeneous
distribution of temperature causes spatially varying volumetric shrinkage
resulting in the generation of residual stresses. Shrinkage is incorporated
into the framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric expansion/contraction
in the kinematics of the body. We show that the parameter for shrinkage also
appears in the systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for the
stress. The solidification of the melt around the glass transition temperature
is emulated by drastically increasing the viscosity of the melt.
  In order to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the derived
constitutive relation, we consider four ribbons of polymeric melt stacked on
each other such as those extruded using a flat nozzle: each layer laid
instantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before another layer is laid
on it. Each layer cools, shrinks and warps until a new layer is laid, at which
time the heat from the newly laid layer flows and heats up the bottom layers.
The residual stresses of the existing and newly laid layers readjust to satisfy
equilibrium. Such mechanical and thermal interactions amongst layers result in
a complex distribution of residual stresses. The plane strain approximation
predicts nearly equibiaxial tensile stress conditions in the core region of the
solidified part, implying that a pre-existing crack in that region is likely to
propagate and cause failure of the part during service. The free-end of the
interface between the first and the second layer is subjected to the largest
magnitude of combined shear and tension in the plane with a propensity for
delamination.

material interacts with neighboring points on a larger-length scale compared to
the mesh discretization. In developing a fully distributed solver, the
interaction over a length scale greater than mesh size introduces additional
data dependencies among the compute nodes and communication bottleneck. In this
work, we carefully look at these challenges in the context of nonlocal models;
to keep the presentation specific to the computational issues, we consider a
nonlocal heat equation in a 2d setting. In particular, the distributed
framework we propose pays greater attention to the bottleneck of data
communication and the dynamic balancing of loads among nodes with varying
compute capacity. For load balancing, we propose a novel framework that

feature, in this work, we devise a toy model with axisymmetry, a slowly
rotating Kerr black hole enveloped by a thin slowly rotating dark matter shell.
Despite its simplicity, we show rich structures regarding fundamental photon
orbits explicitly in such a system. We observe two disconnected branches of
unstable spherical photon orbits, and the jump between them gives rise to a
pair of cusps in the resultant black hole shadow. Besides the cuspy shadow, we
explore other intriguing phenomena when the Maxwell construction cannot be
established. We find that it is possible to have an incomplete arc of Einstein
rings and a ""fractured"" shadow. The potential astrophysical significance of the
corresponding findings is addressed.

parameter k specifying the number of output clusters, k-attributed graph
clustering (k-AGC) groups nodes in G into k disjoint clusters, such that nodes
within the same cluster share similar topological and attribute
characteristics, while those in different clusters are dissimilar. This problem
is challenging on massive graphs, e.g., with millions of nodes and billions of
edges. For such graphs, existing solutions either incur prohibitively high
costs, or produce clustering results with compromised quality.
  In this paper, we propose ACMin, an effective approach to k-AGC that yields
high-quality clusters with cost linear to the size of the input graph G. The
main contributions of ACMin are twofold: (i) a novel formulation of the k-AGC
problem based on an attributed multi-hop conductance quality measure
custom-made for this problem setting, which effectively captures cluster
coherence in terms of both topological proximities and attribute similarities,
and (ii) a linear-time optimization solver that obtains high-quality clusters
iteratively, based on efficient matrix operations such as orthogonal
iterations, an alternative optimization approach, as well as an initialization
technique that significantly speeds up the convergence of ACMin in practice.
  Extensive experiments, comparing 11 competitors on 6 real datasets,
demonstrate that ACMin consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of
result quality measured against ground-truth labels, while being up to orders
of magnitude faster. In particular, on the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph
dataset with 265.2 million edges and 1.1 billion attribute values, ACMin
outputs high-quality results for 5-AGC within 1.68 hours using a single CPU
core, while none of the 11 competitors finish within 3 days.

structure is a 2D system to realize anyons with braiding operations. From the
topological point of view, we have to deal with surface topology. However,
usual materials are 3D objects. Possible topologies for these objects can be
more complex than surfaces. From the topological point of view, Thurston's
geometrization theorem gives the main description of 3-dimensional manifolds.
Here, complements of knots do play a prominent role and are in principle the
main parts to understand 3-manifold topology. For that purpose, we will
construct a quantum system on the complements of a knot in the 3-sphere. The
whole system depends strongly on the topology of this complement, which is
determined by non-contractible, closed curves. Every curve gives a contribution
to the quantum states by a phase (Berry phase). Therefore, the quantum states
can be manipulated by using the knot group (fundamental group of the knot
complement). The universality of these operations was already showed by M.

first-order AC current, magnetic ratchet effect, and second harmonic generation
in phosphorene in the presence of a steady tilted magnetic field and under THz
laser radiation. We establish that various cyclotron resonances exist in the
deduced currents based on the angular frequency of the incoming light. These
resonances are dependent on the $\omega_{c_{+}}$ value, a function of the
carrier charge, the perpendicular magnetic field, and the effective masses
along the armchair or zigzag edges. We discuss the direction and the magnitude
of the deduced currents for various radiation polarizations. We compare the
results with a zero perpendicular magnetic field. Cyclotron resonance for the
first order AC current occurs at $\omega= \pm \omega_{c_{+}}$. The deduced
current declines if the perpendicular magnetic field is zero. Meanwhile, for
the ratchet current, cyclotron resonances occur at $\omega= \pm
\omega_{c_{+}}$, $\omega= \pm 2\omega_{c_{+}}$, and radiation helicity affects
the deduced current for circularly polarized light. Cyclotron resonance for the
second harmonic generation current occurs at $\omega= \pm \omega_{c_{+}}$,
$\omega= \pm 2 \omega_{c_{+}}$ and $\omega= \pm \omega_{c_{+}}/2 $ and the
current is stronger compared to the case with no perpendicular magnetic field.
As the magnetic field rotates in the plane of anisotropic phosphorene, separate
directions are predicted for the second harmonic generation--related current.
It is noteworthy that the magnitude of the ratchet and second harmonic
generation current are within the same range and comparable to the magnetic
ratchet current in monolayer graphene, $\mu A / cm$.

of our institutions through innovative technology for good, yet notorious for
being slow and expensive to use. In this work, we tackle this issue with
concurrency, yet we aim to take a radically different approach by valuing
simplicity. We embrace the simplicity through two steps: first, we formulate a
simple runtime mechanism to deal with conflicts called concurrency delegation.
This method is much simpler and has less overhead, particularly in scenarios
where conflicting transactions are relatively rare. Moreover, to further reduce
the number of conflicting transactions, we propose using static annotations
attached to each transaction, provided by the programmer. These annotations are
pseudo-static: they are static with respect to the lifetime of the transaction,
and therefore are free to use information such as the origin and parameters of
the transaction. We propose a distributor component that can use the output of
this pseudo-static annotations and use them to effectively distribute
transactions between threads in the least-conflicting way. We name the outcome
of a system combining concurrency delegation and pseudo-static annotations as
SonicChain. We evaluate SonicChain for both validation and authoring tasks
against a common workload in blockchains, namely, balance transfers, and
observe that it performs expectedly well while introducing very little overhead
and additional complexity to the system.
