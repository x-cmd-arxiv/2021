Given the uncertainty associated with such an innovative context,
experimentation is a valuable approach for these companies, especially in the
early stages of the development, when implementing unnecessary features
represents a higher risk for companies' survival. Nevertheless, researchers
have argued that the lack of clearly defined practices led to limited adoption
of experimentation. In this regard, the first step is to define the hypotheses
based on which teams will create experiments. Objective: We aim to develop a
systematic technique to identify hypotheses for early-stage software startups.
Methods: We followed a Design Science approach consisted of three cycles in the
construction phase, that involved seven startups in total, and an evaluation of
the final artifact within three startups. Results: We developed the HyMap, a
hypotheses elicitation technique based on cognitive mapping. It consists of a
visual language to depict a cognitive map representing the founder's
understanding of the product, and a process to elicit this map consisted of a
series of questions the founder must answer. Our evaluation showed that the
artifacts are clear, easy to use, and useful leading to hypotheses and
facilitating founders to visualize their idea. Conclusion: Our study
contributes to both descriptive and prescriptive bodies of knowledge. Regarding
the first, it provides a better understanding of the guidance founders use to
develop their startups and, for the latter, a technique to identify hypotheses
in early-stage software startups.

landscape, we propose that the stochastic dynamics of the black hole phase
transition can be effectively described by the Langevin equation or
equivalently by the Fokker-Planck equation in phase space. We demonstrate the
turnover of the kinetics for the charged anti-de Sitter black hole phase
transition, which shows that the mean first passage time is linear with the
friction in the high damping regime and inversely proportional to the friction
in the low damping regime. The fluctuations in the kinetics are shown to be
large/small in the high/low damping regime and the switching behavior from the
small fluctuations to the large fluctuations takes place at the kinetic
turnover point. Because the friction is a reflection of the microscopic degrees
of freedom acting on the order parameter of the black hole, the turnover and
the corresponding fluctuations of the phase transition kinetics can be used to
probe the black hole microstructure.

control is accessible via this strategy. Here we show that precise and
versatile control can be exercised in free space over the dispersion profile of
so-called `space-time' wave packets: a class of pulsed beams undergirded by
non-differentiable angular dispersion. This abstract mathematical feature
allows us to tune the magnitude and sign of the different dispersion orders
without introducing losses, thereby realizing arbitrary dispersion profiles,
and achieving dispersion values unattainable in optical materials away from
resonance. Unlike optical materials and photonic structures in which the values
of the different dispersion orders are not independent of each other, these

the versatility of space-time wave packets as a platform for structured light

subsequent periastron passage. Both absorption and emission components showed
strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was
occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its
geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength
and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of
days. An emission sub-peak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of
its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with
formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the
profile gave a measure of the extent of the sub-peak forming region. In the
phase range 0.93-0.99, the flux in the sub-peak increased steadily,
approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating
that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After
periastron, the sub-peak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly,
suggesting formation in clumps down-stream in the WCR. For most of the time,
its flux exceeded the 2-10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant
coolant of the shocked wind.

to their propensity already in one dimension to exhibit rich phase diagrams
with mobility edges. The deterministic and strongly-correlated nature of the
quasiperiodic potential nevertheless offers challenges distinct from disordered
systems. Motivated by this, we present a theory of localisation in
quasiperiodic chains with nearest-neighbour hoppings, based on the convergence
of local propagators; exploiting the fact that the imaginary part of the
associated self-energy acts as a probabilistic order parameter for localisation
transitions and, importantly, admits a continued-fraction representation.
Analysing the convergence of these continued fractions, localisation or its
absence can be determined, yielding in turn the critical points and mobility
edges. Interestingly, we find anomalous scalings of the order parameter with
system size at the critical points, consistent with the fractal character of
critical eigenstates. Self-consistent theories at high orders are also
considered, shown to be conceptually connected to the theory based on continued
fractions, and found in practice to converge to the same result. Results are
exemplified by analysing the theory for three quasiperiodic models covering a
range of behaviour.

to ensure users privacy, differentially distributed noise is added to the
original data. This technique comes with a trade off between privacy of the
consumer versus utility of the data in terms of providing services like
billing, Demand Response schemes, and Load Monitoring. In this paper, we
propose a technique - Differential Privacy with Noise Cancellation Technique
(DPNCT) - to maximize utility in aggregated load monitoring and fair billing
while preserving users privacy by using noise cancellation mechanism on
differentially private data. We introduce noise to the sensitive data stream
before it leaves smart meters in order to guarantee privacy at individual
level. Further, we evaluate the effects of different periodic noise cancelling
schemes on privacy and utility i.e., billing and load monitoring. Our proposed
scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of preserving the privacy while
accurately calculating the bill.

which initially filled with a binary solution (solute and solvent), and the
other half with pure solvent. The buoyant forces generate a gravity current
that couples to the diffusion of the solute. We perform numerical resolutions
of the 2D model describing the transport of the solute in the slit. This study
allows us to highlight different regimes as a function of a single parameter,
the Rayleigh number $\text{Ra}$ which compares gravity-induced advection to
solute diffusion. We then derive asymptotic analytical solutions to quantify
the width of the mixing zone as a function of time in each regime and establish
a diagram that makes it possible to identify the range of $\text{Ra}$ and times
for which buoyancy does not impact diffusion. In a second step, we present
numerical resolutions of the same model but for a 3D microfluidic channel with
a square cross-section. We observe the same regimes as in the 2D case, and
focus on the dispersion regime at long time scales. We then derive the
expression of the 1D dispersion coefficient for a channel with a rectangular
section, and analyse the role of the transverse flow in the particular case of
a square section. Finally, we show that the impact of this transverse flow on
the solute transport can be neglected for most of the microfluidic experimental

plasma can heavily influence the discharge operation and the plasma-chemistry.
A convenient method for measuring the distribution function is by means of
coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). CARS spectra are measured in a
ns-pulsed plasma between two parallel, 1 mm spaced molybdenum electrodes in
nitrogen at 200 mbar with pulse durations of 200 ns / 250 ns and a repetition
rate of 1 kHz. The CARS spectra are analyzed by a fitting routine to extract
information about the vibrational excitation of the nitrogen molecules in the
plasma. It is found that during the discharge the vibrational distribution for
$v \lesssim 7$ can be described by a vibrational two-temperature distribution
function. Additionally, the electric field is measured by the E-FISH method
during the discharge pulse. It is found to be constant in time after the
initial ionization wave with values close to 81 Td for the investigated
conditions. During the afterglow between two discharge pulses a more general
fitting approach is used to obtain the population differences of two
neighboring vibrational states. This allows to capture the more complex
vibrational dynamics in that time period. The measurement results are discussed
in more detail and compared to simple models in a companion paper.

explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important,
especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of
deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care.
Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model
explainability and introspection. Specific problem: A new approach is to
transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the
prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are
monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach:
Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient
update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a
specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction.
We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their
performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240
chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are)
using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. Results: We found
low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high
accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models
are generally looking at the correct features. We also found that the Latent
Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive
predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\pm$0.95 in a 5 point
scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions

noise or predictive uncertainty, where formal specifications of desired
behavior are inherently probabilistic. Despite the promise of formal
verification in ensuring the reliability of neural networks, progress in the
direction of probabilistic specifications has been limited. In this direction,
we first introduce a general formulation of probabilistic specifications for
neural networks, which captures both probabilistic networks (e.g., Bayesian
neural networks, MC-Dropout networks) and uncertain inputs (distributions over
inputs arising from sensor noise or other perturbations). We then propose a
general technique to verify such specifications by generalizing the notion of
Lagrangian duality, replacing standard Lagrangian multipliers with ""functional
multipliers"" that can be arbitrary functions of the activations at a given
layer. We show that an optimal choice of functional multipliers leads to exact
verification (i.e., sound and complete verification), and for specific forms of
multipliers, we develop tractable practical verification algorithms.
  We empirically validate our algorithms by applying them to Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) and MC Dropout Networks, and certifying properties such as
adversarial robustness and robust detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
On these tasks we are able to provide significantly stronger guarantees when
compared to prior work -- for instance, for a VGG-64 MC-Dropout CNN trained on
CIFAR-10, we improve the certified AUC (a verified lower bound on the true AUC)
for robust OOD detection (on CIFAR-100) from $0\% \rightarrow 29\%$. Similarly,
for a BNN trained on MNIST, we improve on the robust accuracy from $60.2\%
\rightarrow 74.6\%$. Further, on a novel specification -- distributionally
robust OOD detection -- we improve the certified AUC from $5\% \rightarrow
23\%$.

is a vital indicator of the wellness of a patient. Continuous monitoring of RR
can provide early indication and thereby save lives. However, a real-time
continuous RR monitoring facility is only available at the intensive care unit

proposed Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and/ Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for RR
estimation however, the usage of ECG is limited due to the unavailability of it
in wearable devices. Due to the advent of wearable smartwatches with built-in
PPG sensors, it is now being considered for continuous monitoring of RR. This
paper describes a novel approach to RR estimation using machine learning (ML)
models with the PPG signal features. Feature selection algorithms were used to
reduce computational complexity and the chance of overfitting. The best ML
model and the best feature selection algorithm combination was fine-tuned to
optimize its performance using hyperparameter optimization. Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) with fitrgp feature selection algorithm outperformed all other
combinations and exhibits a root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error
(MAE), and two-standard deviation (2SD) of 2.57, 1.91, and 5.13 breaths per

wearable devices for real-time continuous monitoring of the patient.

shown that adding a simple solute as methanol can ""kill"" the density anomalous
behavior as the LLCP is suppressed by the spontaneous crystallization in a
hexagonal closed packing (HCP) crystal near the LLPT. Now, we extend this work
in order to realize how longer-chain alcohols will affect the complex behavior
of water-alcohol mixtures in the supercooled regime. Besides core-softened (CS)
methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol were added to a system of identical particles
that interact through the continuous shouldered well (CSW) potential. We
observed that the density anomaly gradually decreases its extension in phase
diagrams until disappearing with the growth of the non-polar chain and the
alcohol concentration, differently from the liquid-liquid phase transition (and
the LLCP), which remained present in all analyzed mixtures, in according to
\textit{Nature}, 2001, \textbf{409}, 692. For our model, the longer non-polar
chains and higher concentrations gradually impact the competition between the
scales in the CS potential, leading to a gradual disappearing of the anomalies
until the TMD total disappearance is observed when the first coordination shell
structure is also affected: the short-range ordering is favored, leading to
less competition between short- and long-range ordering and, consequently, to
the extinction of anomalies. Also, the non-polar chain size and concentration
have an effect on the solid phases, favoring the hexagonal closed packed (HCP)
solid and the amorphous solid phase over the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal.

these two layers represent a node's inner social circle, and wider social
circle, such that the model can bias copying probabilities towards, or against,
a node's inner circle of friends. Comparing the case of extreme inner circle
bias to an equivalent model with uniform copying, we find that heterogeneous
copying suppresses the power-law degree distributions commonly seen in copying
models, and results in networks with much higher clustering than even the most
optimum scenario for uniform copying. Similarly large clustering values are
found in real collaboration networks, lending empirical support to the
mechanism.

learning models among edge devices, with the orchestration of a server in a
wireless edge network. Due to frequent model updates, FEEL needs to be adapted
to the limited communication bandwidth, scarce energy of edge devices, and the
statistical heterogeneity of edge devices' data distributions. Therefore, a
careful scheduling of a subset of devices for training and uploading models is
necessary. In contrast to previous work in FEEL where the data aspects are
under-explored, we consider data properties at the heart of the proposed
scheduling algorithm. To this end, we propose a new scheduling scheme for
non-independent and-identically-distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced datasets
in FEEL. As the data is the key component of the learning, we propose a new set
of considerations for data characteristics in wireless scheduling algorithms in
FEEL. In fact, the data collected by the devices depends on the local
environment and usage pattern. Thus, the datasets vary in size and
distributions among the devices. In the proposed algorithm, we consider both
data and resource perspectives. In addition to minimizing the completion time
of FEEL as well as the transmission energy of the participating devices, the
algorithm prioritizes devices with rich and diverse datasets. We first define a
general framework for the data-aware scheduling and the main axes and
requirements for diversity evaluation. Then, we discuss diversity aspects and
some exploitable techniques and metrics. Next, we formulate the problem and
present our FEEL scheduling algorithm. Evaluations in different scenarios show
that our proposed FEEL scheduling algorithm can help achieve high accuracy in
few rounds with a reduced cost.

given noisy partial observations. Here each observation corresponds to a
randomly located segment of the signal. While previous works address this
problem using template or moment-matching, in this paper we address MSR from an
unsupervised adversarial learning standpoint, named MSR-GAN. We formulate MSR
as a distribution matching problem where the goal is to recover the signal and
the probability distribution of the segments such that the distribution of the
generated measurements following a known forward model is close to the real
observations. This is achieved once a min-max optimization involving a
generator-discriminator pair is solved. MSR-GAN is mainly inspired by CryoGAN
[1]. However, in MSR-GAN we no longer assume the probability distribution of
the latent variables, i.e. segment locations, is given and seek to recover it
alongside the unknown signal. For this purpose, we show that the loss at the
generator side originally is non-differentiable with respect to the segment
distribution. Thus, we propose to approximate it using Gumbel-Softmax
reparametrization trick. Our proposed solution is generalizable to a wide range
of inverse problems. Our simulation results and comparison with various

and adding their energy deposits to a hard-scatter interaction one-by-one, the
inelastic interactions are presampled, independent of the hard scatter, and
stored as combined events. Consequently, for each hard-scatter interaction only
one such presampled event needs to be added as part of the simulation chain.
For the Run 2 simulation chain, with an average of 35 interactions per bunch

needs of around 20%, while reproducing the properties of the reconstructed
quantities relevant for physics analyses with good accuracy.

profiles in different energy ranges. A multi-peak structure in 1-10 keV is
clearly illustrated. We introduced wavelet analysis into our data analysis
procedures to study QPO signals and perform a detailed wavelet analysis in many
different energy ranges. Through the wavelet spectra, we report the discovery
of a QPO at the frequency $\sim 10$ mHz. In addition, the X-ray light curves
showed multiple QPOs in the period of $\sim 16-32 $ s and $\sim 67- 200 $ s. We
found that the $\sim100$ s QPO was significant in most of the observations and
energies. There exist positive relations between X-ray luminosity and their
Q-factors and S-factors, while the QPO periods have no correlation with X-ray
luminosity. In wavelet phase maps, we found that the pulse phase of $\sim 67-

One
of the recent additions to this experimental toolbox is the Floquet
engineering, where periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian allows the creation
of effective potentials that do not exist otherwise. When subject to external
modulations, however, generic interacting many-body systems absorb energy, thus
posing a heating problem that may impair the usefulness of this method. For
discrete systems with bounded local energy, an exponentially suppressed heating
rate with the driving frequency has been observed previously, leaving the
system in a prethermal state for exceedingly long durations. But for systems in
continuous space, the situation remains unclear. Here we show that Floquet
engineering can be employed to a strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gas held
in a flat box-like potential without inducing excessive heating on
experimentally relevant timescales. The driving eliminates the effect of a
spin-dependent potential originating from a simultaneous magnetic levitation of
two different spin states. We calculate the heating rate and obtain a power-law
suppression with the drive frequency. To further test the many-body behavior of
the driven gas, we measure both the pair-condensation fraction at unitarity and
the contact parameter across the BEC-BCS crossover. At low driving frequencies,
the condensate fraction is reduced by the time-dependent force, but at higher
frequencies, it revives and attains an even higher value than without driving.
Our results are promising for future exploration of exotic many-body phases of
a bulk strongly-interacting Fermi gas with dynamically engineered Hamiltonians.

While in a vast majority of cases small particles experience attractive

degrees of freedom into optomechanical manipulation suggests approaching new
capabilities. Here we analyze optical forces acting on a high refractive index
silicon sphere in a focused Gaussian beam and reveal new regimes of particles
anti-trapping. Multipolar analysis allows separating an optical force into
interception and recoil components, which have a completely different physical
nature resulting in different mechanical actions. In particular, interplaying
interception radial forces and multipolar resonances within a particle can lead
to either trapping or anti-trapping scenarios, depending of the overall system
parameters. At the same time, the recoil force generates a significant
azimuthal component along with an angular-dependent radial force. Those
contribution enable enhancing either trapping or anti-trapping regimes and also
introduce bending reactions. These effects are linked to the far-field
multipole interference resulting and, specifically, to its asymmetric
scattering diagrams. The later approach is extremely useful, as it allows
assessing the nature of optomechanical motion by observing far-field patterns.
Multipolar engineering of optical forces, being quite general approach, is not
necessarily linked to simple spherical shapes and paves a way to new
possibilities in microfluidic applications, including sorting and micro

SAAO telescope in South Africa, is first of the two WALOP instruments currently
under development for carrying out the PASIPHAE survey. Scheduled for
commissioning in the year 2021, the WALOP instruments will be used to measure
the linear polarization of around $10^{6}$ stars in the SDSS-r broadband with
$0.1~\%$ polarimetric accuracy, covering 4000 square degrees in the Galactic
polar regions. The combined capabilities of one-shot linear polarimetry, high
polarimetric accuracy ($< 0.1~\%$) and polarimetric sensitivity ($< 0.05~\%$),
and a large field of view (FOV) of $35\times35~arcminutes$ make WALOP-South a
unique astronomical instrument. In a single exposure, it is designed to measure
the Stokes parameters $I$, $q$ and $u$ in the SDSS-r broadband and narrowband
filters between $500-700~nm$. During each measurement, four images of the full
field corresponding to the polarization angles of $0^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$,
$90^{\circ}$ and $135^{\circ}$ will be imaged on four detectors and carrying
out differential photometry on these images will yield the Stokes parameters.
Major challenges in designing WALOP-South instrument include- (a) in the
optical design, correcting for the spectral dispersion introduced by large
split angle Wollaston Prisms used as polarization analyzers as well as
aberrations from the wide field, and (b) making an optomechanical design
adherent to the tolerances required to obtain good imaging and polarimetric
performance under all temperature conditions as well as telescope pointing
positions. We present the optical and optomechanical design for WALOP-South
which overcomes these challenges.

identify the bundle of Higgs fields, i.e. the cotangent bundle of the moduli

monodromy map into the ${\rm GL}_n$ character variety. We show that the Goldman
symplectic structure on the character variety pulls back along this map to the
complex canonical symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle and hence also

  available soon on the ViWi website https://viwi-dataset.net/",,,,"eess.SP cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The sensitivity to blockages is a key challenge for the high-frequency (5G
millimeter wave and 6G sub-terahertz) wireless networks. Since these networks
mainly rely on line-of-sight (LOS) links, sudden link blockages highly threaten
the reliability of the networks. Further, when the LOS link is blocked, the
network typically needs to hand off the user to another LOS basestation, which
may incur critical time latency, especially if a search over a large codebook
of narrow beams is needed. A promising way to tackle the reliability and
latency challenges lies in enabling proaction in wireless networks. Proaction
basically allows the network to anticipate blockages, especially dynamic
blockages, and initiate user hand-off beforehand. This paper presents a
complete machine learning framework for enabling proaction in wireless networks
relying on visual data captured, for example, by RGB cameras deployed at the
base stations. In particular, the paper proposes a vision-aided wireless
communication solution that utilizes bimodal machine learning to perform
proactive blockage prediction and user hand-off. The bedrock of this solution
is a deep learning algorithm that learns from visual and wireless data how to
predict incoming blockages. The predictions of this algorithm are used by the
wireless network to proactively initiate hand-off decisions and avoid any
unnecessary latency. The algorithm is developed on a vision-wireless dataset
generated using the ViWi data-generation framework. Experimental results on two
basestations with different cameras indicate that the algorithm is capable of
accurately detecting incoming blockages more than $\sim 90\%$ of the time. Such
blockage prediction ability is directly reflected in the accuracy of proactive
hand-off, which also approaches $87\%$. This highlights a promising direction
for enabling high reliability and low latency in future wireless networks.

comparable to industry standards in the computer vision community are available
for this task. To circumvent this problem, we propose to automate the creation
of a realistic training dataset by exploiting techniques stemming from special
effects and harnessing them to target training performance rather than visual
appeal. Foreground data is captured by placing sample surgical instruments over
a chroma key (a.k.a. green screen) in a controlled environment, thereby making
extraction of the relevant image segment straightforward. Multiple lighting
conditions and viewpoints can be captured and introduced in the simulation by
moving the instruments and camera and modulating the light source. Background
data is captured by collecting videos that do not contain instruments. In the
absence of pre-existing instrument-free background videos, minimal labeling
effort is required, just to select frames that do not contain surgical
instruments from videos of surgical interventions freely available online. We
compare different methods to blend instruments over tissue and propose a novel
data augmentation approach that takes advantage of the plurality of options. We
show that by training a vanilla U-Net on semi-synthetic data only and applying
a simple post-processing, we are able to match the results of the same network

irradiance from their apparent intensity. Taking full-disc observations from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examined the intensity contrast of network
and faculae in the continuum and core of the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line and 1700
{\AA}, including the variation with magnetic flux density, distance from disc
centre, nearby magnetic fields, and time. The brightness of network and faculae
is believed to be suppressed by nearby magnetic fields from its effect on
convection. The difference in intensity contrast between the quiet-Sun network
and active region faculae, noted by various studies, arises because active
regions are more magnetically crowded and is not due to any fundamental
physical differences between network and faculae. These results highlight that
solar irradiance models need to include the effect of nearby magnetic fields on
network and faculae brightness. We found evidence that suggests that departures
from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) might have limited effect on intensity
contrast. This could explain why solar irradiance models that are based on the
intensity contrast of solar surface magnetic features calculated assuming LTE
reproduce the observed spectral variability even where the LTE assumption
breaks down. Certain models of solar irradiance employ chromospheric indices as
direct indications of the effect of network and faculae on solar irradiance.
Based on past studies of the Ca II K line and on the intensity contrast
measurements derived here, we show that the fluctuations in chromospheric
emission from network and faculae are a reasonable estimate of the emission
fluctuations in the middle photosphere, but not of those in the lower
photosphere. The data set, which extends from 2010 to 2018, indicates that
intensity contrast was stable to about 3% in this period.

derive the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation for the particle by starting
from the fully relativistic Klein-Gordon equation in order (i) to briefly
discuss the issue of the equivalence principle and (ii) to be able to compare
the relativistic terms in the equation to the tidal-force terms. To the second
order of the nonrelativistic approximation, the resulting Schr\""odinger
equation is that of a simple harmonic oscillator in the horizontal direction
and that of an inverted harmonic oscillator in the vertical direction. Two
methods are used for solving the equation in the vertical direction. The first
method is based on a fixed boundary condition, and yields a discrete-energy
spectrum with a wavefunction that is asymptotic to that of a particle in a
linear gravitational field. The second method is based on time-varying boundary
conditions and yields a quantized-energy spectrum that is decaying in time.
Moving on to a freely-falling reference frame, we derive the corresponding
time-dependent energy spectrum. The effects of tidal forces yield an
expectation value for the Hamiltonian and a relative change in time of a
wavepacket's width that are mass-independent. The equivalence principle, which
we understand here as the empirical equivalence between gravitation and
inertia, is discussed based on these various results. For completeness, we
briefly discuss the consequences expected to be obtained for a Bose-Einstein

correlator, which is based on supersymmetric localisation, has been the subject
of several recent developments. The correlator is re-expressed as a sum over a
two dimensional lattice that is valid for all $N$ and all values of the complex
Yang-Mills coupling $\tau$. In this form it is manifestly invariant under
$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Montonen-Olive duality. Furthermore, it satisfies a
remarkable Laplace-difference equation that relates the $SU(N)$ to the

is an infinite series of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series,
$E(s;\tau,\bar\tau)$ with $s\in \mathbb{Z}$, and rational coefficients. The

instanton contributions have an asymptotic, but Borel summable, series of
perturbative corrections. The large-$N$ expansion of the correlator with fixed
$\tau$ is a series in powers of $N^{1/2-\ell}$ ($\ell\in \mathbb{Z}$) with
coefficients that are rational sums of $E_s$ with $s\in \mathbb{Z}+1/2$. This
gives an all orders derivation of the form of the recently conjectured
expansion. We further consider 't Hooft large-$N$ Yang-Mills theory. The
coefficient of each order can be expanded as a convergent series in $\lambda$.
For large $\lambda$ this becomes an asymptotic series with coefficients that
are again rational multiples of odd zeta values. The large-$\lambda$ series is
not Borel summable, and its resurgent non-perturbative completion is
$O(\exp(-2\sqrt{\lambda}))$.

Intelligence. Under belief space planning (BSP), in a partially observable
setting, it involves calculating the expected accumulated belief-dependent
reward, where the expectation is with respect to all future measurements. Since
solving this general un-approximated problem quickly becomes intractable, state
of the art approaches turn to approximations while still calculating planning
sessions from scratch. In this work we propose a novel paradigm, Incremental
BSP (iX-BSP), based on the key insight that calculations across planning
sessions are similar in nature and can be appropriately re-used. We calculate
the expectation incrementally by utilizing Multiple Importance Sampling
techniques for selective re-sampling and re-use of measurement from previous
planning sessions. The formulation of our approach considers general
distributions and accounts for data association aspects. We demonstrate how
iX-BSP could benefit existing approximations of the general problem,
introducing iML-BSP, which re-uses calculations across planning sessions under
the common Maximum Likelihood assumption. We evaluate both methods and
demonstrate a substantial reduction in computation time while statistically
preserving accuracy. The evaluation includes both simulation and real-world
experiments considering autonomous vision-based navigation and SLAM. As a
further contribution, we introduce to iX-BSP the non-integral wildfire
approximation, allowing one to trade accuracy for computational performance by
averting from updating re-used beliefs when they are ""close enough"". We
evaluate iX-BSP under wildfire demonstrating a substantial reduction in
computation time while controlling the accuracy sacrifice. We also provide
analytical and empirical bounds of the effect wildfire holds over the objective
value.

find a conversion of an AA- to an AB-stacked bilayer graphene caused by the
repulsive interaction between dopant atoms. At a short interlayer distance, a
strong repulsive interaction inducing a strong electric dipole moment of the
dopant atoms is found. This gives rise to a breaking of the high symmetry,
opening up a bandgap. Consequently, a considerable change in thermoelectric
properties such as the Seebeck coefficient and the figure of merit are seen.
The repulsive interaction is reduced by increasing the interlayer distance, and
at a large interlayer distance the conversion process of the stacking order
vanishes. A small bandgap is found leading to a low Seebeck coefficient and a
figure of merit. For both short and large interlayer distances, a prominent
peak in the optical response is found in the visible range and the peak
position is inversely proportional to the interlayer distance.

unconventional insulators starting with SmB$_6$ and subsequently YbB$_{12}$ is
a subject of intense inquiry. Here we shed light on this question by comparing
quantum oscillations between the high magnetic field-induced metallic regime in
YbB$_{12}$ and the unconventional insulating regime. In the field-induced
metallic regime beyond 47 T, we find prominent quantum oscillations in the
contactless resistivity characterised by multiple frequencies up to at least
3000 T and heavy effective masses up to at least 17 $m_\text{e}$,
characteristic of an $f$-electron hybridised metallic Fermi surface. The growth
of quantum oscillation amplitude at low temperatures in electrical transport
and magnetic torque in insulating YbB$_{12}$ is closely similar to the
Lifshitz-Kosevich low temperature growth of quantum oscillation amplitude in
field-induced metallic YbB$_{12}$, pointing to an origin of quantum
oscillations in insulating YbB$_{12}$ from in-gap neutral low energy
excitations. The field-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$ is characterised
by more Fermi surface sheets of heavy quasiparticle effective mass that emerge
in addition to the heavy Fermi surface sheets yielding multiple quantum
oscillation frequencies below 1000 T observed in both insulating and metallic
regimes. We thus observe a heavy multi-component Fermi surface in which
$f$-electron hybridisation persists from the unconventional insulating to the
field-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$, which is in distinct contrast to
the unhybridised conduction electron Fermi surface observed in the case of the
unconventional insulator SmB$_6$. Our findings require a different theoretical
model of neutral in-gap low energy excitations in which the $f$-electron
hybridisation is retained in the case of the unconventional insulator
YbB$_{12}$.

potential in $\mathbb{R}^3$ by the rotation potential, an n-dimensional,
antisymmetric matrix-valued map describing $n(n-1)/2$ rotations within the
coordinate planes. We provide three methods to derive the Helmholtz
decomposition: (1) a numerical method for fields decaying at infinity by using
an $n$-dimensional convolution integral, (2) closed-form solutions using
line-integrals for several unboundedly growing fields including periodic and
exponential functions, multivariate polynomials and their linear combinations,
(3) an existence proof for all analytic vector fields. Examples include the
Lorenz and R\""{o}ssler attractor and the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations
with $n$ species.

types of cancer. Epigenetic studies generate a large amount of data, which
makes it essential to develop novel models capable of dealing with large-scale
data. In this work, we propose a deep embedded refined clustering method for
breast cancer differentiation based on DNA methylation. In concrete, the deep
learning system presented here uses the levels of CpG island methylation
between 0 and 1. The proposed approach is composed of two main stages. The
first stage consists in the dimensionality reduction of the methylation data
based on an autoencoder. The second stage is a clustering algorithm based on
the soft-assignment of the latent space provided by the autoencoder. The whole
method is optimized through a weighted loss function composed of two terms:
reconstruction and classification terms. To the best of the authors' knowledge,
no previous studies have focused on the dimensionality reduction algorithms
linked to classification trained end-to-end for DNA methylation analysis. The
proposed method achieves an unsupervised clustering accuracy of 0.9927 and an
error rate (%) of 0.73 on 137 breast tissue samples. After a second test of the
deep-learning-based method using a different methylation database, an accuracy
of 0.9343 and an error rate (%) of 6.57 on 45 breast tissue samples is
obtained. Based on these results, the proposed algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods evaluated under the same conditions for breast cancer
classification based on DNA methylation data.

context of the accretion of rocky debris from evolved planetary systems. One
open question is the geometry of accretion and how material arrives and mixes
in the white dwarf surface layers. Using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code
CO$^5$BOLD, we present the first transport coefficients in degenerate star
atmospheres which describe the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar across
the surface-plane. We couple newly derived horizontal diffusion coefficients
with previously published vertical diffusion coefficients to provide
theoretical constraints on surface spreading of metals in white dwarfs. Our
grid of 3D simulations probes the vast majority of the parameter space of
convective white dwarfs, with pure-hydrogen atmospheres in the effective
temperature range 6000-18000 K and pure-helium atmospheres in the range
12000-34000 K. Our results suggest that warm hydrogen-rich atmospheres (DA;
$\gtrsim$13000 K) and helium-rich atmospheres (DB, DBA; $\gtrsim$30000 K) are
unable to efficiently spread the accreted metals across their surface,
regardless of the time dependence of accretion. This result may be at odds with
the current non-detection of surface abundance variations at white dwarfs with
debris discs. For cooler hydrogen- and helium-rich atmospheres, we predict a
largely homogeneous distribution of metals across the surface within a vertical
diffusion timescale. This is typically less than 0.1 per cent of disc lifetime
estimates, a quantity which is revisited in this paper using the overshoot
results. These results have relevance for studies of the bulk composition of
evolved planetary systems and models of accretion disc physics.

because of shear flow in the disk, transient arcs of gas (streams) naturally

when a supernova blast wave encounters the CND. Because energetic events arise
naturally and often in the central parsecs of our Galaxy, this result suggests
that the transient structures that characterize the CND do not imply that the
CND itself is a transient structure. We also note that features similar to the

account for the observed orientation of the disk and for the spatial resolution

Photometric coverage reveals that AT 2016jbu underwent significant photometric
variability followed by two luminous events, the latter of which reached an
absolute magnitude of M$_V\sim$-18.5 mag. This is similar to the transient SN
2009ip whose nature is still debated. Spectra are dominated by narrow emission
lines and show a blue continuum during the peak of the second event. AT 2016jbu
shows signatures of a complex, non-homogeneous circumstellar material (CSM). We
see slowly evolving asymmetric hydrogen line profiles, with velocities of
500km$s^{-1}$ seen in narrow emission features from a slow moving CSM, and up
to 10,000km$s^{-1}$ seen in broad absorption from some high velocity material.
Late-time spectra ($\sim$+1 year) show a lack of forbidden emission lines

V band (A(V)). If the extinction curve was truly universal, the strength of the
relationship and the linearity would naturally be maintained for extinction at
any wavelength, and also for N(H) vs. E(B-V). However, extinction curves vary
within the Milky Way, and there is no reason why, except by chance, either
E(B-V) or A(V) would be the most physical measure of dust column density. In
this paper, we utilize for the first time full extinction curves to 41 MW
sightlines and find that the scatter between N(H) and extinction is minimized
-- and the relation becomes linear -- for extinction at 2900 +/- 160 A. Scatter
and nonlinearity increase at longer wavelengths and are especially large for
near-IR extinction. We conclude that near-UV extinction is a superior measure
of the dust column density for MW dust. We provide new, non-linear gas-to-dust
relations for various dust tracers. We also find that the very large
discrepancy between MW and SMC gas-to-dust ratios of 0.9 dex in N(H)/E(B-V) is
reduced to 0.7 dex for far-UV extinction, which matches the difference in
cosmic abundances of carbon between the two galaxies, and therefore confirms
that N(C) is the preferred measure of the gas in the gas-to-dust ratio, even
though it may not be a convenient one.

find a progenitor consistent with a $\sim$22--25~$M_{\odot}$ yellow hypergiant
surrounded by a dusty circumstellar shell, in agreement with what has been
previously reported. We see evidence for significant photometric variability in
the progenitor, as well as strong H$\alpha$ emission consistent with
pre-existing circumstellar material. The age of the environment as well as the
resolved stellar population surrounding AT2016jbu, support a progenitor age of
$>$10 Myr, consistent with a progenitor mass of $\sim$22~$M_{\odot}$. A joint
analysis of the velocity evolution of AT2016jbu, and the photospheric radius
inferred from the bolometric lightcurve shows the transient is consistent with
two successive outbursts/explosions. The first outburst ejected material with
velocity $\sim$650$kms^{-1}$, while the second, more energetic event, ejected
material at $\sim$4500$kms^{-1}$. Whether the latter is the core-collapse of
the progenitor remains uncertain. We place a limit on the ejected $^{56}$Ni
mass of $<$0.016$M_{\odot}$. Using the BPASS code, we explore a wide range of
possible progenitor systems, and find that the majority of these are in
binaries, some of which are undergoing mass transfer or common envelope
evolution immediately prior to explosion. Finally, we use the SNEC code to
demonstrate that the low-energy explosion within some of these binary systems,
together with sufficient CSM, can reproduce the overall morphology of the
lightcurve of AT2016jbu.

have been identified as tracers of C/O, as they form abundantly under high C/O
conditions. We present resolved $\rm C_3H_2$ observations from the TW Hya
Rosetta Stone Project, a program designed to map the chemistry of common
molecules at $15-20$ au resolution in the TW Hya disk. Augmented by archival
data, these observations comprise the most extensive multi-line set for disks
of both ortho and para spin isomers spanning a wide range of energies,
$E_u=29-97$ K. We find the ortho-to-para ratio of $\rm C_3H_2$ is consistent
with 3 throughout extent of the emission, and the total abundance of both $\rm
C_3H_2$ isomers is $(7.5-10)\times10^{-11}$ per H atom, or $1-10$% of the
previously published $\rm C_2H$ abundance in the same source. We find $\rm
C_3H_2$ comes from a layer near the surface that extends no deeper than
$z/r=0.25$. Our observations are consistent with substantial radial variation
in gas-phase C/O in TW Hya, with a sharp increase outside $\sim30$ au. Even if
we are not directly tracing the midplane, if planets accrete from the surface
via, e.g., meridonial flows, then such a change should be imprinted on forming
planets. Perhaps interestingly, the HR 8799 planetary system also shows an
increasing gradient in its giant planets' atmospheric C/O ratios. While these
stars are quite different, hydrocarbon rings in disks are common, and therefore
our results are consistent with the young planets of HR 8799 still bearing the

Starobinsky inflation, in a spatially closed universe is the occurrence of a

recent work it was shown that this problem can be successfully resolved in loop
quantum cosmology for a large class of initial conditions due to a non-singular
cyclic evolution and a hysteresis-like phenomena. However, for certain highly
unfavorable initial conditions the onset of inflation was still difficult to
obtain. In this work, we explore the role of dissipative particle production,
which is typical in warm inflation scenario, in the above setting. We find that
entropy production sourced by such dissipative effects makes hysteresis-like
phenomena stronger. As a result, the onset of inflation is quick in general
including for highly unfavorable initial conditions where it fails or is
significantly delayed in the absence of dissipative effects. We
phenomenologically consider three warm inflation scenarios with distinct forms
of dissipation coefficient, and from dynamical solutions and phase space
portraits find that the phase space of favorable initial conditions turns out
to be much larger than in cold inflation.

asymptote to $\alpha \approx -1.5$ in low-mass dwarfs independent of

Frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) is proposed to address this

low-order frequency response models and do not consider wide-range operating
conditions. This paper presents a generic data-driven framework for FCUC under
high renewable penetration. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to predict
the frequency response using real data or high-fidelity simulation data. Next,
the DNN is reformulated as a set of mixed-integer linear constraints to be
incorporated into the ordinary UC formulation. In the data generation phase,
all possible power injections are considered, and a region-of-interests active
sampling is proposed to include power injection samples with frequency nadirs
closer to the UFLC threshold, which significantly enhances the accuracy of
frequency constraints in FCUC. The proposed FCUC is verified on the the IEEE
39-bus system. Then, a full-order dynamic model simulation using PSS/E verifies
the effectiveness of FCUC in frequency-secure generator commitments.

texture development during annealing of deformed crystalline materials. The
microstructure is considered as a population of subgrains and grains whose
sizes and boundary properties determine their growth rates. The model input
parameters are measured directly on orientation maps maps of the deformed
microstructure measured by electron backscattered diffraction. The anisotropy
in subgrain properties then drives a competitive growth giving rise to the
recrystallization texture development. The method is illustrated by a
simulation of the static recrystallization texture development in a hot rolled
ferritic stainless steel. The model predictions are found to be in good
agreement with the experimental measurements, and allow for an in-depth
investigation of the formation sequence of the recrystallization texture. A
distinction is established between the texture components which develop due to
favorable growth conditions and those developing due to their predominance in
the prior deformed state. The high fraction of alpha fibre orientations in the
recrystallized state is shown to be a consequence of their predominance in the
deformed microstructure rather than a preferred growth mechanism. A close
control of the fraction of these orientations before annealing is thus required
to minimize their presence in the recrystallized state.

the framework of differential privacy to develop a mechanism that securely
shares the teacher's demonstrations with the student. The mechanism allows for
the teacher to decide upon the accuracy of its demonstrations with respect to
the privacy budget that it consumes, thereby granting the teacher full control
over its data privacy. We then develop a kickstarted deep reinforcement
learning algorithm for the student that is privacy-aware because we calibrate
its objective with the parameters of the teacher's privacy mechanism. The
privacy-aware design of the algorithm makes it possible to kickstart the
student's learning despite the perturbations induced by the privacy mechanism.
From numerical experiments, we highlight three empirical results: (i) the
algorithm succeeds in expediting the student's learning, (ii) the student
converges to a performance level that was not possible without the
demonstrations, and (iii) the student maintains its enhanced performance even

the improvement of DeepFake generation methods. Simultaneously, we have seen
detection models' development for differentiating between a manipulated and
original face from image or video content. In this paper, we focus on
identifying the limitations and shortcomings of existing deepfake detection
frameworks. We identified some key problems surrounding deepfake detection
through quantitative and qualitative analysis of existing methods and datasets.
We found that deepfake datasets are highly oversampled, causing models to
become easily overfitted. The datasets are created using a small set of real
faces to generate multiple fake samples. When trained on these datasets, models
tend to memorize the actors' faces and labels instead of learning fake
features. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple data augmentation
method termed Face-Cutout. Our method dynamically cuts out regions of an image
using the face landmark information. It helps the model selectively attend to
only the relevant regions of the input. Our evaluation experiments show that
Face-Cutout can successfully improve the data variation and alleviate the
problem of overfitting. Our method achieves a reduction in LogLoss of 15.2% to
35.3% on different datasets, compared to other occlusion-based techniques.
Moreover, we also propose a general-purpose data pre-processing guideline to
train and evaluate existing architectures allowing us to improve the
generalizability of these models for deepfake detection.

practices, what they write in comments, and how researchers support them in
assessing comment quality.
  Our preliminary findings show that developers embed various kinds of
information in class comments across programming languages. Still, they face
problems in locating relevant guidelines to write consistent and informative
comments, verifying the adherence of their comments to the guidelines, and
evaluating the overall state of comment quality. To help developers and

empirically validated taxonomy of comment convention-related questions from
various community forums, (ii) an empirically validated taxonomy of comment
information types from various programming languages, (iii) a
language-independent approach to automatically identify the information types,

nonasymptotic lower and upper bounds on the relative error in importance

suddenness and heterogeneity across industries. To study the upstream and
downstream propagation of these industry-specific demand and supply shocks, we
build a dynamic input-output model inspired by previous work on the economic
response to natural disasters. We argue that standard production functions, at
least in their most parsimonious parametrizations, are not adequate to model
input substitutability in the context of Covid-19 shocks. We use a survey of
industry analysts to evaluate, for each industry, which inputs were absolutely
necessary for production over a short time period. We calibrate our model on
the UK economy and study the economic effects of the lockdown that was imposed
at the end of March and gradually released in May. Looking back at predictions
that we released in May, we show that the model predicted aggregate dynamics
very well, and sectoral dynamics to a large extent. We discuss the relative
extent to which the model's dynamics and performance was due to the choice of
the production function or the choice of an exogenous shock scenario. To
further explore the behavior of the model, we use simpler scenarios with only
demand or supply shocks, and find that popular metrics used to predict a priori
the impact of shocks, such as output multipliers, are only mildly useful.

introduces two new models for joint mortality modelling and forecasting
multiple subpopulations in adaptations of the multivariate functional principal
component analysis techniques. The first model extends the independent
functional data model to a multi-population modelling setting. In the second
one, we propose a novel multivariate functional principal component method for
coherent modelling. Its design primarily fulfils the idea that when several
subpopulation groups have similar socio-economic conditions or common

non-diverging fashion. We demonstrate the proposed methods by using
sex-specific mortality data. Their forecast performances are further compared
with several existing models, including the independent functional data model
and the Product-Ratio model, through comparisons with mortality data of ten
developed countries. Our experiment results show that the first proposed model
maintains a comparable forecast ability with the existing methods. In contrast,
the second proposed model outperforms the first model as well as the current
models in terms of forecast accuracy, in addition to several desirable

focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on various medical
data of COVID-19-positive patients in order to identify or classify various
aspects of the disease, with promising reported results. However, concerns have
been raised over their generalizability, given the heterogeneous factors in
training datasets. This study aims to examine the severity of this problem by
evaluating deep learning (DL) classification models trained to identify
COVID-19-positive patients on 3D computed tomography (CT) datasets from
different countries. We collected one dataset at UT Southwestern (UTSW), and
three external datasets from different countries: CC-CCII Dataset (China),
COVID-CTset (Iran), and MosMedData (Russia). We divided the data into 2
classes: COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. We trained nine
identical DL-based classification models by using combinations of the datasets
with a 72% train, 8% validation, and 20% test data split. The models trained on
a single dataset achieved accuracy/area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC) values of 0.87/0.826 (UTSW), 0.97/0.988 (CC-CCCI),
and 0.86/0.873 (COVID-CTset) when evaluated on their own dataset. The models
trained on multiple datasets and evaluated on a test set from one of the
datasets used for training performed better. However, the performance dropped
close to an AUC of 0.5 (random guess) for all models when evaluated on a
different dataset outside of its training datasets. Including the MosMedData,
which only contained positive labels, into the training did not necessarily
help the performance on the other datasets. Multiple factors likely contribute
to these results, such as patient demographics and differences in image
acquisition or reconstruction, causing a data shift among different study

for the mass continuity equation and the scalar transport equations are derived
for robust and accurate implementation. The linearized matrices for the
cavitation equation are imparted a positivity-preserving property to address
numerical oscillations arising from high-density gradients typical of two-phase
cavitating flows. The proposed formulation is strongly coupled in a partitioned
manner with an incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes finite element solver, and the
unsteady problem is advanced in time using a fully-implicit
generalized-$\alpha$ time integration scheme. We first verify the
implementation on the benchmark case of Rayleigh bubble collapse. We
demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the cavitation solver by comparing
the numerical solutions with the analytical solutions of the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation for bubble dynamics. We find our solver to be robust for large time

cavitating flow solver is coupled with a hybrid URANS-LES turbulence model with
a turbulence viscosity corrected for the presence of vapor. We validate the
coupled solver for a very high Reynolds number turbulent cavitating flow over a
NACA0012 hydrofoil section. Finally, the proposed method is solved in an
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework to study turbulent cavitating flow over

dominant when compared with natural decay. The PI behavior is governed by the
generally rapid decrease of the PI cross sections as a function of
angular-momentum ($\ell$), and by lattice-induced $\ell$-mixing across the
optical-lattice PECs. In GHz-deep lattices, $\ell$-mixing leads to a rich PEC
structure, and the significant low-$\ell$ PI cross sections are distributed
over many lattice-mixed Rydberg states. In lattices less than several
tens-of-MHz deep, atoms on low-$\ell$ PECs are essentially $\ell$-mixing-free

towards being PI-free. Characterization of PI in GHz-deep Rydberg-atom lattices

which is naturally more communication-efficient than full gradient sharing. Our
approach, called distributed auto-differentiation (dAD), builds off a marriage
of rank-based compression and the innate structure of the gradient as an
outer-product. We demonstrate that dAD trains more efficiently than other state
of the art distributed methods on modern architectures, such as transformers,
when applied to large-scale text and imaging datasets. The future of

essentially collisionless. This means particle distributions are not typically
in thermodynamic equilibrium and deviate significantly from Maxwellian
distributions. The deviations of these distributions can be further enhanced by
plasma processes, such as shocks, turbulence, and magnetic reconnection. Such
distributions can be unstable to a wide variety of kinetic plasma
instabilities, which in turn modify the electron distributions. In this paper
the deviations of the observed electron distributions from a bi-Maxwellian
distribution function is calculated and quantified using data from the
Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft. A statistical study from tens of
millions of electron distributions shows that the primary source of the
observed non-Maxwellianity are electron distributions consisting of distinct
hot and cold components in Earth's low-density magnetosphere. This results in
large non-Maxwellianities in at low densities. However, after performing a
stastical study we find regions where large non-Maxwellianities are observed
for a given density. Highly non-Maxwellian distributions are routinely found
are Earth's bowshock, in Earth's outer magnetosphere, and in the electron
diffusion regions of magnetic reconnection. Enhanced non-Maxwellianities are
observed in the turbulent magnetosheath, but are intermittent and are not
correlated with local processes. The causes of enhanced non-Maxwellianities are
investigated.

The model at an age of $\sim$6000 yr can provide a good fit to the observed

extended ($\sim$1000 au) molecular outflow and a bright shock knot, $^{13}$CO
is tracing the outer ($\sim$1000 au) envelope/pseudo-disc, and C$^{18}$O is
tracing the inner ($\sim$500 au) pseudo-disc. The source size of $\sim$8.6 au
measured in the 873$\mu$m image is comparable to the inner Keplerian disc size
predicted by the model. A 3D model structure of ISO-OPH 200 suggests that this
system is viewed partially through a wide outflow cavity resulting in a direct
view of the outflow and a partial view of the envelope/pseudo-disc. We have
argued that ISO-OPH 200 has been mis-classified as a Class Flat object due to
the unusual orientation. The various signatures of this system, notably, the
young $\sim$616 yr outflow dynamical age and high outflow rate
($\sim$1$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), silicate absorption in the
10$\mu$m mid-infrared spectrum, pristine ISM-like dust in the envelope/disc,
comparable sizes of the extended envelope and outflow, indicate that ISO-OPH

gravitational collapse of a very low-mass core.

ability for monitoring the time evolution of CO$_2$ ro-vibrational excitation
with a well-selected wavelength window around 2289.0 cm$^{-1}$ and a single CW

The rotational and vibrational temperatures for both the symmetric and the
asymmetric modes of CO$_2$ in the afterglow of CO$_2$ + He ns-discharge were
measured with a temporal resolution of 1.5 $\mu$s. The non-thermal feature and
the preferential excitation of the asymmetric stretch mode of CO$_2$ were
experimentally observed, with a peak temperature of $T_{v3, max}$ = 966 $\pm$
1.5 K, $T_{v12, max}$ = 438.4 $\pm$ 1.2 K and $T_{rot}$ = 334.6 $\pm$ 0.6 K
reached at 3 $\mu$s after the nanosecond pulse. In the following relaxation
process, an exponential decay with a time constant of 69 $\mu$s was observed
for the asymmetric stretch (001) state, consistent with the dominant
deexcitation mechanism due to VT transfer with He and deexcitation on the wall.
Furthermore, a synchronous oscillation of the gas temperature and the total
pressure was also observed and can be explained by a two-line thermometry and
adiabatic process. The period of the oscillation and its dependence on the gas
components is consistent with a standing acoustic wave excited by the

rely on a summation of these noisy increments, do not appropriately take into
account the reliability of such observations, which is essential for
appropriately weighing one's current heading direction estimate against
incoming information. In a probabilistic setting, angular path integration can
be formulated as a continuous-time nonlinear filtering problem (circular
filtering) with observed state increments. The circular symmetry of heading
direction makes this inference task inherently nonlinear, thereby precluding
the use of popular inference algorithms such as Kalman filters, rendering the
problem analytically inaccessible. Here, we derive an approximate solution to
circular continuous-time filtering, which integrates state increment
observations while maintaining a fixed representation through both state
propagation and observational updates. Specifically, we extend the established
projection-filtering method to account for observed state increments and apply
this framework to the circular filtering problem. We further propose a
generative model for continuous-time angular-valued direct observations of the
hidden state, which we integrate seamlessly into the projection filter.
Applying the resulting scheme to a model of probabilistic angular path
integration, we derive an algorithm for circular filtering, which we term the
circular Kalman filter. Importantly, this algorithm is analytically accessible,
interpretable, and outperforms an alternative filter based on a Gaussian
approximation.

  Symposium 2021, 21-24 February 2021, San Diego, CA, USA",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) allows a data owner to securely
outsource its encrypted data to a cloud server while maintaining the ability to
search over it and retrieve matched documents. Most existing SSE schemes leak
which documents are accessed per query, i.e., the so-called access pattern, and
thus are vulnerable to attacks that can recover the database or the queried
keywords. Current techniques that fully hide access patterns, such as ORAM or
PIR, suffer from heavy communication or computational costs, and are not
designed with search capabilities in mind. Recently, Chen et al. (INFOCOM'18)
proposed an obfuscation framework for SSE that protects the access pattern in a
differentially private way with a reasonable utility cost. However, this scheme
leaks the so-called search pattern, i.e., how many times a certain query is
performed. This leakage makes the proposal vulnerable to certain database and
query recovery attacks.
  In this paper, we propose OSSE (Obfuscated SSE), an SSE scheme that
obfuscates the access pattern independently for each query performed. This in
turn hides the search pattern and makes our scheme resistant against attacks
that rely on this leakage. Under certain reasonable assumptions, our scheme has
smaller communication overhead than ORAM-based SSE. Furthermore, our scheme
works in a single communication round and requires very small constant
client-side storage. Our empirical evaluation shows that OSSE is highly
effective at protecting against different query recovery attacks while keeping
a reasonable utility level. Our protocol provides significantly more protection
than the proposal by Chen et al.~against some state-of-the-art attacks, which
demonstrates the importance of hiding search patterns in designing effective
privacy-preserving SSE schemes.

uses two staggered Monkhorst-Pack meshes for occupied and virtual orbitals,
respectively, to compute the MP2 energy. The staggered mesh method circumvents
a significant error source in the standard method, in which certain quadrature
nodes are always placed on points where the integrand is discontinuous. One
significant advantage of the proposed method is that there are no tunable
parameters, and the additional numerical effort needed can be negligible
compared to the standard MP2 calculation. Numerical results indicate that the
staggered mesh method can be particularly advantageous for quasi-1D systems, as
well as quasi-2D and 3D systems with certain symmetries.

log-integrability condition on $\psi_{\rho}$, which implies that it is positive
almost everywhere, we recover the asymptotics of the independent case, i.e. the
limit is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. Besides, with further assumptions of regularity
and existence of negative moment for $\psi_{\rho}$, we moreover show that the
above convergence in expectation can be strengthened to an almost sure

phase-space signatures in kinetic turbulence of relevance to low-$\beta$
portions of the solar wind. We retain a full scale-dependent approach in our
treatment, and consider the case in which electric-field fluctuations can be
described by a generalized Ohm's law that includes Hall and thermo-electric
effects. These two electric-field terms provide the dominant contributions to
stochastic ion heating when the ion-Larmor scale is much smaller than the ion
skin depth, $\rho_{\mathrm{i}}\ll d_{\mathrm{i}}$, which is the case at
$\beta{\ll}1$. Employing well-known spectral scaling laws for Alfv\'en-wave and
kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave turbulent fluctuations, we obtain scaling relations
characterizing the field-perpendicular particle-energization rate and energy
diffusion coefficient associated with stochastic heating in these two regimes.
Phase-space signatures of ion heating are then investigated using 3D
hybrid-kinetic simulations of continuously driven Alfv\'enic turbulence at low
$\beta$. In these simulations, energization of ions parallel to the magnetic
field is sub-dominant compared to its perpendicular counterpart
($Q_{\parallel,\mathrm{i}}\ll Q_{\perp,\mathrm{i}}$), and the fraction of
turbulent energy that goes into ion heating is ${\approx}75$\% at
$\beta_{\mathrm{i}}=0.3$ and ${\approx}40$\% at
$\beta_{\mathrm{i}}{\simeq}0.1$. The phase-space signatures of ion energization
are consistent with Landau-resonant collisionless damping and a
($\beta$-dependent) combination of ion-cyclotron and stochastic heating. We
demonstrate good agreement between our theory and various signatures associated
with the stochastic portion of the heating. We discuss the effect of
intermittency on stochastic heating and the implications of our work for the
interpretation of stochastic heating in solar-wind spacecraft data.

user behavior in network routing problems is to institute taxes which alter
users' observed costs in a manner that causes their self-interested choices to
more closely align with a system-level objective. Another conceivable method to
accomplish the same goal is to subsidize the users' actions that are preferable
from a system-level perspective. We show that, when users behave similarly and
predictably, subsidies offer superior performance guarantees to tolls under
similar budgetary constraints; however, in the presence of unknown player
heterogeneity, subsidies fail to offer the same robustness as tolls.

$L^p(\mathbb{R}^{2N})$ norm in the Gagliardo semi-norm for
$\dot{W}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with a weak-$L^p(\mathbb{R}^{2N})$ quasi-norm and
setting $s = 1$. This provides a characterization of such $\dot{W}^{1,p}$
norms, which complements the celebrated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM)
formula. In this paper, we obtain an analog for the case $s = 0$. In
particular, we present a new formula for the $L^p$ norm of any function in
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which involves only the measures of suitable level sets,
but no integration. This provides a characterization of the norm on
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which complements a formula by Maz'ya and Shaposhnikova.
As a result, by interpolation, we obtain a new embedding of the
Triebel-Lizorkin space $F^s_{p,2}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ (i.e. the Bessel potential

underestimate the membrane bow for small sizes while numerical models replicate
the stresses and bows with increased accuracy using temperature gradients. The
largest tensile stress measured using Raman spectroscopy at room temperature
was approximately 1.0 $\pm0.2$ GPa while surface profilometry shows membrane
bows as large as \SI{58}{\micro\metre}. This large bow is caused by additional
stresses from the Si frame in the initial heating phase which are held in place
by the diamond and highlights challenges for any device fabrication using
contact lithography. However, the bow can be reduced if the membrane is
pre-stressed to become flat at CVD temperatures. In this way, a sufficient

Broadly, t-sne is effective at rendering a randomly oriented low-dimensional
map of local clusters, and PCA renders this map interpretable by providing
global, physically meaningful structure. This approach is illustrated using
imaging spectroscopy data, and may prove particularly useful for other
geospatial data given robust local variance structure due to spatial
autocorrelation and physical interpretability of global variance structure due
to spectral properties of Earth surface materials. However, the fundamental
premise could easily be extended to other high dimensional datasets, including

exposure is considered as one of the key problems for modern IR systems. As
conventional ranking frameworks that myopically sorts documents with their
relevance will inevitably introduce unfair result exposure, recent studies on
ranking fairness mostly focus on dynamic ranking paradigms where result
rankings can be adapted in real-time to support fairness in groups (i.e.,
races, genders, etc.). Existing studies on fairness in dynamic learning to
rank, however, often achieve the overall fairness of document exposure in
ranked lists by significantly sacrificing the performance of result relevance
and fairness on the top results. To address this problem, we propose a fair and
unbiased ranking method named Maximal Marginal Fairness (MMF). The algorithm
integrates unbiased estimators for both relevance and merit-based fairness
while providing an explicit controller that balances the selection of documents
to maximize the marginal relevance and fairness in top-k results. Theoretical
and empirical analysis shows that, with small compromises on long list
fairness, our method achieves superior efficiency and effectiveness comparing

training deep neural networks has gained remarkable attention in the research

proposed: (i) the loss function has connected sublevel sets, and (ii) the
solutions found by stochastic gradient descent are dropout stable. While these
explanations provide insights into the phenomenon, their assumptions are not
always satisfied in practice. In particular, the first approach requires the
network to have one layer with order of $N$ neurons ($N$ being the number of
training samples), while the second one requires the loss to be almost
invariant after removing half of the neurons at each layer (up to some
rescaling of the remaining ones). In this work, we improve both conditions by
exploiting the quality of the features at every intermediate layer together
with a milder over-parameterization condition. More specifically, we show that:
(i) under generic assumptions on the features of intermediate layers, it
suffices that the last two hidden layers have order of $\sqrt{N}$ neurons, and
(ii) if subsets of features at each layer are linearly separable, then no
over-parameterization is needed to show the connectivity. Our experiments
confirm that the proposed condition ensures the connectivity of solutions found

requirements do not hold.

at finer granularities during execution. Unfortunately, existing systems are
oblivious to the application phase behavior, and are unable to detect and react
quickly enough to these rapidly changing cache requirements, often incurring
significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Com-CAS, a new
apportioning system that provides dynamic cache allocations for co-executing

adapting to the dynamic cache requirements of applications just-in-time, as

Com-CAS consists of compiler-analysis equipped with machine learning mechanisms
to predict cache requirements, while the back-end consists of proactive
scheduler that dynamically apportions LLC amongst co-executing applications
leveraging Intel Cache Allocation Technology (CAT). Com-CAS's partitioning
scheme utilizes the compiler-generated information across finer granularities

simultaneously maintaining data locality. Our experiments show that Com-CAS
improves average weighted throughput by 15% over unpartitioned cache system,

deterrence of its adversaries. Any hostile cyber operation, suspending control
over a space asset, severely impacts both NATO missions and allied Member
States national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly
unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question:
a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can
NATO and its allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to
safeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field
study is carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with
high-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic
organizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia.
This thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs SASC are
caused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of
Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC management is
caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels and significant
understaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two major collaboration
initiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and
b) Pushing forward the creation of regulation through a standardized security
framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so would enable NATO and its Member

in principle efficiently controlled and manipulated from the outside via
Coulomb engineering. Here, we show how this concept can be used to create
fundamentally new plasmonic waveguides in metallic layered materials. We
discuss in detail how dielectrically structured environments can be utilized to
non-invasively confine plasmonic excitations in an otherwise homogeneous
metallic 2D system by modification of its many-body interactions. We define
optimal energy ranges for this mechanism and demonstrate plasmonic confinement
within several nanometers. In contrast to conventional functionalization
mechanisms, this scheme relies on a purely many-body concept and does not
involve any direct modifications to the active material itself.

  Gaussian process regression approaches",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A rapid decline in mortality and fertility has become major issues in many
developed countries over the past few decades. A precise model for forecasting
demographic movements is important for decision making in social welfare
policies and resource budgeting among the government and many industry sectors.
This article introduces a novel non-parametric approach using Gaussian process
regression with a natural cubic spline mean function and a spectral mixture
covariance function for mortality and fertility modelling and forecasting.
Unlike most of the existing approaches in demographic modelling literature,
which rely on time parameters to decide the movements of the whole mortality or
fertility curve shifting from one year to another over time, we consider the
mortality and fertility curves from their components of all age-specific
mortality and fertility rates and assume each of them following a Gaussian
process over time to fit the whole curves in a discrete but intensive style.
The proposed Gaussian process regression approach shows significant
improvements in terms of preciseness and robustness compared to other
mainstream demographic modelling approaches in the short-, mid- and long-term
forecasting using the mortality and fertility data of several developed
countries in our numerical experiments.

  singularity in harmonic resolvent analysis",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently introduced harmonic resolvent framework is concerned with the
study of the input-output dynamics of nonlinear flows in the proximity of a
known time-periodic orbit. These dynamics are governed by the harmonic
resolvent operator, which is a linear operator in the frequency domain whose
singular value decomposition sheds light on the dominant input-output
structures of the flow. Although the harmonic resolvent is a mathematically
well-defined operator, the numerical computation of its singular value
decomposition requires inverting a matrix that becomes exactly singular as the
periodic orbit approaches an exact solution of the nonlinear governing
equations. The very poor condition properties of this matrix hinder the
convergence of classical Krylov solvers, even in the presence of
preconditioners, thereby increasing the computational cost required to perform
the harmonic resolvent analysis. In this paper we show that a suitable
augmentation of the (nearly) singular matrix removes the singularity, and we
provide a lower bound for the smallest singular value of the augmented matrix.
We also show that the desired decomposition of the harmonic resolvent can be
computed using the augmented matrix, whose improved condition properties lead
to a significant speedup in the convergence of classical iterative solvers. We
demonstrate this simple, yet effective, computational procedure on the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation in the proximity of an unstable time-periodic
orbit.

by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage

instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI

three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more
thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment

cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple
explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the
least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance
the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we
investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different

in a radar system is addressed in this paper. We propose two novel
learning-based approaches to waveform and detector design based on end-to-end
training of the radar system. The first approach consists of alternating
supervised training of the detector for a fixed waveform and reinforcement
learning of the transmitter for a fixed detector. In the second approach, the
transmitter and detector are trained simultaneously. Various operational
waveform constraints, such as peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) and spectral
compatibility, are incorporated into the design. Unlike traditional radar
design methods that rely on rigid mathematical models with limited
applicability, it is shown that radar learning can be robustified by training
the detector with synthetic data generated from multiple statistical models of
the environment. Theoretical considerations and results show that the proposed
methods are capable of adapting the transmitted waveform to environmental
conditions while satisfying design constraints.

color to every vertex in $V$ such that adjacent vertices receive different
colors, every color has a $b$-vertex, and the number of colors is maximized. A
$b$-vertex is a vertex adjacent to vertices colored with all used colors but
its own. The $b$-coloring problem is known to be NP-Hard and its optimal
solution determines the $b$-chromatic number of $G$, denoted $\chi_b(G)$. This
paper presents an integer programming formulation and a very effective
multi-greedy randomized heuristic which can be used in a multi-start
metaheuristic. In addition, a matheuristic approach is proposed combining the
multi-start multi-greedy randomized metaheuristic with a MIP (mixed integer
programming) based local search procedure using the integer programming
formulation. Computational experiments establish the proposed multi-start
metaheuristic as very effective in generating high quality solutions, along
with the matheuristic approach successfully improving several of those results.
Moreover, the computational results show that the multi-start metaheuristic
outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid evolutionary metaheuristic for a subset

additional contribution of this work is the proposal of a benchmark instance

computational comparisons of approaches for the $b$-coloring problem in future

the pyrazine tilt angles do not affect the Cu-pyrazine-Cu exchange because the

hidden attribute adds an extra layer of complexity to the problem by combining
sparse regression and clustering with unknown binary labels. The corresponding
optimization problem is combinatorial, but we propose a novel relaxation of it
as an \emph{invex} optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first invex relaxation for a combinatorial problem. We show that the
inclusion of the debiasing/fairness constraint in our model has no adverse
effect on the performance. Rather, it enables the recovery of the hidden
attribute. The support of our recovered regression parameter vector matches
exactly with the true parameter vector. Moreover, we simultaneously solve the
clustering problem by recovering the exact value of the hidden attribute for
each sample. Our method uses carefully constructed primal dual witnesses to
provide theoretical guarantees for the combinatorial problem. To that end, we
show that the sample complexity of our method is logarithmic in terms of the
dimension of the regression parameter vector.

parameters. Consequently, applied statisticians frequently face a difficult
decision: retain a parameter estimate from a familiar method or replace it with
an estimate from a newer or more complex one. While it is traditional to
compare estimates using risk, such comparisons are rarely conclusive in
realistic settings.
  In response, we propose the ""c-value"" as a measure of confidence that a new
estimate achieves smaller loss than an old estimate on a given dataset. We show
that it is unlikely that a large c-value coincides with a larger loss for the
new estimate. Therefore, just as a small p-value supports rejecting a null
hypothesis, a large c-value supports using a new estimate in place of the old.
For a wide class of problems and estimates, we show how to compute a c-value by
first constructing a data-dependent high-probability lower bound on the
difference in loss. The c-value is frequentist in nature, but we show that it
can provide validation of shrinkage estimates derived from Bayesian models in
real data applications involving hierarchical models and Gaussian processes.

symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is
breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the
excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid debris that
have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy
and stiff lungs. In this paper, we propose the use of micro-bubbles filled with
exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as possible
rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown
that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have
suffered from viral infection. We have conducted simulations to show the
efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of
tissues reaching the alveoli that contain the micro-bubbles. Our results have
shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate
and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our proposed system can be used
for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well
as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where
the micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until

detectors, which can discriminate only photons' presence or absence. It has
recently been found that they can discriminate the number of photons by
analyzing the output signal waveform, and they are expected to be used in
various fields, especially in optical quantum information processing. Here, we
improve the photon-number-resolving performance for light with a high-average
photon number by pattern matching of the output signal waveform. Furthermore,
we estimate the positive-operator-valued measure of the detector by a quantum
detector tomography. The result shows that the device has
photon-number-resolving performance up to five photons without any multiplexing
or arraying, indicating that it is useful as a photon-number-resolving
detector.

inferential statistical procedures, including dimensionality reduction,
hypothesis testing, and regression. In low-dimensional regimes, where the
number of observations far exceeds the number of variables, the optimality of
the sample covariance matrix as an estimator of this parameter is
well-established. High-dimensional regimes do not admit such a convenience,
however. As such, a variety of estimators have been derived to overcome the
shortcomings of the sample covariance matrix in these settings. Yet, the
question of selecting an optimal estimator from among the plethora available
remains largely unaddressed. Using the framework of cross-validated loss-based
estimation, we develop the theoretical underpinnings of just such an estimator
selection procedure. In particular, we propose a general class of loss
functions for covariance matrix estimation and establish finite-sample risk
bounds and conditions for the asymptotic optimality of the cross-validated
estimator selector with respect to these loss functions. We evaluate our
proposed approach via a comprehensive set of simulation experiments and
demonstrate its practical benefits by application in the exploratory analysis

communication channel. In this problem, a set of nodes arrive over time, each
with a message it intends to send. In each time slot, each node may attempt to
broadcast its message or remain idle. If a single node broadcasts in a slot,
the message is received by all nodes; otherwise, if multiple nodes broadcast
simultaneously, a collision occurs and none succeeds. If collision detection is
available, nodes can differentiate collision and silence (i.e., no nodes
broadcast). Performance of contention resolution algorithms is often measured
by throughput -- the number of successful transmissions within a period of
time; whereas robustness is often measured by jamming resistance -- a jammed
slot always generates a collision. Previous work has shown, with collision
detection, optimal constant throughput can be attained, even if a constant
fraction of all slots are jammed. The situation when collision detection is not
available, however, remains unclear.
  In a recent breakthrough paper [Bender et al., STOC '20], a crucial case is
resolved: constant throughput is possible without collision detection, but only
if there is no jamming. Nonetheless, the exact trade-off between the best
possible throughput and the severity of jamming remains unknown. In this paper,
we address this open question. Specifically, for any level of jamming ranging
from none to constant fraction, we prove an upper bound on the best possible
throughput, along with an algorithm attaining that bound. An immediate and
interesting implication of our result is, when a constant fraction of all slots
are jammed, which is the worst-case scenario, there still exists an algorithm
achieving a decent throughput: $\Theta(t/\log{t})$ messages could be
successfully transmitted within $t$ slots.

grand challenge to existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models,
failing to continually adapt to such subpopulation shift. Recent work suggests
training BIQA methods on the combination of all available human-rated IQA
datasets. However, this type of approach is not scalable to a large number of
datasets, and is cumbersome to incorporate a newly created dataset as well. In
this paper, we formulate continual learning for BIQA, where a model learns
continually from a stream of IQA datasets, building on what was learned from
previously seen data. We first identify five desiderata in the new setting with
a measure to quantify the plasticity-stability trade-off. We then propose a
simple yet effective method for learning BIQA models continually. Specifically,
based on a shared backbone network, we add a prediction head for a new dataset,
and enforce a regularizer to allow all prediction heads to evolve with new data
while being resistant to catastrophic forgetting of old data. We compute the
quality score by an adaptive weighted summation of estimates from all
prediction heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed
continual learning method in comparison to standard training techniques for
BIQA. We made the code publicly available at

exponential to nonexistent. We first show that for 1-dimensional strongly

orthogonality in distributed multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar with

may experience distinct delays and Doppler frequency offsets unique to
different TX-RX propagation paths. In such cases, the output of each
waveform-specific matched filter (MF), employed to unravel the waveforms at the
RXs, contains both an \auto term and multiple cross terms, i.e., the filtered
response of the desired and, respectively, undesired waveforms. We consider the
impact of non-orthogonal waveforms and their cross terms on target detection
with or without timing, frequency, and phase errors. To this end, we present a
general signal model for distributed MIMO radar, examine target detection using
existing coherent/non-coherent detectors and two new detectors, including a
hybrid detector that requires phase coherence locally but not across
distributed antennas, and provide a statistical analysis leading to closed-form
expressions of false alarm and detection probabilities for all detectors. Our
results show that cross terms can behave like foes or allies, respectively, if
they and the auto term add destructively or constructively, depending on the
propagation delay, frequency, and phase offsets. Regarding sync errors, we show
that phase errors affect only coherent detectors, frequency errors degrade all
but the non-coherent detector, while all are impacted by timing errors, which
result in a loss in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

characterised experimentally by designing and benchmarking control protocols
for an IBMQ cloud quantum device. This result demonstrates error amplification
induced by the application of a first-order perturbative approximation.
Furthermore, the emergence of errors that cannot be corrected by simple
amplitude scaling of control pulses is demonstrated in simulation, due to an
underlying mistreatment of noncomputational dynamics. Finally, an evaluation of
simulated control dynamics reveals that despite the substantial variance in
numerical predictions across the proposed models, the complexity of discovering
local optimal control protocols appears invariant in the simple control scheme
setting.

behavior during team work. In particular, positive group attitudes are said to
be essential for distributed and global software development efforts where
collaboration is critical to project success. Objective: Given this, we have
sought to study the influence of global software practitioners' personality
profiles from a psycholinguistic perspective. Method: Artifacts from ten teams
were selected from the IBM Rational Jazz repository and mined. We employed
social network analysis (SNA) techniques to identify and group practitioners
into two clusters based on the numbers of messages they communicated, Top
Members and Others, and used standard statistical techniques to assess
practitioners' engagement in task changes associated with work items. We then
performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic
dimensions of the LIWC tool that had been previously correlated with the Big
Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners, we
found that the Top Members demonstrated more openness to experience than the
Other practitioners. Additionally, practitioners involved in usability-related
tasks were found to be highly extroverted, and coders were most neurotic and
conscientious. Conclusion: High levels of organizational and inter-personal
skills may be useful for those operating in distributed settings, and
personality diversity is likely to boost team performance.

recent spatially-resolved observations have shown that local galaxies also obey
a mass-metallicity gradient relation (MZGR) whereby metallicity gradients can
vary systematically with galaxy mass. In this work, we use our
recently-developed analytic model for metallicity distributions in galactic
discs, which includes a wide range of physical processes -- radial advection,
metal diffusion, cosmological accretion, and metal-enriched outflows -- to
simultaneously analyse the MZR and MZGR. We show that the same physical
principles govern the shape of both: centrally-peaked metal production favours
steeper gradients, and this steepening is diluted by the addition of metal-poor
gas, which is supplied by inward advection for low-mass galaxies and by
cosmological accretion for massive galaxies. The MZR and the MZGR both bend at
galaxy stellar mass $\sim 10^{10} - 10^{10.5}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and we show
that this feature corresponds to the transition of galaxies from the
advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime. We also find that both
the MZR and MZGR strongly suggest that low-mass galaxies preferentially lose
metals entrained in their galactic winds. While this metal-enrichment of the
galactic outflows is crucial for reproducing both the MZR and the MZGR at the
low-mass end, we show that the flattening of gradients in massive galaxies is
expected regardless of the nature of their winds.

velocity $v_{\phi}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$) and
gas-phase metallicity gradients at $0.1 \leq z \leq 2.5$ using a compiled data
set of 74 galaxies resolved with ground-based integral field spectroscopy. We
find that galaxies with the highest and the lowest $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ have
preferentially flat metallicity gradients, whereas those with intermediate
values of $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ show a large scatter in the metallicity
gradients. Additionally, steep negative gradients appear almost only in
rotation-dominated galaxies ($v_{\phi}/\sigma_{\mathrm{g}} > 1$), whereas most
dispersion-dominated galaxies show flat gradients. We use our recently
developed analytic model of metallicity gradients to provide a physical
explanation for the shape and scatter of these observed trends. In the case of
high $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$, the inward radial advection of gas dominates over
metal production and causes efficient metal mixing, thus giving rise to flat
gradients. For low $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$, it is the cosmic accretion of
metal-poor gas diluting the metallicity that gives rise to flat gradients.
Finally, the reason for intermediate $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ showing the steepest
negative gradients is that both inward radial advection and cosmic accretion
are weak as compared to metal production, which leads to the creation of
steeper gradients. The larger scatter at intermediate $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ may
be due in part to preferential ejection of metals in galactic winds, which can
decrease the strength of the production term. Our analysis shows how gas
kinematics play a critical role in setting metallicity gradients in
high-redshift galaxies.

Brain. Intracranial compartments such as blood, brain and CSF are
incompressible in nature. Therefore, if a volume imbalance in one of the
aforenoted compartments is observed, the other reaches out to maintain net
change to zero. Whereas, CSF has higher compliance over long term. However, if
the CSF flow is obstructed in the ventricles, this compliance may get exhausted
early. Brain tumor on the other hand poses a similar challenge towards
destabilization of CSF flow by compressing any section of ventricles thereby
ensuing obstruction. To avoid invasive procedures to study effects of tumor on
CSF flow, numerical-based methods such as Finite element modeling (FEM) are
used which provide excellent description of underlying pathological
interaction. A 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is developed to study
the effect of tumor growth on the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in ventricle

be necessary in analyzing intraventricular CSF flow behavior. Findings of the

define the similarity as DeepSimilarity. We also conduct an empirical

distributions with high accuracy. The neural ODE uses the same network
repeatedly during a numerical integration. The memory consumption of the
backpropagation algorithm is proportional to the number of uses times the
network size. This is true even if a checkpointing scheme divides the
computation graph into sub-graphs. Otherwise, the adjoint method obtains a
gradient by a numerical integration backward in time. Although this method
consumes memory only for a single network use, it requires high computational
cost to suppress numerical errors. This study proposes the symplectic adjoint
method, which is an adjoint method solved by a symplectic integrator. The
symplectic adjoint method obtains the exact gradient (up to rounding error)
with memory proportional to the number of uses plus the network size. The
experimental results demonstrate that the symplectic adjoint method consumes
much less memory than the naive backpropagation algorithm and checkpointing
schemes, performs faster than the adjoint method, and is more robust to
rounding errors.

prediction task such as medical image classification, they are often
constrained by data protection regulations and lack of trust among
collaborating parties. If done in a privacy-preserving manner, predictive
analytics can benefit from the collective prediction capability of multiple
parties holding complementary datasets on the same machine learning task. This
paper presents PRICURE, a system that combines complementary strengths of
secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy (DP) to enable
privacy-preserving collaborative prediction among multiple model owners. SMPC
enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding
secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and
inputs. DP masks true prediction results via noisy aggregation so as to deter a
semi-honest client who may mount membership inference attacks. We evaluate
PRICURE on neural networks across four datasets including benchmark medical
image classification datasets. Our results suggest PRICURE guarantees privacy
for tens of model owners and clients with acceptable accuracy loss. We also
show that DP reduces membership inference attack exposure without hurting
accuracy.

However, KH has not yet been observed in 4d/5d transition metal compounds,
since more extended 4d/5d orbitals do not usually form flat bands that supply
localized electrons appropriate for Kondo pairing. Here, we report a doping-
and temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission study on 4d
Ca2-xSrxRuO4, which shows the signature of KH. We observed a spectral weight
transfer in the {\gamma}-band, reminiscent of an orbital-selective Mott phase
(OSMP). The Mott localized {\gamma}-band induces KH with the itinerant
\b{eta}-band, resulting in spectral weight suppression around the Fermi level.
Our work is the first to demonstrate the evolution of the OSMP with possible KH
among 4d electrons, and thereby expands the material boundary of Kondo physics
to 4d multi-orbital systems.

computing gradients of a smoothed approximation of the objective function (and

approximations are calculated by finite differences, with a differencing
interval determined by the noise level in the functions and a bound on the
second or third derivatives. It is assumed that noise level is known or can be
estimated by means of difference tables or sampling. The use of finite
differences has been largely dismissed in the derivative-free optimization
literature as too expensive in terms of function evaluations and/or as
impractical when the objective function contains noise. The test results
presented in this paper suggest that such views should be re-examined and that
the finite-difference approach has much to be recommended. The tests compared

Laplacian spectrum. It has recently found applications in various learning
tasks driven by networked data. However, it is computational demanding and hard
to interpret using simple structural patterns. Due to the close relation
between Lapalcian spectrum and degree sequence, we conjecture that the
structural information, defined as the Shannon entropy of the normalized degree
sequence, might be a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that
is both scalable and interpretable.
  In this work, we thereby study the difference between the structural
information and von Neumann graph entropy named as {\em entropy gap}. Based on
the knowledge that the degree sequence is majorized by the Laplacian spectrum,
we for the first time prove the entropy gap is between $0$ and $\log_2 e$ in
any undirected unweighted graphs. Consequently we certify that the structural
information is a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that
achieves provable accuracy, scalability, and interpretability simultaneously.
This approximation is further applied to two entropy-related tasks: network
design and graph similarity measure, where novel graph similarity measure and
fast algorithms are proposed. Our experimental results on graphs of various
scales and types show that the very small entropy gap readily applies to a wide
range of graphs and weighted graphs. As an approximation of the von Neumann
graph entropy, the structural information is the only one that achieves both
high efficiency and high accuracy among the prominent methods. It is at least
two orders of magnitude faster than SLaQ with comparable accuracy. Our
structural information based methods also exhibit superior performance in two

photometric data obtained from high-$b$ regions and the Galactic plane follow
different probability distributions. To alleviate this dataset shift problem
for quasar candidate selection, we adopt a Transfer Learning Framework at both
data and algorithm levels. At the data level, to make a training set in which
dataset shift is modeled, we synthesize quasars and galaxies behind the
Galactic plane based on SDSS sources and Galactic dust map. At the algorithm
level, to reduce the effect of class imbalance, we transform the three-class
classification problem for stars, galaxies, and quasars to two binary
classification tasks. We apply XGBoost algorithm on Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) and
AllWISE photometry for classification, and additional cut on Gaia proper motion
to remove stellar contaminants. We obtain a reliable GPQ candidate catalog with
160,946 sources located at $|b|\leq 20^{\circ}$ in PS1-AllWISE footprint.
Photometric redshifts of GPQ candidates achieved with XGBoost regression
algorithm show that our selection method can identify quasars in a wide
redshift range ($0<z\lesssim5$). This study extends the systematic searches for
quasars to the dense stellar fields and shows the feasibility of using
astronomical knowledge to improve data mining under complex conditions in the
Big Data era.

entangled state. This approach leads to a simple relation $S = \ln N $ between
the average number $N$ of color-singlet dipoles in the proton wave function and
the entropy of the produced hadronic state $S$. At small $x$, the multiplicity
of dipoles is given by the gluon structure function, $N = x G(x,Q^2)$.
Recently, the H1 Collaboration analyzed the entropy of the produced hadronic
state in DIS, and studied its relation to the gluon structure function; poor
agreement with the predicted relation was found. In this letter we argue that a
more accurate account of the number of color-singlet dipoles in the kinematics
of H1 experiment (where hadrons are detected in the current fragmentation
region) is given not by $xG(x,Q^2)$ but by the sea quark structure function
$x\Sigma(x,Q^2)$. Sea quarks originate from the splitting of gluons, so at
small $x$ $x\Sigma(x,Q^2)\,\sim\, xG(x,Q^2)$, but in the current fragmentation
region this proportionality is distorted by the contribution of the
quark-antiquark pair produced by the virtual photon splitting. In addition, the
multiplicity of color-singlet dipoles in the current fragmentation region is
quite small, and one needs to include $\sim 1/N$ corrections to $S= \ln N$
asymptotic formula. Taking both of these modifications into account, we find
that the data from the H1 Collaboration in fact agree well with the prediction

described by developers. Although prior work has made important observations

characteristics of SATD in build systems. To do so, through a qualitative
analysis of 500 SATD comments in the Maven build system of 291 projects, we
characterize SATD by location and rationale (reason and purpose). Our results
show that limitations in tools and libraries, and complexities of dependency
management are the most frequent causes, accounting for 50% and 24% of the

fixed later. As a first step towards the automatic detection of SATD rationale,
we train classifiers to detect the two most frequently occurring reasons and
the four most frequently occurring purposes of SATD in the content of comments
in Maven build systems. The classifier performance is promising, achieving an
F1-score of 0.71-0.79. Finally, within 16 identified 'ready-to-be-addressed'

representative sample of present direct detection experiments assuming the
WIMP-nucleus scattering process to be driven by each one of the 44 effective
couplings that arise for $j_\chi\le$ 2. We find that a high value of the
multipolarity $s\le 2 j_\chi$ of the coupling, related to the power of the
momentum transfer $q$ appearing in the scattering amplitude, leads to a
suppression of the expected rates and pushes the expected differential spectra
to large recoil energies $E_R$. For $s\le$ 4 the effective scales probed by
direct detection experiments can be suppressed by up to 5 orders of magnitude
compared to the case of a standard spin-independent interaction. For operators
with large $s$ the expected differential spectra can be pushed to recoil
energies in the MeV range, with the largest part of the signal concentrated at
$E_R\gtrsim$ 100 keV and a peculiar structure of peaks and minima arising when
both the nuclear target and the WIMP are heavy. As a consequence the present
bounds on the effective operators can be significantly improved by extending
the recoil energy intervals to higher recoil energies. Our analysis assumes
effective interaction operators that are irreducible under the rotation group.
Such operators drive the interactions of high-multipole dark matter candidates,
i.e. states that possess only the highest multipole allowed by their spin. As a
consequence our analysis represents also the first phenomenological study of
the direct detection of quadrupolar, octupolar, and hexadecapolar dark matter.

buildings, transforming the buildings into electricity prosumers. Existing
studies have developed some advanced building side controls that enable
renewable energy sharing and that aim to optimise building-cluster-level
performance via regulating the energy storage charging/ discharging. However,
the flexible demand shifting ability of electric vehicles is not considered in
these building side controls. For instance, the electric vehicle charging will
usually start once they are plugged into charging stations. But, in such
charging period the renewable generation may be insufficient to cover the EV
charging load, leading to grid electricity imports. Consequently, the
building-cluster-level performance is not optimised. Therefore, this study
proposes a coordinated control of building prosumers for improving the
cluster-level performance, by making use of energy sharing and storage
capability of electricity batteries in both buildings and EVs. An EV
charging/discharging model is first developed. Then, based on the predicted
future 24h electricity demand and renewable generation data, the coordinated
control first considers the whole building cluster as one integrated building
and optimises its operation as well as the EV charging/discharging using
genetic algorithm. Next, the operation of individual buildings in the future
24h is coordinated using nonlinear programming. For validation, the developed
control has been tested on a real building cluster in Ludvika, Sweden. The

achieved state-of-the-art performance in various image restoration

the haze-free image of a haze one. This paper concentrates on the challenging
task of single image dehazing. Based on the atmospheric scattering model, a
novel model is designed to directly generate the haze-free image. The main
challenge of image dehazing is that the atmospheric scattering model has two
parameters, i.e., transmission map and atmospheric light. When they are
estimated respectively, the errors will be accumulated to compromise the
dehazing quality. Considering this reason and various image sizes, a novel

proposed for single image dehazing, which is input-size flexibility at both

combine the generator and adopt the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) to design the

components to create confusion and nonlinear properties in cryptography. To
strengthening a cipher against various attacks, including side channel attacks,
these boxes need to have numerous security properties. In this paper, a novel
method to generate s-boxes is introduced aimed at improving the resistance of
s-boxes against side channel attacks. Methods: In the preprocessing phase of
this approach, a suitable initial s-box which has some basic security
properties is generated by adopting a fast algorithm. Then, in the main stage,
using the initial s-box, we generate new s-boxes which not only have the
properties of the initial S-box but also have been significantly improved under
another set of security properties. To do this, new s-boxes are generated using
a genetic algorithm on a particular subset of the linear combination set of
coordinate functions of the initial s-box in the preprocessing stage. Results:
The performed experiments demonstrate that the values of all security
properties of these new s-boxes, especially the measures of transparency order,
signal-to-noise ratio, confusion coefficient, bijection property, fixed point,
and opposite fixed points, have been substantially improved. For example, our
experiments indicate that 70, 220, 2071, 43, and 406 s-boxes are found better
than the initial s-box, respectively, in the dimensions of 4x4 through 8x8
Conclusion: In this article, a new s-box construction method is introduced in
which the properties related to side channel attacks are improved, without
reducing other security properties. Besides, some results obtained from
generated s-boxes in the dimensions of 4x4 through 8x8 demonstrated that the
generated s-boxes are not only improved relative to the initial s-box, but in
some cases, considerably better than some well-known s-boxes.

primate visual system, a key distinction is their dynamics. Deep nets typically
operate in serial stages wherein each layer completes its computation before
processing begins in subsequent layers. In contrast, biological systems have
cascaded dynamics: information propagates from neurons at all layers in
parallel but transmission occurs gradually over time, leading to speed-accuracy
trade offs even in feedforward architectures. We explore the consequences of
biologically inspired parallel hardware by constructing cascaded ResNets in
which each residual block has propagation delays but all blocks update in
parallel in a stateful manner. Because information transmitted through skip
connections avoids delays, the functional depth of the architecture increases
over time, yielding anytime predictions that improve with internal-processing
time. We introduce a temporal-difference training loss that achieves a strictly
superior speed-accuracy profile over standard losses and enables the cascaded
architecture to outperform state-of-the-art anytime-prediction methods. The
cascaded architecture has intriguing properties, including: it classifies
typical instances more rapidly than atypical instances; it is more robust to
both persistent and transient noise than is a conventional ResNet; and its
time-varying output trace provides a signal that can be exploited to improve
information processing and inference.

leading to new ideas for securing voice transmission. This paper refers to a
relatively new concept of sending encrypted speech as pseudo-speech in the
audio domain over digital voice communication infrastructures, like 3G cellular
network and VoIP.
  This work presents a novel distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for
secure voice communications over voice channels that combines the robustness of
analog speech scrambling and elevated security offered by digital ciphers like
AES-CTR. The system scrambles vocal parameters of a speech signal (loudness,
pitch, timbre) using distance-preserving pseudo-random translations and
rotations on a hypersphere of parameters. Next, scrambled parameters are
encoded to a pseudo-speech signal adapted to transmission over digital voice
channels equipped with voice activity detection. Upon reception of this
pseudo-speech signal, the legitimate receiver restores distorted copies of the
initial vocal parameters. Despite some deciphering errors, an integrated
neural-based vocoder based on the LPCNet architecture reconstructs an
intelligible speech.
  The experimental implementation of this speech encryption scheme has been
tested by simulations and sending an encrypted signal over FaceTime between two
iPhones 6 connected to the same WiFi network. Moreover, speech excerpts
restored from encrypted signals were evaluated by a speech quality assessment
on a group of about 40 participants. The experiments demonstrated that the
proposed scheme produces intelligible speech with a gracefully progressive
quality degradation depending on the channel noise. Finally, the preliminary
computational analysis suggested that the presented setting may operate on
high-end portable devices in nearly real-time.

to show the uniformity of the array. We obtained an energy resolutions between

frequencies ranging from 1 to 5 MHz, with a frequency domain multiplexing (FDM)

readout across several pixels has also been performed to evaluate the impact of
the thermal crosstalk to the instrument's energy resolution budget requirement.
This value results in a derived requirement, for the first neighbour, that is
less than 1$\times$10$^{-3}$ when considering the ratio between the amplitude

nonthermal energy in flare-accelerated electrons, and magnetic free energy
before flares. It is found that the energy components increase systematically
with the flare class, indicating that more energies are involved in larger
flares. The magnetic free energies are larger than the nonthermal energies and
radiative outputs of flares, which is consistent with the magnetic nature of
flares. The ratio $\frac{E_{nth}}{E_{mag}}$ of the four flares, being
0.70$-$0.76, is considerably higher than that of eruptive flares. Hence, this
ratio may serve as an important factor that discriminates confined and eruptive
flares. The nonthermal energies are sufficient to provide the heating
requirements including the peak thermal energy and radiative loss. Our findings
impose constraint on theoretical models of confined CRFs and have potential

  Concretely, a ($C$, $D$) strong-diameter network decomposition is a
partitioning of the nodes of the graph into disjoint clusters, colored with $C$
colors, such that neighboring clusters have different colors and the subgraph

can transform their algorithm to a strong-diameter network decomposition
algorithm with similar parameters. However, that comes at the expense of
requiring unbounded messages. The key remaining qualitative question in the
study of network decompositions was whether one can achieve a similar result

default limits on the stack space which are much lower than the available
memory. If a program runs out of stack space, they get the dreaded ""Stack
Overflow"" exception -- they crash. As a result, OCaml programmers have to be
careful, when they write recursive functions, to remain in the so-called
_tail-recursive_ fragment, using _tail_ calls that do not consume stack space.
  This discipline is a source of difficulties for both beginners and experts.
Beginners have to be taught recursion, and then tail-recursion. Experts
disagree on the ""right"" way to write `List.map`. The direct version is
beautiful but not tail-recursive, so it crashes on larger inputs. The naive
tail-recursive transformation is (slightly) slower than the direct version, and
experts may want to avoid that cost. Some libraries propose horrible
implementations, unrolling code by hand, to compensate for this performance
loss. In general, tail-recursion requires the programmer to manually perform
sophisticated program transformations.
  In this work we propose an implementation of ""Tail Modulo Cons"" (TMC) for
OCaml. TMC is a program transformation for a fragment of non-tail-recursive
functions, that rewrites them in _destination-passing style_. The supported
fragment is smaller than other approaches such as continuation-passing-style,
but the performance of the transformed code is on par with the direct,
non-tail-recursive version. Many useful functions that traverse a recursive
datastructure and rebuild another recursive structure are in the TMC fragment,
in particular `List.map` (and `List.filter`, `List.append`, etc.). Finally
those functions can be written in a way that is beautiful, correct on all

phenomena. It has been found only in the past decade that non-Hermiticity
enables unprecedented effects such as exceptional points, spectral
singularities and bulk Fermi arcs. Recent studies further show that
non-Hermiticity can fundamentally change the topological band theory, leading
to the non-Hermitian band topology and non-Hermitian skin effect, as confirmed
in one-dimensional (1D) systems. However, in higher dimensions, these
non-Hermitian effects remain unexplored in experiments. Here, we demonstrate
the spin-polarized, higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect in two-dimensional
(2D) acoustic metamaterials. Using a lattice of coupled whisper-gallery
acoustic resonators, we realize a spinful 2D higher-order topological insulator
(HOTI) where the spin-up and spin-down states are emulated by the
anti-clockwise and clockwise modes, respectively. We find that the
non-Hermiticity drives wave localizations toward opposite edge boundaries
depending on the spin polarizations. More interestingly, for finite systems
with both edge and corner boundaries, the higher-order non-Hermitian skin
effect leads to wave localizations toward two corner boundaries for the bulk,
edge and corner states in a spin-dependent manner. We further show that such a
non-Hermitian skin effect enables rich wave manipulation through the loss
configuration in each unit-cell. The reported spin-dependent, higher-order
non-Hermitian skin effect reveals the interplay between higher-order topology
and non-Hermiticity, which is further enriched by the spin degrees of freedom.
This unveils a new horizon in the study of non-Hermitian physics and the design
of non-Hermitian metamaterials.

families experienced the usually inaudible sounds of near-Earth space in an
immersive and accessible way. We apply two analysis techniques to the captured
before and after data - quantitative linguistics and thematic analysis. These
analyses reveal significant changes in participants' responses after the
activity compared to before, namely an increased diversity in language used to
describe space and altered conceptions of what space is like. The results
demonstrate that the soundscape was surprisingly effective at innately
communicating key aspects of the underlying science simply through the act of
listening. The impacts also highlight the power of sonification in stimulating
public engagement, which, through reflection, can lead to altered associations,
perceptions, and understanding. Therefore, we show that this novel approach to
drop-in activity evaluation, using graffiti walls both before and after the
activity and applying rigorous analysis to this data, has the power to capture
change and, thus, have a short-term impact. We suggest that commonly used
evaluation tools suitable for drop-in activities, such as graffiti walls,
should be integrated both before and after the main activity in general, rather

  for the increased wave-induced drift of floating marine litter","Accepted and In press, Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Periodic water waves generate Stokes drift as manifest from the orbits of
Lagrangian particles not fully closing. Stokes drift can contribute to the
transport of floating marine litter, including plastic. Previously, marine
litter objects have been considered to be perfect Lagrangian tracers,
travelling with the Stokes drift of the waves. However, floating marine litter
objects have large ranges of sizes and densities, which potentially result in
different rates of transport by waves due to the non-Lagrangian behaviour of
the objects. Through a combination of theory and experiments for idealised
spherical objects in deep-water waves, we show that different objects are
transported at different rates depending on their size and density, and that
larger buoyant objects can have increased drift compared with Lagrangian
tracers. We show that the mechanism for the increased drift observed in our
experiments comprises the variable submergence and the corresponding dynamic
buoyancy force components in a direction perpendicular to the local water
surface. This leads to an amplification of the drift of these objects compared
to the Stokes drift when averaged over the wave cycle. Using an expansion in
wave steepness, we derive a closed-form approximation for this increased drift,
which can be included in ocean-scale models of marine litter transport.

  Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR'20)",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Executing a Golog program on an actual robot typically requires additional
steps to account for hardware or software details of the robot platform, which
can be formulated as constraints on the program. Such constraints are often
temporal, refer to metric time, and require modifications to the abstract Golog
program. We describe how to formulate such constraints based on a modal variant
of the Situation Calculus. These constraints connect the abstract program with
the platform models, which we describe using timed automata. We show that for
programs over finite domains and with fully known initial state, the problem of
synthesizing a controller that satisfies the constraints while preserving the
effects of the original program can be reduced to MTL synthesis. We do this by
constructing a timed automaton from the abstract program and synthesizing an
MTL controller from this automaton, the platform models, and the constraints.
We prove that the synthesized controller results in execution traces which are
the same as those of the original program, possibly interleaved with
platform-dependent actions, that they satisfy all constraints, and that they
have the same effects as the traces of the original program. By doing so, we
obtain a decidable procedure to synthesize a controller that satisfies the
specification while preserving the original program.

barrier in high-power semiconductor devices, owing to its ability to suppress
the diffusion of copper from the metallisation scheme into the surrounding
silicon substructure. However, little is known about the response of TiW to
high temperature events or its behaviour when exposed to air. Here, a combined
soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterisation approach
is used to study the influence of post-deposition annealing and titanium
concentration on the oxidation behaviour of a 300~nm-thick TiW film. The
combination of both XPS techniques allows for the assessment of the chemical
state and elemental composition across the surface and bulk of the TiW layer.
The findings show that in response to high-temperature annealing, titanium
segregates out of the mixed metal system and upwardly migrates, accumulating at
the TiW/air interface. Titanium shows remarkably rapid diffusion under
relatively short annealing timescales and the extent of titanium surface
enrichment is increased through longer annealing periods or by increasing the
precursor titanium concentration. Surface titanium enrichment enhances the
extent of oxidation both at the surface and in the bulk of the alloy due to the
strong gettering ability of titanium. Quantification of the soft X-ray
photoelectron spectra highlights the formation of three tungsten oxidation
environments, attributed to WO$_2$, WO$_3$ and a WO$_3$ oxide coordinated with
a titanium environment. This combinatorial characterisation approach provides
valuable insights into the thermal and oxidation stability of TiW alloys from
two depth perspectives, aiding the development of future device technologies.

most especially in virtual reality systems, the number and potential of
networked virtual environments or NVEs and their users are increasing. NVEs aim
to give distributed users a feeling of immersion in a virtual world and the
possibility of interacting with other users or with virtual objects inside it,
like when they interact in the real world. Being able to provide that feeling
and natural interactions when the users are geographically separated is one of
the goals of these systems. Nevertheless, this goal is especially sensitive to
different issues, such as different connections with heterogeneous throughput
or different network latencies, which can lead to consistency and
synchronization problems and, thus, to a worsening of the users' quality of
experience or QoE. With the purpose of solving these issues, researchers have
proposed and evaluated numerous technical solutions, in fields like network
architectures, data distribution and filtering, resource balancing, computing
models, predictive modeling and synchronization in NVEs. This paper gathers and
classifies them, summarizing their advantages and disadvantages, using a new
way of classification. With the current increase of the number of NVEs and the
multiple solutions proposed so far, this work aims to become a useful tool and
a starting point not only for future researchers in this field but also for
those who are new in NVEs development, in which guaranteeing a good users' QoE

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accuracy and generalization of dynamics models is key to the success of
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). As the complexity of tasks
increases, so does the sample inefficiency of learning accurate dynamics
models. However, many complex tasks also exhibit sparsity in the dynamics,
i.e., actions have only a local effect on the system dynamics. In this paper,
we exploit this property with a causal invariance perspective in the
single-task setting, introducing a new type of state abstraction called
\textit{model-invariance}. Unlike previous forms of state abstractions, a
model-invariance state abstraction leverages causal sparsity over state
variables. This allows for compositional generalization to unseen states,
something that non-factored forms of state abstractions cannot do. We prove
that an optimal policy can be learned over this model-invariance state
abstraction and show improved generalization in a simple toy domain. Next, we
propose a practical method to approximately learn a model-invariant
representation for complex domains and validate our approach by showing
improved modelling performance over standard maximum likelihood approaches on
challenging tasks, such as the MuJoCo-based Humanoid. Finally, within the MBRL
setting we show strong performance gains with respect to sample efficiency
across a host of other continuous control tasks.

placed on a graph, have one out of two types and, based on the predominant type
in their neighborhood, decide whether to changes their types; similar to a new
agent arriving as soon as another agent leaves the vertex.
  We investigate the probability that an edge $\{u,v\}$ is monochrome, i.e.,
that both vertices $u$ and $v$ have the same type in the FSP, and we provide a
general framework for analyzing the influence of the underlying graph topology
on residential segregation. In particular, for two adjacent vertices, we show
that a highly decisive common neighborhood, i.e., a common neighborhood where
the absolute value of the difference between the number of vertices with
different types is high, supports segregation and moreover, that large common
neighborhoods are more decisive.
  As an application, we study the expected behavior of the FSP on two common
random graph models with and without geometry: (1) For random geometric graphs,
we show that the existence of an edge $\{u,v\}$ makes a highly decisive common
neighborhood for $u$ and $v$ more likely. Based on this, we prove the existence
of a constant $c > 0$ such that the expected fraction of monochrome edges after
the FSP is at least $1/2 + c$. (2) For Erd\""os-R\'enyi graphs we show that
large common neighborhoods are unlikely and that the expected fraction of
monochrome edges after the FSP is at most $1/2 + o(1)$. Our results indicate
that the cluster structure of the underlying graph has a significant impact on
the obtained segregation strength.

related to the assumption on noise characteristics, which makes it more

cyclic adversarial learning with self-supervised residual learning. Unlike the

  Our aim was to test whether the thermal cosmic-ray and UV-driven chemistry is

formation of CO+ We searched for CO+ absorption with the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA) toward two quasars with known Galactic foreground
absorption from diffuse interstellar gas, J1717-3342 and J1744-3116, targeting
the two strongest hyperfine components of the J=2-1 transition near 236 GHz. We

The derived upper limits on the CO+ column densities represent about 4% of the
HCO+ column densities. The corresponding upper limit on the CO+ abundance
relative to H2 is <1.2 x 10^{-10}.
  The non-detection of CO+ confirms that HCO+ is mainly produced in the
reaction between oxygen and carbon hydrides, CH2+ or CH3+ , induced by
suprathermal processes, while CO+ and HOC+ result from reactions of C+ with OH
and H2O. The densities required to form CO molecules at low extinction are
consistent with this scheme.

probabilities (or sticking coefficients) have been found close to unity for
most gases. Here we report a strong decrease of the sticking coefficients of
H2O and CO2 on substrates more akin to cosmic dust, such as submicrometer-sized
particles of carbon and olivine, bare or covered with ice. This effect results
from the local curvature of the grains, and then extends to larger grains made
of aggregated small particles, such as fluffy or porous dust in more evolved
media (e.g. circumstellar disks). The main astrophysical implication is that
accretion rates of gases are reduced accordingly, slowing the growth of cosmic
ices. Furthermore, volatile species that are not adsorbed on a grain at their
freeze-out temperature will pertain in the gas phase, which will impact gas-ice
partitions. We also found that thermal desorption of H2O is not modified by
grains size, and thus the snowlines temperature should be independent on the

it achieves the minimax optimal regret bound of $O\big((\lambda K)^{1/3}T^{2/3}

In the stochastically constrained adversarial regime, which includes the
stochastic regime as a special case, it achieves a regret bound of
$O\left(\big((\lambda K)^{2/3} T^{1/3} + \ln T\big)\sum_{i \neq i^*}

a unique optimal arm. In the special case of $\lambda = 0$ (no switching

quasi-integrable systems is proved by assuming a non-resonance condition on the
frequencies, such as the standard Diophantine condition or the milder Bryuno
condition. In the presence of dissipation, most of the quasi-periodic solutions
disappear and one expects, at most, only a few of them to survive together with
the periodic attractors. However, to prove that a quasi-periodic solution
really exists, usually one assumes that the frequencies still satisfy a
Diophantine condition and, furthermore, that some external parameters of the
system are suitably tuned with them. In this paper we consider a class of
systems on the one-dimensional torus, subject to a periodic perturbation and in
the presence of dissipation, and show that, however small the dissipation, if
the perturbation is a trigonometric polynomial in the angles and the
unperturbed frequencies satisfy a non-resonance condition of finite order,
depending on the size of the dissipation, then a quasi-periodic solution exists
with slightly perturbed frequencies provided the size of the perturbation is
small enough. If on the one hand the maximal size of the perturbation is not
uniform in the degree of the trigonometric polynomial, on the other hand all
but finitely many frequencies are allowed and there is no restriction arising
from the tuning of the external parameters. A physically relevant case, where
the result applies, is the spin-orbit model, which describes the rotation of a
satellite around its own axis, while revolving on a Keplerian orbit around a
planet, in the case in which the dissipation is taken into account through the
MacDonald torque.

communication system is expected to achieve enormous transmission rate,
provided that the transmit and receive beams are properly aligned with the MIMO
channel. However, existing beam alignment techniques rely on either channel
estimation or beam sweeping, which incur prohibitively high training overhead,
especially for future wireless systems with further increased antenna
dimensions and more stringent requirement on cost-effective hardware

is environment-aware and training-free, by utilizing the emerging concept of
channel knowledge map (CKM), together with the user location information that
is readily available in contemporary wireless systems. CKM is a site-specific
database, tagged with the transmitter/receiver locations, which contains useful
channel information to facilitate or even obviate real-time channel state
information (CSI) acquistion. Two instances of CKM are proposed for beam
alignment in mmWave massive MIMO systems, namely channel path map (CPM) and
beam index map (BIM). It is shown that compared with existing training-based
beam alignment schemes, the proposed CKM-enabled environment-aware beam
alignment is able to drastically improve the effective communication rate, even
with moderate user location errors, thanks to its significant saving of the
prohibitive training overhead.

and cannot be described by one single rotation axis only. Simulations with

because Br$^._\text{S}$ defects on the $4d$ sites cause the transfer of one or

carry out intercage jumps via interstitial and interstitialcy mechanisms. With
that, one single Br$^._\text{S}$ defect enables Li diffusion over an extended
spatial area explaining why low degrees of site-exchange are sufficient to
trigger superionic conduction. The vacant sites of the Frenkel pairs, namely
V$'_\text{Li}$, are mostly immobile and bound to the Br$^._\text{S}$ defect. To

required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used
when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD
with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the
dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been
properly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a
method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the
first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns
energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain
regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence.
By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy
age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of
AD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local
minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy
landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better

Therefore, assets are an investment that requires continuous management.
Identifying assets is the first step for their effective management. However,
there is a lack of awareness of what assets and types of assets are common in

their state of quality and how they degrade over time have not been
well-understood. Method: We perform a systematic literature review and a field

Results: We create the first comprehensive, structured, yet extendable taxonomy

information-theoretically tight characterization of the optimal rate of

the Network Singleton Bound (which requires a zero-error recovery criteria) in
a certain parameter regime where the capacity had been heretofore open. As a
direct corollary we also obtain the capacity of the corresponding problem where
information-theoretic secrecy against eavesdropping is required in addition to

gerrymandering problem in graph theoretic setting as proposed by Cohen-Zemach
et al. [AAMAS 2018]. Our contributions in this article are two-fold, conceptual
and computational. We first resolve the open question posed by Ito et al.
[AAMAS 2019] about the computational complexity of the problem when the input
graph is a path. Next, we propose a generalization of their model, where the
input consists of a graph on $n$ vertices representing the set of voters, a set
of $m$ candidates $\mathcal{C}$, a weight function $w_v: \mathcal{C}\rightarrow
{\mathbb Z}^+$ for each voter $v\in V(G)$ representing the preference of the
voter over the candidates, a distinguished candidate $p\in \mathcal{C}$, and a
positive integer $k$. The objective is to decide if one can partition the
vertex set into $k$ pairwise disjoint connected sets (districts) s.t $p$ wins
more districts than any other candidate. The problem is known to be NPC even if
$k=2$, $m=2$, and $G$ is either a complete bipartite graph (in fact $K_{2,n}$)
or a complete graph. This means that in search for FPT algorithms we need to
either focus on the parameter $n$, or subclasses of forest. Circumventing these
intractable results, we give a deterministic and a randomized algorithms for
the problem on paths running in times $2.619^{k}(n+m)^{O(1)}$ and
$2^{k}(n+m)^{O(1)}$, respectively. Additionally, we prove that the problem on
general graphs is solvable in time $2^n (n+m)^{O(1)}$. Our algorithmic results
use sophisticated technical tools such as representative set family and Fast
Fourier transform based polynomial multiplication, and their (possibly first)
application to problems arising in social choice theory and/or game theory may
be of independent interest to the community.

with adequate accuracy. Calibrating does not require any tools; but, tools to
make calibration easier have been developed. Theoretical consideration shows
that the use of certain tools enables one to introduce a type of calibration
error that goes undetected by the calibration software. In this study, the
existence of such errors is experimentally confirmed and their magnitude is
estimated. It is demonstrated to be crucial that the DistoX is calibrated and
that the calibration is valid, that is, that the device has not changed since
it was last calibrated. No part of the DistoX must have moved or changed its
magnetization since calibration, not even the battery. The calibration method
used and the quality of the resulting calibration are important too. It is
highly recommended that the DistoX be checked immediately before surveying a
cave and thus avoid the possibility of using an uncalibrated, not validly
calibrated, or poorly calibrated device. To complete the check, a few survey
shots are measured multiple times with the device at different roll angles, and
the back shot of one of the shots is measured. If the device is properly
calibrated, the measurements will agree with each other within the acceptable
measurement error. This is not the case for a device that is not properly
calibrated.

understanding of astrophysical transients, only made possible by increasingly
powerful machine learning-based filtering to accurately sift through the vast

real-bogus classifier based on a Bayesian convolutional neural network that
provides nuanced, uncertainty-aware classification of transient candidates in
difference imaging, and demonstrate its application to the datastream from the
GOTO wide-field optical survey. Not only are candidates assigned a
well-calibrated probability of being real, but also an associated confidence
that can be used to prioritise human vetting efforts and inform future model
optimisation via active learning. To fully realise the potential of this
architecture, we present a fully-automated training set generation method which
requires no human labelling, incorporating a novel data-driven augmentation
method to significantly improve the recovery of faint and nuclear transient
sources. We achieve competitive classification accuracy (FPR and FNR both below
1%) compared against classifiers trained with fully human-labelled datasets,
whilst being significantly quicker and less labour-intensive to build. This
data-driven approach is uniquely scalable to the upcoming challenges and data
needs of next-generation transient surveys. We make our data generation and

stochastic gradient} (VCSG), to improve the performance of the stochastic
variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. To avoid over-reducing the variance
of gradient by SVRG, a hyper-parameter $\lambda$ is introduced in VCSG that is
able to control the reduced variance of SVRG. Theory shows that the
optimization method can converge by using an unbiased gradient estimator, but
in practice, biased gradient estimation can allow more efficient convergence to
the vicinity since an unbiased approach is computationally more expensive.
$\lambda$ also has the effect of balancing the trade-off between unbiased and
biased estimations. Secondly, to minimize the number of full gradient
calculations in SVRG, a variance-bounded batch is introduced to reduce the
number of gradient calculations required in each iteration. For smooth
non-convex functions, the proposed algorithm converges to an approximate
first-order stationary point (i.e.
$\mathbb{E}\|\nabla{f}(x)\|^{2}\leq\epsilon$) within
$\mathcal{O}(min\{1/\epsilon^{3/2},n^{1/4}/\epsilon\})$ number of stochastic
gradient evaluations, which improves the leading gradient complexity of
stochastic gradient-based method SCS
$(\mathcal{O}(min\{1/\epsilon^{5/3},n^{2/3}/\epsilon\})$. It is shown
theoretically and experimentally that VCSG can be deployed to improve
convergence.

matrix of a random walk, we further train the network with self-supervision on
its neural eigenspace to impose consistency on predictions between related

some full-label supervised ones and works well when scribbles are randomly

alternative approach to the QGT based on eigenprojectors and (generalized)
Bloch vectors is exposed. It offers more analytical insight than the eigenstate
approach. In particular, the full QGT of each band can be obtained without

the virus to travel from meters up to hundred meters from the source location.
The secondary finding shows viruses released into the atmosphere from entry and
exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial distance of < 50m.
This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the infection
rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at
various door locations for UCH, depending on which door is used there can be a
higher concentration of COVID-19. Although our results are based on London,

major axis of the galaxies, allowing us to obtain radial profiles of the
gas-phase oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)). The slope of a linear fit to these
radial profiles is defined as the metallicity gradient. We investigated
correlations between these gradients and global galaxy properties, such as star
formation activity and gas content. In addition, we examined the correlation of
local metallicity measurements and the global HI mass fraction. Results. We
obtained two main results: (i) the local metallicity is correlated with the
global HI mass fraction, which is in good agreement with previous results. A
simple toy model suggests that this correlation points towards a 'local gas
regulator model'; (ii) the primary driver of metallicity gradients appears to
be stellar mass surface density (as a proxy for morphology). Conclusions. This
work comprises one of the few systematic observational studies of the influence
of the cold gas on the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, as
considered via metallicity gradients and local measurements of the gas-phase

approximately optimal shapes of (exact) size $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$ to a

which involves a new integrand, namely the one conjectured by Bouchitt\'e in
2001 and predicted heuristically before in works of Allaire & Kohn and Kohn &
Strang from the 1980s and 1990s. This integrand gives the energy of the limit
generalized shape understood as a fine oscillation of (optimal)

in the original compliance is just a quadratic form and the non-convexity of
the problem is not immediately obvious. In fact, it is the interaction of the

divergence-constraint) that gives rise to this new integrand. We also present
connections to the theory of Michell trusses, first formulated in 1904, and

indeed convergence in the training of ANNs, until today there is no rigorous
theoretical analysis which proves (or disproves) this conjecture. In
particular, even in the case of the most basic variant of gradient descent
optimization algorithms, the plain vanilla gradient descent method, it remains
an open problem to prove or disprove the conjecture that gradient descent
converges in the training of ANNs. In this article we solve this problem in the
special situation where the target function under consideration is a constant

in the training of rectified fully-connected feedforward ANNs with one-hidden

converge to zero. Our mathematical analysis strongly exploits the property that
the rectifier function is the activation function used in the considered ANNs.
A key contribution of this work is to explicitly specify a Lyapunov function

studies demonstrated the existence of two types of periodic lattice distortions
above and below the triclinic phase transition, suggesting the existence of an
unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) order. The suppression of CDW order

investigate collective dynamics in BaNi$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We demonstrate the
existence of several CDW amplitude modes. Their smooth evolution through the
structural phase transition implies the commensurate CDW order in the triclinic

an unconventional origin of the underlying electronic instability.

maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of the multicast service.
Additionally, we explore the combination of spatial multiplexing with
orthogonal (time/frequency) multiple access. By varying the number of antennas
at the base station (BS) and users' spatial distribution, we also provide the
optimal subgroup configuration that maximizes the spectral efficiency per

networks, to match the demand for increased capacity and the challenges that
communications in the higher portion of the spectrum (i.e., the mmWave band)
introduce. Ultra-dense networks, however, require pervasive, high-capacity
backhaul solutions, and deploying fiber optic to all base stations is generally
considered to be too expensive for network operators. The 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has thus introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul
(IAB), a wireless backhaul solution in which the access and backhaul links
share the same hardware, protocol stack, and also spectrum. The multiplexing of
different links in the same frequency bands, however, introduces interference

expertise in the domain of usability and human-machine interaction and/or in
the domain of dementia and neuropsychological assessment. Participants
identified usability issues in all components of the DemSelf prototype. For
example, confirmation of answers was not consistent across subtests. Answers
were sometimes logged directly when a button is tapped and cannot be corrected.
This can lead to frustration and bias in test results, especially for people
with vision or motor impairments. The direct adoption of time limits from the
original paper-based instrument or the simultaneous verbal and textual item

Qmci and needs to be re-validated. Visual recognition instead of a free verbal

important confounding variable. Participants would generally prefer if the test
is conducted in a medical office rather than at a patient's home so that
someone is present for support and the result can be discussed directly.

that the solvent, whose affinity to the polymer is similar to that to the

kink perturbations. The inclusion of magnetic field may lead to the
stabilisation of the jets. Jets and complex magnetic fields are ubiquitous in
the solar atmosphere, which suggests the possibility of the kink instability in
certain cases. The aim of the paper is to study the kink instability of
triangular jets sandwiched between magnetic tubes/slabs and its possible
connection to observed properties of the jets in the solar atmosphere. A
dispersion equation governing the kink perturbations is obtained through
matching of analytical solutions at the jet boundaries. The equation is solved
analytically and numerically for different parameters of jets and surrounding
plasma. The analytical solution is accompanied by a numerical simulation of
fully nonlinear MHD equations for a particular situation of solar type II
spicules. MHD triangular jets are unstable to the dynamic kink instability
depending on the Alfven Mach number (the ratio of flow to Alfven speeds) and
the ratio of internal and external densities. When the jet has the same density
as the surrounding plasma, then only super Alfvenic flows are unstable.
However, denser jets are unstable also in sub Alfvenic regime. Jets with an
angle to the ambient magnetic field have much lower thresholds of instability
than field-aligned flows. Growth times of the kink instability are estimated as
6-15 min for type I spicules and 5-60 s for type II spicules matching with
their observed life times. Numerical simulation of full nonlinear equations
shows that the transverse kink pulse locally destroys the jet in less than a
minute in the conditions of type II spicules. Dynamic kink instability may lead
to full breakdown of MHD flows and consequently to observed disappearance of
spicules in the solar atmosphere.

magnitude (EF) are commonly used to estimate the affected tissue surrounding
the active contact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads. Previous studies have
found that DBS starts to noticeably activate axons at approximately 0.2 V/mm,
corresponding to activation of 3.4 $\mu$m axons in simulations of individual
axon triggering. Most axons in the brain are considerably smaller however, and
the effect of the electric field is thus expected to be stronger with
increasing EF as more and more axons become activated.
  Objective: To estimate the fraction of activated axons as a function of
electric field magnitude.
  Methods: The EF thresholds required for axon stimulation of myelinated axon
diameters between 1 and 5 $\mu$m were obtained from a combined cable and
Hodgkin-Huxley model in a FEM-simulated electric field from a Medtronic 3389
lead. These thresholds were compared with the average axon diameter
distribution from literature from several structures in the human brain to
obtain an estimate of the fraction of axons activated at EF levels between 0.1
and 1.8 V/mm.
  Results: The effect of DBS is estimated to be 41$\cdot$EF - 7.4 % starting at
a threshold level EFt0 = 0.18 V/mm.
  Conclusion: The fraction of activated axons from DBS in a voxel is estimated
to increase linearly with EF above the threshold level of 0.18 V/mm. This means
linear regression between EF above 0.18 V/mm and clinical outcome is a suitable
statistical method when doing improvement maps for DBS.

deserving funding. Peer review has limitations, including bias against risky
proposals or interdisciplinary research. The inter-rater reliability between

Funding agencies are also increasingly acknowledging the role of chance. The
Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) introduced a lottery for proposals in
the middle group of good but not excellent proposals. In this article, we
introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model for the evaluation process. To rank the
proposals, we estimate their expected ranks (ER), which incorporates both the
magnitude and uncertainty of the estimated differences between proposals. A
provisional funding line is defined based on ER and budget. The ER and its
credible interval are used to identify proposals with similar quality and
credible intervals that overlap with the funding line. These proposals are
entered into a lottery. We illustrate the approach for two SNSF grant schemes
in career and project funding. We argue that the method could reduce bias in
the evaluation process. R code, data and other materials for this article are

critical step for the correct personalization of patient-specific cardiac
models. In healthy conditions, the Purkinje network is the main source of the
electrical activation, but under pathological conditions the so-called earliest
activation sites (EASs) are possibly sparser and more localized. Yet, their
number, location and timing may not be easily inferred from remote recordings,
such as the epicardial activation or the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), due
to the underlying complexity of the model. In this work, we introduce GEASI
(Geodesic-based Earliest Activation Sites Identification) as a novel approach
to simultaneously identify all EASs. To this end, we start from the anisotropic
eikonal equation modeling cardiac electrical activation and exploit its
Hamilton--Jacobi formulation to minimize a given objective function, e.g. the
quadratic mismatch to given activation measurements. This versatile approach
can be extended to estimate the number of activation sites by means of the
topological gradient, or fitting a given ECG. We conducted various experiments
in 2D and 3D for in-silico models and an in-vivo intracardiac recording
collected from a patient undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy. The
results demonstrate the clinical applicability of GEASI for potential future
personalized models and clinical intervention.

Results. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 91.7 % compared to

the factors and metrics that practitioners currently consider when selecting
OSS. We also investigate the source of information and portals that can be used
to assess the factors, as well as the possibility to automatically extract such
information with APIs. [Method] We elicited the factors and the metrics adopted
to assess and compare OSS performing a survey among 23 experienced developers
who often integrate OSS in the software they develop. Moreover, we investigated
the APIs of the portals adopted to assess OSS extracting information for the

to separate and generate clean speech from a mixed audio containing speech from
different speakers. Empowered by the deep learning technologies over
sequence-to-sequence domain, recent neural speech separation models are now
capable of generating highly clean speech audios. To make these models more
practical by reducing the model size and inference time while maintaining high
separation quality, we propose a new transformer-based speech separation
approach, called TransMask. By fully un-leashing the power of self-attention on
long-term dependency exception, we demonstrate the size of TransMask is more
than 60% smaller and the inference is more than 2 times faster than
state-of-the-art solutions. TransMask fully utilizes the parallelism during
inference, and achieves nearly linear inference time within reasonable input
audio lengths. It also outperforms existing solutions on output speech audio
quality, achieving SDR above 16 over Librimix benchmark.

to optimize the cost of computation. The major ingredient that a computer needs
is the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of
the thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research.
It started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that
the computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information
(here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's
constant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the
necessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the
complicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern
computers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the
connection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with
computation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the
field of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs
while transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in
this article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of
computation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which
simulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient
parts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have
reviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction. We have
also discussed about the alternative computation models that have been proposed
with thermodynamically cost-efficient.

Hinode/EIS observations. Compared to the pre-flare elemental abundances, we
observed a strong increase in coronal abundance of Ca XIV 193.84 {\AA}, an
emission line with low first ionisation potential (FIP < 10 eV), as quantified
by the ratio Ca/Ar during the flare. This is in contrast to the unchanged
abundance ratio observed using Si X 258.38 {\AA}/S X 264.23 {\AA}. We propose
two different mechanisms to explain the different composition results. Firstly,
the small flare-induced heating could have ionised S, but not the noble gas Ar,
so that the flare-driven Alfv\'en waves brought up Si, S and Ca in tandem via
the ponderomotive force which acts on ions. Secondly, the location of the flare
in strong magnetic fields between two sunspots may suggest fractionation
occurred in the low chromosphere, where the background gas is neutral H. In
this region, high-FIP S could behave more like a low-FIP than a high-FIP
element. The physical interpretations proposed generate new insights into the
evolution of plasma abundances in the solar atmosphere during flaring, and
suggests that current models must be updated to reflect dynamic rather than
just static scenarios.

activity of the non-bonding lone electron pair (LEP) of Sb. The strong cation
LEP leads to the formation of layers piled up along the a-axis and linked by
weak Sb-O electrostatic interactions. In fact, Sb is 4-fold coordination with O
similar to what occurs with the P-O coordination, despite the large difference
of ionic radii and electronegativity between both elements. Here we report a
joint experimental and theoretical study of the structural and vibrational
properties of SbPO4 at high pressure. We show that SbPO4 is not only one of the
most compressible phosphates but also one of the most compressible compounds of
the ABO4 family. Moreover, it has a considerable anisotropic compression
behavior with the largest compression occurring along a direction close to
a-axis and governed by the compression of the LEP and the weak inter-layer Sb-O
bonds. The strong compression along the a-axis leads to a subtle modification
of the monoclinic crystal structure above 3 GPa leading from a 2D to a 3D
material. Moreover, the onset of a reversible pressure-induced phase transition
is observed above 9 GPa, which is completed above 20 GPa. We propose that the
high-pressure phase is a triclinic distortion of the original monoclinic phase.
The understanding of the compression mechanism of SbPO4 can aid in
understanding the importance of the ion intercalation and catalytic properties
of this layered compound.

DNA and graphene models, by applying methods of nonlinear dynamics. Using
symplectic integration techniques, we present an extensive analysis of chaos in
the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model of DNA. The chaoticity is quantified by
the maximum Lyapunov exponent (mLE) across a spectrum of temperatures, and the
effect of base pair (BP) disorder on the dynamics is studied. In addition to
heterogeneity due to the ratio of adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine
(GC) BPs, the distribution of BPs in the sequence is analysed by introducing
the alternation index $\alpha$. An exact probability distribution for BP
arrangements and $\alpha$ is derived using P\'olya counting. The value of the
mLE depends on the composition and arrangement of BPs in the strand, with a
dependence on temperature. We probe regions of strong chaoticity using the
deviation vector distribution, studying links between strongly nonlinear
behaviour and the formation of bubbles. Randomly generated sequences and
biological promoters are both studied. Further, properties of bubbles are
analysed through molecular dynamics simulations. The distributions of bubble
lifetimes and lengths are obtained, fitted with analytical expressions, and a
physically justified threshold for considering a BP to be open is successfully
implemented. In addition to DNA, we present analysis of the dynamical stability
of a planar model of graphene, studying the mLE in bulk graphene as well as in
graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The stability of the material manifests in a very
small mLE, with chaos being a slow process in graphene. For both armchair and
zigzag edge GNRs, the mLE decreases with increasing width, asymptotically
reaching the bulk behaviour. This dependence of the mLE on both energy density
and ribbon width is fitted accurately with empirical expressions.

improve physics-based simulation. Specifically, we integrate the classic
Lagrangian mechanics with a deep autoencoder to accelerate elastic simulation
of deformable solids. Due to the inertia effect, the dynamic equilibrium cannot
be established without evaluating the second-order derivatives of the deep
autoencoder network. This is beyond the capability of off-the-shelf automatic
differentiation packages and algorithms, which mainly focus on the gradient
evaluation. Solving the nonlinear force equilibrium is even more challenging if
the standard Newton's method is to be used. This is because we need to compute
a third-order derivative of the network to obtain the variational Hessian. We
attack those difficulties by exploiting complex-step finite difference, coupled
with reverse automatic differentiation. This strategy allows us to enjoy the
convenience and accuracy of complex-step finite difference and in the meantime,
to deploy complex-value perturbations as collectively as possible to save
excessive network passes. With a GPU-based implementation, we are able to wield
deep autoencoders (e.g., $10+$ layers) with a relatively high-dimension latent
space in real-time. Along this pipeline, we also design a sampling network and
a weighting network to enable \emph{weight-varying} Cubature integration in
order to incorporate nonlinearity in the model reduction. We believe this work
will inspire and benefit future research efforts in nonlinearly reduced
physical simulation problems.

amenable to a constant factor approximation using a greedy algorithm that is
robust to local errors. For such problems, we provide a general framework that
efficiently transforms offline robust greedy algorithms to online ones using
Blackwell approachability. We show that the resulting online algorithms have
$O(\sqrt{T})$ (approximate) regret under the full information setting. We
further introduce a bandit extension of Blackwell approachability that we call
Bandit Blackwell approachability. We leverage this notion to transform greedy
robust offline algorithms into a $O(T^{2/3})$ (approximate) regret in the
bandit setting. Demonstrating the flexibility of our framework, we apply our
offline-to-online transformation to several problems at the intersection of
revenue management, market design, and online optimization, including product
ranking optimization in online platforms, reserve price optimization in
auctions, and submodular maximization. We also extend our reduction to
greedy-like first order methods used in continuous optimization, such as those
used for maximizing continuous strong DR monotone submodular functions subject
to convex constraints. We show that our transformation, when applied to these
applications, leads to new regret bounds or improves the current known bounds.
We complement our theoretical studies by conducting numerical simulations for
two of our applications, in both of which we observe that the numerical
performance of our transformations outperforms the theoretical guarantees in
practical instances.

parameter $R_0$, whose value, above or below unity, determines the state of the
contagion. If, however, the pathogen evolves as it spreads, $R_0$ may change
over time, potentially leading to a mutation-driven spread, in which an
initially sub-pandemic pathogen undergoes a breakthrough mutation. To predict
the boundaries of this pandemic phase, we introduce here a modeling framework
to couple the network spreading patterns with the intra-host evolutionary

driven by different selection forces. And yet here we show that even in the
extreme case when these two forces are mutually independent, mutations can
still fundamentally alter the pandemic phase-diagram, whose transitions are now
shaped, not just by $R_0$, but also by the balance between the epidemic and the
evolutionary timescales. If mutations are too slow, the pathogen prevalence
decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if
mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once
again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we identify a
broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen can break
through to gain widespread prevalence.

exciting prospect as a wavelength measurement method due to its high resolution
and simple design. In previous studies, panel cameras have been used to detect
the subtle differences between speckle patterns. However, the volume,
bandwidth, sensitivity, and cost (in non-visible bands) associated with panel
cameras have hindered their utility in broader applications, especially in high
speed and low-cost measurements. In this work, we broke the limitations imposed
by panel cameras by using a quadrant detector (QD) to capture the speckle
images. In the scheme of QD detection, speckle images are directly filtered by
convolution, where the kernel is equal to one quarter of a speckle pattern.
First, we proposed an up-sampling algorithm to pre-process the QD data. Then a
new convolution neural network (CNN) based algorithm, shallow residual network
(SRN), was proposed to train the up-sampled images. The experimental results
show that a resolution of 4 fm (~ 0.5 MHz) was achieved at 1550nm with an
updating speed of ~ 1 kHz. More importantly, the SRN shows excellent
robustness. The wavelength can be precisely reconstructed from raw QD data
without any averaging, even where there exists apparent noise. The low-cost,
simple structure, high speed and robustness of this design promote the
speckle-based wavemeter to the industrial grade. In addition, without the
restriction of panel cameras, it is believed that this wavemeter opens new
routes in many other fields, such as distributed optical fiber sensors, optical
communications, and laser frequency stabilization.

sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with
an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained

several countries. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of the mitigation
implemented to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mexican territory
during 2020. We also investigate to what extent the initial deployment of the
vaccine will help to mitigate the pandemic and reduce the need for social
distancing and other mobility restrictions. Our modeling approach is based on a
simple mechanistic Kermack-McKendrick-type model. To quantify the effect of
NPIs, we perform a monthly Bayesian inference using officially published data.
The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, the
cumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have been
at least twice the official number. Moreover, for low vaccine coverage levels,
relaxing NPIs may dramatically increase the disease burden; therefore, safety
measures are of critical importance at the early stages of vaccination. The
simulations also suggest that it may be more desirable to employ a vaccine with
low efficacy but reach a high coverage than a vaccine with high effectiveness
but low coverage levels. This supports the hypothesis that single doses to more
individuals will be more effective than two doses for every person.

accelerations can be explained by a linear interaction with turbulence for
timescales between about 1/2 and 10 s. These timescales are comparable to those
of typical eagle behaviors, corresponding to between about 1 and 25 wingbeats,
and to those of turbulent gusts both larger than the eagle's wingspan and
smaller than large-scale atmospheric phenomena such as convection cells. The
eagle's accelerations exhibit power spectra and intermittent activity
characteristic of turbulence, and increase in proportion to the turbulence
intensity. Intermittency results in accelerations that are occasionally several
times stronger than gravity, and much larger than the ones we experience while
driving, for instance. These imprints of turbulence on the bird's movements
need to be further explored to understand the energetics of birds and other
volant lifeforms, to improve our own methods of flying through ceaselessly

  Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks","Paper got accepted in 7th International Conference on Vehicle
  Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems (VEHITS) 2021","7th International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent
  Transport Systems 2021",,,"cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Urban areas are negatively impacted by Carbon Dioxide (CO2 ) and Nitrogen
Oxide (NOx) emissions. In order to achieve a cost-effective reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions and to combat climate change, the European Union (EU)
introduced an Emissions Trading System (ETS) where organizations can buy or
receive emission allowances as needed. The current ETS is a centralized one,
consisting of a set of complex rules. It is currently administered at the
organizational level and is used for fixed-point sources of pollution such as
factories, power plants, and refineries. However, the current ETS cannot
efficiently cope with vehicle mobility, even though vehicles are one of the
primary sources of CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, we propose a new
distributed Blockchain-based emissions allowance trading system called B-ETS.
This system enables transparent and trustworthy data exchange as well as
trading of allowances among vehicles, relying on vehicle-to-vehicle
communication. In addition, we introduce an economic incentive-based mechanism
that appeals to individual drivers and leads them to modify their driving
behavior in order to reduce emissions. The efficiency of the proposed system is
studied through extensive simulations, showing how increased vehicle
connectivity can lead to a reduction of the emissions generated from those
vehicles. We demonstrate that our method can be used for full life-cycle
monitoring and fuel economy reporting. This leads us to conjecture that the
proposed system could lead to important behavioral changes among the drivers

systems. This secondary bifurcation stops active phase separation in its
nonlinear regime. It is then either replaced by an extended, system-filling,
spatially periodic pattern or, in a complementary parameter region, by a novel
hybrid state with spatially alternating homogeneous and periodic states. The
transition from phase separation to extended spatially periodic patterns is
hysteretic. We show that the resulting patterns are multistable, as they show
stability beyond the bifurcation for different wavenumbers belonging to a
wavenumber band. The transition from active phase separation to the hybrid
states is continuous. Both transition scenarios are systems-spanning phenomena
in particle conserving systems. They are predicted with a generic dissipative
model introduced in this work. Candidates for specific systems, in which these
generic secondary transitions are likely to occur, are, for example,
generalized models for motility-induced phase separation in active Brownian
particles, models for cell division or chemotactic systems with conserved
particle dynamics.

synthesis, which is the problem of generating an animated talking head given a
text as input. Due to the high complexity of this problem, we approach it as
the composition of two problems. Specifically, that of Text-to-Speech (TTS)
synthesis as well as the voice-driven talking head animation. For TTS, we
present models that are used to map text to intermediate acoustic
representations, e.g. mel-spectrograms, as well as models that generate voice
signals conditioned on these intermediate representations, i.e vocoders. For
the talking-head animation problem, we categorize approaches based on whether
they produce human faces or anthropomorphic figures. An attempt is also made to
discuss the importance of the choice of facial models in the second case.
Throughout the review, we briefly describe the most important work in
audiovisual speech synthesis, trying to highlight the advantages and
disadvantages of the various approaches.

  arXiv:2101.10444",,,,"cs.AR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object detection is widely used on embedded devices. With the wide
availability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerator chips, the
object detection applications are expected to run with low power consumption,
and high inference speed. In addition, the CPU load is expected to be as low as
possible for a CNN accelerator chip working as a co-processor with a host CPU.
In this paper, we optimize the object detection model on the CNN accelerator
chip by minimizing the CPU load. The resulting model is called GnetDet. The
experimental result shows that the GnetDet model running on a 224mW chip
achieves the speed of 106FPS with excellent accuracy.
