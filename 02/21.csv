  Action Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised tasks have been utilized to build useful representations that
can be used in downstream tasks when the annotation is unavailable. In this
paper, we introduce a self-supervised video representation learning method
based on the multi-transformation classification to efficiently classify human
actions. Self-supervised learning on various transformations not only provides
richer contextual information but also enables the visual representation more
robust to the transforms. The spatio-temporal representation of the video is
learned in a self-supervised manner by classifying seven different
transformations i.e. rotation, clip inversion, permutation, split, join
transformation, color switch, frame replacement, noise addition. First, seven
different video transformations are applied to video clips. Then the 3D
convolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips and
these features are processed to classify the pseudo-labels. We use the learned
models in pretext tasks as the pre-trained models and fine-tune them to
recognize human actions in the downstream task. We have conducted the
experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets together with C3D and 3D Resnet-18 as
backbone networks. The experimental results have shown that our proposed
framework is outperformed other SOTA self-supervised action recognition
approaches. The code will be made publicly available.

inter-decision dynamics between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers
that can be used to optimize and analyze policies/regulations related to MSPs.
To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical programming
model with a public-sector decision maker (regulator) at the highest level, the
MSP in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The regulator aims
to maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans,
transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its
service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and
routes. The travelers' decisions depend on the regulator and MSP's decisions
while the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator's decisions. To
solve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian
optimization (BO) within a simulation-optimization solution approach. At the
lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation
system simulation model to capture travelers' behavior subject to specific
decisions made by the regulator and MSP. The agent-based transportation
simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network, a transit
network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with
shared rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich,
Germany in order to validate the model. The case study investigates the tolls
and parking costs the city administration should set, as well as changes in the
public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best policy
settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the
AMOD fleet size is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides
significant value to travelers in Munich.

considers the systemic changes that electrification of heating could introduce,
including biases that could be introduced if legacy modelling approaches
continue to prevail. Covariates from gas and electrical regression models are
combined to form a novel, time-collapsed system model, with demand-weather
sensitivities determined using lasso-regularized linear regression. It is
shown, using a GB case study with one million domestic heat pump installations
per year, that the sensitivity of electrical system demand to temperature (and
subsequently sensitivities to cold/warm winter seasons) could increase by 50%
following four years of heat demand electrification. A central estimate of 1.75
kW additional peak demand per heat pump is estimated, with variability across
three published heat demand profiles leading to a range of more than 14 GW in
the most extreme cases. It is shown that the legacy approach of scaling
historic demand, as compared to the explicit modelling of heat, could lead to
over-procurement of 0.79 GW due to bias in estimates of additional capacity to

stimuli manifest in the variation of membrane capacitance, resulting from the
selective membrane permeability to ions exchanges and testifying to the central
role of electromechanical processes in the buildup mechanism of nerve impulse.
As well established [See e.g. D. Gross et al, Cellular and Molecular
Neurobiology vol. 3, p. 89 (1983)], in these electromechanical processes the
net instantaneous charge stored in the membrane is regulated by the rate of
change of the net fluid density through the membrane, orresponding to the
difference in densities of extacellular and intracellular fluids. An
electromechanical model is proposed for which mechanical forces are assumed to
result from the flow of ionic liquids through the nerve membrane, generating
pressure waves stimulating the membrane and hence controlling the net charge
stored in the membrane capacitor. The model features coupled nonlinear partial
differential equations: the familiar Hodgkin-Huxley's cable equation for the
transmembrane voltage in which the membrane capacitor is now a capacitive
diode, and the Heimburg-Jackson's nonlinear hydrodynamic equation for the
pressure wave controlling the total charge in the membrane capacitor. In the
stationary regime, the Hodgkin-Huxley cable equation with variable capacitance
reduces to a linear operator problem with zero eigenvalue, the bound states of
which can be obtained exactly for specific values of characteristic parameters
of the model. In the dynamical regime, numerical simulations of the modified
Hodgkin-Huxley equation lead to a variety of typical figures for the
transmembrane voltage, reminiscent of action potentials observed in real
physiological contexts.

  Neural Networks","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks have shown excellent performance on semi-supervised
classification tasks. However, they assume access to a graph that may not be
often available in practice. In the absence of any graph, constructing
k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) graphs from the given data have shown to give
improvements when used with GNNs over other semi-supervised methods. This paper
proposes a semi-supervised graph learning method for cases when there are no
graphs available. This method learns a graph as a convex combination of the
unsupervised kNN graph and a supervised label-affinity graph. The
label-affinity graph directly captures all the nodes' label-affinity with the
labeled nodes, i.e., how likely a node has the same label as the labeled nodes.
This affinity measure contrasts with the kNN graph where the metric measures
closeness in the feature space. Our experiments suggest that this approach
gives close to or better performance (up to 1.5%), while being simpler and
faster (up to 70x) to train, than state-of-the-art graph learning methods. We
also conduct several experiments to highlight the importance of individual
components and contrast them with state-of-the-art methods.

profiles (DC14, Lucky13, Burkert and Moore profiles) showed declining features

mainly due to the characteristics of those dark matter profiles and also due to
the varying levels of problems within the inner regions fittings. For the
remaining five accepted dark matter profiles, we further conducted analysis by
using the reduced chi-square test. Four out of the five accepted dark matter
profiles lie within the range of 0.40 < reduced chi-square < 1.70, except for
the case of the core-modified profile. In addition, Pseudoisothermal profile
achieved the best fitting i.e. reduced chi-square nearest to 1, mainly due to
its linearity in the inner region and flatness at large radii.

analysis choices and systematic effects related to source galaxy selection,
shape measurement and photometric redshift estimation can be best characterized
in end-to-end tests going from mock observations to recovered cluster masses.
To create such test scenarios, we measure and model the photometric properties
of galaxy clusters and their sky environments from the Dark Energy Survey Year
3 (DES Y3) data in two bins of cluster richness $\lambda\in[30;\,45)$,
$\lambda\in[45;\,60)$ and three bins in cluster redshift ($z\in[0.3;\,0.35)$,
$z\in[0.45;\,0.5)$ and $z\in[0.6;\,0.65)$. Using deep-field imaging data we
extrapolate galaxy populations beyond the limiting magnitude of DES Y3 and
calculate the properties of cluster member galaxies via statistical background
subtraction. We construct mock galaxy clusters as random draws from a
distribution function, and render mock clusters and line-of-sight catalogs into
synthetic images in the same format as actual survey observations. Synthetic
galaxy clusters are generated from real observational data, and thus are
independent from the assumptions inherent to cosmological simulations. The
recipe can be straightforwardly modified to incorporate extra information, and
correct for survey incompleteness. New realizations of synthetic clusters can
be created at minimal cost, which will allow future analyses to generate the
large number of images needed to characterize systematic uncertainties in
cluster mass measurements.

counterpart to C-hard problems to which all problems in C reduce. Our concrete
example is the class of non-regular deterministic context-free languages
(DCFL'), with a truth-table reduction by Mealy machines (which proves to be a

$L=\{0^n1^n; n\geq 1\}$ is DCFL'-simple, which can thus be viewed as the
simplest problem in the class DCFL'. This result has already provided an
application, to the computational model of neural networks 1ANN at the first
level of analog neuron hierarchy. This model was proven not to recognize $L$,
by using a specialized technical argument that can hardly be generalized to
other languages in DCFL'. By the result that $L$ is DCFL'-simple, w.r.t. the
reduction that can be implemented by 1ANN, we immediately obtain that 1ANN
cannot accept any language in DCFL'. It thus seems worthwhile to explore if

investigated isomorph of gallium oxide polymorphs, due to the great potential
it represents for applications in optoelectronics and photonics for solar
technology, particularly in blind ultraviolet photodetector solar cells (SBUV)
designs. To optimize its use in these applications, and to identify possible
new features, knowledge of its fundamental properties is relevant. In this
respect, optical, thermal and electronic properties of beta-\ce{Ga2O3} have
been studied expriementally, providing evidence of a wide-band inorganic and
transparent semiconductor with a Kerr nonlinearity. Thermo-optical properties
of the material, probed in SBUV sensing experiments, have highlighted a sizable
heat diffusion characterized by a temperature gradient along the path of
optical beams, quadratic in beam position and promoting a refractive-index
change with temperature. The experimentally observed Kerr nonlinearity together
with the thermally induced birefringence, point unambiguously to a possible
formation of soliton molecules during propagation of high-intensity fields in
beta-\ce{Ga2O3}. To put this conjecture on a firm ground we propose a
theoretical analysis, based on the cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation in 1+1
spatial dimension, in which thermal lensing creates an effective potential
quadratic in the coordinate of beam position. Using the non-isospectral
inverse-scattering transform method, the exact one-soliton solution to the
propagation equation is obtained. This solution features a bound state of
entangled pulses forming a soliton molecule, in which pulses are more or less
entangled depending on characteristic parameters of the system.

consisting of a K-order nonlinear complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, coupled to
a first-order equation describing time variation of the electron plasma

detrimental or favorable to continuous-wave operation, depending on the
group-velocity dispersion of the host medium. Numerical simulations of the

we provide an overview of the current challenges to achieve further
technological improvements. On the raw materials side, we see no fundamental
limitation to expansion in capacity of the current market technologies, even
though basic estimates predict that the PV sector will become the largest
consumer of Ag in the world after 2030. On the other hand, recent market data
on PV costs indicates that the largest cost fraction is now infrastructure and
area-related, and nearly independent of the core cell technology. Therefore,
additional value adding is likely to proceed via an increase in energy yield
metrics such as the power density and/or efficiency of the PV module. However,
current market technologies are near their fundamental detailed balance
efficiency limits. The transition to multijunction PV in tandem configurations
is regarded as the most promising path to surpass this limitation and increase
the power per unit area of PV modules. So far, each specific multijunction
concept faces particular obstacles that have prevented their upscaling, but the
field is rapidly improving. In this review work, we provide a global comparison
between the different types of multijunction concepts, including III-Vs,
Si-based tandems and the emergence of perovskite/Si devices. Coupled with
analyses of new notable developments in the field, we discuss the challenges
common to different multijunction cell architectures, and the specific
challenges of each type of device, both on a cell level and on a module
integration level. From the analysis, we conclude that several tandem concepts
are nearing the disruption level where a breakthrough into mainstream PV is
possible.

utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three
important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and
bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors
integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data,
MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with
synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the
synthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the
weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the
architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different

74 individuals. We conduct data instance level and patient level evaluations.
MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%,

  Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ 2021)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Security bugs are errors in code that, when exploited, can lead to serious
software vulnerabilities. These bugs could allow an attacker to take over an
application and steal information. One of the ways to address this issue is by
means of awareness training. The Sifu platform was developed in the industry,
for the industry, with the aim to raise software developers' awareness of
secure coding. This paper extends the Sifu platform with three challenges that
specifically address embedded programming courses, and describes how to
implement these challenges, while also evaluating the usefulness of these
challenges to raise security awareness in an academic setting. Our work
presents technical details on the detection mechanisms for software
vulnerabilities and gives practical advice on how to implement them. The
evaluation of the challenges is performed through two trial runs with a total
of 16 participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are
suitable for academia, and can even potentially be included in official
teaching curricula. One major finding is an indicator of the lack of awareness
of secure coding by undergraduates. Finally, we compare our results with
previous work done in the industry and extract advice for practitioners.

complicated nuances. Discovering distinctive linguistic phenomena from data is
not an easy task. For instance, lexical ambiguity is a fundamental feature of
language which is challenging to learn. Even more prominently, inferring the
meaning of rare and unseen lexical units is difficult with neural networks.
Meaning is often determined from context. With context, languages allow meaning
to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader.
To model this learning process, a system has to learn from a few instances in
context and be able to generalize well to unseen cases. The learning process is
hindered when training data is scarce for a task. Even with sufficient data,
learning patterns for the long tail of the lexical distribution is challenging.
In this thesis, we focus on understanding certain potentials of contexts in
neural models and design augmentation models to benefit from them. We focus on
machine translation as an important instance of the more general language
understanding problem. To translate from a source language to a target
language, a neural model has to understand the meaning of constituents in the
provided context and generate constituents with the same meanings in the target
language. This task accentuates the value of capturing nuances of language and
the necessity of generalization from few observations. The main problem we
study in this thesis is what neural machine translation models learn from data
and how we can devise more focused contexts to enhance this learning. Looking
more in-depth into the role of context and the impact of data on learning
models is essential to advance the NLP field. Moreover, it helps highlight the
vulnerabilities of current neural networks and provides insights into designing
more robust models.

population. In turn, the immune systems of infected populations get updated,
chasing viruses even further away. Quantitatively understanding how these
dynamics result in observed patterns of rapid pathogen and immune adaptation is
instrumental to epidemiological and evolutionary forecasting. Here we present a
mathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a
finite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of
viral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections. We show the
emergence of an antigenic wave that is pushed forward and canalized by
cross-reactivity. We obtain analytical results for shape, speed, and angular
diffusion of the wave. In particular, we show that viral-immune co-evolution
generates a new emergent timescale, the persistence time of the wave's
direction in antigenic space, which can be much longer than the coalescence
time of the viral population. We compare these dynamics to the observed
antigenic turnover of influenza strains, and we discuss how the dimensionality
of antigenic space impacts on the predictability of the evolutionary dynamics.

length of delay between encoding and initiating the PM intention and the type

everyday PM performance was affected by the length of delay rather than the

to the PM cue focality (i.e., semantic relationship with the intended action).

$s_{\beta-\alpha}= 0.98$ and $s_{\beta-\alpha}= 0.99,$ $0.995$, which gives the
enhancement in the cross section, particularly a few times greater than the
predictions of the SM due to resonant-impacts of the additional heavy neutral
Higgs bosons. This shows that enhancement in cross section occurs on leaving
the alignment i.e., $s_{\beta-\alpha}=1$, at which all the higgs that couple to
vector bosons and fermions have the same values as in SM at tree level. A large
value of enhancement factor is obtained at $s_{\beta-\alpha}= 0.98$ compared to
$s_{\beta-\alpha}= 0.99,$ $0 .995$. Furthermore, the decrease in the
enhancement factor is observed for the case when $m_H=300$ GeV,
$m_A=m_{H^\pm}=500$ GeV. The behavior of the scaling factor with $\tan{\beta}$
is also studied, which shows that for large values of $\tan\beta$, the scaling
factor becomes equal to $s_{\beta-\alpha}$. Finally a convincing correlation is
achieved by taking into account, the experimental and theoretical constraints

meta-learning techniques in few-shot learning. It enables us to learn a

adapt to new tasks using a small amount of labeled training data. Despite the
generalization power of the meta-model, it remains elusive that how adversarial
robustness can be maintained by MAML in few-shot learning. In addition to
generalization, robustness is also desired for a meta-model to defend
adversarial examples (attacks). Toward promoting adversarial robustness in
MAML, we first study WHEN a robustness-promoting regularization should be
incorporated, given the fact that MAML adopts a bi-level (fine-tuning vs.
meta-update) learning procedure. We show that robustifying the meta-update
stage is sufficient to make robustness adapted to the task-specific fine-tuning
stage even if the latter uses a standard training protocol. We also make
additional justification on the acquired robustness adaptation by peering into
the interpretability of neurons' activation maps. Furthermore, we investigate
HOW robust regularization can efficiently be designed in MAML. We propose a
general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework,
which allows the use of unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack
generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning. In particular, we for the
first time show that the auxiliary contrastive learning task can enhance the

dimensional stack of chains, AC Josephson effect implies that electric field
pulses perpendicular to the layers and chains can steer the order parameter

Ground-based radars can detect Earth orbiting debris down to a few square

capabilities and availability of its small radar network capable of tracking

extensive technical description of all the system components followed by a
study that estimates its future performance. A section dedicated to waveform
design is also presented, since the system allows the usage of several types of
pulse modulation schemes such as LFM and phase coded modulations while enabling
the development and testing of more advanced ones. By presenting an

small manually-designed search space or utilize a cumbersome neural

bit-level sparsity quantization (BSQ) to tackle the mixed-precision
quantization from a new angle of inducing bit-level sparsity. We consider each
bit of quantized weights as an independent trainable variable and introduce a
differentiable bit-sparsity regularizer. BSQ can induce all-zero bits across a
group of weight elements and realize the dynamic precision reduction, leading
to a mixed-precision quantization scheme of the original model. Our method
enables the exploration of the full mixed-precision space with a single
gradient-based optimization process, with only one hyperparameter to tradeoff
the performance and compression. BSQ achieves both higher accuracy and higher
bit reduction on various model architectures on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet

that were discovered in 2009. Since that time, intense research interest has
led to the identification of numerous compounds that support skyrmions over a
range of conditions spanning cryogenic to room temperatures. Skyrmions can be
set into motion under various types of driving, and the combination of their
size, stability, and dynamics makes them ideal candidates for numerous
applications. Skyrmions represent a new class of system in which the energy
scales of the skyrmion-skyrmion interactions, sample disorder, temperature, and
drive can compete. A growing body of work indicates that the static and dynamic
states of skyrmions can be influenced strongly by pinning or disorder in the
sample; thus, an understanding of such effects is essential for the eventual
use of skyrmions in applications. In this article we review the current state
of knowledge regarding individual skyrmions and skyrmion assemblies interacting
with quenched disorder or pinning. We outline the microscopic mechanisms for
skyrmion pinning, including the repulsive and attractive interactions that can
arise from impurities, grain boundaries, or nanostructures. This is followed by
descriptions of depinning phenomena, sliding states over disorder, the effect
of pinning on the skyrmion Hall angle, the competition between thermal and
pinning effects, the control of skyrmion motion using ordered potential
landscapes such as one- or two-dimensional periodic asymmetric substrates, the
creation of skyrmion diodes, and skyrmion ratchet effects. We highlight the
distinctions arising from internal modes and the strong gyroscopic or Magnus
forces that cause the dynamical states of skyrmions to differ from those of
other systems with pinning. We also discuss future directions and open
questions related to the pinning and dynamics in skyrmion systems.

equations. What happens if we consider a more general framework, where
time-dependent dephasing rates are allowed, thereby permitting the possibility
of non-Markovian scenarios? Does dephasing assisted transport still manifest
for non-Markovian dephasing? Here, we address these open questions in a setup

non-Markovian dephasing assisted transport depends on the way in which the
incoherent energy sources are locally coupled to the chain. This is illustrated
with two different configurations, namely non-symmetric and symmetric.
Specifically, we verify that non-Markovian dephasing assisted transport
manifested only in the non-symmetric configuration. This allows us to draw a
parallel with the conditions in which time-independent Markovian dephasing
assisted transport manifests. Finally, we find similar results by considering a
controllable and experimentally implementable system, which highlights the

proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. $f$,
$2f/3$) and across three frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_1+f_2$),
respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their
limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify
phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$,
$f_1+f_2+f_3-f_4$), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the
frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $2f_1/3+f_2/3$). To address the gap, this paper
proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for
the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase
coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure
the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the
detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled

are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple
coupled R\""ossler oscillators. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a
reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the
phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag

1988, states that a $k$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the $k$-server
problem exists. It is conjectured that the work function algorithm (WFA)
achieves this guarantee, a multi-purpose algorithm with applications to various
online problems. This has been shown for several special cases: $k=2$,
$(k+1)$-point metrics, $(k+2)$-point metrics, the line metric, weighted star
metrics, and $k=3$ in the Manhattan plane.
  The known proofs of these results are based on potential functions tied to
each particular special case, thus requiring six different potential functions
for the six cases. We present a single potential function proving
$k$-competitiveness of WFA for all these cases. We also use this potential to
show $k$-competitiveness of WFA on multiray spaces and for $k=3$ on trees.
While the DoubleCoverage algorithm was known to be $k$-competitive for these
latter cases, it has been open for WFA. Our potential captures a type of lazy
adversary and thus shows that in all settled cases, the worst-case adversary is
lazy. Chrobak and Larmore conjectured in 1992 that a potential capturing the
lazy adversary would resolve the $k$-server conjecture.
  To our major surprise, this is not the case, as we show (using connections to
the $k$-taxi problem) that our potential fails for three servers on the circle.
Thus, our potential highlights laziness of the adversary as a fundamental
property that is shared by all settled cases but violated in general. On the
one hand, this weakens our confidence in the validity of the $k$-server
conjecture. On the other hand, if the $k$-server conjecture holds, then we

of existing things - can be a powerful way to evolve rather than design
technical objects such as electronic circuits. Intriguingly, this seems to be
an ongoing and thus open-ended process creating novelty with increasing
complexity. Here, we employ combinatorial evolution in software development.
While current approaches such as genetic programming are efficient in solving
particular problems, they all converge towards a solution and do not create
anything new anymore afterwards. Combinatorial evolution of complex systems
such as languages and technology are considered open-ended. Therefore,
open-ended automatic programming might be possible through combinatorial
evolution. We implemented a computer program simulating combinatorial evolution
of code blocks stored in a database to make them available for combining.
Automatic programming in the sense of algorithm-based code generation is
achieved by evaluating regular expressions. We found that reserved keywords of
a programming language are suitable for defining the basic code blocks at the
beginning of the simulation. We also found that placeholders can be used to
combine code blocks and that code complexity can be described in terms of the
importance to the programming language. As in a previous combinatorial
evolution simulation of electronic circuits, complexity increased from simple
keywords and special characters to more complex variable declarations, class
definitions, methods, and classes containing methods and variable declarations.
Combinatorial evolution, therefore, seems to be a promising approach for
open-ended automatic programming.

  Efficiency Guarantees",,,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The internet advertising market is a multi-billion dollar industry, in which
advertisers buy thousands of ad placements every day by repeatedly
participating in auctions. An important and ubiquitous feature of these
auctions is the presence of campaign budgets, which specify the maximum amount
the advertisers are willing to pay over a specified time period. In this paper,
we present a new model to study the equilibrium bidding strategies in standard
auctions, a large class of auctions that includes first- and second-price
auctions, for advertisers who satisfy budget constraints on average. Our model
dispenses with the common, yet unrealistic assumption that advertisers' values
are independent and instead assumes a contextual model in which advertisers
determine their values using a common feature vector. We show the existence of
a natural value-pacing-based Bayes-Nash equilibrium under very mild
assumptions. Furthermore, we prove a revenue equivalence showing that all
standard auctions yield the same revenue even in the presence of budget
constraints. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove Price of Anarchy bounds for
liquid welfare and structural properties of pacing-based equilibria that hold
for all standard auctions. In recent years, the internet advertising market has
adopted first-price auctions as the preferred paradigm for selling advertising
slots. Our work thus takes an important step toward understanding the
implications of the shift to first-price auctions in internet advertising
markets by studying how the choice of the selling mechanism impacts revenues,
welfare, and advertisers' bidding strategies.

in-silico hybrid stochastic synapse by pairing a ferroelectric field-effect

well-established crossbar array architecture for compute-in-memory. We
experimentally show that the inherent stochastic switching of the selector

stochastic noise within the synapses of NSM that samples the conductance states
of the FeFET, both during learning and inference. We perform network-level

address the following scientific question: does the issuance of heat alerts
prevent adverse health effects? Our goal is to address this question within a
causal inference framework in the context of time series data. A key challenge
is that causal inference methods require the overlap assumption to hold: each
unit (i.e., a day) must have a positive probability of receiving the treatment
(i.e., issuing a heat alert on that day). In our motivating example, the
overlap assumption is often violated: the probability of issuing a heat alert
on a cooler day is zero. To overcome this challenge, we propose a stochastic
intervention for time series data which is implemented via an incremental
time-varying propensity score (ItvPS). The ItvPS intervention is executed by
multiplying the probability of issuing a heat alert on day $t$ -- conditional
on past information up to day $t$ -- by an odds ratio $\delta_t$. First, we
introduce a new class of causal estimands that relies on the ItvPS
intervention. We provide theoretical results to show that these causal
estimands can be identified and estimated under a weaker version of the overlap
assumption. Second, we propose nonparametric estimators based on the ItvPS and
derive an upper bound for the variances of these estimators. Third, we extend
this framework to multi-site time series using a spatial meta-analysis
approach. Fourth, we show that the proposed estimators perform well in terms of
bias and root mean squared error via simulations. Finally, we apply our
proposed approach to estimate the causal effects of increasing the probability
of issuing heat alerts on each warm-season day in reducing deaths and
hospitalizations among Medicare enrollees in $2,837$ U.S. counties.

pyramid network was added to the U-Net++ model, enabling the utilization of
feature maps at different scales. As a result, the accuracy of the probability

images from 18 patients in this study. The whole dataset was split into a
training dataset (1572 images) for the 10-fold cross-validation and a test
dataset (174 images) for evaluating the performance of models. Our IVUS-U-Net++
segmentation model achieved a Jaccard measure (JM) of 0.9412, a Hausdorff
distance (HD) of 0.0639 mm for the lumen border, and a JM of 0.9509, an HD of
0.0867 mm for the MA border, respectively. Moreover, the Pearson correlation
and Bland-Altman analyses were performed to evaluate the correlations of 12
clinical parameters measured from our segmentation results and the ground

architectures. Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to alleviate such
heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some
architecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given
limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top
architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This
paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find
the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We
propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one
strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the
high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key
property of the weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling better
architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed
architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new
better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework, dubbed WeakNAS,
produces coarse-to-fine iteration to gradually refine the ranking of sampling
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WeakNAS costs fewer samples to
find top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201. Compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods, WeakNAS outperforms all
with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least 7.5x less samples to find global
optimal on NAS-Bench-101. WeakNAS can also absorb their ideas to boost
performance more. Further, WeakNAS strikes the new SOTA result of 81.3% in the

salicylate (CPCl/NaSal). By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration
ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and
relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched
micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR
diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the
mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low
salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are
linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared
displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 ~ Tdiff 0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion
time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 ~
Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in
branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of
differentiating various types of micellar microstructure. In addition, the
self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched
micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing to the existing
restricted diffusion models, and shown to be much slower than the diffusion of
proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched
wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is
through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour
length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second
viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination
of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.

correspondence placement rely on nearest neighbor search for simpler anatomies.
Coordinate transformations for shape correspondence hold promise to address the
increasing anatomical complexities. Nonetheless, due to the inherent
shape-level geometric complexity and population-level shape variation, the
coordinate-wise correspondence often does not translate to the anatomical
correspondence. An alternative, group-wise approach for correspondence
placement explicitly models the trade-off between geometric description and the
population's statistical compactness. However, these models achieve limited
success in resolving nonlinear shape correspondence. Recent works have
addressed this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of
correspondence through lifting positional data to a higher dimensional feature
space. However, they heavily rely on manual expertise to create domain-specific
features and consistent landmarks. This paper proposes an automated feature
learning approach, using deep convolutional neural networks to extract
correspondence-friendly features from shape ensembles. Further, an unsupervised
domain adaptation scheme is introduced to augment the pretrained geometric
features with new anatomies. Results on anatomical datasets of human scapula,
femur, and pelvis bones demonstrate that features learned in supervised fashion
show improved performance for correspondence estimation compared to the manual
features. Further, unsupervised learning is demonstrated to learn complex
anatomy features using the supervised domain adaptation from features learned
on simpler anatomy.

motion of a sedimenting elliptical particle is investigated using the immersed
interface-lattice Boltzmann method (II-LBM), in which a signed distance
function is adopted to apply the jump conditions for the II-LBM and to add
external electromagnetic forces. First, mechanisms of electromagnetic control
on suppressing vorticity generation based on the vorticity equation and vortex
shedding based on the streamwise momentum equation are discussed. Then,
systematical investigations are performed to quantify and qualify the effects
of the electromagnetic control by changing the electromagnetic strength, the
initial orientation angle of the elliptical particle, and the density ratio of
the particle to the fluid. To demonstrate the control effect of different
cases, comparisons of vorticity fields, particle trajectories, orientation
angles, and energy transfers of the particles are presented. Results show that
the rotational motion of the particle can be well controlled by appropriate
magnitudes of electromagnetic forces. In a relatively high solid to fluid
density ratio case where vortex shedding appears, the sedimentation speed can
increase nearly 40\% and the motion of the particle turns into a steady descent
motion once an appropriate magnitude of the electromagnetic force is applied.
When the magnitude of the electromagnetic force is excessive, the particle will
deviate from the center of the side walls. In addition, the controlling
approach is shown to be robust for various initial orientation angles and solid
to fluid density ratios.

linear, Bernoulli, Riccati, and Abel) with arbitrary coefficients, and present
in detail the Adomian method for obtaining their solutions. In each case we
compare the Adomian solution with the exact solution of some particular
differential equations, and we show their complete equivalence. The second
order and the fifth order ordinary differential equations are also considered.
An important extension of the standard ADM, the Laplace-Adomian Decomposition
Method is also introduced through the investigation of the solutions of a
specific second order nonlinear differential equation. We also present the
applications of the method to the Fisher-Kolmogorov second order partial
nonlinear differential equation, which plays an important role in the
description of many physical processes, as well as three important applications
in astronomy and astrophysics, related to the determination of the solutions of
the Kepler equation, of the Lane-Emden equation, and of the general
relativistic equation describing the motion of massive particles in the

increase of Raman scattering cross section of molecules adsorbed to plasmonic
metals and influenced by numerous physico-chemical factors such as geometry and
optical properties of the metal surface, orientation of chemisorbed molecules
and chemical environment. While SERS holds promise for single molecule
sensitivity and optical sensing of DNA sequences, more detailed understanding
of the rich physico-chemical interplay between various factors is needed to
enhance predictive power of existing and future SERS-based DNA sensing
platforms. In this work we report on experimental results indicating that SERS
spectra of adsorbed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) isomers depend on the order on
which individual bases appear in the 3-base long ssDNA due to intra-molecular
interaction between DNA bases. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that
the effect holds under more general conditions when the molecules don't
experience chemical enhancement due to resonant charge transfer effect and also
under standard Raman scattering without electromagnetic or chemical
enhancements. Our numerical simulations qualitatively support the experimental
findings and indicate that base permutation results in modification of both
Raman and chemically enhanced Raman spectra.

is keeping track of the interactions between the people and the objects.
CheckSoft uses finite-state-machine (FSM) based logic for keeping track of such

the interactions by the video cameras. CheckSoft is easily scalable since the
architecture is based on multi-processing in which a separate process is
assigned to each human and to each ""storage container"" for the objects. A
storage container may be a shelf on which the objects are displayed or a bin in
which the objects are stored, depending on the specific application in which
CheckSoft is deployed.

and ambient airlight. Existing dehazing methods often ignore the depth cues and
fail in distant areas where heavier haze disturbs the visibility. However, we
note that the guidance of the depth information for transmission estimation
could remedy the decreased visibility as distances increase. In turn, the good
transmission estimation could facilitate the depth estimation for hazy images.
In this paper, a deep end-to-end model that iteratively estimates image depths
and transmission maps is proposed to perform an effective depth prediction for
hazy images and improve the dehazing performance with the guidance of depth
information. The image depth and transmission map are progressively refined to
better restore the dehazed image. Our approach benefits from explicitly
modeling the inner relationship of image depth and transmission map, which is
especially effective for distant hazy areas. Extensive results on the
benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed network performs favorably against the
state-of-the-art dehazing methods in terms of depth estimation and haze
removal.

concept drift: the distribution of the data may drift over time because of
dynamically changing environments, and anomalies may become normal as time
elapses. We propose to use adaptive Huffman coding for anomaly detection in
audio with concept drift. Compared with the existing method of adaptive
Gaussian mixture modeling (AGMM), adaptive Huffman coding does not require a
priori information about the clusters and can adjust the number of clusters
dynamically depending on the amount of variation in the audio. To control the
size of the Huffman tree, we propose to merge clusters that are close to each
other instead of replacing rare clusters with new data. This reduces redundancy
in the Huffman tree while ensuring that it never forgets past information. On a
dataset of audio with concept drift which we have curated ourselves, our
proposed method achieves higher area under the curve (AUC) compared with AGMM
and fixed-length Huffman trees. The proposed approach is also time-efficient
and can be easily extended to other types of time series data (e.g., video).

fast-flowing bloodstreams. Towards this end, we develop a multiscale
computational model to recreate SIPA in silico, where the suspension dynamics

intrinsic binding rates theoretically derived and informed by single-molecule

milliseconds, comparable to the platelet transit time through pathologic

platelet activation. The multiscale SIPA simulator provides a cross-scale tool
for exploring the biophysical mechanisms of SIPA in silico that are difficult

first of these definitions of relative expressiveness, we show that all the
defeasible logics in the DL framework are equally expressive under this
formulation of relative expressiveness. The second formulation of relative
expressiveness is stronger than the first. However, we show that logics
incorporating individual defeat are equally expressive as the corresponding
logics with team defeat. Thus the only differences in expressiveness of logics
in DL arise from differences in how ambiguity is handled. This completes the
study of relative expressiveness in DL begun in \cite{Maher12}.

metric to measure the adversarial robustness of a model over a particular
$\epsilon$-interval $[\epsilon_0, \epsilon_1]$ (interval of adversarial
perturbation strengths) that facilitates unbiased comparisons across models
when they have different initial $\epsilon_0$ performance. This can be used to
determine how adversarially robust a model is to different image distributions
or task (or some other variable); and/or to measure how robust a model is
comparatively to other models. We used this adversarial robustness metric on
models of an MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a Fusion dataset (CIFAR-10 + MNIST) where
trained models performed either a digit or object recognition task using a
LeNet, ResNet50, or a fully connected network (FullyConnectedNet) architecture
and found the following: 1) CIFAR-10 models are inherently less adversarially
robust than MNIST models; 2) Both the image distribution and task that a model
is trained on can affect the adversarial robustness of the resultant model. 3)
Pretraining with a different image distribution and task sometimes carries over
the adversarial robustness induced by that image distribution and task in the
resultant model; Collectively, our results imply non-trivial differences of the
learned representation space of one perceptual system over another given its
exposure to different image statistics or tasks (mainly objects vs digits).
Moreover, these results hold even when model systems are equalized to have the
same level of performance, or when exposed to approximately matched image
statistics of fusion images but with different tasks.

COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained
by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and
treatment. Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions
to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social
distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in
intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating
coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to
consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by
incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel
metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth
patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to
policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple
Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of
model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban
""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary
infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and
heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can
facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively
mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate
our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that
informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies.

corresponding to different factors should be distinct from each other, and the
disentangled representation should reflect those variations with separate
dimensions. To discover the factors and learn disentangled representation,
previous methods typically leverage an extra regularization term when learning
to generate realistic images. However, the term usually results in a trade-off
between disentanglement and generation quality. For the generative models
pretrained without any disentanglement term, the generated images show
semantically meaningful variations when traversing along different directions
in the latent space. Based on this observation, we argue that it is possible to
mitigate the trade-off by $(i)$ leveraging the pretrained generative models
with high generation quality, $(ii)$ focusing on discovering the traversal
directions as factors for disentangled representation learning. To achieve
this, we propose Disentaglement via Contrast (DisCo) as a framework to model
the variations based on the target disentangled representations, and contrast
the variations to jointly discover disentangled directions and learn
disentangled representations. DisCo achieves the state-of-the-art disentangled

approximating the real data distributions. Specifically, each content embedding
from the dataset, which encodes the most dominant factors for image
reconstruction, is assumed to be sampled from a shared distribution across the
dataset. The style embedding for a particular image, encoding the remaining
factors, is used to customize the shared distribution through an affine
transformation. The experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that

approaches to automate the identification of safe terrain from input digital

input DEMs with increased sensor noise. In the last decade, deep learning

applicability to safety-critical space missions has often been limited due to
concerns regarding their outputs' reliability. In response to these
limitations, this paper proposes an application of the Bayesian deep-learning
segmentation method for hazard detection. The developed approach enables
reliable, safe landing site detection by: (i) generating simultaneously a
safety prediction map and its uncertainty map via Bayesian deep learning and
semantic segmentation; and (ii) using the uncertainty map to filter out the
uncertain pixels in the prediction map so that the safe site identification is
performed only based on the certain pixels (i.e., pixels for which the model is
certain about its safety prediction). Experiments are presented with simulated
data based on a Mars HiRISE digital terrain model by varying uncertainty

arises from two sources, namely spin-conservation term and spin-flip term. The
spin-conservation term is generated by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) interaction on
dxy/dx2-y2 orbitals and is contributed to the out-of-plane MA. The spin-flip
term is caused by SOC interaction on dxz/dyz and px/py orbitals and is
responsible for the in-plane MA. We further find that strain-tuned MA is mainly
determined by exchange splitting and ligand field splitting. Increase of strain
will enhance the exchange splitting and reduce the ligand field splitting,
resulting in the enhancement of the in-plane MA from dxy/dx2-y2 orbitals and
the reduction of the out-of-plane MA from dxz/dyz and px/py orbitals, and hence
leading to the change of the strength and direction of the total MA. Our study

(LSTM) network models which also include some recent versions such as
bidirectional-LSTM and encoder-decoder LSTM models. We use a multivariate time
series approach that attempts to predict air quality for 10 prediction horizons
covering total of 80 hours and provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast
with uncertainties quantified. Our results show that the multivariate
bidirectional-LSTM model provides best predictions despite COVID-19 impact on
the air-quality during full and partial lockdown periods. The effect of
COVID-19 on the air quality has been significant during full lockdown; however,
there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality afterwards.

of WSI analysis based on machine learning. Firstly, the development status of
WSI and CAD methods are introduced. Secondly, we discuss publicly available WSI

nonlinearity and the harmonic-oscillator (HO) confining potential. The system
models binary settings in BEC and optics. In the symmetric system, with the HO
trap acting in both components, we consider Josephson oscillations (JO)
initiated by an input in the form of the HO's ground state (GS) or dipole mode
(DM), placed in one component. With the increase of the strength of the
self-focusing nonlinearity, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) between the
components takes place in the dynamical JO state. Under still stronger
nonlinearity, the regular JO initiated by the GS input carry over into a
chaotic dynamical state. For the DM input, the chaotization happens at smaller
powers than for the GS, which is followed by SSB at a slightly stronger
nonlinearity. In the system with the defocusing nonlinearity, SSB does not take
place, and dynamical chaos occurs in a small area of the parameter space. In
the asymmetric half-trapped system, with the HO potential applied to a single
component, we first focus on the spectrum of confined binary modes in the
linearized system. The spectrum is found analytically in the limits of weak and
strong inter-component coupling, and numerically in the general case. Under the
action of the coupling, the existence region of the confined modes shrinks for
GSs and expands for DMs. In the full nonlinear system, the existence region for
confined modes is identified in the numerical form. They are constructed too by
means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation, in the case of the defocusing
nonlinearity. Lastly, particular (non-generic) exact analytical solutions for
confined modes, including vortices, in one- and two-dimensional asymmetric
linearized systems are found. They represent bound states in the continuum.

This paper generalises the famous rule of thumb for the acceptable level of

The extension is based on choosing the missing elements such that the maximal

inconsistency of random matrices is found to be the function of matrix size and
the number of missing elements, with a nearly linear dependence in the case of
the latter variable. Our results can be directly built into decision-making

views: it then allows the confidential execution of certain tasks by ensuring
that, each actor potentially has only a partial perception of the processes'

accomplish this, the model rely on three projection algorithms allowing to
partially replicate the processes' global execution states at a given moment,
to consistently update the obtained partial states and to deduce new coherent

control of the shape while reducing the impact on the orbital angular momentum

composed of three identical satellites orbiting around the geocenter with a

lead to the optical path difference (OPD, $\Delta l$) along the propagation of

$X$). For single link and Michelson interferometer, the maxima of $|\Delta l|$
are on the order of 1 pm. For the TDI combinations, these can be suppressed to
about 0.004 and 0.008 pm for $\alpha$ and $X$. The OPD noise of the Michelson
combination is colored in the concerned frequency range; while the ones for the
TDI combinations are approximately white. Furthermore, we calculate the ratio
of the equivalent strain of the OPD noise to that of TQ, and find that the OPD
noises for the TDI combinations can be neglected in the most sensitive

In this work, we re-analyzed the INTEGRAL hard X-ray-selected sample of Seyfert
galaxies. We only consider sources that have measurements in black hole mass,
and luminosities in radio and X-rays. Our sample includes 64 sources, consists
of both bright AGNs and low-luminosity ones. We first find that, because of the
similarity in the $L_{HX}/L_X$ distribution, the X-ray origin of radio-loud
Seyferts may be the same to that of radio-quiet ones, where we attribute to the
hot accretion flow (or similarly, the corona). We then investigate the
connections between luminosities in radio and X-rays. Since our sample suffers
a selection bias of a black hole mass $M_{BH}$ dependence on $L_X/L_{Edd}$, we
focus on the correlation slope $\xi_X$ between the radio (at 1.4 GHz) and X-ray
luminosities in Eddington unit, i.e.
$(L_R/L_{Edd})\propto(L_X/L_{Edd})^{\xi_X}$. We classify the sources according
to various properties, i.e. 1) Seyfert classification, 2) radio loudness, and
3) radio morphology. We find that, despite these differences in classification,
all the sources in our sample are consistent with a universal correlation slope
$\xi_X$, with $\xi_X=0.77\pm0.10$. This is unexpected, considering various
possible radio emitters in radio-quiet systems. For the jet interpretation, our
result may suggest a common/universal but to be identified jet launching
mechanism among all the Seyfert galaxies, while properties like black hole spin
and magnetic field strength only play secondary roles. We further estimate the
jet production efficiency $\eta_{jet}$ of Seyfert galaxies, which is
$\eta_{jet}\approx1.9^{+0.9}_{-1.5}\times10^{-4}$ on average. We also find that
$\eta_{jet}$ increases as the system goes fainter.

the field equations allows for explicitly covariant degree of freedom number
count, which is stable with respect to deformations. If the original Lagrangian
equations are not involutive, the involutive closure will be a non-Lagrangian

in a common formal framework, via specifying Galois connections linking search
and optimization processes on directed metagraphs whose edge targets are

drawn from the core cognitive algorithms used in the OpenCog AGI framework:
Probabilistic logical inference, evolutionary program learning, pattern mining,
agglomerative clustering, pattern mining and nonlinear-dynamical attention
allocation.
  The analysis presented involves representing these cognitive algorithms as
recursive discrete decision processes involving optimizing functions defined
over metagraphs, in which the key decisions involve sampling from probability
distributions over metagraphs and enacting sets of combinatory operations on
selected sub-metagraphs. The mutual associativity of the combinatory operations
involved in a cognitive process is shown to often play a key role in enabling
the decomposition of the process into folding and unfolding operations; a
conclusion that has some practical implications for the particulars of
cognitive processes, e.g. militating toward use of reversible logic and
reversible program execution. It is also observed that where this mutual
associativity holds, there is an alignment between the hierarchy of subgoals
used in recursive decision process execution and a hierarchy of subpatterns
definable in terms of formal pattern theory.

highly uncertain. We examine the uncertainty in the outcome of perturbations to
the synchronous state in a Kuramoto-like representation of the British power
grid. Based on local basin landscapes which correspond to single-node
perturbations, we demonstrate that the uncertainty shows strong spatial
variability. While perturbations at many nodes only allow for a few outcomes,
other local landscapes show extreme complexity with more than a hundred basins.
Particularly complex domains in the latter can be related to unstable invariant
chaotic sets of saddle type. Most importantly, we show that the characteristic
dynamics on these chaotic saddles can be associated with certain topological
structures of the network. We find that one particular tree-like substructure
allows for the chaotic response to perturbations at nodes in the north of Great
Britain. The interplay with other peripheral motifs increases the uncertainty

However, current human-robot interfaces lack intuitive teleoperation and cannot
mimic surgeon's hand/finger sensing and fine motion. These limitations make
tele-operated robotic surgery not suitable for micro-surgery and difficult to
learn for established surgeons. We report a pilot study showing an intuitive
way of recording and mapping surgeon's gross hand motion and the fine synergic
motion during cardiac micro-surgery as a way to enhance future intuitive
teleoperation. Methods: We set to develop a prototype system able to train a
Deep Neural Net-work (DNN) by mapping wrist, hand and surgical tool real-time
data acquisition(RTDA) inputs during mock-up heart micro-surgery procedures.
The trained network was used to estimate the tools poses from refined hand
joint angles. Results: Based on surgeon's feedback during mock micro-surgery,
the developed wearable system with light-weight sensors for motion tracking did
not interfere with the surgery and instrument handling. The wearable motion
tracking system used 15 finger-thumb-wrist joint angle sensors to generate
meaningful data-sets representing inputs of the DNN network with new hand joint
angles added as necessary based on comparing the estimated tool poses against
measured tool pose. The DNN architecture was optimized for the highest
estimation accuracy and the ability to determine the tool pose with the least
mean squared error. This novel approach showed that the surgical instrument's
pose, an essential requirement for teleoperation, can be accurately estimated

attracted attention owing to their low power consumption.However, for
continuous data values, they must employ a coding process to convert the values
to spike trains.Thus, they have not yet exceeded the performance of artificial
neural networks (ANNs), which handle such values directly.To this end, we
combine an ANN and an SNN to build versatile hybrid neural networks (HNNs) that
improve the concerned performance.To qualify this performance, MNIST and
CIFAR-10 image datasets are used for various classification tasks in which the
training and coding methods changes.In addition, we present simultaneous and
separate methods to train the artificial and spiking layers, considering the
coding methods of each.We find that increasing the number of artificial layers
at the expense of spiking layers improves the HNN performance.For
straightforward datasets such as MNIST, it is easy to achieve the same
performance as ANNs by using duplicate coding and separate learning.However,
for more complex tasks, the use of Gaussian coding and simultaneous learning is
found to improve the accuracy of HNNs while utilizing a smaller number of

importance to detect the disease at an early stage especially in the hot spots
of this epidemic. There are more than 110 Million infected cases on the globe,
sofar. Due to its promptness and effective results computed tomography
(CT)-scan image is preferred to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Early detection and isolation of the patient is the only
possible way of controlling the spread of the disease. Automated analysis of
CT-Scans can provide enormous support in this process. In this article, We
propose a novel approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CT-scan images. Our method
is based on a very intuitive and natural idea of analyzing shapes, an attempt
to mimic a professional medic. We mainly trace SARS-CoV-2 features by
quantifying their topological properties. We primarily use a tool called
persistent homology, from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), to compute these
topological properties. We train and test our model on the ""SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan
dataset"" \citep{soares2020sars}, an open-source dataset, containing 2,481
CT-scans of normal and COVID-19 patients. Our model yielded an overall
benchmark F1 score of $99.42\% $, accuracy $99.416\%$, precision $99.41\%$, and
recall $99.42\%$. The TDA techniques have great potential that can be utilized
for efficient and prompt detection of COVID-19. The immense potential of TDA
may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally,
in particular in the low and middle-income countries where RT-PCR labs and/or
kits are in a serious crisis.

fairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies
voting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times,
electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is
comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.

winds. Here we show, using both the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the
measured gravity field, that the observed cloud-level wind profile between
25$^{\circ}$S and 25$^{\circ}$N must extend unaltered to depths of thousands of
kilometers. Poleward, the midlatitude deep jets also contribute to the gravity
signal, but might differ somewhat from the cloud-level winds. We analyze the

using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and combine them with archival

of the powerful radio loud galaxies in the local Universe. ULIRGs are
characterized by large infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}>$10$^{12}$L$\odot$),
large dust masses ($\sim10^{8}M_{\odot}$) and vigorous star formation (star
formation rates $\sim$10-100 $M_{\odot}~$yr$^{-1}$). Studies show that they
represent the end stages of mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies. Their
luminosity can be due to both starburst activity and active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We study a sample of 13 ULIRGs that have optically identified AGN
characteristics with 1.28~GHz GMRT observations. Our aim is to resolve any
core-jet structures or nuclear extensions and hence examine whether the ULIRGs
are evolving into radio loud ellipticals. Our deep, low frequency observations
show marginal extension for only one source. However, the integrated radio
spectra of 9 ULIRGs show characteristics that are similar to that of
GPS/CSS/CSO/young radio sources. The estimated spectral ages are 0.4 to 20 Myr
and indicate that they are young radio sources and possible progenitors of
radio galaxies. Hence, we conclude that although most ULIRGs do not show kpc
scale extended radio emission associated with nuclear activity, their radio
spectral energy distributions do show signatures of young radio galaxies.

the involution is the Galois involution then a recent conjecture of Dipendra
Prasad predicts a formula for the dimension of the space of invariant linear

conjecture (in the generic case) for $SL(n)$ which is joint work with Dipendra
Prasad. Then we describe one more newly discovered connection between
distinction and base change which is that base change information appears in
the constant of proportionality between two natural invariant linear forms on a
distinguished representation. This latter result is for discrete series for
$GL(n)$ and is joint with Nadir Matringe. This paper is a report on the

$\mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R})$ of the totally nonzero Grassmannian
$Gr^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R})$ is mentioned and the parameter spaces are

$\mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R})$ of strata under suitable actions of the

\mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}), ((\mathbb{R}^*)^n\rtimes S_n)\backslash

Interestingly enough, the enumerated value of the isomorphism classes of the
generic point arrangements in the Euclidean plane is expressed in terms of the
number theoretic Euler-totient function. The analogous enumeration questions
are still open in higher dimensions for $m\geq 3$.

learning (MARL). One of the reasons is the policy changes of agents during the
learning process. Some existing works have discussed various consequences
caused by non-stationarity with several kinds of measurement indicators. This
makes the objectives or goals of existing algorithms are inevitably
inconsistent and disparate. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion, the
$\delta$-measurement, to explicitly measure the non-stationarity of a policy
sequence, which can be further proved to be bounded by the KL-divergence of
consecutive joint policies. A straightforward but highly non-trivial way is to
control the joint policies' divergence, which is difficult to estimate
accurately by imposing the trust-region constraint on the joint policy.
Although it has lower computational complexity to decompose the joint policy
and impose trust-region constraints on the factorized policies, simple policy
factorization like mean-field approximation will lead to more considerable
policy divergence, which can be considered as the trust-region decomposition
dilemma. We model the joint policy as a pairwise Markov random field and
propose a trust-region decomposition network (TRD-Net) based on message passing
to estimate the joint policy divergence more accurately. The Multi-Agent Mirror
descent policy algorithm with Trust region decomposition, called MAMT, is
established by adjusting the trust-region of the local policies adaptively in
an end-to-end manner. MAMT can approximately constrain the consecutive joint
policies' divergence to satisfy $\delta$-stationarity and alleviate the
non-stationarity problem. Our method can bring noticeable and stable
performance improvement compared with baselines in cooperative tasks of
different complexity.

scheme for minimizing the number of dominant absorbing sets in order to improve
its performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Since the
parity-check matrices of different nested sub-codes partially overlap, the
optimization of one nested sub-code imposes constraints on the optimization of
the other sub-codes. To tackle these constraints, a multi-step optimization
process is applied first to one of the nested codes, then sequential
optimization of the remaining nested codes is carried out based on the
constraints imposed by the previously optimized sub-codes. Results show that
the order of optimization has a significant impact on the number of dominant
absorbing sets in the Tanner graph of the code, resulting in a tradeoff between
the performance of a nested code structure and its optimization sequence: the
code which is optimized without constraints has fewer harmful structures than
the code which is optimized with constraints. We also show that for certain
code parameters, dominant absorbing sets in the Tanner graphs of all nested
codes are completely removed using our proposed optimization strategy.

and an assumed model for the true distribution of transients in/around their
host galaxies. Using simulated transients placed in the well-studied COSMOS
field, we consider several agnostic and physically motivated priors and offset
distributions to explore the method sensitivity. We then apply the methodology
to the set of 13~fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized with an uncertainty of
several arcseconds. Our methodology finds nine of these are securely associated
to a single host galaxy, P(O_i|x)>0.95. We examine the observed and intrinsic
properties of these secure FRB hosts, recovering similar distributions as
previous works. Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the apparent
magnitude of the securely identified host galaxies and the estimated cosmic
dispersion measures of the corresponding FRBs, which results from the Macquart
relation. Future work with FRBs will leverage this relation and other measures
from the secure hosts as priors for future associations. The methodology is
generic to transient type, localization error, and image quality. We encourage
its application to other transients where host galaxy associations are critical

supernovae. We have encoded the technique in Python on GitHub:

of this undertaking propelled the rapid development of Internet which has
evidently brought about unprecedented paradigm shifts in the use of Information

Furthermore, the penetration of ICTs to other spheres of our daily lives is
evidence enough that the impacts thereof go beyond mere communicative facets of
our lives. However, many challenges arose in the implementation of
telecommunications reforms. In order to achieve the status quo, government had
to make strategic liberalisation policies in the telecoms sector that saw the
opening up of the international communication gateways to the private sector.
This is in tandem with the fact that the relationship between government
(through its formulation of policies and regulations) and other stakeholders
determines the ability of a country to generate and use advanced knowledge for
industrial competitiveness. As such, in this paper, we present the genesis and
evaluate the impacts associated with the telecommunications reforms and the
subsequent liberalisation of international communication gateways, and Internet
development in Zambia. We further consider the challenges this has brought
about and discuss possible future directions. This is helpful in forecasting

a treatment on an outcome into different causal pathways and to quantify the
causal effect in each pathway. For instance, in causal fairness, the total
effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect
on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee's
occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal
statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal
mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling
confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among
treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential
ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often
unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential
ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy
strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously
uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate
the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We
further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.

  Systems (NeurIPS 2021)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the
classes that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.
Such class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to
handle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical
cases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not
to miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True
Positive Rates (TPRs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost
of very high False Positive Rates (FPRs) for problems with class imbalance.
Existing methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this
into account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by
emphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of
the positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To
this end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a
constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be
used with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve
(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting
constrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).
Going beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed
constraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental
results for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications
using an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the
cases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the
misclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.

to optimization algorithms to improve performance in problems with high
dimensionality. To demonstrate this method, a conditional generative
adversarial network (C-GAN) is used to augment the solutions produced by a
genetic algorithm (GA) for a 311-dimensional nonconvex multi-objective
mixed-integer nonlinear optimization. The C-GAN, composed of two networks with
three fully connected hidden layers, is trained on solutions generated by GA,
and then given sets of desired labels (i.e., objective function values),
generates complementary solutions corresponding to those labels. Six
experiments are conducted to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed method.
The generated complementary solutions are compared to the original solutions in
terms of optimality and diversity. The generative model generates solutions
with objective functions up to 100% better, and with hypervolumes up to 100%
higher, than the original solutions. These findings show that a C-GAN with even
a simple training approach and architecture can, with a much shorter runtime,
highly improve the diversity and optimality of solutions found by an
optimization algorithm for a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem.

mathematically. In the last few decades, the field of network optimization has
witnessed an upsurge of interest among researchers and practitioners. The
network models considered in this thesis are broadly classified into four types
including transportation problem, shortest path problem, minimum spanning tree
problem and maximum flow problem. Quite often, we come across situations, when
the decision parameters of network optimization problems are not precise and
characterized by various forms of uncertainties arising from the factors, like
insufficient or incomplete data, lack of evidence, inappropriate judgements and
randomness. Considering the deterministic environment, there exist several
studies on network optimization problems. However, in the literature, not many
investigations on single and multi objective network optimization problems are
observed under diverse uncertain frameworks. This thesis proposes seven
different network models under different uncertain paradigms. Here, the
uncertain programming techniques used to formulate the uncertain network models
are (i) expected value model, (ii) chance constrained model and (iii) dependent
chance constrained model. Subsequently, the corresponding crisp equivalents of
the uncertain network models are solved using different solution methodologies.
The solution methodologies used in this thesis can be broadly categorized as
classical methods and evolutionary algorithms. The classical methods, used in
this thesis, are Dijkstra and Kruskal algorithms, modified rough Dijkstra
algorithm, global criterion method, epsilon constraint method and fuzzy
programming method. Whereas, among the evolutionary algorithms, we have
proposed the varying population genetic algorithm with indeterminate crossover

that, for both games, the thresholds prevent equalizing ZD strategies from
existing. In the snowdrift game, introducing a cooperator threshold has no
effect on the region of feasible extortionate ZD strategies. For extortionate
strategies in the public goods game, the threshold only restricts the region of
enforceable strategies for small values of the public goods multiplier.
Generous ZD strategies exist for both games, but introducing a cooperator
threshold forces the slope more towards the value of a fair strategy, where the
player has approximately the same payoff as the average payoff of his
opponents.

  global optimization algorithm",,,,,"physics.acc-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy beamlines of synchrotron
radiation facilities, it is important to keep X-ray spectrometer operating in
optimal conditions. The adjusting process is normally very time consuming due
to the irregular light source beam point, and it is difficult to get global
optimum. This study aims to develop an intelligent adjusting system based on
global optimization algorithm for high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy
beamline commissioning. First of all, based on the two dimensional experimental
data, automatic adjustment process was established. Then the automatic
optimization was applied to adjust X-ray spectrometer practically, and upgraded
iteratively. Online tests results show that this automatic adjustment process
converges to the optimal solution quickly, and the convergence time is about
several hundred steps, more efficient than manual optimization process. After
automatic adjustment, we can get correct X-ray spectrum based on the adjusted
spectrometer.
