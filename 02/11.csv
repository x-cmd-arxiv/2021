size of the interaction region allows for scans of the HHG yield along the
propagation axis. Further, by measuring the ionization yield in unison with the
extreme ultraviolet (XUV) we are able to distinguish regions of maximum
ionization from regions of optimum XUV generation. This distinction is of great
importance for BG fields as the generation of BG beams with axicons often leads
to oscillations of the on-axis intensity, which can be exploited for extended
phase matching conditions. We observed such oscillations in the ionization and
XUV flux along the propagation axis for the first time. As it is the case for
Gaussian modes, the harmonic yield is not maximum at the point of highest
ionization. Finally, despite Bessel beams having a hole in the center in the
far field, the XUV beam is well collimated making BG modes a great alternative
when spatial filtering of the fundamental is desired.

number of $K_{r + 1}$-free graphs with large minimum degree, and in the case $r

of triangle-free graphs: for each $k$, what minimum degree guarantees that a
triangle-free graph is $k$-colourable? The profile has been extensively studied
and was finally determined by Brandt and Thomass\'{e}.
  Triangle-free graphs are exactly those in which each neighbourhood is
one-colourable. As a natural variant, \L uczak and Thomass\'{e} introduced the
notion of a locally bipartite graph in which each neighbourhood is
2-colourable. Here we study the chromatic profile of the family of graphs in
which every neighbourhood is $b$-colourable (locally $b$-partite graphs) as
well as the family where the common neighbourhood of every $a$-clique is
$b$-colourable. Our results include the chromatic thresholds of these families
as well as showing that every $n$-vertex locally $b$-partite graph with minimum

Understanding these locally colourable graphs is crucial for extending the

light-front and instant-form kinematic subgroups is established using
non-perturbative methods. The difficulty with field theoretic formulations of
Dirac's forms of dynamics is that the free and interacting unitary
representations of the Poincar\'e group are defined on inequivalent
representations of the Hilbert space, which means that the concept of kinematic
transformations must be modified on the Hilbert space of the field theory. This
work addresses this problem by assuming the existence of a field theory with
the expected properties and constructs equivalent representations with instant
and front form kinematic subgroups. In this construction both the light-front
and instant-form formulations share the same vacuum and one-particle states.
The free field Fock space plays no role. There is no ""quantization"" of a
classical theory. The property that survives from the perturbative approach is
the notion of a kinematic subgroup, which means kinematic Poincar\'e
transformations can be trivially implemented by acting on suitable basis
vectors. This non-perturbative approach avoids dealing with issues that arise
in perturbative treatments where is it necessary to have a consistent treatment
of renormalization, rotational covariance, and the structure of the light-front
vacuum. While addressing these issues in a computational framework is important
for applications, this work may provide some insight into the nature of the
expected resolution and identifies the origin of some of differences between
the perturbative and non-perturbative approaches.

constituting ca. 80% of all known species, they are difficult to study due to
their small size and similarity between species. Conventional monitoring
techniques depend on time consuming trapping methods and tedious
microscope-based work by skilled experts in order to identify the caught insect
specimen at species, or even family level. Researchers and policy makers are in
urgent need of a scalable monitoring tool in order to conserve biodiversity and
secure human food production due to the rapid decline in insect numbers.
  In order to improve upon existing insect clustering methods, we propose an
adaptive variant of the variational autoencoder (VAE) which is capable of
clustering data by phylogenetic groups. The proposed dynamic beta-VAE
dynamically adapts the scaling of the reconstruction and regularization loss
terms (beta value) yielding useful latent representations of the input data. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the dynamic beta-VAE on optically recorded insect
signals from regions of southern Scandinavia to cluster unlabelled targets into
possible species. We also demonstrate improved clustering performance in a
semi-supervised setting using a small subset of labelled data. These
experimental results, in both unsupervised- and semi-supervised settings, with
the dynamic beta-VAE are promising and, in the near future, can be deployed to
monitor insects and conserve the rapidly declining insect biodiversity.

require the simultaneous calculation of the spatial variation of concentration
of dozens of diffusing chemical species. Machine learning surrogates, neural
networks trained to provide approximate solutions to such complicated numerical
problems, can often provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude compared
to direct calculation. PDE surrogates enable use of larger models than are
possible with direct calculation and can make including such simulations in
real-time or near-real time workflows practical. Creating a surrogate requires
running the direct calculation tens of thousands of times to generate training
data and then training the neural network, both of which are computationally
expensive. We use a Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the stationary
solution to the diffusion equation in the case of two equal-diameter, circular,
constant-value sources located at random positions in a two-dimensional square
domain with absorbing boundary conditions. To improve convergence during
training, we apply a training approach that uses roll-back to reject stochastic
changes to the network that increase the loss function. The trained neural
network approximation is about 1e3 times faster than the direct calculation for
individual replicas. Because different applications will have different
criteria for acceptable approximation accuracy, we discuss a variety of loss
functions and accuracy estimators that can help select the best network for a

in Chemical Species Tomography (CST). The traditional implementation of CST
generally places the target field in the central region of laser sensing, the
so-called Region of Interest (RoI), with uniform-size meshes. The centre of the
RoI locates at the midpoint between the laser emitters and receivers, while the
size of the RoI is empirically determined by the optical layout. A too small
RoI cannot make the most use of laser beams, while a too large one leads to
much severer rank deficiency in CST. To solve the above-mentioned issues, we
introduce hybrid-size meshing, for the first time, by reforming the density of
the pixels in the entire sensing region of CST. This development alleviates the
ill-posedness of the CST inverse problem by detailing the target flow field
with dense pixels in the RoI and fully considering the complete physical
absorption model with sparse pixels out of the RoI. The proposed scheme was
both numerically and experimentally validated using a CST sensor with 32 laser
beams using a variety of computational tomographic algorithms. The images
reconstructed using the hybrid-size meshing scheme show better accuracy and
finer profile of the target flow, compared with those reconstructed using the
traditionally uniform-size meshing. The proposed hybrid-size meshing scheme
significantly facilitates the industrial application of CST towards practical
combustors, in which the combustion zone is bypassed by cooling air. In these
scenarios, the proposed scheme can better characterise the combustion zone with
dense meshes, while maintaining the integrity of the physical model by
considering the absorption in the bypass air with sparse meshes.

disseminate both distally via the release and diffusion of cell-free virus
through the medium, and locally via direct, cell-to-cell transmission. To
determine the relative contribution of each mode of infection to HCV
dissemination, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that explicitly
incorporates both distal and local modes of infection. The ABM tracks the
concentration of extracellular infectious virus in the supernatant and the
number of intracellular HCV RNA segments within each infected cell over the
course of simulated in vitro HCV infections. Experimental data for in vitro HCV
infections conducted in the presence and absence of free-virus neutralizing
antibodies was used to validate the ABM and constrain the value of its
parameters. We found that direct, cell-to-cell infection accounts for 99%
(84%$-$100%, 95% credible interval) of infection events, making it the dominant
mode of HCV dissemination in vitro. Yet, when infection via the free-virus
route is blocked, a 57% reduction in the number of infection events at 72 hpi
is observed experimentally; a result consistent with that found by our ABM.
Taken together, these findings suggest that while HCV spread via cell-free
virus contributes little to the total number of infection events in vitro, it
plays a critical role in enhancing cell-to-cell HCV dissemination by providing
access to distant, uninfected areas, away from the already established large
infection foci.

and a key issue in many applications, e.g., in medical imaging, microscopy,
document analysis and remote sensing. According to the human perception, image
segmentation is the process of dividing an image into non-overlapping regions.
These regions, which may correspond, e.g., to different objects, are
fundamental for the correct interpretation and classification of the scene
represented by the image. The division into regions is not unique, but it
depends on the application, i.e., it must be driven by the final goal of the
segmentation and hence by the most significant features with respect to that
goal. Thus, image segmentation can be regarded as a strongly ill-posed problem.
A classical approach to deal with ill posedness consists in incorporating in
the model a-priori information about the solution, e.g., in the form of penalty
terms. In this work we provide a brief overview of basic computational models
for image segmentation, focusing on edge-based and region-based variational
models, as well as on statistical and machine-learning approaches. We also
sketch numerical methods that are applied in computing solutions to these
models. In our opinion, our view can help the readers identify suitable classes

nuclei up to 100 TeV. Among the main scientific objectives is the precise
measurement of the cosmic electron+positron flux, which due to the very large
proton background in orbit requires a powerful particle identification method.
In the past decade, the field of machine learning has provided us the needed
tools. This paper presents a neural network based approach to cosmic electron
identification and proton rejection and showcases its performances based on
simulated Monte Carlo data. The neural network reaches significantly lower
background than the classical, cut-based method for the same detection
efficiency, especially at highest energies. A good matching between simulations
and real data completes the picture.

extended gravity theories. First, we formulate the polarizations in linear
massive gravity (MG) with generic mass terms of non-Fierz-Pauli type by
identifying all the independent variables that obey Klein-Gordon-type
equations. The dynamical degrees of freedom (dofs) in the generic MG consist of
spin-2 and spin-0 modes, the former breaking down into two tensor (helicity-2),
two vector (helicity-1) and one scalar (helicity-0) components, while the
latter just corresponding to a scalar. We find convenient ways of decomposing
the two scalar modes of each spin into distinct linear combinations of the
transverse and longitudinal polarizations with coefficients directly expressed
by the mass parameters, thereby serving as a useful tool in measuring the
masses of GWs. Then we analyze the linear perturbations of generic
higher-curvature gravity (HCG) whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary polynomial of
the Riemann tensor. On a flat background, the linear dynamical dofs in this
theory are identified as massless spin-2, massive spin-2, and massive spin-0
modes. As its massive part encompasses the identical structure to the generic
MG, GWs in the generic HCG provide six massive polarizations on top of the
ordinary two massless modes. In parallel to MG, we find convenient
representations for the scalar-polarization modes directly connected to the
parameters of HCG. In this analysis, we employ two distinct methods; One takes
full advantage of the partial equivalence between the generic HCG and MG at the
linear level, whereas the other relies upon a gauge-invariant formalism. We
confirm that the two results agree. We also discuss methods to determine the
theory parameters by GW-polarization measurements. Our method does not require
measuring the propagation speeds or the details of the waveforms of the GWs.

Powerful ML algorithms such as neural networks or ensemble methods are
notoriously difficult to interpret. Here, we introduce the novel Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm (Lundberg & Lee, 2017), a game-theoretic
approach that explains the output of a given ML model, in the fluid dynamics
context. We give a proof of concept concerning SHAP as an explainable AI method
providing useful and human-interpretable insight for fluid dynamics. To show
that the feature importance ranking provided by SHAP can be interpreted
physically, we first consider data from an established low-dimensional model
based on the self-sustaining process (SSP) in wall-bounded shear flows, where
each data feature has a clear physical and dynamical interpretation in terms of
known representative features of the near-wall dynamics, i.e. streamwise
vortices, streaks and linear streak instabilities. SHAP determines consistently
that only the laminar profile, the streamwise vortex, and a specific streak
instability play a major role in the prediction. We demonstrate that the method
can be applied to larger fluid dynamics datasets by a SHAP evaluation on plane
Couette flow in a minimal flow unit focussing on the relevance of streaks and
their instabilities for the prediction of relaminarisation events. Here, we
find that the prediction is based on proxies for streak modulations
corresponding to linear streak instabilities within the SSP. That is, the SHAP
analysis suggests that the break-up of the self-sustaining cycle is connected
with a suppression of streak instabilities.

numerical instabilities during gradient-based optimization. We address this

learning to medical images. The approach is either to fine-tune a pre-trained
model or use it as a feature extractor. Most modern architecture contain batch
normalisation layers, and fine-tuning a model with such layers requires taking
a few precautions as they consist of trainable and non-trainable weights and
have two operating modes: training and inference. Attention is primarily given
to the non-trainable weights used during inference, as they are the primary
source of unexpected behaviour or degradation in performance during transfer
learning. It is typically recommended to fine-tune the model with the batch
normalisation layers kept in inference mode during both training and inference.
In this paper, we pay closer attention instead to the trainable weights of the
batch normalisation layers, and we explore their expressive influence in the
context of transfer learning. We find that only fine-tuning the trainable
weights (scale and centre) of the batch normalisation layers leads to similar
performance as to fine-tuning all of the weights, with the added benefit of
faster convergence. We demonstrate this on a variety of seven publicly
available medical imaging datasets, using four different model architectures.

that these encodings can lead to a reduction of the effective error strength at

some threshold value to logical noise with variance upper bounded by any

is only a function of the amount of squeezing and independent of the number of

extensively studied for half a century. In the classic version of this problem,
we are given two matroids $\mathcal{M}_1 = (V, \mathcal{I}_1)$ and
$\mathcal{M}_2 = (V, \mathcal{I}_2)$ on a comment ground set $V$ of $n$
elements, and then we have to find the largest common independent set $S \in

form ""Is $S \in \mathcal{I}_1$?"" or ""Is $S \in \mathcal{I}_2$?"" for $S
\subseteq V$. The goal is to minimize the number of queries.
  Beating the existing $\tilde O(n^2)$ bound, known as the quadratic barrier,
is an open problem that captures the limits of techniques from two lines of
work. The first one is the classic Cunningham's algorithm [SICOMP 1986], whose
$\tilde O(n^2)$-query implementations were shown by CLS+ [FOCS 2019] and Nguyen
[2019]. The other one is the general cutting plane method of Lee, Sidford, and
Wong [FOCS 2015]. The only progress towards breaking the quadratic barrier
requires either approximation algorithms or a more powerful rank oracle query
[CLS+ FOCS 2019]. No exact algorithm with $o(n^2)$ independence queries was
known.
  In this work, we break the quadratic barrier with a randomized algorithm
guaranteeing $\tilde O(n^{9/5})$ independence queries with high probability,
and a deterministic algorithm guaranteeing $\tilde O(n^{11/6})$ independence
queries. Our key insight is simple and fast algorithms to solve a graph
reachability problem that arose in the standard augmenting path framework

criterion, namely that semi-classical transition amplitudes from the early
universe up to current field values should be well defined. On a classical
level, our criterion is weaker than the Barrow-Tipler principle, but it has the
advantage of being sensitive to quantum effects. We find significant
consequences for early universe models, in particular: eternal inflation and
strictly cyclic universes are ruled out. Within general relativity, the first
phase of evolution cannot be inflationary, and it can be ekpyrotic only if the
scalar field potential is trustworthy over an infinite field range. Quadratic
gravity eliminates all non-accelerating backgrounds near a putative big bang
(thus imposing favourable initial conditions for inflation), while the expected
infinite series of higher-curvature quantum corrections eliminates Lorentzian
big bang spacetimes altogether. The scenarios that work best with the principle
of finite amplitudes are the no-boundary proposal, which gives finite
amplitudes in all dynamical theories that we have studied, and string-inspired
loitering phases. We also comment on the relationship of our proposal to the

of more than ~2 MK. At low frequencies (decimetric and metric wavelengths),
scattering and refraction of electromagnetic waves are thought to considerably
increase the imaged radio source sizes (up to a few arcminutes). However,
exactly how source size relates to scattering due to turbulence is still
subject to investigation. The theoretical predictions relating source
broadening to propagation effects have not been fully confirmed by observations
due to the rarity of high spatial resolution observations of the solar corona
at low frequencies. Here, the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) was used to observe
the solar corona at 120-180 MHz using baselines of up to ~3.5 km (corresponding
to a resolution of ~1-2') during the partial solar eclipse of 2015 March 20. A
lunar de-occultation technique was used to achieve higher spatial resolution
(~0.6') than that attainable via standard interferometric imaging (~2.4'). This
provides a means of studying the contribution of scattering to apparent source
size broadening. It was found that the de-occultation technique reveals a more
structured quiet corona that is not resolved from standard imaging, implying
scattering may be overestimated in this region when using standard imaging
techniques. However, an active region source was measured to be ~4' using both
de-occultation and standard imaging. This may be explained by the increased
scattering of radio waves by turbulent density fluctuations in active regions,
which is more severe than in the quiet Sun.

this data can in principle be re-analyzed to measure the polarization as a
function of the transverse momentum of the $\Lambda$ baryon with respect to the
lepton pair. This observable could be the first significant probe of the
function, $D_{T}$. In this paper, we first develop a TMD formalism for
$\Lambda$ polarization; we then present a recent twist-3 formalism that was
established to describe $\Lambda$ polarization. Using the TMD formalism, we
demonstrate that the $\Lambda$ polarization at OPAL and Belle can be described
using the twist-2 TMD factorization formalism. Finally, we make a theoretical
prediction for this polarization in the collinear twist-3 formalism at Belle.

to identify the dynamic underlying associations across the normalized growth
measurements of the COVID-19 cumulative case, recovery, and death counts, and
those of the exchange rate, and stock market indices, using data over 203 days

shock to the growth of exchange rate was seen to persist for around 10+ days,
and that for stock exchange was seen to be around 15 days. The models capture
the contemporaneous nature of these shocks and the subsequent responses,
potentially guiding to inform policy decisions at a national level. Further,
causal inference-based analyses would allow us to infer relationships that are
stronger than mere associations.

nonparametric test for tackling the two-sample problem. Its statistic is given
by the difference in expectations of the witness function, a real-valued
function defined as a weighted sum of kernel evaluations on a set of basis

testing is performed on a separate test set to avoid overfitting (i.e., control
type-I error). That is, the test set is used to simultaneously estimate the

select the kernel and is discarded. In this work, we propose to use the
training data to also define the weights and the basis points for better data
efficiency. We show that 1) the new test is consistent and has a
well-controlled type-I error; 2) the optimal witness function is given by a
precision-weighted mean in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with

This doping explains the presence of oxygen vacancies at the surface that

provide the essential PMS functions as modules which can be easily chosen and
combined for sensing in different scenarios. The scenario-based description
feature allows organizers to easily and quickly set up a new participatory

and participate in the sensing. Moreover, ParmoSense provides GUI tools as well
for creating and distributing PMS system easily, editing and visualizing
collected data quickly. It also provides multiple functions for encouraging
participants' motivation for sustainable operation of the system. Through
performance comparison with existing PMS platforms, we confirmed ParmoSense
shows the best cost-performance in the perspective of the workload for
preparing PMS system and varieties of functions. In addition, to evaluate the
availability and usability of ParmoSense, we conducted 19 case studies, which
have different locations, scales, and purposes, over 4 years with cooperation

randomly selected time-variant phase shift on the reflected signal. To
facilitate the performance analysis of a RRS-assisted system, first, we present
novel closed-form expressions for the probability density function, the
cumulative distribution function, the moments, and the characteristic function
of the distribution of the sum of double-Nakagami-m random vectors, whose
amplitudes follow the double-Nakagami-m distribution, i.e., the distribution of
the product of two Nakagami-m random variables, and phases follow the circular
uniform distribution. We also consider a special case of this distribution,
namely the distribution of the sum of Rayleigh-Nakagami-m random vectors. Then,
we exploit these expressions to investigate the performance of the RRS-assisted
composite channel, assuming that the two links undergo Nakagami-m fading and
the equivalent phase follows the circular uniform distribution. Closed-form
expressions for the outage probability, the average received signal-to-noise
ratio, the ergodic capacity, the bit error probability, the amount of fading,
and the channel quality estimation index are provided to evaluate the
performance of the considered system. These metrics are also derived for the
practical special case where one of the two links undergoes Rayleigh fading.

shrouded bladed disk with frictional contacts at the shrouds and the contact
interface evolution. Prediction of fretting wear commonly occurring at the
contacts of turbomachinery components, and its impact on the dynamics is
increasingly researched due to the components subjected to their structural
limits for performance and operating at high loading conditions. Over a
lifetime, the fretting wear at these contacts could alter the global dynamic
response of these bladed disks from the designed operating point and could lead
to high vibration amplitudes. This study implements a coupled static/dynamic
harmonic balance method (HBM) with wear energy approach and an adaptive wear
logic to study the impact on the steady-state nonlinear dynamic response.
Firstly, the methodology is applied to a cantilever beam with a contact patch
and then to a shrouded bladed disk with shroud contacts using cyclic symmetry
boundary conditions. The novelty of the paper is to show the effect of wear on
the dynamics with the changing contact pre-load using a coupled approach. A
wear acceleration $v_{w,max}$ parameter is defined, and the impact of the
choice of this parameter is discussed in detail on the computation time and the
accuracy of results. The test cases demonstrate the impact of wear on the
dynamic nonlinear response curves and the contact interface evolution for
various scenarios.

insufficient operational intensity, parallelism, and execution efficiency.
These insights let us create a DC-accelerator-optimized search space, with
space-to-depth, space-to-batch, hybrid fused convolution structures with
vanilla and depthwise convolutions, and block-wise activation functions. On top
of our DC accelerator optimized neural architecture search space, we further
propose a latency-aware compound scaling (LACS), the first multi-objective

discovers that network depth should grow much faster than image size and
network width, which is quite different from previous compound scaling results.
With the new search space and LACS, our search and scaling on datacenter
accelerators results in a new model series named EfficientNet-X. EfficientNet-X

interactions at lower power and reduce the number of competing nonlinear

parametric oscillation in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic circuit. Our

metal deficiency for massive protocluster galaxies favors a model in which
funneling of the primordial cold gas through filaments dilutes the metal
content of protoclusters at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 2$). At these redshifts,
gas reservoirs in filaments are dense enough to cool down rapidly and fall into
the potential well of the protocluster to lower the gas-phase metallicity of

galaxy interactions which are more prevalent in dense environments.

normalized image pyramid (SNIP) is generated that, like human vision, only
attends to objects within a fixed size range at different scales. Such a
restriction of objects' size during training affords better learning of
object-sensitive filters, and therefore, results in better accuracy. However,
the use of an image pyramid increases the computational cost. Hence, we propose
an efficient spatial sub-sampling scheme which only operates on fixed-size
sub-regions likely to contain objects (as object locations are known during
training). The resulting approach, referred to as Scale Normalized Image
Pyramid with Efficient Resampling or SNIPER, yields up to 3 times speed-up
during training. Unfortunately, as object locations are unknown during
inference, the entire image pyramid still needs processing. To this end, we
adopt a coarse-to-fine approach, and predict the locations and extent of
object-like regions which will be processed in successive scales of the image
pyramid. Intuitively, it's akin to our active human-vision that first skims
over the field-of-view to spot interesting regions for further processing and
only recognizes objects at the right resolution. The resulting algorithm is
referred to as AutoFocus and results in a 2.5-5 times speed-up during inference

excess is the extended emission from a unresolved population of millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic bulge. Such a population would, along with the
prompt $\gamma$ rays, also inject large quantities of electrons/positrons
($e^\pm$) into the interstellar medium. These $e^\pm$ could potentially
inverse-Compton (IC) scatter ambient photons into $\gamma$ rays that fall
within the sensitivity range of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
In this article, we examine the detection potential of CTA to this signature by
making a realistic estimation of the systematic uncertainties on the Galactic
diffuse emission model at TeV-scale $\gamma$-ray energies. We forecast that, in
the event that $e^\pm$ injection spectra are harder than $E^{-2}$, CTA has the
potential to robustly discover the IC signature of a putative Galactic bulge
MSP population sufficient to explain the GCE for $e^\pm$ injection efficiencies
in the range $\approx 2.9-74.1\%$, or higher, depending on the level of
mismodeling of the Galactic diffuse emission components. On the other hand, for
spectra softer than $E^{-2.5}$, a reliable CTA detection would require an
unphysically large $e^\pm$ injection efficiency of $\gtrsim 158\%$. However,
even this pessimistic conclusion may be avoided in the plausible event that MSP
observational and/or modeling uncertainties can be reduced. We further find
that, in the event that an IC signal were detected, CTA can successfully
discriminate between an MSP and a dark matter origin for the radiating $e^\pm$.

reported as LIGO/Virgo sources or source candidates. CE is even considered by
some as a mandatory phase in the formation of BH-BH, BH-NS or NS-NS mergers in
binary evolution. At the moment, there is no full first-principles model for
development of CE. We employ the Startrack population synthesis code to test
the current advancements in studies on stability of RLOF for massive donors to
assess their effect on LIGO/Virgo source population. In particular, we allow
for more restrictive CE development criteria for massive donors. We also test a
modified condition for switching between different types of stable mass
transfer. Implemented modifications significantly influence basic properties of
merging double compact objects, sometimes in non-intuitive way. For one of
tested models with restricted CE development criteria local merger rate density
for BH-BH systems increased due to emergence of a new dominant formation
scenario without any CE phase. We find that the changes in highly uncertain
assumptions on RLOF physics may significantly affect (i) local merger rate
density, (ii) shape of the mass and mass ratio distributions, and (iii)
dominant evolutionary formation (with and without CE) scenarios of LIGO/Virgo
sources. Our results demonstrate that without sufficiently strong constraints

during the wustite reduction step which is dramatically slower than the
hematite reduction. Many rate-limiting factors of this reaction are set by the
micro- and nanostructure as well as the local chemistry of the ores. Their
quantification allows knowledge-driven ore preparation and process optimization
to make the hydrogen-based reduction of iron ores commercially viable, enabling
the required massive CO2 mitigation to ease global warming. Here, we report on
a multi-scale structure and composition analysis of iron reduced from hematite
with pure H2, reaching down to near-atomic scale.

predictor based on cascaded feedforward neural network is proposed. The
proposed method aims to identify anomaly due to cyber or physical disturbances

protocol is a major challenge because successive changes in links or breakdowns
destabilize the network topology. Therefore, choosing the right route in this
type of network due to resource constraints and their operating environment is
one of the most important challenges in these networks. Therefore, the main
purpose of these networks is to collect appropriate routing information about
the environment around the network sensors while observing the energy
consumption of the sensors. One of the important approaches to reduce energy
consumption in sensor networks is the use of the clustering technique, but in
most clustering methods, only the criterion of the amount of energy of the
cluster or the distance of members to the cluster has been considered.
Therefore, in this paper, a method is presented using the firefly algorithm and
using the four criteria of residual energy, noise rate, number of hops, and
distance. The proposed method called EM-FIREFLY is introduced which selects the
best cluster head with high attractiveness and based on the fitness function
and transfers the data packets through these cluster head to the sink. The
proposed method is evaluated with NS-2 simulator and compared with the
algorithm-PSO and optimal clustering methods. The evaluation results show the
efficiency of the EM-FIREFLY method in maximum relative load and network

the quark mixing pattern is generated by the spontaneous breaking of the
discrete symmetries due to flavons that act as Froggatt-Nielsen fields. The
tiny neutrino masses arise from a radiative seesaw mechanism at one loop level,
thanks to a preserved $Z_2^{\left( 1\right)}$ discrete symmetry, which also
leads to stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. The leptonic
sector features the predictive cobimaximal mixing pattern, consistent with the
experimental data from neutrino oscillations. For the scenario of normal
neutrino mass hierarchy, the model predicts an effective Majorana neutrino mass
parameter in the range $3$~meV$\lesssim m_{\beta\beta}\lesssim$ $18$ meV, which
is within the declared range of sensitivity of modern experiments. The model

characterized by a periodicity dependent on the direction between the localized

electron-electron (phonon) interactions and non-trivial Bloch wavefunctions
associated with the narrow bands. Inspired by recent experiments, we focus on
two independent quantities that are considerably modified by Coulomb
interaction driven band renormalization, namely the density of states and the
minimal spatial extent associated with the Wannier functions. First, we show
that a filling-dependent enhancement of the density of states, caused by band
flattening, in combination with phonon-mediated attraction due to
electron-phonon umklapp processes, increases the tendency towards
superconducting pairing in a range of angles around magic-angle. Second, we
demonstrate that the minimal spatial extent associated with the Wannier

stiffness, also develops a non-trivial enhancement due to the interaction
induced renormalization of the Bloch wavefunctions. While our modeling of
superconductivity assumes a weak electron-phonon coupling and does not consider

follow-up campaign of AT2018bwo (DLT18x), a LRN discovered in NGC45, and
investigate its progenitor system using binary stellar-evolution models. The
transient reached a peak magnitude of $M_r=-10.97\pm0.11$ and maintained this
brightness during its optical plateau of $t_p = 41\pm5$days. During this phase,
it showed a rather stable photospheric temperature of ~3300K and a luminosity
of ~$10^{40}$erg/s. The photosphere of AT2018bwo at early times appeared larger
and cooler than other similar LRNe, likely due to an extended mass-loss episode
before the merger. Towards the end of the plateau, optical spectra showed a
reddened continuum with strong molecular absorption bands. The reprocessed
emission by the cooling dust was also detected in the mid-infrared bands ~1.5
years after the outburst. Archival Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data
taken 10-14 years before the transient event suggest a progenitor star with
$T_{prog}\sim 6500$K, $R_{prog}\sim 100R_{\odot}$ and $L_{prog}\sim
2\times10^4L_{\odot}$, and an upper limit for optically thin warm (1000 K) dust
mass of $M_d<10^{-6}M_{\odot}$. Using stellar binary-evolution models, we
determined the properties of binary systems consistent with the progenitor
parameter space. For AT2018bwo, we infer a primary mass of 12-16 $M_{\odot}$,
which is 9-45% larger than the ~11$M_{\odot}$ obtained using single-star
evolution models. The system, consistent with a yellow-supergiant primary, was
likely in a stable mass-transfer regime with -2.4<log
($\dot{M}/M_{\odot}$/yr)<-1.2 a decade before the main instability occurred.
During the dynamical merger, the system would have ejected 0.15-0.5$M_{\odot}$
with a velocity of ~500 km/s.

of archival far-infrared data from Herschel, we present a new set of AGN and
galaxy infrared templates, and introduce the spectral energy distribution

properties, free of AGN contamination. To build these, we used a sample of 100

star-forming galaxies selected via infrared diagnostics. Using these templates,
combined with a flexible model for the AGN contribution, we extracted the
intrinsic infrared emission of our AGN sample. We further demonstrate that we
can reduce the diversity in the intrinsic shapes of AGN spectral energy
distributions down to a set of three AGN templates, of which two represent AGN
continuum, and one represents silicate emission. Our results indicate that, on
average, the contribution of AGNs to the far-infrared ($\lambda~\gtrsim$ 50

century, theoretical predictions have yet to match the observed properties of
binary populations. This work quantitatively examines the recent proposal of
tidal circularization by resonance locking, where tidal dissipation arises from
resonances between the star's natural oscillation frequencies and harmonics of
the orbital frequency, and where resonances are `locked' for an extended period
of time due to concurrent stellar evolution. We focus on tidal resonances with
axi-symmetric gravity-modes, and examine binaries with primary masses from one
to two solar masses. We find that orbital evolution via resonance locking
occurs primarily during the star's pre-main-sequence phase, with the
main-sequence phase contributing negligibly. Resonance locking, ignoring
non-linearity, can circularize binaries with peri-centre distances out to $\sim
10$ stellar radii, corresponding to circular periods of $\sim 4-6$ days.
However, we find resonantly excited gravity-modes will become nonlinear in
stellar cores, which prevents them from reaching their full, linear amplitudes.
We estimate that such a `saturated resonance lock' reduces the circularization
period by about a third, but resonance locking remains much more effective than
the cumulative actions of equilibrium tides. In a companion paper, we examine
recent binary data to compare against theory.

suggest that low-frequency, stochastic photometric variability and surface
turbulence in massive stars are caused by the the presence of subsurface
convection. We show that an explanation for the observed surface photometric
variability and macroturbulence relying on convective core driven internal
gravity waves encounters a number of difficulties and seems unlikely to be able
to explain the observed trends.

because of a combination of stellar feedback processes and gravitational
instabilities driven by mergers and gas accretion. In this paper, we present
the analysis of a sample of five Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) at $4
\lesssim z\lesssim 5$. Taking advantage of the magnifying power of strong
gravitational lensing, we quantified their kinematic and dynamical properties
from ALMA observations of their [CII] emission line. We combined the dynamical
measurements obtained for these galaxies with those obtained from previous
studies to build the largest sample of $z \sim 4.5$ galaxies with high-quality
data and sub-kpc spatial resolutions, so far. We found that all galaxies in the
sample are dynamically cold, with rotation-to-random motion ratios, $V/\sigma$,
between 7 to 15. The relation between their velocity dispersions and their
star-formation rates indicates that stellar feedback is sufficient to sustain
the turbulence within these galaxies and no further mechanisms are needed. In
addition, we performed a rotation curve decomposition to infer the relative
contribution of the baryonic (gas, stars) and dark matter components to the
total gravitational potentials. This analysis allowed us to compare the
structural properties of the studied DSFGs with those of their descendants, the
local early type galaxies. In particular, we found that five out of six
galaxies of the sample show the dynamical signature of a bulge, indicating that
the spheroidal component is already in place at $z \sim 4.5$.

of up to 4% over several days, consistent with foreground material transiting

Pictoris b and the predicted transit of its Hill sphere to within 0.1 au
projected distance of the planet provided an opportunity to search for the
transit of a circumplanetary disk in this $21\pm 4$ Myr-old planetary system.
  Continuous broadband photometric monitoring of Beta Pictoris requires
ground-based observatories at multiple longitudes to provide redundancy and to
provide triggers for rapid spectroscopic followup. These observatories include
the dedicated Beta Pictoris monitoring observatory bRing at Sutherland and
Siding Springs, the ASTEP400 telescope at Concordia, and observations from the
space observatories BRITE and Hubble Space Telescope.
  We search the combined light curves for evidence of short period transient
events caused by rings and for longer term photometric variability due to
diffuse circumplanetary material. We find no photometric event that matches
with the event seen in November 1981, and there is no systematic photometric
dimming of the star as a function of the Hill sphere radius. We conclude that
the 1981 event was not caused by the transit of a circumplanetary disk around
Beta Pictoris b.
  The upper limit on the long term variability of Beta Pictoris places an upper
limit of $1.8\times 10^{22}$ g of dust within the Hill sphere. Circumplanetary
material is either condensed into a non-transiting disk, is condensed into a
disk with moons that has a small obliquity, or is below our detection
threshold. This is the first time that a dedicated international campaign has

parameter space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a
multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of 2L1S events
usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate

space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to
yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method

amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE)
learns a surrogate posterior $\hat{p}(\theta|x)$ as an observation-parametrized
conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the
full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the
NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation

allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also
captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be
refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal
burn-in steps.

The long-range potential in this scenario depends on a non-integer power of the

of BayeSN, continuous from 0.35--0.95 $\mu$m, which we use to model the
properties of SNe Ia in the rest-frame $z$-band, study the properties of dust
in their host galaxies, and construct a Hubble diagram of SN Ia distances
determined from full $griz$ light curves. Our $griz$ Hubble diagram has a low
total RMS of 0.13 mag using BayeSN, compared to 0.16 mag using SALT2.
Additionally, we test the consistency of the dust law $R_V$ between low- and
high-mass host galaxies by using our model to fit the full time- and
wavelength-dependent SEDs of SNe Ia up to moderate reddening (peak apparent
$B-V \lesssim 0.3$). Splitting the population at the median host mass, we find
$R_V=2.84\pm0.31$ in low-mass hosts, and $R_V=2.58\pm0.23$ in high-mass hosts,
both consistent with the global value of $R_V=2.61\pm0.21$ that we estimate for
the full sample. For all choices of mass split we consider, $R_V$ is consistent
across the step within $\lesssim1.2\sigma$. Modelling population distributions

highly consistent with the full sample's population mean $\mu(R_V) =

galaxy or recent merger. Ten galaxies have smooth velocity gradients consistent
with the emission arising from a gaseous disk. The remaining eight quasar host
galaxies show no velocity gradient, suggesting that the gas in these systems is
dispersion-dominated. All galaxies show high velocity dispersions with a mean
of 129+-10 km/s. To provide an estimate of the dynamical mass within twice the

Comparison between the dynamical mass and the mass of the supermassive black
hole reveals that the sample falls above the locally derived bulge mass--black
hole mass relation at 2.4sigma significance. This result is robust even if we
account for the large systematic uncertainties. Using several different
estimators for the molecular mass, we estimate a gas mass fraction of >10%,
indicating gas makes up a large fraction of the baryonic mass of z~6 quasar

avenue to test the QCD axion DM via transient radio signatures coming from
encounters between neutron stars (NSs) and axion minihalos around primordial
black holes (PBHs). We consider a general QCD axion scenario in which the PQ
symmetry breaking occurs before (or during) inflation coexisting with a small
fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. The PBHs will unavoidably acquire around
them axion minihalos with the typical length scale of parsecs. The axion
density in the minihalos may be much higher than the local DM density, and the
presence of these compact objects in the Milky Way today provides a novel
chance for testing the axion DM hypothesis. We study the evolution of the
minihalo mass distribution in the Galaxy accounting for tidal forces and
estimate the encounter rate between NSs and the dressed PBHs. We find that the
encounters give rise to transient line-like emission of radio frequency photons
produced by the resonant axion-photon conversion in the NS magnetosphere and
the characteristic signal could be detectable with the sensitivity of current
and prospective radio telescopes. It would be important to investigate in
detail search strategies for such signals which would provide a novel pathway

circumbinary disks due to the strong nonlinearities involved. Many circumbinary
simulations also require the use of numerical mass sinks: source terms which
prevent gas from unphysically accumulating around the simulated point masses by
removing gas at a given rate. However, special care must be taken when drawing
physical conclusions from such simulations to ensure that results are not
biased by numerical artifacts. We demonstrate how the use of improved sink
methods reduces some of these potential biases in vertically-integrated
simulations of aspect ratio 0.1 accretion disks around binaries with mass
ratios between 0.1 and 1. Specifically, we show that sink terms that do not
reduce the angular momentum of gas relative to the accreting object: 1) reduce
the dependence on the sink rate of physical quantities such as the torque on
the binary, distribution of accretion between binary components, and evolution
of the binary semi-major axis; 2) reduce the degree to which the sink rate
affects the structure of the accretion disks around each binary component; 3)
alter the inferred variability of accretion onto the binary, making it more
regular in time. We also investigate other potential sources of systematic
error, such as the precise from of gravitational softening and previously
employed simplifications to the viscous stress tensor. Because of the strong
dependence of the orbital evolution of the binary on both the torque and
distribution of mass between binary components, the sink methods employed can
have a significant effect on the inferred orbital evolution of the binary.

forms a quantum dual of a traversable wormhole, with a ground state close to
the so called thermofield double state. We use adiabaticity arguments and
numerical simulations to show that the character of the ground state remains
unchanged when interaction strengths in the two SYK models become imbalanced.
Analysis of thermodynamic and dynamical quantities highlights the key
signatures of the wormhole phase in the imbalanced case. Further adiabatic
evolution naturally leads to the 'maximally imbalanced' limit where fermions in
a single SYK model are each coupled to a free Majorana zero mode. This limit is
interesting because it could be more easily realized using various setups
proposed to implement the SYK model in a laboratory. We find that this limiting
case is marginal in that it retains some of the characteristic signatures of
the wormhole physics, such as the spectral gap and revival dynamics, but lacks
others so that it likely does not represent the full-fledged wormhole dual. We
discuss how this scenario could be implemented in the proposed realization of
the SYK physics in quantum wires of finite length coupled to a disordered
quantum dot.

couplings were suggested to be proximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid

excitations into itinerant Majorana fermions and static $Z_2$ fluxes. Motivated
by the emergence of this plethora of 4d and 5d transition metal Kitaev
materials and by the fact that some level of disorder is inevitable in real
materials, here we study how the Kitaev QSL responds to various forms of
disorder, such as vacancies, impurities, and bond randomness. First, we argue
that the presence of the quenched disorder in the Kitaev QSL can lead to the
Anderson localization of Majorana fermions and the appearance of Lifshitz
tails. We point out that the Anderson localization of low-energy states is
particularly strong in the extended Kitaev model with the time reversal
symmetry breaking term. Second, we show that the disorder effects on the
low-energy Majorana fermion modes can be detected in thermal transport. Third,
we show that at finite temperatures the $Z_2$ fluxes become thermally excited
and give rise to an additional disorder for the Majorana fermions. This source
of the disorder dominates at high temperatures. Fourth, we demonstrate that
both the structure of the energy spectrum and the thermal transport properties
of the disordered Kitaev QSL depend strongly on the character of disorder.
While we find that both the site disorder and the bond randomness suppress the
longitudinal thermal conductivity, the low-energy localization is stronger in
the case of the site disorder.

reflect the realized utility of a predictor unless certain implicit assumptions

This often results in suboptimal implementations and in disappointment when
expected outcomes are not achieved. One common failure mode for classic metrics
arises when multiple predictions can be made for the same event, particularly
when redundant true positive predictions produce little additional value. This
describes many clinical alerting systems. We explain why classic metrics cannot
correctly represent predictor performance in such contexts, and introduce an
improved performance assessment technique using utility functions to score
predictions based on their utility in a specific workflow context. The
resulting utility metrics (u-metrics) explicitly account for the effects of
temporal relationships on prediction utility. Compared to traditional measures,
u-metrics more accurately reflect the real world costs and benefits of a
predictor operating in a live clinical context. The improvement can be
significant. We also describe a formal approach to snoozing, a mitigation
strategy in which some predictions are suppressed to improve predictor
performance by reducing false positives while retaining event capture. Snoozing

streaming. We use analytic estimates validated by time-dependent
spherically-symmetric simulations to derive expressions for the mass-loss rate,
momentum flux, and speed of CR-driven galactic winds, suitable for
cosmological-scale or semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. For CR
diffusion coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim r_0 c_i$ where $r_0$ is the base radius
of the wind and $c_i$ is the isothermal gas sound speed, the asymptotic wind
energy flux is comparable to that supplied to CRs, and the outflow rapidly
accelerates to supersonic speeds. By contrast, for $\kappa \lesssim r_0 c_i$,
CR-driven winds accelerate more slowly and lose most of their energy to
gravity, a CR analogue of photon-tired stellar winds. Given CR diffusion
coefficients estimated using Fermi gamma-ray observations of pion decay, we
predict mass-loss rates in CR-driven galactic winds of order the star formation
rate for dwarf and disc galaxies. The dwarf galaxy mass-loss rates are small
compared to the mass-loadings needed to reconcile the stellar and dark matter
halo mass functions. For nuclear starbursts (e.g., M82, Arp 220), CR diffusion

the effects of substitution on oxygen vacancy migration. However, an in-depth

been explored. Here, we investigate soluble monovalent, divalent, trivalent and
tetravalent cation substituents. By combining classical simulations and quantum
mechanical calculations, we provide an insight into defect association energies
between substituent cations and oxygen vacancies as well as their effects on
the diffusion mechanisms. Our simulations indicate that oxygen ionic
diffusivity of subvalent cation-substituted systems follows the order Gd>Ca>Na.
With the same charge, a larger size mismatch with Ce cation yields a lower
oxygen ionic diffusivity, i.e., Na>K, Ca>Ni, Gd>Al. Based on these trends, we
identify species that could tune the oxygen ionic diffusivity: we estimate that
the optimum oxygen vacancy concentration for achieving fast oxygen ionic
transport is 2.5% for GdxCe1-xO2-x/2, CaxCe1-xO2-x and NaxCe1-xO2-3x/2 at 800
K. Remarkably, such a concentration is not constant and shifts gradually to
higher values as the temperature is increased. We find that co-substitutions
can enhance the impact of the single substitutions beyond that expected by
their simple addition. Furthermore, we identify preferential oxygen ion
migration pathways, which illustrate the electro-steric effects of substituent
cations in determining the energy barrier of oxygen ion migration. Such
fundamental insights into the factors that govern the oxygen diffusion
coefficient and migration energy would enable design criteria to be defined for

following three questions are pursued: usage (number of web domains registered

this, 13,900 domain names were gathered through ICANN's Domain Name
Registration Data Lookup database. Each web domain was subsequently
categorized, and data on web impact were obtained from Majestic's API. Based on
the results obtained, it is concluded that the dot-science top-level domain is
scarcely adopted by the academic community, and mainly used by registrar
companies for reselling purposes (35.5% of all web domains were parked).
Websites receiving the highest number of backlinks were generally related to
non-academic websites applying intensive link building practices and offering
leisure or even fraudulent contents. Majestic's Trust Flow metric has been
proved an effective method to filter reputable academic websites. As regards
primary academic-related dot-science web domain categories, 1,175 (8.5% of all

domains), blogs (261) and research groups (133). All dubious content reveals
bad practices on the Web, where the tag 'science' is fundamentally used as a

reactions of alkali-metal atoms colliding with open-shell alkali-metal dimers
in their metastable triplet states by choosing the internal hyperfine and
rovibrational states of the reactants as well as by inducing magnetic Feshbach
resonances with an external magnetic field. We base these conclusions on
coupled-channel statistical calculations that include the effects of hyperfine
contact and magnetic-field-induced Zeeman interactions on ultracold chemical
reactions of hyperfine-resolved ground-state Na and the triplet
NaLi(a$^3\Sigma^+$) producing singlet Na$_2$($^1\Sigma^+_g$) and a Li atom. We
find that the reaction rates are sensitive to the initial hyperfine states of
the reactants. The chemical reaction of fully spin-polarized, high-spin states
of rotationless NaLi(a$^3\Sigma^+, v = 0, N = 0$) molecules with fully
spin-polarized Na is suppressed by a factor of 10-100 compared to that of
unpolarized reactants. We interpret these findings within the adiabatic state
model, which treats the reaction as a sequence of nonadiabatic transitions
between the initial non-reactive high-spin state and the final low-spin states
of the reaction complex. In addition, we show that magnetic Feshbach resonances
can similarly change reaction rate coefficients by several orders of magnitude.
Some of these resonances are due to resonant trimer bound states dissociating
to the $N=2$ rotational state of NaLi(a$^3\Sigma^+, v = 0$) and would thus
exist in systems without hyperfine interactions.

Derivative-free optimization, meanwhile, is capable of solving sophisticated
problems. It commonly uses a sampling-and-updating framework to iteratively
improve the solution, where exploration and exploitation are also needed to be
well balanced. Therefore, derivative-free optimization deals with a similar
core issue as reinforcement learning, and has been introduced in reinforcement
learning approaches, under the names of learning classifier systems and
neuroevolution/evolutionary reinforcement learning. Although such methods have
been developed for decades, recently, derivative-free reinforcement learning
exhibits attracting increasing attention. However, recent survey on this topic
is still lacking. In this article, we summarize methods of derivative-free
reinforcement learning to date, and organize the methods in aspects including
parameter updating, model selection, exploration, and parallel/distributed

directions, hoping that this article could bring more attentions to this topic

first demonstrate our approach in variants of CarRacing games with customized

decentralized and distributed training of DL models over peer-to-peer
wirelessly connected edge devices, not only alleviate the above limitations but

is to specify a formal system that explains the set of attested phonological
strings in a language. Traditionally, a collection of rules (or constraints, in
the case of optimality theory) and underlying forms (UF) are posited to work in
tandem to generate phonological strings. However, the degree of abstraction of
UFs with respect to their concrete realizations is contentious. As the main
contribution of our work, we implement the phonological generative system as a
neural model differentiable end-to-end, rather than as a set of rules or
constraints. Contrary to traditional phonology, in our model, UFs are
continuous vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, rather than discrete strings. As a
consequence, UFs are discovered automatically rather than posited by linguists,
and the model can scale to the size of a realistic vocabulary. Moreover, we
compare several modes of the generative process, contemplating: i) the presence
or absence of an underlying representation in between morphemes and surface
forms (SFs); and ii) the conditional dependence or independence of UFs with
respect to SFs. We evaluate the ability of each mode to predict attested
phonological strings on 2 datasets covering 5 and 28 languages, respectively.
The results corroborate two tenets of generative phonology, viz. the necessity
for UFs and their independence from SFs. In general, our neural model of
generative phonology learns both UFs and SFs automatically and on a
large-scale.

so-called heard/not-heard (HnH) method, which allows the GDs to detect the MA
at the border of their antenna communication radius. Despite the simplicity of
this method, its efficacy in terms of accuracy is poor because it relies on the
antenna radius that continuously varies under different conditions. Usually,
the antenna radius declared by the manufacturer does not fully characterize the
actual antenna radiation pattern. In this paper, the radiation pattern of the
commercial DecaWave DWM1001 Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) antennas is observed in a
real test-bed at different altitudes for collecting more information and
insights on the antenna radius. The compared algorithms are then tested using
both the observed and the manufacturer radii. The experimental accuracy is
close to the expected theoretical one only when the antenna pattern is actually
omnidirectional. However, typical antennas have strong pattern irregularities
that decrease the accuracy. For improving the performance, we propose
range-based (RB) variants of the compared algorithms in which, instead of using
the observed or the manufacturer radii, the actual measured distances between
the MA and the GD are used. The localization accuracy tremendously improves
confirming that the knowledge of the exact antenna pattern is essential for any

amplitude variation in the y direction are generated in a laboratory. The
amplitude variation in the y direction is studied within the framework of the
vector (vNLSE) and scalar (sNLSE) nonlinear Schrodinger equations using the
uniform-amplitude, Stokes-like solution of the vNLSE and the Jacobi elliptic
sine function solution of the sNLSE. The wavetrains are generated using the
Stokes-like solution of vNLSE; however, a comparison of both predictions shows
that while they both do a reasonably good job of predicting the observed
amplitude variation in y, the comparison with the elliptic function solution of
the sNLSE has significantly less error. Additionally, for agreement with the
vNLSE solution, a third harmonic in y term from a Stokes-type expansion of
interacting, symmetric wavetrains must be included. There is no evidence of
instability growth in the x-direction, consistent with the work of Segur and
colleagues, who showed that dissipation stabilizes the modulational
instability. There is some extra amplitude variation in y, which is examined
via a qualitative stability calculation that allows symmetry breaking in that
direction.

(FE) head models can calculate brain strain, which is used to evaluate the risk
of mild traumatic brain injury. To find a time window that can provide a
sufficient duration of kinematics for FE analysis, we investigated 118 on-field
video-confirmed head impacts collected by the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard.
Because the individual differences in brain geometry influence these
calculations, we included six representative brain geometries and found that
larger brains need a longer time window of kinematics for accurate calculation.
Among the different sizes of brains, a pre-trigger time of 20 ms and a
post-trigger time of 70 ms were found to yield calculations of brain strain and
strain rate that were not significantly different from calculations using the
original 200 ms time window recorded by the mouthguard.

interaction between the behaviour of Fock state detection in free space versus

with Fock wavepackets as a function of their degree of monochromaticity, the
number of spatial dimensions, the linear or quadratic nature of the
light-matter coupling, and the presence (or absence) of cavity walls in space.
In doing so we show that intuition coming from quantum optics in cavities does
not straightforwardly carry to the free space case. For example, in $(3+1)$
dimensions the detector response to a Fock wavepacket will go to zero as the
wavepacket is made more and more monochromatic and in coincidence with the
detector's resonant frequency. This is so even though the energy of the
free-space wavepacket goes to the expected finite value of $\hbar\Omega$ in the
monochromatic limit. This is in contrast to the behaviour of the light-matter
interaction in a cavity (even a large one) where the probability of absorbing a
Fock quantum is maximized when the quantum is more monochromatic at the
detector's resonance frequency. We trace this crucial difference to the fact
that monochromatic Fock states are not normalizable in the continuum, thus
physical Fock states need to be constructed out of normalizable wavepackets
whose energy density goes to zero in the monochromatic limit as they get
spatially delocalized.

  The use of online platforms to communicate and collaborate at work provides

from both fundamental and applied perspectives. For example, the studies of
dynamical properties of magnetic vortices and skyrmions not only deepened the
understanding of many-body physics but also led to potential applications in
data processing and storage. Topological structures constructed from electrical
polarization rather than spin have recently been realized in ferroelectric
superlattices, promising for ultrafast electric-field control of topological
orders. However, little is known about the dynamics of such complex extended
nanostructures which in turn underlies their functionalities. Using
terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction measurements, we
observe ultrafast collective polarization dynamics that are unique to polar
vortices, with orders of magnitude higher frequencies and smaller lateral size
than those of experimentally realized magnetic vortices. A previously unseen
soft mode, hereafter referred to as a vortexon, emerges as transient arrays of
nanoscale circular patterns of atomic displacements, which reverse their
vorticity on picosecond time scales. Its frequency is significantly reduced at
a critical strain, indicating a condensation of structural dynamics.
First-principles-based atomistic calculations and phase-field modeling reveal
the microscopic atomic arrangements and frequencies of the vortex modes. The
discovery of subterahertz collective dynamics in polar vortices opens up

a set of axis aligned rectangles, one for each point in $S$, exist, such that

question is also known as Freedman's conjecture (conjecturing that such a set

introduce new insights that push the limits of this analysis.
  Our lower bound uses a greedy algorithm with a particular order of the points

approximation ratio of 0.1039. We complement the result with an upper bound of
3/4 on the approximation ratio for a natural class of greedy algorithms that

the thermal structure of hot-Jupiters, using a detailed 1-D
radiative-convective model. We find that the inclusion of photochemical hazes
results in major heating of the upper and cooling of the lower atmosphere.
Sulphur containing species, such as SH, S$_2$ and S$_3$ provide significant
opacity in the middle atmosphere and lead to local heating near 1 mbar, while
OH, CH, NH, and CN radicals produced by the photochemistry affect the thermal
structure near 1 $\mu$bar. Furthermore we show that the modifications on the
thermal structure from photochemical gases and hazes can have important
ramifications for the interpretation of transit observations. Specifically, our
study for the hazy HD 189733 b shows that the hotter upper atmosphere resulting
from the inclusion of photochemical haze opacity imposes an expansion of the
atmosphere, thus a steeper transit signature in the UV-Visible part of the
spectrum. In addition, the temperature changes in the photosphere also affect
the secondary eclipse spectrum. For HD 209458 b we find that a small haze
opacity could be present in this atmosphere, at pressures below 1 mbar, which
could be a result of both photochemical hazes and condensates. Our results
motivate the inclusion of radiative feedback from photochemical hazes in
general circulation models for a proper evaluation of atmospheric dynamics.

takes advantage of temporal symmetries in order to partially suppress quantum
errors without the need resource-intensive error detection and correction
protocols. This and other open-loop error mitigation techniques are critical
for quantum information processing in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum technology. However, despite its utility, dynamical decoupling does not
address errors which occur at unstructured times during a circuit, including
certain commonly-encountered noise mechanisms such as cross-talk and
imperfectly calibrated control pulses. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an
alternative technique - `quantum measurement emulation' (QME) - that
effectively emulates the measurement of stabilizer operators via stochastic
gate application, leading to a first-order insensitivity to coherent errors.
The QME protocol enables error suppression based on the stabilizer code
formalism without the need for costly measurements and feedback, and it is
particularly well-suited to discrete coherent errors that are challenging for
DD to address.

high-speed camera, encoding information about the third spatial dimension

Identification and reconstruction of individual swimmer bodies and 3D

CLASH clusters with Chandra data. We consider the solid angle in the lens plane
corresponding to a magnification $\mu>1.5$, that amounts to a total of ~100
arcmin$^2$. Our main goal is to assess the efficiency of massive clusters as
cosmic telescopes to explore the faint end of X-ray extragalactic source
population. We search for X-ray emission from strongly lensed sources
identified in the optical, and perform an untargeted detection of lensed X-ray
sources. We detect X-ray emission only in 9 out of 849 lensed/background
optical sources. The stacked emission of the sources without detection does not
reveal any signal in any band. Based on the untargeted detection, we find 66
additional X-ray sources that are consistent with being lensed sources. After
accounting for completeness and sky coverage, we measure for the first time the
soft- and hard-band number counts of lensed X-ray sources. The results are
consistent with current modelization of the AGN population distribution. The
distribution of de-lensed fluxes of the sources identified in moderately deep
CLASH fields reaches a flux limit of ~$10^{-16}$ and ~$10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$
in the soft and hard bands, respectively. We conclude that, in order to match
the depth of the CDFS exploiting massive clusters as cosmic telescopes, the
required number of cluster fields is about two orders of magnitude larger than
that offered by the 20 years Chandra archive. A significant step forward will
be made when future X-ray facilities, with ~1' angular resolution and large
effective area, will allow the serendipitous discovery of rare, strongly lensed
high-$z$ X-ray sources, enabling the study of faint AGN activity in early
Universe and the measurement of gravitational time delays in the X-ray
variability of multiply imaged AGN.

extensively studied, for more than 50 years, in single-server queues with

SRPT in multiserver queues with abandonment. In particular, we consider the
M/GI/s+GI queue and demonstrate that, in the many-sever overloaded regime,
performance in the SRPT queue is equivalent, asymptotically in steady state, to
a preemptive two-class priority queue where customers with short service times
(below a threshold) are served without wait, and customers with long service
times (above a threshold) eventually abandon without service. We prove that the
SRPT discipline maximizes, asymptotically, the system throughput, among all
scheduling disciplines. We also compare the performance of the SRPT policy to
blind policies and study the effects of the patience-time and service-time

newly introduced transmission scheme known as rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA). RSMA relies on multi-antenna rate-splitting at the transmitter and
successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, such that the
intended message for a user is split into a common part and a private part and
the interference is partially decoded and partially treated as noise. In this
paper, we formulate the MMF problem subject to per-antenna power constraints at
the satellite for the system with imperfect channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT). We also consider the case of two-stage precoding which is
assisted by on-board processing (OBP) at the satellite. Numerical results
obtained through simulations for RSMA and the conventional linear precoding
method are compared. When RSMA is used, MMF rate gain is promised and this gain
increases when OBP is used. RSMA is proven to be promising for multigateway
multibeam satellite systems whereby there are various practical challenges such
as feeder link interference, CSIT uncertainty, per-antenna power constraints,
uneven user distribution per beam and frame-based processing.

the increase of planetary orbital distance and the decrease of planetary
radius. Finally, the density map of planet distribution is compensated for the
fitted exponential decay functions of detection efficiency to obtain a relative
occurrence rate distribution of terrestrial planets. The result shows two
regions with planet abundance: one corresponds to planets with radii between
0.5 and 1.5 R_Earth within 0.2 AU, the other corresponds to planets with radii
between 1.5 and 3 R_Earth beyond 0.5 AU. It also confirms the features that may
be caused by atmospheric evaporation: there is a vacancy of planets of sizes
between 2.0 and 4.0 R_Earth inside of ~ 0.5 AU, and a valley with relatively
low occurrence rates between 0.2 and 0.5 AU for planets with radii between 1.5
and 3.0 R_Earth.

universal velocity scale, independent of the presence of well-defined

recent analysis, valid for emergent IR fixed points exhibiting local quantum
criticality, and dual to IR AdS$_2$ geometries, suggests to identify such a
velocity using the time and length scales at which hydrodynamics breaks down --
the equilibration velocity. The latter relates to the radius of convergence of
the hydrodynamic expansion and it is extracted from a collision between a
hydrodynamic diffusive mode and a non-hydrodynamic mode associated to the IR
AdS$_2$ region. In this short note, we confirm this picture for holographic
systems displaying the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance.
Moreover, we find that, at zero temperature, the lower bound set by quantum
chaos and the upper one defined by causality and hydrodynamics exactly
coincide, determining uniquely the diffusion constant. Finally, we comment on
the meaning and universality of this newly proposed prescription.

between a point transmitter and fully-absorbing spherical receiver (FAR), where
the one link (termed primary) has priority over the second link (termed

for the co-existence of both links, which use the same type of molecules for

molecular degradation. The derived equation is then used for the performance
analysis of primary and secondary links in a cognitive molecular communication

example: the consequences of fluctuating environments on the emergence of
antibiotic resistance, which is an immense and growing problem. Typically, high
doses of antibiotics are employed to eliminate the infection quickly and
minimize the time under which resistance may emerge. However, this strategy may
not be optimal. Since competition can reduce fitness and resistance typically
has a reproductive cost, resistant mutants' fitness can depend on their
environment. Here we show conditions under which environmental varying fitness
can be exploited to prevent the emergence of resistance. We develop a
stochastic Lotka-Volterra model of a microbial system with competing
phenotypes: a wild strain susceptible to the antibiotic, and a mutant strain
that is resistant. We investigate the impact of various pulsed applications of
antibiotics on population suppression. Leveraging competition, we show how a
strategy of environmental switching can suppress the infection while avoiding
resistant mutants. We discuss limitations of the procedure depending on the
microbe and pharmacodynamics and methods to ameliorate them.

due to the growing complexity of these systems and their fast deployment

(anomalies) in order to reduce their cyber risk and operational cost. While
there is a rich literature on anomaly detection in many IoT-based systems,
there is no existing work that documents the use of ML models for anomaly
detection in digital agriculture and in smart manufacturing systems. These two
application domains pose certain salient technical challenges. In agriculture
the data is often sparse, due to the vast areas of farms and the requirement to
keep the cost of monitoring low. Second, in both domains, there are multiple
types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data
characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines,
such as, the RPM of the motor. The inferencing and the anomaly detection
processes therefore have to be calibrated for the operating point.
  In this paper, we analyze data from sensors deployed in an agricultural farm
with data from seven different kinds of sensors, and from an advanced
manufacturing testbed with vibration sensors. We evaluate the performance of
ARIMA and LSTM models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then,
considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer
learning from a high data rate sensor. We then perform anomaly detection using
the predicted sensor data. Taken together, we show how in these two application
domains, predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way
for predictive maintenance.

stylized video, a common approach is to estimate the optic flow of the pixels
in the original video and make the generated pixels match the estimated optical
flow. This is achieved by minimizing an optical flow-based (OFB) loss during
model training. However, optical flow estimation is itself a challenging task,
particularly in complex scenes. In addition, it incurs a high computational
cost. We propose a much simpler temporal loss called the frame difference-based
(FDB) loss to solve the temporal inconsistency problem. It is defined as the
distance between the difference between the stylized frames and the difference
between the original frames. The differences between the two frames are
measured in both the pixel space and the feature space specified by the
convolutional neural networks. A set of human behavior experiments involving 62
subjects with 25,600 votes showed that the performance of the proposed FDB loss
matched that of the OFB loss. The performance was measured by subjective
evaluation of stability and stylization quality of the generated videos on two
typical video stylization models. The results suggest that the proposed FDB
loss is a strong alternative to the commonly used OFB loss for video

model Hamiltonians for all distinct types of band inversions allowed by
symmetry. Using these model Hamiltonians, which emphasize the physical nature
of the allowed couplings, we establish the generic electronic phase diagram
noncentrosymmetric Dirac semimetals and show that it generically includes
phases with coexistent Weyl point nodes or Weyl line nodes. In particular, for
one specific type of band inversion in sixfold symmetric systems we show that
Weyl line nodes are always present. Based on first-principles calculations, we
predict that BiPd$_2$O$_4$ is a noncentrosymmetric Dirac semimetal under 20 Gpa
pressure and hosts topological type-II Dirac points on the fourfold rotation
axis. Furthermore, we propose that the hexagonal polar alloy
LiZnSb$_{x}$Bi$_{1-x}$ realizes a Dirac semimetal with coexistent Weyl points.
Interestingly, the emergence and location of the Weyl points is highly tunable
and can be controlled by the alloy concentration $x$. More generally, our
results not only establish band-inverted noncentrosymmetric systems as a broad
and versatile class of topological semimetals, but also provide a framework for
studying the quantum nonlinear Hall effect and nonlinear optical properties in
the Dirac semimetals.

been generalized to weighted graphs.
  In this paper, we consider a multi-level version of the subsetwise spanner in
weighted graphs, where the vertices in $S$ possess varying level, priority, or
quality of service (QoS) requirements, and the goal is to compute a nested
sequence of spanners with the minimum number of total edges. We first
generalize the $+2$ subsetwise spanner of [Pettie 2008, Cygan et al., 2013] to
the weighted setting. We experimentally measure the performance of this and
several other algorithms for weighted additive spanners, both in terms of
runtime and sparsity of output spanner, when applied at each level of the
multi-level problem. Spanner sparsity is compared to the sparsest possible
spanner satisfying the given error budget, obtained using an integer

possibility by fitting the spectrum with the photon-ALP oscillation model, and
find that the parameter space of ALP mass $m_a\leq 10^{-8}$\,eV and the
coupling constant (between photons and ALPs) $g_{a\gamma}$=1.16--1.48$\times

motivation is to find an RMT analogue of Rankin-Selberg convolution, which
constructs a new $L$-functions from an input pair. We report one such attempt;
while it does not appear to model convolution, it does create new ensembles
with properties hybridizing those of its constituents.
  For definiteness we concentrate on the ensemble of palindromic real symmetric
Toeplitz (PST) matrices and the ensemble of real symmetric matrices, whose
limiting spectral measures are the Gaussian and semi-circular distributions,
respectively; these were chosen as they are the two extreme cases in terms of
moment calculations. For a PST matrix $A$ and a real symmetric matrix $B$, we
construct an ensemble of random real symmetric block matrices whose first row
is $\lbrace A, B \rbrace$ and whose second row is $\lbrace B, A \rbrace$. By
Markov's Method of Moments and the use of free probability, we show this
ensemble converges weakly and almost surely to a new, universal distribution

construction by considering an iterated concatenation of matrices from an
arbitrary pair of random real symmetric sub-ensembles with different limiting

the brittle failure of amorphous materials, and we assess the role of rare

soft regions, similarly to Griffiths effects in disordered systems. We
numerically demonstrate how localized plastic events in such soft regions
trigger macroscopic failure via the propagation of a shear band. This physical
picture, which no longer holds in poorly annealed ductile materials, allows us
to discuss the role of finite size effects in brittle yielding and reinforces
the similarities between yielding and other disorder-controlled nonequilibrium

challenge for both human and computer vision. Handling these environmental
conditions is essential for safe decision making, especially in autonomous

approaches, however, rely on training data collected in the real world that is
biased towards good weather conditions, with dense fog, snow, and heavy rain as
outliers in these datasets. Without training data, let alone paired data,
existing autonomous vehicles often limit themselves to good conditions and stop
when dense fog or snow is detected. In this work, we tackle the lack of
supervised training data by combining synthetic and indirect supervision. We
present ZeroScatter, a domain transfer method for converting RGB-only captures
taken in adverse weather into clear daytime scenes. ZeroScatter exploits
model-based, temporal, multi-view, multi-modal, and adversarial cues in a joint

performance is achieved with stimulated Brillouin scattering lasers that are
stabilized to independent microcavity references, realizing sources with 30 Hz
integral linewidth and a fractional frequency instability less than or equal to

a new type of optical-frequency-stabilized phase-locked loop (OFS-PLL) that
operates with a less than 800 kHz loop bandwidth, eliminating traditional power
consuming high bandwidth electronics and digital signal processors used to
phase lock optical carriers. Additionally, we measure the residual phase error
down to a received carrier power of -34 dBm, removing the need to transmit

a comparison of extended MHD simulations of spontaneous type-I ELMs and
pellet-triggered ELMs allowing to study their non-linear dynamics in detail. In
particular, pellet-triggered ELMs are simulated by injecting deuterium pellets
into different time points during the pedestal build-up described in [A. Cathey

background plasma flows as well as the time dependent bootstrap current
evolution are included during the build-up to capture the balance between
stabilising and destabilising terms for the edge instabilities accurately.
Dependencies on the pellet size and injection times are studied. The
spatio-temporal structures of the modes and the resulting divertor heat fluxes
are compared in detail between spontaneous and triggered ELMs. We observe that
the premature excitation of ELMs by means of pellet injection is caused by a
helical perturbation described by a toroidal mode number of n = 1. In
accordance with experimental observations, the pellet-triggered ELMs show
reduced thermal energy losses and narrower divertor wetted area with respect to
spontaneous ELMs. The peak divertor energy fluency is seen to decrease when
ELMs are triggered by pellets injected earlier during the pedestal build-up.

mirrors with different reflectivities: One has minimal optical loss, and the
other high transmission loss where more than 90% of the intracavity photons
would be emitted. Cavity finesse, birefringent effects, and mechanical
resonances are measured using the lasers at 780, 782, and 795 nm. In order to
obtain cavity geometric parameters, we drive the adjacent longitudinal or
transverse modes with two lasers simultaneously, and measure those frequencies
using a precision wavelength meter (WLM). A major novelty of this method is
that the parameters' uncertainties are solely determined by the resolution of
the WLM, eliminating all of the temporal environment fluctuations. Our scheme
makes it possible to quantify the atom-cavity coupling constant up to four
significant figures, the most precise and accurate estimation so far, which
would become a key ingredient for benchmarking a cavity-based quantum node.
Furthermore, the distortion of polarized photonic qubits would be minimized
owing to the small birefringent splitting, below 4.9% of the cavity linewidth.
Our system should operate in the intermediate atom-cavity coupling regime that
would allow us to implement various quantum network protocols.

clinical deterioration is a basic tenet of patient care. This gave rise to a
patient safety intervention philosophy known as a Rapid Response System (RRS),
whereby a patient who meets a pre-determined set of criteria for imminent
clinical deterioration is immediately assessed and treated, with the goal of
mitigating the deterioration and preventing intensive care unit (ICU) transfer,
cardiac arrest, or death. While RRSs have been widely adopted, multiple
systematic reviews have failed to find evidence of their effectiveness.
Typically, RRS criteria are simple, expert (consensus) defined rules that
identify significant physiologic abnormalities or are based on clinical
observation.
  If one can find a pattern in the patient's data earlier than the onset of the
physiologic derangement manifest in the current criteria, intervention
strategies might be more effective. In this paper, we apply machine learning to
electronic medical records (EMR) to infer if patients are at risk for clinical
deterioration. Our models are more sensitive and offer greater advance
prediction time compared with existing rule-based methods that are currently
utilized in hospitals. Our results warrant further testing in the field; if
successful, hospitals can integrate our approach into their existing IT systems
and use the alerts generated by the model to prevent ICU transfer, cardiac
arrest, or death, or to reduce the ICU length of stay.

electronics, heat exchangers, and nuclear reactors. Nowadays, the pool boiling
method is tried to exercise frequently due to its ability to remove high heat
flux compared with natural/forced convection, while maintaining at low wall
superheat. But this pool boiling heat transfer capacity is also limited by an
important parameter, called critical heat flux (CHF). At the point of CHF, the
heat transfer coefficient (HTC) drastically decreases due to the change of the
heat transfer regime from nucleate boiling to film boiling. This is why, the
enhancement of CHF, while maintaining low wall superheat is of great interest
to engineers and researchers.

attacks whose purpose is to undermine the integrity of the model. However, the
current literature on data poisoning attacks is mainly focused on ad hoc
techniques that are only applicable to specific machine learning models.
Additionally, the existing data poisoning attacks in the literature are limited
to either binary classifiers or to gradient-based algorithms. To address these
limitations, this paper first proposes a novel model-free label-flipping attack
based on the multi-modality of the data, in which the adversary targets the
clusters of classes while constrained by a label-flipping budget. The
complexity of our proposed attack algorithm is linear in time over the size of
the dataset. Also, the proposed attack can increase the error up to two times
for the same attack budget. Second, a novel defense technique based on the
Synthetic Reduced Nearest Neighbor (SRNN) model is proposed. The defense
technique can detect and exclude flipped samples on the fly during the training
procedure. Through extensive experimental analysis, we demonstrate that (i) the
proposed attack technique can deteriorate the accuracy of several models
drastically, and (ii) under the proposed attack, the proposed defense technique
significantly outperforms other conventional machine learning models in
recovering the accuracy of the targeted model.

the superconducting critical temperature and we calculate the actual value of
the critical temperature shift. We also show that in the case of type-I
superconducting film this phase transition can be of the first order. In the
external magnetic field the critical temperature depends on the relative
orientation of the external magnetic field and the exchange field in the
ferromagnet. Also we predict the in-plane anisotropy of the critical current
which may open an alternative way for the experimental observation of the
spontaneous supercurrents generated by the SOC.

protocols being described elsewhere, the focus of this paper is on results and
the top performing single and ensemble system submissions from 62 teams, all of
which out-perform the two baseline systems, often by a substantial margin.
Deeper analyses shows that performance is dominated by specific conditions
involving either specific spoofing attacks or specific acoustic environments.
While fusion is shown to be particularly effective for the logical access
scenario involving speech synthesis and voice conversion attacks, participants
largely struggled to apply fusion successfully for the physical access scenario
involving simulated replay attacks. This is likely the result of a lack of
system complementarity, while oracle fusion experiments show clear potential to
improve performance. Furthermore, while results for simulated data are
promising, experiments with real replay data show a substantial gap, most
likely due to the presence of additive noise in the latter. This finding, among
others, leads to a number of ideas for further research and directions for
future editions of the ASVspoof challenge.

high number of antennas and operating within the millimeter and sub-THz

the plane wave approximation is often not accurate because the system may
operate in the near-field propagation region (Fresnel region) where the
electromagnetic field wavefront is spherical. In this case, the curvature of
arrival (CoA) is a measure of the spherical wavefront that can be used to infer
the source position using only a single large array. In this paper, we study a
near-field tracking problem for inferring the state (i.e., the position and
velocity) of a moving source with an ad-hoc observation model that accounts for
the phase profile of a large receiving array. For this tracking problem, we
derive the posterior Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (P-CRLB) and show the effects
when the source moves inside and outside the Fresnel region. We provide
insights on how the loss of positioning information outside Fresnel comes from
an increase of the ranging error rather than from inaccuracies of angular
estimation. Then, we investigate the performance of different Bayesian tracking
algorithms in the presence of model mismatches and abrupt trajectory changes.
Our results demonstrate the feasibility and high accuracy for most of the
tracking approaches without the need of wideband signals and of any

image is crucial for preventing widespread breast cancer specially among women.
This paper is primarily focusing on the classification of breast tumors through
statistical modelling such as Rician inverse Gaussian (RiIG) pdf of contourlet
transformed B-Mode image of breast tumors which is not reported yet in other
earlier works. The suitability of RiIG distribution in modeling the contourlet
coefficients is illustrated and compared with that of Nakagami distribution.
The proposed method consists of pre-processing to remove the speckle noise,
segmentation of the lesion region, contourlet transform on the B-Mode
Ultrasound image and using the corresponding contourlet sub-band coefficients
and the RiIG parameters, production of contourlet parametric (CP) images and
weighted contourlet parametric (WCP) images. A number of geometrical,
statistical, and texture features are calculated from B-Mode and the contourlet
parametric images. In order to classify the features, seven different
classifiers are employed. The proposed approach is applied to two different
datasets (Mendeley Data and Dataset B) those are available publicly. It is
shown that with parametric images, accuracies in the range of 94-97% are
achieved for different classifiers. Specifically, with the support vector
machine and k-nearest-neighbor classifier, very high accuracies of 97.2% and
97.55% can be obtained for the Mendeley Data and Dataset B,respectively, using
the weighted contourlet parametric images.The reported classification
performance is also compared with that of other works using the datasets
employed in this paper. It is seen that the proposed approach using weighted

such intelligent vehicles has experienced large progress in the last decade
thanks to advances in deep learning techniques but some challenges still
remain. One such challenge is the detection of corner cases. They are
unexpected and unknown situations that occur while driving. Conventional visual
perception methods are often not able to detect them because corner cases have
not been witnessed during training. Hence, their detection is highly
safety-critical, and detection methods can be applied to vast amounts of
collected data to select suitable training data. A reliable detection of corner
cases will not only further automate the data selection procedure and increase
safety in autonomous driving but can thereby also affect the public acceptance
of the new technology in a positive manner. In this work, we continue a
previous systematization of corner cases on different levels by an extended set

different categories and link them with the corner case levels. Hence, we give

designed for applications to planetary hamiltonian systems. The scheme is
adapted to properly work with models of chains of $N+1$ particles interacting
via anharmonic potentials, thus covering also the case of FPU chains. After
having preliminarily settled the Hamiltonian in a suitable way, we perform a
sequence of canonical transformations removing the undesired perturbative terms
by an iterative procedure. This is done by using the Lie series approach, that
is explicitly implemented in a programming code with the help of a software
package, which is especially designed for computer algebra manipulations. In
the cases of FPU chains with $N=4,\, 8$, we successfully apply our new
algorithm to the construction of elliptic tori for wide sets of the parameter
ruling the size of the perturbation, i.e., the total energy of the system.
Moreover, we explore the stability regions surrounding 1D elliptic tori. We
compare our semi-analytical results with those provided by numerical
explorations of the FPU-model dynamics, where the latter ones are obtained by
using techniques based on the so called frequency analysis. We find that our
procedure works up to values of the total energy that are of the same order of
magnitude with respect to the maximal ones, for which elliptic tori are
detected by numerical methods.

revealed that the commonly used neuron coverage metrics by existing DL testing
approaches are not correlated to model robustness. It is also not an effective

using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For
vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all

learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs
using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for

in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$. It was proved by Szeg\H{o} for
$N=2$ and by Weinberger for $N \geq 2$ that among all equimeasurable domains
$\mu_2(\Omega)$ attains its global maximum if $\Omega$ is a ball. In the
present work, we develop the approach of Weinberger in two directions. Firstly,
we refine the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger result for a class of domains of the form
$\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus\overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}$ which are either
centrally symmetric or symmetric of order $2$ (with respect to every coordinate
plane $(x_i,x_j)$) by showing that
$\mu_{2}(\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus\overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}})\leq\mu_2(B_\beta\setminus\overline{B}_\alpha)$,
where $B_\alpha, B_\beta$ are balls centered at the origin such that
$B_\alpha\subset\Omega_{\text{in}}$ and
$|\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus\overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}|=|B_\beta\setminus\overline{B}_\alpha|$.
Secondly, we provide Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger type inequalities for higher
eigenvalues by imposing additional symmetry assumptions on the domain. Namely,
if $\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus\overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}$ is symmetric of
order $4$, then we prove
$\mu_{i}(\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus\overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}})\leq\mu_i(B_\beta\setminus\overline{B}_\alpha)$
for $i=3,\dots,N+2$, where we also allow $\Omega_{\text{in}}$ and $B_\alpha$ to
be empty. If $N=2$ and the domain is symmetric of order $8$, then the latter
inequality persists for $i=5$. Counterexamples to the obtained inequalities for
domains outside of the considered symmetry classes are given. The existence and
properties of nonradial domains with required symmetries in higher dimensions
are discussed. As an auxiliary result, we obtain the non-radiality of the
eigenfunctions associated to $\mu_{N+2}(B_\beta\setminus\overline{B}_\alpha)$.

the radio properties. We find the following: 1. The broad line region (BLR) and
continuum polarization are both produced by a single scattering medium. 2. The
scattering medium is equatorial, and at right angle to the system axis. 3. The
scattering medium is located at or just outside the BLR. The continuum
polarization and the H$\alpha$ polarization angle swing, can both serve as an
inclination indicator. The observed line width is found to be affected by
inclination, which can lead to an underestimate of the black hole mass by a
factor of $\sim 5$ for a close-to face-on view. The line width measured in the
polarized flux overcomes the inclination bias, and provides a close-to
equatorial view of the BLR in all AGN, which allows to reduce the inclination
bias in the BLR based black hole mass estimates.

the dynamics of a viscoelastic beam, which is both experimentally investigated

this way it is possible to fit the experimental curves to determine the complex

modulus of the material by using the appropriate number of relaxation times, on
the basis of the frequency range considered. Moreover, by varying the length of
the beams, the frequency range of interest can be changed/enlarged. Our results
are tested against those obtained with a well established and reliable

the tissue as a composition of six distinct fluid phases; their dynamics are

The same approach is also applied for the vasculature phase, which is divided
into young sprouts (products of angiogenesis), and fully formed-mature vessels.
The remaining two phases correspond to healthy cells and extracellular material
(ECM). Furthermore, the model foresees the existence of nutrient chemical
species, which are transferred within the tissue through diffusion or supplied
by the vasculature (blood vessels). The model is numerically solved with the
Finite Elements Method and computations are performed with the commercial

cancer cells are well separated from young cancer cells, which form a
protective shield for the growing tumor. We study the effect of different

the importance of casting constraints on modified theories of gravity in a
framework as general and robust as possible. Requiring more stringent -- yet
well-motivated -- beyond General Relativity (GR) parametrizations improves the
inference drawn from available GW data, substantially decreasing the errors on
deviation parameters. This implies a reduction in the number of signals needed
to detect a deviation from GR predictions and an increase of the number of
GR-violating coefficients that can be meaningfully constrained with a given
number of signals. To this end, we apply to LIGO-Virgo observations a high-spin
version of the Parametrized ringdown spin expansion coefficients (ParSpec)
formalism, encompassing large classes of modified theories of gravity. We
constrain the lowest-order perturbative deviation of the fundamental ringdown
frequency to be $\delta\omega^{0}_{220} = {-0.05}^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, when
assuming adimensional beyond-GR couplings, substantially improving upon
previously published results. We also establish upper bounds $\ell_{p=2} < 23

\mathrm{km}$ on the scale $\ell_p$ at which the appearance of new physics is
disfavoured, depending on the mass dimension $p$ of the ringdown coupling.
These bounds exceed the ones obtained by previous analyses or are competitive
with existing ones, depending on the specific alternative theory considered,
and promise to quickly improve as the number of detectors, sensitivity and
duty-cycle of the gravitational-wave network steadily increases.

Quench may lead to damage or even to catastrophic conductor failure. A

superconductor transient, resistive states (flux flow, Ohmic) thus is mandatory
to safely avoid quench. This request sharp comparison of local, transient
conductor temperature and current transport density with local values of

variable, TCrit, might not uniquely be defined? A multi-physics model
(fractional parentage, Pauli selection rule, time of flight-concept with a
mediating Boson, the Yukawa model and the uncertainty principle) provides
relaxation time at which TCrit, as the thermodynamic, equilibrium state,
finally would be obtained. But relaxation time diverges the closer the electron
system approaches the phase transition, which questions existence of uniquely
defined TCrit within finite process time. In this paper, focus is on multiple

suggested operator method to solve the incompleteness problem of radiative

obtained from tomographic particle image velocimetry at the downstream distance
of two equivalent orifice diameters are analysed. Jets issuing from a circular
orifice and from a fractal orifice are examined, where the fractal geometry is
obtained from a repeating fractal pattern applied to a base square shape. While
in the round jet energy is mostly contained at wavenumber m=0, associated to
the characteristic Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex rings, in the fractal jet modal
structures at the fundamental azimuthal wavenumber m=4 capture the largest
amount of energy. The second part of the study focuses on the relationship
between streamwise vorticity and streamwise velocity, to characterise the role
of the orifice geometry on the lift-up mechanism recently found to be active in
turbulent jets. The averaging of the streamwise vorticity conditioned on
intense positive fluctuations of streamwise velocity reveals a pair of
vorticity structures of opposite sign flanking the conditioning point, inducing
a radial flow towards the jet periphery. This pair of structures is observed in
both jets, even if the azimuthal extent of this pattern is 30% larger in the
jet issuing from the circular orifice. This evidences that the orifice geometry
directly influences the interaction between velocity and vorticity.

without constants and function symbols obeys a zero-one law: As the number of
elements of finite models increases, every formula holds either in almost all
or in almost no models of that size. Therefore, many properties of models, such
as having an even number of elements, cannot be expressed in the language of
first-order logic. For modal logics, limit behavior for models and frames may
differ. Halpern and Kapron proved zero-one laws for classes of models
corresponding to the modal logics K, T, S4, and S5.
  In this paper, we prove zero-one laws for provability logic with respect to
both model and frame validity. Moreover, we axiomatize validity in almost all
relevant finite models and in almost all relevant finite frames, leading to two
different axiom systems. In the proofs, we use a combinatorial result by
Kleitman and Rothschild about the structure of almost all finite partial
orders. On the way, we also show that a previous result by Halpern and Kapron
about the axiomatization of almost sure frame validity for S4 is not correct.
Finally, we consider the complexity of deciding whether a given formula is
almost surely valid in the relevant finite models and frames.

analysis is performed for bulk speed, proton density, temperature, magnetic
field magnitude and total perpendicular pressure. Additionally, a study of
events during the two opposition phases of Earth and Mars in the years 2016 and
2018 is conducted. SIR related coronal holes with their area as well as their
latitudinal and longitudinal extent are extracted and correlated to the maximum
bulk speed and duration of the corresponding high speed solar wind streams
following the stream interaction regions. We find that while the entire solar
wind HSS shows no expansion as it evolves from Earth to Mars, the crest of the
HSS profile broadens by about 17%, and the magnetic field and total pressure by
about 45% around the stream interface. The difference between the maximum and
minimum values in the normalized superposed profiles increases slightly or
stagnates from 1-1.5 AU for all parameters, except for the temperature. A sharp
drop at zero epoch time is observed in the superposed profiles for the magnetic
field strength at both heliospheric distances. Maximum solar wind speed has a
stronger dependence on the latitudinal extent of the respective coronal hole

significant improvements in the performance of many NLP tasks. Though the
Transformer encoder may effectively capture general information in its
resulting representations, the backbone information, meaning the gist of the

that rely on the encoding heavily. Our explicit text compression approaches use
dedicated models to compress text, while our implicit text compression approach
simply adds an additional module to the main model to handle text compression.
We propose three ways of integration, namely backbone source-side fusion,
target-side fusion, and both-side fusion, to integrate the backbone information
into Transformer-based models for various downstream tasks. Our evaluation on
benchmark datasets shows that the proposed explicit and implicit text
compression approaches improve results in comparison to strong baselines. We
therefore conclude, when comparing the encodings to the baseline models, text
compression helps the encoders to learn better language representations.

requirements of these embedded platforms the framework is built from the ground
up to provide predictive uncertainty based only on one forward pass and a
negligible amount of additional matrix multiplications with theoretically
proven correctness. Our aim is to enable already trained deep learning models
to generate uncertainty estimates on resource-limited devices at inference time
focusing on classification tasks. This framework is founded on theoretical
developments casting dropout training as approximate inference in Bayesian NNs.
Our layerwise distribution approximation to the convolution layer cascades
through the network, providing uncertainty estimates in one single run which
ensures minimal overhead, especially compared with uncertainty techniques that
require multiple forwards passes and an equal linear rise in energy and latency
requirements making them unsuitable in practice. We demonstrate that it yields
better performance and flexibility over previous work based on multilayer
perceptrons to obtain uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation with mobile
applications datasets shows that our approach not only obtains robust and
accurate uncertainty estimations but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods

Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since
being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in
clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early
prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical
deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events.
The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population
at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model
was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and
mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict

epidemiological domain. We first apply the autoregressive distributed lag

there was a substantial criticism concerning the algebraic construction and
factors assessment of UCP, it remains an efficient early size estimation
method. Predicting software effort from UCP is still an ever-present challenge.
The earlier version of UCP method suggested using productivity as a cost
driver, where fixed or a few pre-defined productivity ratios have been widely
agreed. While this approach was successful when no enough historical data is
available, it is no longer acceptable because software projects are different
in terms of development aspects. Therefore, it is better to understand the
relationship between productivity and other UCP variables. This paper examines
the impact of data locality approaches on productivity and effort prediction
from multiple UCP variables. The environmental factors are used as partitioning
factors to produce local homogeneous data either based on their influential
levels or using clustering algorithms. Different machine learning methods,
including solo and ensemble methods, are used to construct productivity and
effort prediction models based on the local data. The results demonstrate that
the prediction models that are created based on local data surpass models that
use entire data. Also, the results show that conforming the hypothetical
assumption between productivity and environmental factors is not necessarily a
requirement for success of locality.

works in appearance encoding often prioritised one of these requirements at the
expense of the other, by either applying high-fidelity array compression
strategies not suited for efficient queries during rendering, or by fitting a
compact analytic model that lacks expressiveness. We present a compact neural

representation amenable to importance sampling: rather than inverting the
trained networks, we learn to encode them in a more compact embedding that can

characteristic frequencies of fast variability; the most prominent ones are
around log(f/Hz) $\simeq$ -3. Because we still have only small number
statistics, we obtained a new observation to test whether this is a general
characteristic of CVs, especially if mass transfer occurs at a high rate
typical for dwarf nova in outbursts, in the so called ""high state"". METHODS: We
analyzed optical Kepler data of the quiescent nova and intermediate polar V4743
Sgr. This system hosts a white dwarf accreting through a disk in the high
state. We calculated the power density spectra, and searched for break or
characteristic frequencies. Our goal is to assess whether the mHz frequency of
the flickering is a general characteristic. RESULTS: V4743 Sgr has a clear
break frequency at log(f/Hz) $\simeq$ -3. This detection increases the
probability that the mHz characteristic frequency is a general feature of CVs
in the high state, from 69% to 91%. Furthermore, we propose the possibility
that the variability is generated by similar mechanism as in the nova-like
system MV Lyr, which would make V4743 Sgr unique.

challenging dynamic environments. The unique feature of the VIODE dataset is
the systematic introduction of moving objects into the scenes. It includes
three environments, each of which is available in four dynamic levels that
progressively add moving objects. The dataset contains synchronized stereo

highly dynamic scenes. Thirdly, we propose a simple extension for visual
localization algorithms that relies on semantic information. Our results show
that scene semantics are an effective way to mitigate the adverse effects of
dynamic objects on VIO algorithms. Finally, we make the VIODE dataset publicly

functions are called M-languages. M-languages are studied from the aspect of
their recognition by deterministic finite automata whose components take values
on M (M-DFAs). The characterization of an M-language l is based on providing a
right congruence on Sigma* that is defined through l and a factorization on the
set of all M-languages, L(Sigma*,M) (in sort L). A factorization on L is a pair
of functions (g,f) such that, for each l in L, g(l). f(l)= l, where g(l) in M
and f(l) in L. In essence, a factorization is a form of common factor
extraction. A general Myhill-Nerode theorem, which is valid for any L(Sigma*,
M), is provided. Basically, l is recognized by an M-DFA if and only if there
exists a factorization on L, (g,f), such that the right congruence on Sigma*
induced by the factorization (g,f) and f(l), has finite index. This paper shows
that the existence of M-DFAs guarantees the existence of natural non-trivial
factorizations on L without taking account any additional property on the

detected sources, enabled us to better sample the mass function (MF). The MF
slopes are estimated at ages of 1, 1.5 and 2 Myr, at different radii, and for
different mass ranges. The MF slopes for the mass range of 10-300 solar-mass

learning to reconstruct individual 3D objects in a synthetic setup of an
uncluttered environment, which is far from a real-life scenario. In this work,
we reformulate the problem of point cloud completion into an object
hallucination task. Thus, we introduce a novel autoencoder-based architecture
called HyperPocket that disentangles latent representations and, as a result,
enables the generation of multiple variants of the completed 3D point clouds.
We split point cloud processing into two disjoint data streams and leverage a
hypernetwork paradigm to fill the spaces, dubbed pockets, that are left by the
missing object parts. As a result, the generated point clouds are not only
smooth but also plausible and geometrically consistent with the scene. Our
method offers competitive performances to the other state-of-the-art models,

investigates the privacy-utility-fairness trade-off in neural networks by
comparing a Simple (S-NN), a Fair (F-NN), a Differentially Private (DP-NN), and
a Differentially Private and Fair Neural Network (DPF-NN) to evaluate

considered fair as it achieved a risk difference below the strict (0.05) and
lenient (0.1) thresholds. However, while the accuracy of the proposed model
improved on previous work from Xu, Yuan and Wu (2019), the risk difference was

evolved towards the present-day cold and dry body or if it always was cold and
dry with just some sporadic episodes of liquid water on its surface. An
important clue into this question can be gained by studying the earliest
evolution of the Martian atmosphere and whether it was dense and stable to
maintain a warm and wet climate or tenuous and susceptible to strong
atmospheric escape. We discuss relevant aspects for the evolution and stability
of a potential early Martian atmosphere. This contains the solar EUV flux
evolution, the formation timescale and volatile inventory of the planet
including volcanic degassing, impact delivery and removal, the loss of a
catastrophically outgassed steam atmosphere, atmosphere-surface interactions,
and thermal and non-thermal escape processes affecting any secondary
atmosphere. While early non-thermal escape at Mars before 4 billion years ago
(Ga) is poorly understood, particularly in view of its ancient intrinsic
magnetic field, research on thermal escape processes indicate that volatile
delivery and volcanic degassing cannot counterbalance the strong thermal
escape. Therefore, a catastrophically outgassed steam atmosphere of several
bars of CO2 and H2O, or CO and H2 for reduced conditions, could have been lost
within just a few million years (Myr). Thereafter, Mars likely could not build
up a dense secondary atmosphere during its first ~400 Myr but might only have
possessed an atmosphere sporadically during events of strong volcanic
degassing, potentially also including SO2. This indicates that before ~4.1 Ga
Mars indeed might have been cold and dry. A denser CO2- or CO-dominated
atmosphere, however, might have built up afterwards but must have been lost
later-on due to non-thermal escape processes and sequestration into the ground.

photomultipliers above the background. In this paper, the sensitivity of KM3NeT
to a supernova explosion is estimated from detailed analyses of background data
from the first KM3NeT detection units and simulations of the neutrino signal.
The KM3NeT observational horizon (for a $5\,\sigma$ discovery) covers
essentially the Milky-Way and for the most optimistic model, extends to the
Small Magellanic Cloud ($\sim$ 60 kpc). Detailed studies of the time profile of
the neutrino signal allow assessment of the KM3NeT capability to determine the
arrival time of the neutrino burst with a few milliseconds precision for
sources up to 5$-$8 kpc away, and detecting the peculiar signature of the
standing accretion shock instability if the core-collapse supernova explosion
happens closer than 3$-$5 kpc, depending on the progenitor mass. KM3NeT's
capability to measure the neutrino flux spectral parameters is also presented.

  22 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Flutter stability is a dominant design constraint of modern gas and steam
turbines. To further increase the feasible design space, flutter-tolerant
designs are currently explored, which may undergo Limit Cycle Oscillations
(LCOs) of acceptable, yet not vanishing, level. Bounded self-excited
oscillations are a priori a nonlinear phenomenon, and can thus only be
explained by nonlinear interactions such as dry stick-slip friction in
mechanical joints. The currently available simulation methods for blade flutter
account for nonlinear interactions, at most, in only one domain, the structure
or the fluid, and assume the behavior in the other domain as linear. In this
work, we develop a fully-coupled nonlinear frequency domain method which is
capable of resolving nonlinear flow and structural effects. We demonstrate the
computational performance of this method for a state-of-the-art aeroelastic
model of a shrouded turbine blade row. Besides simulating limit cycles, we
predict, for the first time, the phenomenon of nonlinear instability, i.e., a
situation where the equilibrium point is locally stable, but for sufficiently
strong perturbation (caused e.g. by an impact), the dry frictional dissipation
cannot bound the flutter vibrations. This implies that linearized theory does
not necessary lead to a conservative design of turbine blades. We show that
this phenomenon is due to the nonlinear contact interactions at the tip
shrouds, which cause a change of the vibrational deflection shape and
frequency, which in turn leads to a loss of aeroelastic stability. Finally, we
extend the well-known energy method to capture these effects, and conclude that
it provides a good approximation and is useful for initializing the
fully-coupled solver.

RowHammer, a phenomenon where rapidly activating a DRAM row can cause bit-flips
in physically-nearby rows. Recent studies demonstrate that modern DRAM chips,
including chips previously marketed as RowHammer-safe, are even more vulnerable
to RowHammer than older chips. Many works show that attackers can exploit
RowHammer bit-flips to reliably mount system-level attacks to escalate
privilege and leak private data. Therefore, it is critical to ensure
RowHammer-safe operation on all DRAM-based systems. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms face two major challenges.
First, they incur increasingly higher performance and/or area overheads when
applied to more vulnerable DRAM chips. Second, they require either proprietary
information about or modifications to the DRAM chip design. In this paper, we
show that it is possible to efficiently and scalably prevent RowHammer
bit-flips without knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals. We introduce
BlockHammer, a low-cost, effective, and easy-to-adopt RowHammer mitigation
mechanism that overcomes the two key challenges by selectively throttling
memory accesses that could otherwise cause RowHammer bit-flips. The key idea of
BlockHammer is to (1) track row activation rates using area-efficient Bloom
filters and (2) use the tracking data to ensure that no row is ever activated
rapidly enough to induce RowHammer bit-flips. By doing so, BlockHammer (1)
makes it impossible for a RowHammer bit-flip to occur and (2) greatly reduces a
RowHammer attack's impact on the performance of co-running benign applications.
Compared to state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms, BlockHammer
provides competitive performance and energy when the system is not under a
RowHammer attack and significantly better performance and energy when the
system is under attack.

high voltages, temperatures and frequencies with low energy losses, and have
been of increasing importance in power and high-frequency electronics. However,
the poor performance of p-channel transistors compared with that of n-channel
transistors has constrained the production of energy-efficient complimentary
circuits with integrated n- and p-channel transistors. The p-type surface
conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond offers great potential for solving
this problem, but surface transfer doping, which is commonly believed to be
essential for generating the conductivity, limits the performance of
transistors made of hydrogen-terminated diamond because it requires the
presence of ionized surface acceptors, which cause hole scattering. Here, we
report on fabrication of a p-channel wide-bandgap heterojunction field-effect
transistor consisting of a hydrogen-terminated diamond channel and hexagonal
boron nitride ($h$-BN) gate insulator, without relying on surface transfer
doping. Despite its reduced density of surface acceptors, the transistor has
the lowest sheet resistance ($1.4$ k$\Omega$) and largest on-current ($1600$
$\mu$m mA mm$^{-1}$) among p-channel wide-bandgap transistors, owing to the
highest hole mobility (room-temperature Hall mobility: $680$

behavior, with a high on/off ratio exceeding $10^8$. These characteristics are
suited for low-loss switching and can be explained on the basis of standard

patches, and in this work, we postulate to mitigate this limitation by
preserving local consistency around patch vertices. To that end, we introduce a
Locally Conditioned Atlas (LoCondA), a framework for representing a 3D object
hierarchically in a generative model. Firstly, the model maps a point cloud of
an object into a sphere. Secondly, by leveraging a spherical prior, we enforce
the mapping to be locally consistent on the sphere and on the target object.
This way, we can sample a mesh quad on that sphere and project it back onto the
object's manifold. With LoCondA, we can produce topologically diverse objects
while maintaining quads to be stitched together. We show that the proposed
approach provides structurally coherent reconstructions while producing meshes
of quality comparable to the competitors.

In this paper, we determine and study the necessary and sufficient conditions

diffeomorphism between the set of null generators in each boundary and a scalar
function, called step function, that determines a shift of points along the
null generators. Generically there exists at most one possible matching but in
some circumstances this is not so. When the null boundaries are totally

whose nature and consequences are analyzed in detail. The expression for the
energy-momentum tensor of a general null shell is also derived. Finally, we
find the most general shell (with non-zero energy, energy flux and pressure)

the emergence of a highly-anisotropic population of phonons in reciprocal

very robust performance across many queries, including those previously unseen,

tabular models reliable only when large numbers of user interactions are

robust performance across all queries, and many tabular models for
specialization: each optimized for high performance on a single query. GENSPEC
uses novel relative high-confidence bounds to choose which model to deploy per
query. By doing so, GENSPEC enjoys the high performance of successfully
specialized tabular models with the robustness of a generalized feature-based

of solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing. QAOA on
the MaxCut problem has been studied extensively on specific families of graphs,
however, little is known about the algorithm on arbitrary graphs. We evaluate
the performance of QAOA at depths at most three on the MaxCut problem for all
connected non-isomorphic graphs with at most eight vertices and analyze how
graph structure affects QAOA performance. Some of the strongest predictors of
QAOA success are the existence of odd-cycles and the amount of symmetry in the

allow us to identify classes of combinatorial problems that are likely to

radial migration is the most intense, and brings them to present locations at 9
kpc and beyond. Low eccentricities and slightly outward radial excursions of

their parent cluster and supersonically sail away through the interstellar
medium (ISM). The winds of these fast-moving stars blow asymmetric bubbles thus
creating a circumstellar environment in which stars eventually die with a
supernova explosion. The morphology of the resulting remnant is largely
governed by the circumstellar medium of the defunct progenitor star. In this
paper, we present 2D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations investigating the
effect of the ISM magnetic field on the shape of the supernova remnants of a
35Mo star evolving through a Wolf-Rayet phase and running with velocity 20 and
40 km/s, respectively. A 7 microG ambient magnetic field is sufficient to
modify the properties of the expanding supernova shock front and in particular
to prevent the formation of filamentary structures. Prior to the supernova
explosion, the compressed magnetic field in the circumstellar medium stabilises
the wind/ISM contact discontinuity in the tail of the wind bubble. A
consequence is a reduced mixing efficiency of ejecta and wind materials in the
inner region of the remnant, where the supernova shock wave propagates.
Radiative transfer calculations for synchrotron emission reveal that the
non-thermal radio emission has characteristic features reflecting the asymmetry
of exiled core-collapse supernova remnants from Wolf-Rayet progenitors. Our
models are qualitatively consistent with the radio appearance of several
remnants of high-mass progenitors, namely the bilateral G296.5+10.0 and the
shell-type remnants CTB109 and Kes 17, respectively.

and the Sun would experience a Dalton-like minimum, or even the Maunder-like
minimum, if the declining trend continues in the following several cycles, so
that the predictions of solar activity for cycles 25 and 26 are crucial. In Qin

two-parameter modified logistic prediction (TMLP) model, which can predict the
variation of SSNs in a solar cycle if the start time of the cycle has been
determined. In this work, we obtain a new model denoted as TMLP-extension
(TMLP-E), which can predict the solar cycle nearly two cycles in advance, so
that the predictions of cycles 25 and 26 are made. It is found that the
predicted solar maximum, ascent time, and cycle length are 115.1, 4.84 yr, and
11.06 yr, respectively, for cycle 25, and 107.3, 4.80 yr, and 10.97 yr,

We investigate the configuration of a complex flux rope above a
{\delta} sunspot region in NOAA AR 11515, and its eruptive expansion during a
confined M5.3-class flare.
  Methods. We study the formation of the {\delta} sunspot using continuum
intensity images and photospheric vector magnetograms provided by SDO/HMI. We
use EUV and UV images provided by SDO/AIA, and hard X-ray emission recorded by
RHESSI to investigate the eruptive details. The coronal magnetic field is
extrapolated with a non-linear force free field (NLFFF) method, based on which
the flux rope is identified by calculating the twist number Tw and squashing
factor Q. We search the null point via a modified Powell hybrid method.
  Results. The collision between two emerging spot groups form the {\delta}
sunspot. A bald patch (BP) forms at the collision location, above which a
complex flux rope is identified. The flux rope has multiple layers, with one
compact end and one bifurcated end, having Tw decreasing from the core to the
boundary. A null point is located above the flux rope. The eruptive process
consists of precursor flaring at a 'v'-shaped coronal structure, rise of the
filament, and flaring below the filament, corresponding well with the NLFFF
topological structures, including the null point and the flux rope with BP and
hyperbolic flux tube (HFT). Two sets of post-flare loops and three flare
ribbons support the bifurcation configuration of the flux rope.
  Conclusions. The precursor reconnection, which occurs at the null point,
weakens the overlying confinement to allow the flux rope to rise, fitting the
breakout model. The main phase reconnection, which may occur at the BP or HFT,
facilitates the flux rope rising. The results suggest that the {\delta} spot
configuration presents an environment prone to the formation of complex
magnetic configurations which will work together to produce activities.

formulation where the PDE constraints are eliminated. This approach is known to
be more computationally feasible than other alternatives at large scales.
However, the elimination of the constraints forces the optimization process to
fulfill the constraints at all times. In some problems this may lead to a
highly non-linear objective, which is hard to solve. An example to such a
problem, which we focus on in this work, is Full Waveform Inversion (FWI),
which appears in seismic exploration of oil and gas reservoirs, and medical
imaging. In an attempt to relieve the non-linearity of FWI, several approaches
suggested to expand the optimization search space and relax the PDE
constraints. This comes, however, with severe memory and computational costs,
which we aim to reduce. In this work we adopt the expanded search space
approach, and suggest a new formulation of FWI using extended source functions.
To make the source-extended problem more feasible in memory and computations,
we couple the source extensions in the form of a low-rank matrix. This way, we
have a large-but-manageable additional parameter space, which has a rather low
memory footprint, and is much more suitable for solving large scale instances
of the problem than the full rank additional space. In addition, we show how
our source-extended approach is applied together with the popular simultaneous
sources technique -- a stochastic optimization technique that significantly
reduces the computations needed for FWI inversions. We demonstrate our

novel learning methods on MTS data, with deep learning models dominating the
most recent advancements. Prior literature has primarily focused on designing

However, a less studied challenge is associated with high dimensionality of MTS
data. In this paper, we propose a novel neural component, namely Neural Feature
Selector (NFS), as an end-2-end solution for feature selection in MTS data.
Specifically, NFS is based on decomposed convolution design and includes two
modules: firstly each feature stream (a stream corresponds to an univariate
series of MTS) within MTS is processed by a temporal CNN independently; then an
aggregating CNN combines the processed streams to produce input for other
downstream networks. We evaluated the proposed NFS model on four real-world MTS
datasets and found that it achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art
methods while providing the benefit of feature selection. Our paper also
highlights the robustness and effectiveness of feature selection with NFS

difference in the molecular dynamics (MD) of water in the ranges from 273 to

associated with the metastable ice-like phase of water, in which hexagonal

dipoles play a key role in the mechanism of resonant activation by thermal
energy of consistent reactions of deformation, rupture and formation of
tetrahedral HBs in water clusters. The synergism of these reactions and the
interaction of the charges of the vacant acceptor and donor tetrahedral

highly-eccentric orbit ($a=18$\,au, $e=0.84$). Its host star possesses a common
proper-motion companion which is likely on a bound orbit. In this paper, we
explore scenarios for the excitation of the eccentricity of the planet in
binary systems such as this, considering planet-planet scattering, Lidov-Kozai
cycles from the binary acting on a single-planet system, or Lidov-Kozai cycles
acting on a two-planet system that also undergoes scattering. Planet-planet
scattering, in the absence of a binary companion, has a $2.8-7.2\%$ probability
of pumping eccentricities to the observed values in our simulations, depending
on the relative masses of the two planets. Lidov-Kozai cycles from the binary
acting on an initially circular orbit can excite eccentricities to the observed
value, but require very specific orbital configurations for the binary and
overall there is a low probability of catching the orbit at the high observed
high eccentricity ($0.6\%$). The best case is provided by planet-planet
scattering in the presence of a binary companion: here, the scattering provides
the surviving planet with an initial eccentricity boost that is subsequently
further increased by Kozai cycles from the binary. We find a success rate of
$14.5\%$ for currently observing $e\ge0.84$ in this set-up. The single-planet
plus binary and two-planet plus binary cases are potentially distinguishable if
the mutual inclination of the binary and the planet can be measured, as the
latter permits a broader range of mutual inclinations. The combination of
scattering and Lidov-Kozai forcing may also be at work in other wide-orbit
eccentric giant planets, which have a high rate of stellar binary companions.

empirical averages estimated from a high-dimensional dataset of independently
distributed equilibrium configurations of a given system. However, in several
applications such as biology, data result from stochastic evolutionary
processes, and configurations are related through a hierarchical structure,
typically represented by a tree, and therefore not independent. In turn,
empirical averages of observables superpose intrinsic signal related to the
equilibrium distribution of the studied system and spurious historical (or
phylogenetic) signal resulting from the structure underlying the
data-generating process. The naive application of inverse statistical physics
techniques therefore leads to systematic biases and an effective reduction of
the sample size. To advance on the currently open task of extracting intrinsic
signals from correlated data, we study a system described by a multivariate
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process defined on a finite tree. Using a Bayesian
framework, we can disentangle covariances in the data corresponding to their
multivariate Gaussian equilibrium distribution from those resulting from the
historical correlations. Our approach leads to a clear gain in accuracy in the
inferred equilibrium distribution, which corresponds to an effective two- to

achieved by, e.g., light in the XUV to x-ray range. These energies allow the
creation of ultrashort laser pulses and hence time-resolved measurements with
high time resolutions.
  So far, electronic decay processes were described by Fano's theory. However,
this theory considers only the involved electronic states while neglecting the
nuclear parts of the wavefunction. Especially in the case of ICD, though, the

obtain various lower and upper bounds, which are sometimes exact as is the case
for certain finite commutative rings of prime power cardinality. Two simple
examples that capture the essence of these higher degree Davenport constants
are the following. 1) Suppose $n = 2^k$, then every sequence of integers $S$ of
length $2n$ contains a subsequence $S'$ of length at least two such that
$\sum_{a_i,a_j \in S'} a_ia_j \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ and the bound is sharp. 2)
Suppose $n \equiv1 \pmod{2}$, then every sequence of integers $S$ of length $2n

modulating the kinetics of binding to target antigen. In the present study, we
study the association of a poly-histidine tagged enzyme (phosphoglycerate

Charge-Reorganization Allostery (CRA) effect. We further observe that the
negatively charged nucleotide substrates of PGK modulate CRA substantially,
even though they bind far away from the His-tag-antibody interaction interface.
In particular, binding of ATP reduces CRA by more than 50%. The results

turbulent solar wind, the shock surfaces fluctuate and ripple in a range of
different scales. We discuss particle acceleration at rippled shocks in the
presence of ambient solar-wind turbulence. This strongly affects particle
acceleration and transport of energetic particles (both ions and electrons) at
shock fronts. In particular, we point out that the effects of upstream
turbulence is critical for understanding the variability of energetic particles
at shocks. Moreover, the presence of pre-existing upstream turbulence
significantly enhances the trapping near the shock of low-energy charged
particles, including near the thermal energy of the incident plasma, even when
the shock propagates normal to the average magnetic field. Pre-existing
turbulence, always present in space plasmas, provides a means for the efficient
acceleration of low-energy particles and overcoming the well known injection
problem at shocks.

having effective methods to suppress errors. Recent breakthroughs have
introduced methods capable of exponentially suppressing errors by preparing
multiple noisy copies of a state and virtually distilling a more purified
version. Here we present an alternative method, the Resource-Efficient Quantum
Error Suppression Technique (REQUEST), that adapts this breakthrough to much
fewer qubits by making use of active qubit resets, a feature now available on
commercial platforms. Our approach exploits a space/time trade-off to achieve a
similar error reduction using only $2N+1$ qubits as opposed to $MN+1$ qubits,
for $M$ copies of an $N$ qubit state. Additionally, we propose a method using
near-Clifford circuits to find the optimal number of these copies in the
presence of realistic noise, which limits this error suppression. We perform a
numerical comparison between the original method and our qubit-efficient
version with a realistic trapped-ion noise model. We find that REQUEST can
reproduce the exponential suppression of errors of the virtual distillation
approach, while out-performing virtual distillation when fewer than $3N+1$
qubits are available. Finally, we examine the scaling of the number of shots
$N_S$ required for REQUEST to achieve useful corrections. We find that $N_S$
remains reasonable well into the quantum advantage regime where $N$ is hundreds

species sampling type and generates discrete distributions, which yield of the
order $n^\sigma$ different values (""species"") in a random sample of size $n$,
if the type $\sigma$ is positive. Thus this type parameter can be set to target
true distributions of various levels of discreteness, making the Pitman-Yor
process an interesting prior in this case. It was previously shown that the
resulting posterior distribution is consistent if and only if the true
distribution of the data is discrete. In this paper we derive the
distributional limit of the posterior distribution, in the form of a
(corrected) Bernstein-von Mises theorem, which previously was known only in the
continuous, inconsistent case. It turns out that the Pitman-Yor posterior
distribution has good behaviour if the true distribution of the data is
discrete with atoms that decrease not too slowly. Credible sets derived from
the posterior distribution provide valid frequentist confidence sets in this
case. For a general discrete distribution, the posterior distribution, although
consistent, may contain a bias which does not converge to zero at the
$\sqrt{n}$ rate and invalidates posterior inference. We propose a bias
correction that solves this problem. We also consider the effect of estimating
the type parameter from the data, both by empirical Bayes and full Bayes
methods. In a small simulation study we illustrate that without bias correction
the coverage of credible sets can be arbitrarily low, also for some discrete

problem because of the difficulty in separating an individual tooth from
adjacent teeth and its surrounding alveolar bone. Thus, this paper proposes a
fully automated method of identifying and segmenting 3D individual teeth from
dental CBCT images. The proposed method addresses the aforementioned difficulty
by developing a deep learning-based hierarchical multi-step model. First, it
automatically generates upper and lower jaws panoramic images to overcome the
computational complexity caused by high-dimensional data and the curse of
dimensionality associated with limited training dataset. The obtained 2D
panoramic images are then used to identify 2D individual teeth and capture
loose- and tight- regions of interest (ROIs) of 3D individual teeth. Finally,
accurate 3D individual tooth segmentation is achieved using both loose and
tight ROIs. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved an
F1-score of 93.35% for tooth identification and a Dice similarity coefficient
of 94.79% for individual 3D tooth segmentation. The results demonstrate that
the proposed method provides an effective clinical and practical framework for
digital dentistry.

devices is crucial for their performance. Central questions -- such as the role
of static energetic disorder and vibrational effects -- are under ongoing
dispute. This study provides an in-depth analysis of temperature dependent
broadening of the spectroscopic absorption and emission features of CT states
in devices with small molecule-fullerene blends. We confirm the validity of the
electro-optical reciprocity relation between the photovoltaic external quantum
efficiency ($\mathrm{EQE_{PV}}$) and electroluminescence ($\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$),
enabling us to validate the device temperature during the experiment. The
validated temperature allows us to fit our experimental data with several
models, and compare extracted CT state energies with the corresponding open
circuit voltage limit at $0\mathrm{\,K}$. Our findings unveil that the
absorption and emission characteristics are usually not symmetric, and
dominated by temperature-activated broadening (vibrational) effects instead of
static disorder.

taken before, during and after a small C2.0 flare in order to monitor the
evolution of the magnetic field evolution and its relation to the flare event.
We find that while the flare left the active region itself unaltered, the event
included a large Magnetic Field Enhancement (MFE), which consisted of a large
increase of the magnetic field to strengths just short of 500~G in a rather
small region where no magnetic field was measured before the flare. This MFE is
observed during the impulsive phase of the flare at the footpoints of flare
loops, its magnetic energy is sufficient to power the radiative losses of the
entire flare, and has completely dissipated after the flare. We argue that the
MFE might occur at the location of the reconnection event triggering the flare,
and note that it formed within 22 minutes of the flare start (as given by the
EIS raster return time). These results open the door to a new line of studies
aimed at determining whether MFEs 1) can be flare precursor events, 2) can be
used for Space Weather forecasts; and 3) what advance warning time they could
allow; as well as to explore which physical processes lead to their formation
and dissipation, whether such processes are the same in both long-duration and
impulsive flares, and whether they can be predicted by theoretical models.

  We evaluated SelfHAR on various HAR datasets and showed state-of-the-art
performance over supervised and previous semi-supervised approaches, with up to
12% increase in F1 score using the same number of model parameters at
inference. Furthermore, SelfHAR is data-efficient, reaching similar performance
using up to 10 times less labeled data compared to supervised approaches. Our

lymph nodes must be assessed to properly estimate disease progression and

estimation of short-axis diameter and mediastinum station are paramount for
correct diagnosis. A method for accurate and automatic segmentation is hence
decisive for quantitatively describing lymph nodes. In this study, the use of
3D convolutional neural networks, either through slab-wise schemes or the
leveraging of downsampled entire volumes, is investigated. Furthermore, the
potential impact from simple ensemble strategies is considered. As lymph nodes
have similar attenuation values to nearby anatomical structures, we suggest
using the knowledge of other organs as prior information to guide the
segmentation task. To assess the segmentation and instance detection
performances, a 5-fold cross-validation strategy was followed over a dataset of
120 contrast-enhanced CT volumes. For the 1178 lymph nodes with a short-axis
diameter $\geq10$ mm, our best performing approach reached a patient-wise
recall of 92%, a false positive per patient ratio of 5, and a segmentation
overlap of 80.5%. The method performs similarly well across all stations.
Fusing a slab-wise and a full volume approach within an ensemble scheme
generated the best performances. The anatomical priors guiding strategy is
promising, yet a larger set than four organs appears needed to generate an
optimal benefit. A larger dataset is also mandatory, given the wide range of
expressions a lymph node can exhibit (i.e., shape, location, and attenuation),

gleaned from photometry, particularly in redder optical bands. For
high-redshift SN Ia, these rest-frame red wavelengths will be observed by the
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our results also confirm previous work that
SN Ia host-galaxy stellar mass is strongly correlated with ejecta velocity:
high-velocity SN Ia are found nearly exclusively in high-stellar-mass hosts.
However, host-galaxy properties alone do not explain velocity-dependent
differences in supernova colors and luminosities across samples. Measuring and
understanding the connection between intrinsic explosion properties and
supernova environments, across cosmic time, will be important for precision

  Estimation with Both Implicit and Explicit Semantic Guidance",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised depth estimation has made a great success in learning depth
from unlabeled image sequences. While the mappings between image and pixel-wise
depth are well-studied in current methods, the correlation between image, depth
and scene semantics, however, is less considered. This hinders the network to
better understand the real geometry of the scene, since the contextual clues,
contribute not only the latent representations of scene depth, but also the
straight constraints for depth map. In this paper, we leverage the two benefits
by proposing the implicit and explicit semantic guidance for accurate
self-supervised depth estimation. We propose a Semantic-aware Spatial Feature
Alignment (SSFA) scheme to effectively align implicit semantic features with
depth features for scene-aware depth estimation. We also propose a
semantic-guided ranking loss to explicitly constrain the estimated depth maps
to be consistent with real scene contextual properties. Both semantic label
noise and prediction uncertainty is considered to yield reliable depth
supervisions. Extensive experimental results show that our method produces high
quality depth maps which are consistently superior either on complex scenes or
diverse semantic categories, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a
significant margin.

simulation, which provides the most accurate results, but is very
computationally expensive. In particular, the simulation convergence time
scales poorly as simulation domains become tighter or more heterogeneous.
Semi-analytical models that rely on averaged structural properties (i.e.
porosity and tortuosity) have been proposed, but these features only summarize
the domain, resulting in limited applicability. On the other hand, data-driven
machine learning approaches have shown great promise for building more general
models by virtue of accounting for the spatial arrangement of the domains solid
boundaries. However, prior approaches building on the Convolutional Neural
Network (ConvNet) literature concerning 2D image recognition problems do not
scale well to the large 3D domains required to obtain a Representative
Elementary Volume (REV). As such, most prior work focused on homogeneous
samples, where a small REV entails that that the global nature of fluid flow
could be mostly neglected, and accordingly, the memory bottleneck of addressing
3D domains with ConvNets was side-stepped. Therefore, important geometries such
as fractures and vuggy domains could not be well-modeled. In this work, we
address this limitation with a general multiscale deep learning model that is
able to learn from porous media simulation data. By using a coupled set of
neural networks that view the domain on different scales, we enable the
evaluation of large images in approximately one second on a single Graphics
Processing Unit. This model architecture opens up the possibility of modeling
domain sizes that would not be feasible using traditional direct simulation
tools on a desktop computer.

lack fundamental insight into how such models are related to the user's
inherent decision-making process. To provide this insight, we propose a novel
recurrent cell, namely FaNC, from Freudian and Newtonian perspectives. FaNC
divides the user's state into conscious and unconscious states, and the user's
decision process is modelled by Freud's two principles: the pleasure principle

user's instinct, we place the user's unconscious state and item embeddings in
the same latent space and subject them to Newton's law of gravitation.
Moreover, to recommend items to users, we model the reality principle, i.e.,
balancing the conscious and unconscious states, via a gating function. Based on
extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, this paper provides
insight into the characteristics of the proposed model. FaNC initiates a new

ensures that generated volumes are equally high quality at all points in space,
and that arbitrarily large volumes can be generated. SliceGAN has been
successfully trained on a diverse set of materials, demonstrating the

shown through a statistical comparison of synthetic and real datasets of a
battery electrode in terms of key microstructural metrics. Finally, we find
that the generation time for a $10^8$ voxel volume is on the order of a few

lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas
spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g.
Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from
diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators
in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of
parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North,
South, West, and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are
both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner,
except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central
question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation
(effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets
or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner
Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19
chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the
performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However,
Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%. . . 41.2%).
Thus, Lipi-Ring offers an alternative to Lipizzaner when the computational cost
of training matters.

methods to remove the least informative channels, e.g., to reduce the amount of
electrodes to be mounted, to decrease the computational load, or to reduce
overfitting effects and improve performance. Wrapper-based channel selection
methods aim to match the channel selection step to the target model, yet they
require to re-train the model multiple times on different candidate channel
subsets, which often leads to an unacceptably high computational cost,
especially when said model is a (deep) neural network. To alleviate this, we
propose a framework to embed the EEG channel selection in the neural network
itself to jointly learn the network weights and optimal channels in an
end-to-end manner by traditional backpropagation algorithms. We deal with the
discrete nature of this new optimization problem by employing continuous
relaxations of the discrete channel selection parameters based on the
Gumbel-softmax trick. We also propose a regularization method that discourages
selecting channels more than once. This generic approach is evaluated on two
different EEG tasks: motor imagery brain-computer interfaces and auditory
attention decoding. The results demonstrate that our framework is generally
applicable, while being competitive with state-of-the art EEG channel selection
methods, tailored to these tasks.

products. Live Emotion analysis and verification nullify deceit made to
complainers on live chat, corroborate messages of both ends in messaging apps
and promote an honest conversation between users. The main concept behind this
emotion artificial intelligent verifier is to license or decline message
accountability by comparing variegated emotions of chat app users recognized
through facial expressions and text prediction. In this paper, a proposed
emotion intelligent live detector acts as an honest arbiter who distributes
facial emotions into labels namely, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Hate.
Further, it separately predicts a label of messages through text
classification. Finally, it compares both labels and declares the message as a
fraud or a bonafide. For emotion detection, we deployed Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) using a miniXception model and for text prediction, we selected
Support Vector Machine (SVM) natural language processing probability classifier
due to receiving the best accuracy on training dataset after applying Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and
Logistic regression.

transfer across thousands of kilometers. A critical step in the further
developing optical frequency transfer is its capability to transfer a high
spectral purity feature from ultrastable lasers or optical clocks to any remote
locations and, at the same time, its adaptability to incorporate the optical
frequency transfer technique into any existing communication networks with
different topologies. Here we for the first time report a technique that
delivers optical-frequency signals to multiple independent remote hubs along a
ring optical-fiber network with passive phase stabilization. The technique
automatically corrects optical-fiber length fluctuations of arbitrary hubs
along the loop by mixing and shifting optical signals. Without the help of an
active phase tracker and a compensator, it could significantly mitigate some
technical problems such as the limited compensation speed and phase recovery
time, the phase jitter contamination caused by the servo bump in conventional
phase noise cancellation. Moreover, by transmitting optical signals along both
directions using the same optical source, it can improve the signal-to-noise
ratio at each hub. This technique maintains the same delay-limited phase noise
correction capability as in conventional techniques and, furthermore, improves
the phase jitter by a factor of 3, opening a way to a broad distribution of an
ultrastable frequency reference with high spectral purity and enabling a wide
range of applications beyond metrology over a ring fiber network with the
naturally impressive reliability and scalability.

multiple places based on passive phase noise cancellation over a bus topology
fiber network. This technique mitigates any active servo controller on the main
fiber link and at arbitrary access places as opposed to the conventional
technique, in which an active phase compensation circuit has to be adopted to
stabilize the main fiber link. Although the residual fiber phase noise power
spectral density (PSD) in the proposed technique turns out to be a factor of 7
higher than that of in the conventional multiple-access technique when the
access place is close to the end of the fiber link, it could largely suppress
the phase noise introduced by the servo bumps, improve the response speed and
phase recovery time, and minimize hardware overhead in systems with many
stations and connections without the need of the active servo circuits
including phase discriminators and active compensators. The proposed technique
could considerably simplify future efforts to make precise optical frequency
signals available to many users, as required by some large-scale science
experiments.

the initial investment required to found a new software company becomes smaller
and smaller resulting from technological advances such as cloud technology,
increasing numbers of new software startups are born. Typically, the main
argument for studying software startups is that they differ from mature
software organizations in various ways, thus making the findings of many
existing studies not directly applicable to them. How, exactly, software
startups really differ from other types of software organizations as an
on-going debate. In this paper, we seek to better understand how software
startups differ from mature software organizations in terms of development
practices. Past studies have primarily studied method use, and in comparison,
we take on a more atomic approach by focusing on practices. Utilizing the
Essence Theory of Software Engineering as a framework, we split these practices
into categories for analysis while simultaneously evaluating the suitability of
the theory for the context of software startups. Based on the results, we
propose changes to the Essence Theory of Software Engineering for it to better
fit the startup context.

aviation. During charging, plating of lithium metal, a critical failure
mechanism, has been studied and mitigation strategies have been proposed. For
electric aircraft, high discharge power requirements necessitate stripping of
lithium metal in an uniform way and recent studies have identified the
evolution of surface voids and pits as a potential failure mechanism. In this
work, using density functional theory calculations and thermodynamic analysis,
we investigate the discharge process on lithium metal surfaces. In particular,
we calculate the tendency for vacancy congregation on lithium metal surfaces,
which constitutes the first step in the formation of voids and pits. We find
that among the low Miller index surfaces, the (111) surface is the least likely
to exhibit pitting issues. Our analysis suggests that faceting control during
electrodeposition could be a key pathway towards simultaneously enabling both
fast charge and fast discharge.
