  MHC class I proteins","10 pages",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I pathway supports the
detection of cancer and viruses by the immune system. It presents parts of
proteins (peptides) from inside a cell on its membrane surface enabling
visiting immune cells that detect non-self peptides to terminate the cell. The
ability to predict whether a peptide will get presented on MHC Class I
molecules helps in designing vaccines so they can activate the immune system to
destroy the invading disease protein. We designed a prediction model using a
BERT-based architecture (ImmunoBERT) that takes as input a peptide and its
surrounding regions (N and C-terminals) along with a set of MHC class I (MHC-I)
molecules. We present a novel application of well known interpretability
techniques, SHAP and LIME, to this domain and we use these results along with
3D structure visualizations and amino acid frequencies to understand and
identify the most influential parts of the input amino acid sequences
contributing to the output. In particular, we find that amino acids close to
the peptides' N- and C-terminals are highly relevant. Additionally, some
positions within the MHC proteins (in particular in the A, B and F pockets) are
often assigned a high importance ranking - which confirms biological studies
and the distances in the structure visualizations.

  Auto-regression",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-attention architectures have emerged as a recent advancement for
improving the performance of vision tasks. Manual determination of the
architecture for self-attention networks relies on the experience of experts
and cannot automatically adapt to various scenarios. Meanwhile, neural
architecture search (NAS) has significantly advanced the automatic design of
neural architectures. Thus, it is appropriate to consider using NAS methods to
discover a better self-attention architecture automatically. However, it is
challenging to directly use existing NAS methods to search attention networks
because of the uniform cell-based search space and the lack of long-term
content dependencies. To address this issue, we propose a full-attention based
NAS method. More specifically, a stage-wise search space is constructed that
allows various attention operations to be adopted for different layers of a
network. To extract global features, a self-supervised search algorithm is
proposed that uses context auto-regression to discover the full-attention
architecture. To verify the efficacy of the proposed methods, we conducted
extensive experiments on various learning tasks, including image
classification, fine-grained image recognition, and zero-shot image retrieval.
The empirical results show strong evidence that our method is capable of
discovering high-performance, full-attention architectures while guaranteeing
the required search efficiency.

is desirable to access the space-time variation of echo intensity on each

subtle motion information of the potential blob targets can be accurately

solving an motion optical flow field (MOFF) function. Nonetheless, due to the
sparkle of the sonar echograph sequences, and strong interferences caused by
wake and cavitation noise of fast-moving ship in harbor environments, the
constraints underlying the traditional motion optical flow function that is
couples the brightness constancy constant along time dimension of each echo
intensity points and the motion field spatial smoothness does not hold in our

final properties of materials. We present extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
results on the segregation kinetics of the critical binary (AB) mixture with a
fraction of bond disorder (BD) introduced in a regular manner. We focus on
studying the effect of various quench temperatures on the growth kinetics and
scaling properties of evolving morphologies. The two-dimensional (2d) kinetic
Ising system with conserved spin exchange kinetics is used to model the system.
We observe that domain morphologies change from their usual interconnected
bicontinuous isotropic patterns at zero BD to short strips and lamellar
patterns (anisotropy) with increasing BD at shallow quench. The domain
evolution remains extremely slow at deep quench and for lower fractions of BD,
and thus, morphologies appear very similar; however, we observed lamellar
patterns at high BD. The scaling behavior represented by the correlation
function and the structure factor changes significantly with quench depths for
a higher fraction of BD. In contrast, a tiny deviation from the scaling is
observed at a lower fraction of disorder for shallow quenches. The growth law
is consistent with the Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS) growth law (\phi->1/3) for shallow
quench and at low fractions of BD studied here. At a high fraction of BD, the
length scale crossovers gradually from an early time LS growth to the diffusion
dynamics (\phi->1/2) during intermediate times for both deep and shallow
quenches. The domain growth freezes (\phi->0) to a finite size when the system
evolves to an equilibrium (stable) lamellar morphology in the asymptotic time
limit on the time scale of our simulation. However, no significant changes are
observed in the scaling behavior at lower fractions of BD for the deep quench.

  approximation in radiation therapy",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deterministic models for radiation transport describe the density of
radiation particles moving through a background material. In radiation therapy
applications, the phase space of this density is composed of energy, spatial
position and direction of flight. The resulting six-dimensional phase space
prohibits fine numerical discretizations, which are essential for the
construction of accurate and reliable treatment plans. In this work, we tackle
the high dimensional phase space through a dynamical low-rank approximation of
the particle density. Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) evolves the
solution on a low-rank manifold in time. Interpreting the energy variable as a
pseudo-time lets us employ the DLRA framework to represent the solution of the
radiation transport equation on a low-rank manifold for every energy. Stiff
scattering terms are treated through an efficient implicit energy
discretization and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt
the rank in energy. To facilitate the use of boundary conditions and reduce the
overall rank, the radiation transport equation is split into collided and
uncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles
are described by a directed quadrature set guaranteeing low computational
costs, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. It
can be shown that the presented method is L$^2$-stable under a time step
restriction which does not depend on stiff scattering terms. Moreover, the
implicit treatment of scattering does not require numerical inversions of
matrices. Numerical results for radiation therapy configurations as well as the
line source benchmark underline the efficiency of the proposed method.

add complexity to the modeling process. Gaussian process (GP) is a fully
data-driven and non-parametric Bayesian modeling approach which can be used as
a modeling component of MBC. The knowledge about the uncertainty is propagated
through predictions by generating local GPs for vehicles and broadcasting their
hyper-parameters as a model to the neighboring vehicles. In this research
study, GP is used to model each vehicle's speed trajectory, which allows
vehicles to access the future behavior of their preceding vehicle during
communication loss and/or low-rate communication. Besides, to overcome the
safety issues in a vehicle platoon, two operating modes for each vehicle are
considered; free following and emergency braking. This paper presents a
discrete hybrid stochastic model predictive control, which incorporates system
modes as well as uncertainties captured by GP models. The proposed control
design approach finds the optimal vehicle speed trajectory with the goal of
achieving a safe and efficient platoon of vehicles with small inter-vehicle gap
while reducing the reliance of the vehicles on a frequent communication.
Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller
considering the aforementioned communication paradigm with low-rate
intermittent communication.

the corresponding probability characteristic functions (pcf), or by a
polynomial chaos (PCE) or similar expansion. Here the interest is mainly to
compute characterisations like the entropy, or relations between two
distributions, like their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These are all computed
from the pdf, which is often not available directly, and it is a computational
challenge to even represent it in a numerically feasible fashion in case the
dimension $d$ is even moderately large. In this regard, we propose to represent
the density by a high order tensor product, and approximate this in a low-rank
format. We show how to go from the pcf or functional representation to the pdf.
This allows us to reduce the computational complexity and storage cost from an
exponential to a linear. The characterisations such as entropy or the
$f$-divergences need the possibility to compute point-wise functions of the
pdf. This normally rather trivial task becomes more difficult when the pdf is
approximated in a low-rank tensor format, as the point values are not directly

of the data as a tensor. All that we require is that the data can be considered
as an element of an associative, commutative algebra with an inner product.
Such an algebra is isomorphic to a commutative sub-algebra of the usual matrix
algebra, allowing the use of matrix algorithms to accomplish the mentioned

occur.
  In this paper, we consider the training dynamics of gradient flow on kernel
least-squares objectives, which is a limiting dynamics of SGD trained neural
networks. Using precise high-dimensional asymptotics, we characterize the
dynamics of the fitted model in two ""worlds"": in the Oracle World the model is
trained on the population distribution and in the Empirical World the model is
trained on a sampled dataset. We show that under mild conditions on the kernel
and $L^2$ target regression function the training dynamics undergo three stages
characterized by the behaviors of the models in the two worlds. Our theoretical
results also mathematically formalize some interesting deep learning phenomena.
Specifically, in our setting we show that SGD progressively learns more complex
functions and that there is a ""deep bootstrap"" phenomenon: during the second
stage, the test error of both worlds remain close despite the empirical
training error being much smaller. Finally, we give a concrete example
comparing the dynamics of two different kernels which shows that faster
training is not necessary for better generalization.

information geometry to explore sloppiness and its deep relation to emergent
theories. We introduce the model manifold of predictions, whose coordinates are
the model parameters. Its hyperribbon structure explains why only a few
parameter combinations matter for the behavior. We review recent rigorous
results that connect the hierarchy of hyperribbon widths to approximation
theory, and to the smoothness of model predictions under changes of the control

representations merely from texts. The learned representations encode the
distributional semantics but fail to connect to any knowledge about the
physical world. In contrast, humans learn language by grounding concepts in
perception and action and the brain encodes grounded semantics for cognition.
Inspired by this notion and recent work in vision-language learning, we design
a two-stream model for grounding language learning in vision. The model
includes a VGG-based visual stream and a Bert-based language stream. The two
streams merge into a joint representational space. Through cross-modal
contrastive learning, the model first learns to align visual and language
representations with the MS COCO dataset. The model further learns to retrieve
visual objects with language queries through a cross-modal attention module and
to infer the visual relations between the retrieved objects through a bilinear
operator with the Visual Genome dataset. After training, the language stream of
this model is a stand-alone language model capable of embedding concepts in a
visually grounded semantic space. This semantic space manifests principal
dimensions explainable with human intuition and neurobiological knowledge. Word
embeddings in this semantic space are predictive of human-defined norms of
semantic features and are segregated into perceptually distinctive clusters.
Furthermore, the visually grounded language model also enables compositional
language understanding based on visual knowledge and multimodal image search
with queries based on images, texts, or their combinations.

liquid oscillates around an immersed microfeature, typically a solid body or a
bubble. The ability of such features to locally concentrate stresses produces
strong inertial effects to which both fluid and immersed particles respond
within short length (O(100) microns) and time (milliseconds) scales, rendering
viscous streaming arguably the most efficient mechanism to exploit inertia at
the microscale. Despite this potential, viscous streaming has been investigated
in rather narrow conditions, mostly making use of bodies of uniform curvature
(cylinders, spheres) for which induced flow topologies are constrained to only
two regimes, classically referred to as single and double layer regimes. This
severely limits the scope of potential applications, and sits in stark contrast
to inertial focusing (the approach that perhaps has most defined the field of
inertial microfluidics), where instead boundaries with multiple curvatures have
long been utilised to magnify inertial effects, expand design space, and enable
novel applications. Here, we demonstrate that a multi-curvature approach in
viscous streaming dramatically extends the range of accessible flow topologies.
We show that numerically predicted, but never experimentally observed,
streaming flows can be physically reproduced, computationally engineered, and
in turn used to enhance particle manipulation, filtering and separation in
compact, robust, tunable and inexpensive devices. Overall, this study provides
an avenue to unlock the utility of viscous streaming with potential
applications in manufacturing, environment, health and medicine, from particle
self-assembly to microplastics removal.

just passivates the unintentional C donors. C-H complex formation explains why
MOCVD grown Ga$_2$O$_3$ can exhibit record-low free-carrier concentrations, in

parameterization of the clothes we consider, based on 3D UV maps encoding
spatial garment displacements. The problem is then formulated as a mapping
between the human kinematics space (represented also by 3D UV maps of the
undressed body mesh) into the clothes displacement UV maps, which we learn
using a conditional GAN with a discriminator that enforces feasible

encapsulating many different cloth topologies, and at test we can simulate

is experimentally tested in a laboratory setting. The objective is to
investigate the attenuation mechanisms of vertically polarized seismic waves
traveling at the surface of unconsolidated substrates that are characterized by
power-law rigidity profiles. Both geometric spreading and material damping due
to skeletal dissipation are considered. An electromagnetic shaker is employed
to excite the granular medium between 300 and 550 Hz, generating linear modes
that are localized near the surface. A densely sampled section is recorded at
the surface using a laser vibrometer. The explicit solution of the geometric
attenuation law of Rayleigh-like waves in layered media is employed to
calculate the geometric spreading function of the vertically polarized surface
modes within the granular material. In accordance with recent studies, the
dynamics of these small-amplitude multi-modal linear waves can be analysed by
considering the granular medium as perfectly continuous and elastic. By
performing a non-linear regression analysis on particle displacements,
extracted from experimental velocity data, we determine the frequency-dependent
attenuation coefficients, which account for the material damping.
  The findings of this work show that laboratory-scale physical models can be
used to study the geometric spreading of vertically polarized seismic waves
induced by the soil inhomogeneity and characterize the material damping of the

transfer show a striking discrepancy relative to the ratio extracted from
unpolarized elastic electron-proton scattering cross sections. One hypothesis
is that the discrepancy is caused by hard two-photon exchange (TPE), a
typically neglected radiative correction that may bias the two approaches
differently. This hypothesis has been challenging to confirm. Theoretical
estimates of TPE are model-dependent, and recent experimental determinations of
TPE lacked the kinematic reach to be conclusive. The possible impact of TPE
remains a cloud over our knowledge of the proton's form factors. Recently, the
OLYMPUS experiment published new elastic scattering cross sections that are
insensitive to the effects of TPE: specifically the average of electron-proton
and positron-proton cross sections. The OLYMPUS experiment, conducted at DESY,
Hamburg, measured elastic $e^-p$ and $e^+p$ scattering by detecting the
scattered lepton and recoiling proton in coincidence in a large-acceptance,
toroidal magnetic spectrometer. OLYMPUS was designed to measure the $e^+p/e^-p$
cross section raio to isolate the effects of TPE. By exploiting the over
determined kinematics of the reaction, the absolute efficiency of spectrometer
could be verified, allowing cross sections to be extracted from the data. These
results can help refine our knowledge of the proton's form factors, especially
in the squared momentum-transfer region of 1--2 GeV$^2$, where some previous
measurements are in tension.

approximation for both GR and some of its generalisations. It permits various
parameterisations of the motion, among which are the Lagrange-type and
Gauss-type orbital equations. Often, these equations are developed under the
Lagrange constraint, which makes the evolving orbital elements parameterise
instantaneous conics tangent to the orbit. Arbitrary mathematically, this
choice of a constraint is convenient under perturbations dependent only on
positions. Under perturbations dependent also on velocities (like relativistic
corrections) the Lagrange constraint unnecessarily complicates solutions that
can be simplified by introducing a freedom in the orbit parameterisation, which
is analogous to the gauge freedom in electrodynamics and gauge theories.
Geometrically, this freedom is the freedom of nonosculation, i.e. of the degree
to which the instantaneous conics are permitted to be non-tangent to the actual
orbit. Under the same perturbation, all solutions with different degree of
nonosculation look mathematically different, though describe the same physical
orbit. While non-intuitive, the modeling of an orbit with a sequence of
nontangent instantaneous conics can at times simplify calculations. The
appropriately generalised (""gauge-generalised"") Lagrange-type equations, and
their applications, appeared in the literature hitherto. We in this paper
derive the gauge-generalised Gauss-type equations and apply them to the PPN
two-body problem. Fixing the gauge freedom in three different ways (i.e.
modeling an orbit with non-osculating elements of three different types) we
find three parameterisations of the PPN two-body dynamics. These
parameterisations render orbits with either a fixed non-osculating semimajor
axis, or a fixed non-osculating eccentricity, or a fixed non-osculating
argument of periastron.

flip-flop network model consisting of mutually inhibitory interactions between
wake- and sleep-promoting neuronal populations. Motivated by changes in sleep
behavior during early childhood as babies transition from napping to
non-napping behavior, we vary homeostatic and circadian modulation and analyze
effects on resulting sleep-wake patterns. To identify the types and sequences
of bifurcations leading to changes in stable sleep-wake patterns in this
piecewise-smooth model, we employ multiple mathematical methods, including
fast-slow decomposition and numerical computation of circle maps. We find that
the average daily number of sleeps exhibits a period adding sequence as the
homeostatic time constants are reduced, and that the temporal circadian profile
influences the number of observed solutions in the sequence. These solutions
emerge through sequences of saddle-node and border collision bifurcations,
where the particular sequence depends on parameter values. When the temporal
circadian profile is steep, as is observed with long day lengths, some sleep
patterns are lost and bistability of other patterns may occur. We analyze a
limiting case of the temporal circadian waveform, a circadian hard switch

parameter. Possible parent distribution functions are then fit and tested
against the empirical IM distribution. Correlation and other analyses are then
performed to find IM relationships. The model is shown to perform well across

a very challenging task since the learning algorithm needs to deal with

Accelerating the adaptation process for a new target speaker is of importance

approach to the hard fast few-shot style transfer for voice cloning task using

to be highly sensitive for adaptation with few samples. Domain adversarial

Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to conduct fast

denoising using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has superior performance

deep learning-based method entitled ""SDnDTI"" for denoising DTI data, which does
not require additional high-SNR data for training. Specifically, SDnDTI divides
multi-directional DTI data into many subsets, each consisting of six DWI
volumes along optimally chosen diffusion-encoding directions that are robust to
noise for the tensor fitting, and then synthesizes DWI volumes along all
acquired directions from the diffusion tensors fitted using each subset of the
data as the input data of CNNs. On the other hand, SDnDTI synthesizes DWI
volumes along acquired diffusion-encoding directions with higher SNR from the
diffusion tensors fitted using all acquired data as the training target. SDnDTI
removes noise from each subset of synthesized DWI volumes using a deep
3-dimensional CNN to match the quality of the cleaner target DWI volumes and
achieves even higher SNR by averaging all subsets of denoised data. The
denoising efficacy of SDnDTI is demonstrated on two datasets provided by the

is interesting to note that the angular separation between the outermost
relativistic image and the others initially increases and then decreases as the
quantum parameter increases, indicating that there is a maximum in the angular
separation. The maximum is reached after the black hole becomes a wormhole,
which can be taken as a signal for the formation of the wormhole. Moreover, the

first-principles approach toward designing a scheduler that caters to the
unique characteristics of serverless functions as seen in real-world
deployments. We first create a taxonomy of scheduling policies along three
dimensions. Next, we use simulation to explore the scheduling policy space for
the function characteristics in a 14-day trace of Azure functions and conclude
that frequently used features such as late binding and random load balancing
are sub-optimal for common execution time distributions and load ranges. We use
these insights to design Hermes, a scheduler for serverless functions with
three key characteristics. First, to avoid head-of-line blocking due to high
function execution time variability, Hermes uses a combination of early binding
and processor sharing for scheduling at individual worker machines. Second,
Hermes uses a hybrid load balancing approach that improves consolidation at low
load while employing least-loaded balancing at high load to retain high
performance. Third, Hermes is both load and locality-aware, reducing the number
of cold starts compared to pure load-based policies. We implement Hermes for
Apache OpenWhisk and demonstrate that, for the case of the function patterns
observed both in the Azure and in other real-world traces, it achieves up to
85% lower function slowdown and 60% higher throughput compared to existing
policies.

gravitationally bound neutron star (NS) binaries, with orbital separation of
$10^9$ m. Based on Dewitt's approach, we calculate the gravitational Casimir
energy cost of the binary plane, which consists of statically gravitational
effects and deformation-induced effects. It is found that the static effects
include a term coming from the self-gravity of the orbital plane and the
contribution of Newtonian gravitational potential of the binary system. While
the deformation-induced effect also results from two parts, i.e. the
instability of orbital binding energy, scaling as $\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}$, and the
dynamically Casimir energy cost of the orbital binding energy, decaying as
$\frac{1}{(R-r)^4}$. The dynamically gravitational Casimir phenomena and the
corresponding energy cost modify the spiral-in orbital motion of the binary and
thus the frequency of released gravitational waves (GWs). We consider the
mechanical response of two NS components and qualitatively study the
corrections to the orbital motion of the system and the GW frequencies. It is
found that the dynamical Casimir effects exert a dissipative force on the
binary plane, depending on the frequency of GWs. The resultant dissipation may
enhance with the decaying separation and increasing GW frequencies, which
subsequently accelerates the orbital decay of the binary. However, the
dissipation rate just has an order of $10^{-70}$ eV/s. So the corrections to
the dynamics of NS binaries are very marginal, by considering the wide
separation, the cosmological coalescence time, and low-frequency GWs of the

be allocated irrevocably on arrival to one of $n$ agents, who have additive
valuations for the items. Our goal is to make the least happy agent as happy as
possible. In research on the topic of online allocation, this is a fundamental
and natural problem. Our main result is to reveal the asymptotic competitive
ratios of the problem for both the adversarial and i.i.d. input models. We
design a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that is asymptotically
$1/n$-competitive for the adversarial model, and we show that this guarantee is
optimal. To this end, we present a randomized algorithm with the same
competitive ratio first and then derandomize it. A natural derandomization
fails to achieve the competitive ratio of $1/n$. We instead build the algorithm
by introducing a novel technique. When the items are drawn from an unknown
identical and independent distribution, we construct a simple polynomial-time

the strict competitive ratio and show almost tight bounds for the solution. We
further mention some implications of our results on variants of the problem.

fundamentally linked to its internal turbulence. However, accurately measuring
the turbulent velocity dispersion is challenging due to projection effects and
observational limitations, such as telescope resolution, particularly for
clouds that include non-turbulent motions, such as large-scale rotation. Here
we develop a new method to recover the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent
velocity dispersion (${\sigma}_{v,3D}$) from position-position-velocity (PPV)
data. We simulate a rotating, turbulent, collapsing molecular cloud and compare
its intrinsic ${\sigma}_{v,3D}$ with three different measures of the velocity
dispersion accessible in PPV space: 1) the spatial mean of the 2nd-moment map,
${\sigma}_i$, 2) the standard deviation of the gradient/rotation-corrected
1st-moment map, ${\sigma}_{(c-grad)}$, and 3) a combination of 1) and 2),
called the 'gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion',
${\sigma}_{(p-grad)}=({\sigma}^2_i+{\sigma}^2_{(c-grad)})^{1/2}$. We show that
the gradient correction is crucial in order to recover purely turbulent motions
of the cloud, independent of the orientation of the cloud with respect to the
line of sight (LOS). We find that with a suitable correction factor and
appropriate filters applied to the moment maps, all three statistics can be
used to recover ${\sigma}_{v,3D}$, with method 3 being the most robust and
reliable. We determine the correction factor as a function of the telescope
beam size for different levels of cloud rotation, and find that for a beam FWHM
$f$ and cloud radius $R$, the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion can best be
recovered from the gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion via
${\sigma}_{v,3D}=[(-0.29\pm0.26)f/R+1.93\pm0.15]{\sigma}_{(p-grad)}$ for
$f/R<1$, independent of the level of cloud rotation or LOS orientation.

0.1956(2) d, longer than the orbital one, were detected during this outburst.
There are two possible interpretations of this period. The first one is
superhumps despite that V363 Lyr is far above the period gap. This
interpretation requires an evolved, undermassive secondary enabling a low mass
ratio of q=0.15. The evolution of this long-period variations, however, does
not follow the standard evolution of superhumps. The second one is that the
precursor occurred when the disk reached the tidal truncation radius, as
inferred from observations of IW And stars. In this case, the long-period
variations could be interpreted as a variable stream impact on a precessing
eccentric disk, which may have been formed by disturbances at the tidal
truncation radius. This might lead to effective removal of the angular momentum
which resulted in 0.3-0.4 mag brightening following the precursor. The
fractional period excess suggests that q is just above the stability limit of
the 3:1 resonance. In either cases, the nature of the secondary and the mass
ratio need to be verified by spectroscopic observations.

from student detector. Then we explore the self-knowledge distillation from a
new angle by decoupling original branch into a self-supervised learning branch
and a new self-knowledge distillation branch. With extensive experiments on the
PASCAL-VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks, the evaluation results show that UDFA can
surpass the standard training and state-of-the-art adversarial training methods

on GFLV2 with ResNet-50 improves clean precision by 2.2 AP on PASCAL-VOC;

machines, and a set J of n jobs, where each job j has a processing-time vector
$p_j\in \mathbb{R}^d_{\geq 0}$. The goal is to find an assignment $\sigma:J\to
[m]$ of jobs to machines so as to minimize the makespan $\max_{i\in
[m]}\max_{r\in [d]}( \sum_{j:\sigma(j)=i}p_{j,r})$. A natural lower bound on
the optimal makespan is lb $:=\max\{\max_{j\in J,r\in [d]}p_{j,r},\max_{r\in
[d]}(\sum_{j\in J}p_{j,r}/m)\}$. Our main result is a very simple O(log
d)-approximation algorithm for vector scheduling with respect to the lower
bound lb: we devise an algorithm that returns an assignment whose makespan is
at most O(log d)*lb.
  As an application, we show that the above guarantee leads to an O(log log
m)-approximation for Stochastic Minimum-Norm Load Balancing (StochNormLB). In
StochNormLB, we have m identical machines, a set J of n independent stochastic
jobs whose processing times are nonnegative random variables, and a monotone,
symmetric norm $f:\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. The goal is to find an
assignment $\sigma:J\to [m]$ that minimizes the expected $f$-norm of the
induced machine-load vector, where the load on machine i is the (random) total
processing time assigned to it. Our O(log log m)-approximation guarantee is in
fact much stronger: we obtain an assignment that is simultaneously an O(log log
m)-approximation for StochNormLB with all monotone, symmetric norms. Next, this
approximation factor significantly improves upon the O(log m/log log
m)-approximation in (Ibrahimpur and Swamy, FOCS 2020) for StochNormLB, and is a
consequence of a more-general black-box reduction that we present, showing that
a $\gamma(d)$-approximation for d-dimensional vector scheduling with respect to
the lower bound lb yields a simultaneous $\gamma(\log m)$-approximation for
StochNormLB with all monotone, symmetric norms.

(DPFA-Net), by selectively performing the neighborhood feature aggregation with
dynamic pooling and an attention mechanism. DPFA-Net has two variants for
semantic segmentation and classification of 3D point clouds. As the core module
of the DPFA-Net, we propose a Feature Aggregation layer, in which features of
the dynamic neighborhood of each point are aggregated via a self-attention
mechanism. In contrast to other segmentation models, which aggregate features
from fixed neighborhoods, our approach can aggregate features from different
neighbors in different layers providing a more selective and broader view to
the query points, and focusing more on the relevant features in a local
neighborhood. In addition, to further improve the performance of the proposed
semantic segmentation model, we present two novel approaches, namely Two-Stage
BF-Net and BF-Regularization to exploit the background-foreground information.
Experimental results show that the proposed DPFA-Net achieves the
state-of-the-art overall accuracy score for semantic segmentation on the S3DIS

tasks of semantic segmentation, part segmentation, and 3D object
classification. It is also computationally more efficient compared to other

means recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples.
This interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory,
which is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then
the original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much
less, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling
theories. A strong factor in Compressive Sensing (CS) theory to achieve the
sparsest solution and the noise removal from the corrupted image is the
selection of the basis dictionary. In this paper, Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) and moment transform (Tchebichef, Krawtchouk) are compared in order to
achieve image denoising of Gaussian additive white noise based on compressive
sensing and sparse approximation theory. The experimental results revealed that
the basis dictionaries constructed by the moment transform perform
competitively to the traditional DCT. The latter transform shows a higher PSNR
of 30.82 dB and the same 0.91 SSIM value as the Tchebichef transform. Moreover,
from the sparsity point of view, Krawtchouk moments provide approximately
20-30% more sparse results than DCT.

\textit{Enhancement of Index of Refraction}(EIR) in quantum optics. In the
quantum optical EIR the atomic systems are rendered by coherence and quantum
interference to exhibit orders of magnitude higher index of refraction with
vanishing or even negative absorption near their resonances. Similarly, in the
plasmon-induced EIR, a probe signal can experience positive, zero or negative
extinction while strongly interacting with a metallic nanorod in a metamolecule

the collective response of a square array of such metamolecules in the form of
a metasurface to modulate the amplitude of a signal by coherent control of
absorption from positive to negative values without implementing gain materials
or nonlinear processes. This novel approach can be used for challenging the
control of light by light at the extreme levels of space, time, and intensity
by applying ultra-short pulses interacting with ultrafast surface plasmons or
extremely low-intensity pulses at the level of single photon to a nanoscale
single plasmonic metamolecule. The scheme also introduces an effective tool for

transversal direction is sufficiently small. By choosing a gauge adapted to the
plane wave solution, we deduce an equivalent Euler-Lagrangian equation for the

our gating module chooses one of them, which results in a hybrid model of the

Full-Linearity (FL). We found that there exist strong correlations between

exhibit more preferences towards the non-linearity during the propagation
steps. To our knowledge, we are the first who design a hybrid method and report

quantitative geographic data. However, as the number of classes grows,
distinguishing between adjacent classes increasingly becomes challenging. To
mitigate this issue, this work introduces two new visualization types:
choriented maps (maps that use colour and orientation as variables to encode
geographic information) and choriented mobile (an optimization of choriented
maps for mobile devices). The maps were evaluated in a graphical perception
study featuring the comparison of SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) data for
several European countries. Choriented maps and choriented mobile
visualizations resulted in comparable, sometimes better effectiveness and
confidence scores than choropleth and graduated symbol maps. Choriented maps
and choriented mobile visualizations also performed well regarding efficiency
overall and performed worse only than graduated symbol maps. These results
suggest that the use of colour and orientation as visual variables in
combination can improve the selectivity of map symbols and user performance
during the exploration of geographic data in some scenarios.

erupt every ~$10^5$ years, while the recurrence time scale of modern recurrent
novae (N_r) stars ranges from 10 to ~100 years. To bridge this huge gap in our
knowledge (three orders of magnitude in time scales), it appears attractive to
consider historical data: In Far Eastern sources, we searched for brightening
events at different epochs but similar positions that possibly refer to
recurrent nova eruptions. Probing a sample of ~185 Asian observations from ~500
BCE to 1700 CE, we present a method to systematically filter possible events.
The result are a few search fields with between 2 and 5 flare ups and typical
cadences between $10^2$ and $10^3$ years. For most of our recurrence
candidates, we found possible counterparts among known cataclysmic variables in
the corresponding search areas. This work is based on an interdisciplinary
approach, combining methods from digital humanities and computational
astrophysics when applying our previously developed methods in searches for
classical novae among Far Eastern guest stars. A first and rather preliminary
comparison of (possible) historical and (well known) modern recurrent novae
reveals first tentative hints on some of their properties, stimulating further
studies in this direction.

images with plausible contents. Recent inpainting methods have introduced
perceptual and style losses as auxiliary losses to guide the learning of
inpainting generators. Perceptual and style losses help improve the perceptual
quality of inpainted results by supervising deep features of generated regions.
However, two challenges have emerged with the usage of auxiliary losses: (i)
the time-consuming grid search is required to decide weights for perceptual and
style losses to properly perform, and (ii) loss terms with different auxiliary
abilities are equally weighted by perceptual and style losses. To meet these
two challenges, we propose a novel framework that independently weights
auxiliary loss terms and adaptively adjusts their weights within a single
training process, without a time-consuming grid search. Specifically, to
release the auxiliary potential of perceptual and style losses, we propose two
auxiliary losses, Tunable Perceptual Loss (TPL) and Tunable Style Loss (TSL) by
using different tunable weights to consider the contributions of different loss
terms. TPL and TSL are supersets of perceptual and style losses and release the
auxiliary potential of standard perceptual and style losses. We further propose
the Auxiliary Weights Adaptation (AWA) algorithm, which efficiently reweights
TPL and TSL in a single training process. AWA is based on the principle that
the best auxiliary weights would lead to the most improvement in inpainting
performance. We conduct experiments on publically available datasets and find
that our framework helps current SOTA methods achieve better results.

an efficient solution to avoid ghosting artifacts. However, it is very
challenging to restore a full-resolution HDR image from a real-world image with
SVE because: a) only one-third of pixels with varying exposures are captured by

Multimodal locomotions are achieved, and the influence of porous silica doping
on the stability of each locomotion in nonideal environment is explored in
depth. Motions in nonideal circumstances such as climbing, loading, current
rushing, wind blowing, and obstacle hindering are conducted successfully with
porous silica doping. Such a stability-enhanced multimodal locomotion system
can be used in biocatalysis as well as thrombus removal, and its prospect for
precision medicine is highlighted by in vivo demonstration of multimodal

[1] which works well with quantization of synaptic weights. We train several
5-layer DNNs on MNIST dataset using 2-, 3- and 5-state DW device as synapse.
For in-situ training, a separate high precision memory unit is adopted to
preserve and accumulate the weight gradients, which are then quantized to
program the low precision DW devices. Moreover, a sizeable noise tolerance
margin is used during the training to address the intrinsic programming noise.
For ex-situ training, a precursor DNN is first trained based on the
characterized DW device model and a noise tolerance margin, which is similar to
the in-situ training. Remarkably, for in-situ inference the energy dissipation

gravitational response of heavy-particle vacuum energies is strongly
suppressed. The models contain three ingredients: (i) a relaxation mechanism,
(ii) a very supersymmetric gravity sector coupled to matter for which
supersymmetry is non-linearly realised, and (iii) an accidental approximate
scale invariance expressed through the presence of a low-energy dilaton
supermultiplet. All three are common in higher-dimensional and string
constructions and although none suffices on its own, taken together they can
dramatically suppress the net vacuum-energy density. The dilaton's {\it
vev}~$\tau$ determines the weak scale $M_W \sim M_p/\sqrt\tau$. We compute the
potential for $\tau$ and find it can be stabilized in a local de Sitter minimum
at sufficiently large field values to explain the electroweak hierarchy, doing
so using input parameters no larger than $O(60)$ because the relevant potential
arises as a rational function of $\ln\tau$. The de Sitter vacuum energy at the
minimum is order $c\, M_W^8 \propto 1/\tau^4$, with $c \ll O(M_W^{-4})$. We
discuss how to achieve $c \sim 1/M_p^4$ as required by observations. Scale
invariance implies the dilaton couples to matter like a Brans-Dicke scalar with
dangerously large coupling yet because it comes paired with an axion it can
evade bounds through the novel screening mechanism described in {\tt
ArXiV:2110.10352}. Cosmological axio-dilaton evolution predicts a natural
quintessence model for Dark Energy, whose evolution can realize recent
proposals to resolve the Hubble tension, and whose axion contributes to Dark
Matter. We summarize inflationary implications and some remaining challenges,

neutrino model PRD 103, 063540 (2021), enabling one to unify inflation with the
present dark energy, can be used for producing an early dark energy. The model
works in the following way. At early stages of the Big-Bang, the inflaton
trapped in the minimum at $\phi = 0$ gets uplifted due to interaction with
neutrinos and starts to roll down to one of the degenerate minima of the
effective potential and after a while gets anchored at this minimum, which in
turn evolves in time very slowly. Correspondingly, the early dark energy taking
place as a result of this dynamical symmetry breaking also varies in time very
slowly. Shortly before the recombination epoch, however, the symmetry is
restored and early dark energy disappears. A typical problem of the mass
varying neutrino models is that they can hardly provide the needed amount of
early dark energy at the tree-level because of smallness of neutrino masses.
Nevertheless, the quantum fluctuations of $\phi$ can do the job in providing
sufficient early dark energy under assumption that inflationary energy scale is
of the order of $1$\,TeV. Radiative as well as thermal corrections coming from
the neutrino sector do not affect the model significantly. As for the gravity
induced corrections to the effective potential - they can be safely ignored.

scheme, and a joint transmit beamforming and phase shift optimization at the
base station (BS) and RIS, respectively. The alternating optimization (AO)
algorithm is proposed to handle the coupling between active beamforming and
passive RIS phase shifts, and the successive convex approximation (SCA)
algorithm is utilized to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problems.
The improvement in terms of AoI provided by the proposed algorithm and the
trade-off between the age of information and energy harvesting is quantified by
the numerical simulation results.

larger than the first zero of the potential, and gravity becomes repulsive at

opportunities for the experimental exploration of driven-dissipative many-body
systems in unconventional regimes. One of such regimes occurs in bosonic
systems, where nowadays one can induce driving and dissipation through pairs of
excitations, rather than the conventional single-excitation processes.
Moreover, modern platforms can be driven in a way in which the modes of the
bosonic array decay collectively rather than locally, such that the pairs of
excitations recorded by the environment come from a coherent superposition of
all sites. In this work we analyze the superfluid phases accessible to bosonic
arrays subject to these novel mechanisms more characteristic of quantum optics,
which we prove to lead to remarkable spatiotemporal properties beyond the
traditional scope of pattern formation in condensed-matter systems or nonlinear
optics alone. We show that, even in the presence of residual local loss, the
system is stabilized into an exotic state with bosons condensed along the modes
of a closed manifold in Fourier space, with a distribution of the population
among these Fourier modes that can be controlled via a weak bias (linear)
drive. This gives access to a plethora of different patterns, ranging from
periodic and quasi-periodic ones with tunable spatial wavelength, to
homogeneously-populated closed-Fourier-manifold condensates that are thought to
play an important role in some open problems of condensed-matter physics.
Moreover, we show that when any residual local linear dissipation is balanced
with pumping, new constants of motion emerge that can force the superfluid to
oscillate in time, similarly to the mechanism behind the recently discovered
superfluid time crystals. We propose specific experimental implementations with
which this rich and unusual spatiotemporal superfluid behavior can be explored.

a model where the GEB wormhole geometry is embedded in a five dimensional

our system only utilize local and relative information to make decisions and
control themselves distributively. Agent in the multi-agent system will
reorganize themselves into a new topology quickly in case that any of them is

formation convergence rate and on-par success rate of obstacle avoidance
compared with baselines (both classic control methods and another RL-based

the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as a special case. For any locally-unique

invariant under continuous modification of models in the class with a
locally-unique (fixed-charge) gapped ground state. This establishes that any
path of models in the class that connects the two extreme cases of the SSH

is believed to be optimal for the class of models considered here. We also show
an interesting duality of the index, and prove that any topologically

Here we stress that we do not have a specific model in mind, but a whole
collection of models which can be transformed into each other, or represent
different aspects of the pandemic. Each single model is based on a mathematical
formulation that we call a rule-based system. They have several advantages, for
example that they can be both interpreted both stochastically and
deterministically without changing the model structure. Rule-based systems
should be easier to communicate to non-specialists, when compared to
differential equations. Due to their combinatorial nature, the rule-based model
framework we propose is ideal for systematic mathematical modelling, systematic
links to statistics, data analysis in general and machine learning. Most
importantly, the framework can be used inside a Bayesian model selection
algorithm, which can extend unsupervised machine learning technology to gain
mechanistic insight through mathematical models. We first introduce the
Bayesian model selection algorithm and give an introduction to rule-based
systems. We propose precursor models, all consistent with our rule-based
framework and relevant for the COVID-19 pandemic. We complement the models with
numerical results and, for some of them, we include analytical results such as
the calculation of the number of new infections generated by an infected person
during their infectious period. We conclude the article with an in depth

potential to provide Tb/s aggregate rates. In this paper, interference
management is studied in a Laser-based optical wireless network where
vertical-cavity surface-emitting (VCSEL) lasers are used for data transmission.
In particular, rate splitting (RS) and hierarchical rate splitting (HRS) are
proposed to align multi-user interference, while maximizing the multiplexing
gain of the network. Basically, RS serves multiple users simultaneously by
splitting a message of a user into common and private messages, each message
with a certain level of power, while on the other side users decode their
messages following a specific methodology. The performance of the conventional
RS scheme is limited in high density wireless networks. Therefore, the HRS
scheme is developed aiming to achieve high rates where users are divided into
multiple groups, and a new message called outer common message is used for
managing inter-group interference. We formulate an optimization problem that
addresses power allocation among the messages of the HRS scheme to further
enhance the performance of the network. The results show that the proposed
approach provides high achievable rates compared with the conventional RS and
HRS schemes in different scenarios.

images and computer vision can improve human-computer and human-robot
interaction. However, privacy has become an issue of great concern, as the
identities of people used to train affective models can be exposed in the
process. For instance, malicious individuals could exploit images from users
and assume their identities. In addition, affect recognition using images can
lead to discriminatory and algorithmic bias, as certain information such as
race, gender, and age could be assumed based on facial features. Possible
solutions to protect the privacy of users and avoid misuse of their identities
are to: (1) extract anonymised facial features, namely action units (AU) from a
database of images, discard the images and use AUs for processing and training,
and (2) federated learning (FL) i.e. process raw images in users' local
machines (local processing) and send the locally trained models to the main
processing machine for aggregation (central processing). In this paper, we
propose a two-level deep learning architecture for affect recognition that uses
AUs in level 1 and FL in level 2 to protect users' identities. The architecture
consists of recurrent neural networks to capture the temporal relationships
amongst the features and predict valence and arousal affective states. In our
experiments, we evaluate the performance of our privacy-preserving architecture
using different variations of recurrent neural networks on RECOLA, a
comprehensive multimodal affective database. Our results show state-of-the-art
performance of $0.426$ for valence and $0.401$ for arousal using the
Concordance Correlation Coefficient evaluation metric, demonstrating the
feasibility of developing models for affect recognition that are both accurate
and ensure privacy.

static and dynamic properties of hosted skyrmions are studied theoretically. We
predict the effects of the curvature-induced drift of skyrmions under the
action of the curvature gradients without any external stimuli. The strength of
the curvature-induced driving force essentially depends on the skyrmion type,
Neel or Bloch, while the trajectory of motion is determined by the type of
magnetic ordering: ferro- or antiferromagnetic. When moving on the surface,
skyrmions undergo deformations that depend on the type of skyrmion. In the
small-curvature limit, using the collective-variable approach we show, that the
driving force acting on a Neel skyrmion is linear in the gradient of the mean
curvature. The driving acting on a Bloch skyrmion is much smaller: it is
proportional to the product of the mean curvature and its gradient. In contrast
to the fast Neel skyrmions, the dynamics of the slow Bloch skyrmions is
essentially affected by the skyrmion profile deformation. For the sake of
simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of zero Gaussian curvature and
consider cylindrical surfaces of general type. Equations of motion for
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic skyrmions in curved magnetic films are
obtained in terms of collective variables. All analytical predictions are
confirmed by numerical simulations.

formulated. By following the original idea of David Hestenes in the spacetime
algebra of signature $(+,-,-,-)$, the techniques related to relative vector and
spacetime split are built up in the spacetime algebra of signature $(-,+,+,+)$.
The even subalgebras of the spacetime algebras of signatures
$(\pm,\mp,\mp,\mp)$ share the same operation rules, so that they could be
treated as one algebraic formalism, in which spacetime physics is described in
a signature invariant form. Based on the two spacetime algebras and their
""common"" even subalgebra, rotor techniques on Lorentz transformation and
relativistic dynamics of a massive particle in curved spacetime are
constructed. A signature invariant treatment of the general Lorentz boost with
velocity in an arbitrary direction and the general spatial rotation in an
arbitrary plane is presented. For a massive particle, the spacetime splits of
the velocity, acceleration, momentum, and force four-vectors with the
normalized four-velocity of the fiducial observer, at rest in the coordinate
system of the spacetime metric, are given, where the proper time of the
fiducial observer is identified, and the contribution of the bivector
connection is considered, and with these results, a three-dimensional analogue
of Newton's second law for this particle in curved spacetime is achieved.
Finally, as a comprehensive application of the techniques constructed in this
paper, a geometric algebra approach to gyroscopic precession is provided, where
for a gyroscope moving in the Lense-Thirring spacetime, the precessional
angular velocity of its spin is derived in a signature invariant manner.

shear flow is studied numerically, while considering unsteady, continuous and
nonuniform boundary conditions on its surface. Here, the capsule acts as a
reservoir with its initially encapsulated solute concentration decaying over
time. This scenario differs from the classical case study of either constant
concentration or constant mass flux at the surface of the particle. The flow
and the concentration field are computed using fully three-dimensional lattice
Boltzmann simulations, where the fluid-structure two-way coupling is achieved
by the immersed boundary method. Effects of the flow and the boundary
conditions on mass transfer efficacy are quantified by the Sherwood number (the
dimensionless mass transfer coefficient), which is found to increase due to the
combined effects of forced convection and local shear induced by the rotation
of the capsule. Having continuity of both the concentration and the mass flux
on the capsule significantly decreases the Sherwood number as compared to the
case with constant and uniform boundary conditions. All the obtained results
can be applied to heat transfer in case of cooling an initially hot spherical

several measures of irreversibility have been introduced to assess the distance
from thermal equilibrium of a stochastically driven system. While the dynamical
noise is often approximated as white, in many real applications the time
correlations of the random forces can actually be significantly long-lived
compared to the relaxation times of the driven system. We analyze the effects
of temporal correlations in the noise on commonly used measures of
irreversibility and demonstrate how the theoretical framework for white noise

improves with increasing strain rate, while for larger strains the
predictability vs strain rate relation becomes non-monotonic. We show that for

circularly moving point mass perturber in a gaseous medium. We demonstrate
that, when the perturber is turned on at $t=0$, steady-state (infinite time
perturbation) is achieved after exactly one sound-crossing time. At low Mach
number $\mathcal{M}~\ll~1$, the circular-motion steady-state DF converges to
the linear-motion, finite time perturbation expression. The analytic results
describe both the radial and tangential forces on the perturbers caused by the
backreaction of the wake propagating in the medium. The radial force is
directed inward, toward the motion centre, and is dominant at large Mach
numbers. For subsonic motion, this component is negligible. For moderate and
low Mach numbers, the tangential force is stronger and opposes the motion of
the perturber. The analytic solution to the circular-orbit DF suffers from a
logarithmic divergence in the supersonic regime. This divergence appears at
short distances from the perturber solely (unlike the linear motion result
which is also divergent at large distances) and can be encoded in a maximum
multipole. This is helpful to assess the resolution dependence of numerical
simulations implementing DF at the level of Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials. We
also show how our approach can be generalised to calculate the DF acting on a

approach on anteroposterior pelvic X-rays to measure anatomical version,

using their CT images. The proposed deep learning model, Attention on

population. The age and gender of these people are added as two other inputs to

increase as people get older with the mean values of 16.54 and 16.11 (right and
left angles) for men and 20.61 and 19.55 for women in our dataset. The
predicted errors in the estimation of right and left angles using the proposed

several limitations in the need for an exhaustive annotation of object
categories, a possible domain gap between datasets, and a bias that is

the common rationale that a sequence of video frames capture a set of common
objects and interactions between them, thus a notion of co-segmentation between
the video frame features may equip the model with the ability to automatically
focus on task-specific salient regions and improve the underlying task's
performance in an end-to-end manner. In this regard, we propose a generic
module called ``Co-Segmentation inspired Attention Module'' (COSAM) that can be
plugged in to any CNN model to promote the notion of co-segmentation based
attention among a sequence of video frame features. We show the application of
COSAM in three video-based tasks namely: 1) Video-based person re-ID, 2) Video

to capture the task-specific salient regions in video frames, thus leading to
notable performance improvements along with interpretable attention maps for a

the need to estimate their partition functions. The state of the art in
addressing this problem is multi-stage algorithms, which consist of a cooling

schedule in these algorithms is adaptive, the mean estimation computations use
MCMC as a black-box to draw approximate samples. We develop a doubly adaptive

accretion dynamics on an intermediate scale between the Schwarzschild radius
and the galactic scale, which is $\sim$1-100 pc. We demonstrate that a rotating
disk formed on a parsec-scale acquires poloidal magnetic fields via accretion
and this produces an asymmetric bipolar outflow at some point. The formation of
the outflow was found to follow the growth of strongly magnetized regions
around disk surfaces (magnetic bubbles). The bipolar outflow grew continuously
inside the expanding bubbles. We theoretically derived the growth condition of
magnetic bubbles for our model that corresponds to a necessary condition for
outflow growth. We found that the north-south asymmetric structure of the
bipolar outflow originates from the complex motions excited by accreting flows
around the outer edge of the disk. The bipolar outflow comprises multiple
mini-outflows and downflows (failed outflows). The mini-outflows emanate from
the magnetic concentrations (magnetic patches). The magnetic patches exhibit
inward drifting motions, thereby making the outflows unsteady. We demonstrate
that the inward drift can be modeled using a simple magnetic patch model that
considers magnetic angular momentum extraction. This study could be helpful for
understanding how asymmetric and non-steady outflows with complex substructures

radiation from accretion disks or entrainment by radio jets such as molecular
outflows in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei, NGC 1377.

  Implementation Based on Mixed Integer Model Predictive Control","13 pages, 18 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coasting has been widely used in the eco-driving guidelines to reduce fuel
consumption by profiting from kinetic energy. However, the comprehensive
comparison between different coasting strategies and online performance of the
eco-coasting strategy using road grade preview are still unclear because of the
oversimplification and the integer variable in the optimal control problems.
Herein, two different coasting strategies (fuel cut-off and engine start/stop)
are proposed to reveal the potential benefit of eco-coasting using the road
grade preview. Engine drag torque and energy cost used for engine restart are
considered in the modeling to give a fair evaluation of the offline and online
performance. The offline performance of these two coasting methods is evaluated
through dynamic programming (DP) under various driving scenarios with different
slope profiles. Offline simulation shows that the engine start/stop method
outperforms the fuel cut-off method in terms of fuel consumption and travel
time by getting rid of the engine drag torque. Then, online performance of
these two coasting methods is evaluated using Mixed Integer Model Predictive
Control (MIMPC). A novel operational constraint on the minimum off steps is
added in the MIMPC formulation to avoid frequent switch of the integer
variables which represent the fuel cut-off and the engine start/stop mechanism.
Simulation results show that, for both fuel cut-off and engine start/stop
coasting methods, the MPC controller reduces fuel consumption to a level
comparable to DP without sacrificing the travel time.

  Aggregations",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequential recommendation aims to choose the most suitable items for a user
at a specific timestamp given historical behaviors. Existing methods usually
model the user behavior sequence based on the transition-based methods like
Markov Chain. However, these methods also implicitly assume that the users are
independent of each other without considering the influence between users. In
fact, this influence plays an important role in sequence recommendation since
the behavior of a user is easily affected by others. Therefore, it is desirable
to aggregate both user behaviors and the influence between users, which are
evolved temporally and involved in the heterogeneous graph of users and items.
In this paper, we incorporate dynamic user-item heterogeneous graphs to propose
a novel sequential recommendation framework. As a result, the historical
behaviors as well as the influence between users can be taken into
consideration. To achieve this, we firstly formalize sequential recommendation
as a problem to estimate conditional probability given temporal dynamic
heterogeneous graphs and user behavior sequences. After that, we exploit the
conditional random field to aggregate the heterogeneous graphs and user
behaviors for probability estimation, and employ the pseudo-likelihood approach
to derive a tractable objective function. Finally, we provide scalable and
flexible implementations of the proposed framework. Experimental results on
three real-world datasets not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method but also provide some insightful discoveries on sequential
recommendation.

centuries. Although there are good arguments based on our current understanding
of the laws of nature for the view that it is not possible for humans to have
free will, most people believe they do. This discrepancy begs for an
explanation. If we accept that we do not have free will, we are faced with two
problems: (1) while freedom is a very commonly used concept that everyone
intuitively understands, what are we actually referring to when we say that an
action or choice is ""free"" or not? And, (2) why is the belief in free will so
common? Where does this belief come from, and what is its purpose, if any? In
this paper, we examine these questions from the perspective of reinforcement
learning (RL). RL is a framework originally developed for training artificial
intelligence agents. However, it can also be used as a computational model of
human decision making and learning, and by doing so, we propose that the first
problem can be answered by observing that people's common sense understanding
of freedom is closely related to the information entropy of an RL agent's
normalized action values, while the second can be explained by the necessity
for agents to model themselves as if they could have taken decisions other than
those they actually took, when dealing with the temporal credit assignment
problem. Put simply, we suggest that by applying the RL framework as a model
for human learning it becomes evident that in order for us to learn efficiently
and be intelligent we need to view ourselves as if we have free will.

cell of the structure consists of a hollow-square plate connected to a ring

allow for coupling the axial and the torsional motion of the lattice, thus
amplifying the inertia of the system. We develop both simplified analytical and
numerical models of the building block to derive the complex dispersion
relation of the infinite lattice. The structure supports a frequency-tailorable
attenuation zone, whose lower bound is controlled by the second coupled
axial-torsional mode. Laboratory measurements of the transmission spectrum on a
3D printed sample match very well with the analytical and numerical
predictions, confirming the wide-band filtering properties of this lattice. We
complete our investigation by developing and solving a constrained optimization
model to obtain the optimized geometric parameters of the unit cell that
minimize the bandgap opening frequency and, at the same time, fulfill
structural requirements. In particular, the internal stresses induced by the
self-weight of the structure are kept to a low by virtue of the employed

algorithms to classify, segment and evaluate the results of scientific work.
Initially, the proposed framework categorize the abstract texts into according
to the problems intended to be solved by employing a text classification
approach. Then, the abstract text is segmented into problem description,
methodology and results. Finally, the methodology of the abstract is ranked
based on the sentiment analysis of its results. The proposed framework allows
us to quickly rank the best methods to solve specific problems. To validate the
proposed framework, oil production anomaly abstracts were experimented and
achieved promising results.
