timing variations (TTVs) are presented for these systems based on observations
that span the period 2016 - 2020. The data were collected with the 0.6 m
telescope at Adiyaman University (ADYU60, Turkey) and the 1.0 m telescope at
T\""UB\.ITAK National Observatory (TUG, Turkey). Global fits were performed to
the combined light curves for each system along with the corresponding radial
velocity (RV) data taken from the literature. The extracted parameters (for all
three systems) are found to be consistent with the values from previous
studies. Through fits to the combined mid-transit times data from our
observations and the data available in the literature, an updated linear
ephemeris is obtained for each system. Although a number of potential outliers
are noted in the respective O-C diagrams, the majority of the data are
consistent within the 3$\sigma$ confidence level implying a lack of convincing
evidence for the existence of additional objects in the systems studied.

  Recognition","Accepted in FG2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.SD eess.AS eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal analysis has recently drawn much interest in affective computing,
since it can improve the overall accuracy of emotion recognition over isolated
uni-modal approaches. The most effective techniques for multimodal emotion
recognition efficiently leverage diverse and complimentary sources of
information, such as facial, vocal, and physiological modalities, to provide
comprehensive feature representations. In this paper, we focus on dimensional
emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities
extracted from videos, where complex spatiotemporal relationships may be
captured. Most of the existing fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or
conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the
complimentary nature of audio-visual (A-V) modalities. We introduce a
cross-attentional fusion approach to extract the salient features across A-V
modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence
and arousal. Our new cross-attentional A-V fusion model efficiently leverages
the inter-modal relationships. In particular, it computes cross-attention
weights to focus on the more contributive features across individual
modalities, and thereby combine contributive feature representations, which are
then fed to fully connected layers for the prediction of valence and arousal.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated experimentally on
videos from the RECOLA and Fatigue (private) data-sets. Results indicate that
our cross-attentional A-V fusion model is a cost-effective approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches. Code is available:

state-of-the-art copresence detection schemes suffer from two major
limitations: (1) they cannot accurately detect copresence in low-entropy
context (e.g., empty room with few events occurring) and insufficiently
separated environments (e.g., adjacent rooms), (2) they require devices to have
common sensors (e.g., microphones) to capture context, making them impractical
on devices with heterogeneous sensors. We address these limitations, proposing
Next2You, a novel copresence detection scheme utilizing channel state

range of subcarriers specifying a Wi-Fi channel to capture a robust wireless

off-the-shelf smartphones relying only on ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipsets and
evaluate it based on over 95 hours of CSI measurements that we collect in five

accurate copresence detection both in low-entropy context and insufficiently

especially the multi-focus configuration, where several types of micro-lenses
are used, using raw images only. Current calibration methods rely on simplified
projection models, use features from reconstructed images, or require separated
calibrations for each type of micro-lens. In the multi-focus configuration, the
same part of a scene will demonstrate different amounts of blur according to
the micro-lens focal length. Usually, only micro-images with the smallest
amount of blur are used. In order to exploit all available data, we propose to
explicitly model the defocus blur in a new camera model with the help of our
newly introduced Blur Aware Plenoptic (BAP) feature. First, it is used in a
pre-calibration step that retrieves initial camera parameters, and second, to
express a new cost function to be minimized in our single optimization process.
Third, it is exploited to calibrate the relative blur between micro-images. It
links the geometric blur, i.e., the blur circle, to the physical blur, i.e.,
the point spread function. Finally, we use the resulting blur profile to
characterize the camera's depth of field. Quantitative evaluations in

important machine learning tasks, e.g., metric learning, AUC maximization, and
ranking. Investigating the generalization behavior of pairwise learning is thus
of significance. However, existing generalization analysis mainly focuses on
the convex objective functions, leaving the nonconvex learning far less
explored. Moreover, the current learning rates derived for generalization
performance of pairwise learning are mostly of slower order. Motivated by these
problems, we study the generalization performance of nonconvex pairwise
learning and provide improved learning rates. Specifically, we develop
different uniform convergence of gradients for pairwise learning under
different assumptions, based on which we analyze empirical risk minimizer,
gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent pairwise learning. We first
successfully establish learning rates for these algorithms in a general
nonconvex setting, where the analysis sheds insights on the trade-off between
optimization and generalization and the role of early-stopping. We then
investigate the generalization performance of nonconvex learning with a
gradient dominance curvature condition. In this setting, we derive faster
learning rates of order $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, where $n$ is the sample size.
Provided that the optimal population risk is small, we further improve the
learning rates to $\mathcal{O}(1/n^2)$, which, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first $\mathcal{O}(1/n^2)$-type of rates for pairwise learning, no
matter of convex or nonconvex learning. Overall, we systematically analyzed the

questions about the reliability of the workers. The AMT workforce is very

they expect. This has the effect of giving each worker (good or bad) a lower
Human Intelligence Task (HIT) approval score, which is unfair to the good
workers. It also has the effect of giving the requester a bad reputation on the
workers' forums. Some of the issues causing the mass rejections stem from the
requesters not taking the time to create a well-formed task with complete

paper describes a study that looks at the crowdsourcing HITs on AMT that were
available over a given span of time and records information about those HITs.
This study also records information from a crowdsourcing forum on the worker

polar solvents (water, methanol, and acetonitrile) and benzene, strong to
moderate catalytic effect for both reactions is found whereas apolar and bulky
cyclohexane interacts weakly with the solute and does not show pronounced

plasmonic waveguide system which simultaneously achieves multiqubit

by computing the negativity metric applied for the first time to the proposed
nanophotonic ENZ configuration. The ENZ response is found to be substantially
advantageous to boost the coherence between multiple emitters compared to
alternative plasmonic waveguide schemes. Finally, the superradiance collective
emission response at the ENZ resonance is utilized to design a new high

quickly teach them new concepts: object-centric properties of the environment
that they care about (e.g. objects near, upright, etc). However, teaching a new
perceptual concept from high-dimensional robot sensor data (e.g. point clouds)
is demanding, requiring an unrealistic amount of human labels. To address this,
we propose a framework called Perceptual Concept Bootstrapping (PCB). First, we
leverage the inherently lower-dimensional privileged information, e.g., object
poses and bounding boxes, available from a simulator only at training time to
rapidly learn a low-dimensional, geometric concept from minimal human input.
Second, we treat this low-dimensional concept as an automatic labeler to
synthesize a large-scale high-dimensional data set with the simulator. With
these two key ideas, PCB alleviates human label burden while still learning
perceptual concepts that work with real sensor input where no privileged
information is available. We evaluate PCB for learning spatial concepts that
describe object state or multi-object relationships, and show it achieves
superior performance compared to baseline methods. We also demonstrate the
utility of the learned concepts in motion planning tasks on a 7-DoF Franka
Panda robot.

intense coherent radio emissions of radio pulsars. This mechanism is, however,
not well understood because the effects of collective plasma response and
nonlinear plasma evolution on the resulting emission power must be taken into
account. In addition, details of the radio emission properties of this
mechanism are unknown, which limits the observational verification of the
emission model.
  By including collective and nonlinear plasma effects, we calculate radio
emission power properties by the linear acceleration emission mechanism that
occurs via the antenna principle for two instabilities in neutron star
magnetospheres: 1) a relativistic streaming instability and 2) interactions of
plasma bunches/clouds.
  We utilize 1D electrostatic relativistic particle-in-cell simulations to
evolve the instabilities self-consistently. From the simulations, the power
properties of coherent emission are obtained by novel post-processing of
electric currents.
  We found that the total radio power by plasma bunch interactions exceeds the
power of the streaming instability by eight orders of magnitude. The wave power
generated by a plasma bunch interaction can be as large as
$2.6\times10^{16}$~W. Therefore, $\sim$$4\times (10^1-10^5)$ simultaneously
interacting plasma bunches may account for the total observed radio power of
typical pulsars ($10^{18}$-$10^{22}$~W). The radio spectrum of the plasma bunch
is characterized by a flatter profile for lower frequencies and a power-law
index up to $\approx-1.6 \pm 0.2$ for higher frequencies. The plasma bunches
radiate in a wide range of frequencies simultaneously, fulfilling no specific
relation between emission frequency and height in the magnetosphere. The power
of the streaming instability is more narrowband than that of the interacting
bunches.

of using it to provide a unified framework for proving generalization bounds in
the realizable setting. We first demonstrate that one can use this framework to
express non-trivial (but sub-optimal) bounds for any learning algorithm that
outputs hypotheses from a class of bounded VC dimension. We prove that the CMI
framework yields the optimal bound on the expected risk of Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) for learning halfspaces. This result is an application of our
general result showing that stable compression schemes Bousquet al. (2020) of
size $k$ have uniformly bounded CMI of order $O(k)$. We further show that an
inherent limitation of proper learning of VC classes contradicts the existence
of a proper learner with constant CMI, and it implies a negative resolution to
an open problem of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). We further study the CMI of
empirical risk minimizers (ERMs) of class $H$ and show that it is possible to
output all consistent classifiers (version space) with bounded CMI if and only
if $H$ has a bounded star number (Hanneke and Yang (2015)). Moreover, we prove
a general reduction showing that ""leave-one-out"" analysis is expressible via
the CMI framework. As a corollary we investigate the CMI of the
one-inclusion-graph algorithm proposed by Haussler et al. (1994). More
generally, we show that the CMI framework is universal in the sense that for
every consistent algorithm and data distribution, the expected risk vanishes as
the number of samples diverges if and only if its evaluated CMI has sublinear
growth with the number of samples.

terms of infinite, increasing sequences of positive values, in which each
element is associated with a corresponding allocation value. Examples include
problems such as online bidding, searching for a hidden target on an unbounded
line, and designing interruptible algorithms based on repeated executions. The
performance of the online algorithm, in each of these problems, is measured by
the competitive ratio, which describes the multiplicative performance loss due
to the absence of full information on the instance.
  We study such competitive sequencing problems in a setting in which the
online algorithm has some (potentially) erroneous information, expressed as a
$k$-bit advice string, for some given $k$. We first consider the untrusted
advice setting of [Angelopoulos et al, ITCS 2020], in which the objective is to
quantify performance considering two extremes: either the advice is either
error-free, or it is generated by a (malicious) adversary. Here, we show a
Pareto-optimal solution, using a new approach for applying the functional-based
lower-bound technique due to [Gal, Israel J. Math. 1972]. Next, we study a
nascent noisy advice setting, in which a number of the advice bits may be
erroneous; the exact error is unknown to the online algorithm, which only has
access to a pessimistic estimate (i.e., an upper bound on this error). We give
improved upper bounds, but also the first lower bound on the competitive ratio
of an online problem in this setting. To this end, we combine ideas from robust
query-based search in arrays, and fault-tolerant contract scheduling. Last, we
demonstrate how to apply the above techniques in robust optimization without
predictions, and discuss how they can be applicable in the context of more
general online problems.

benefited from a large number of evolution schemes that are able to enforce

unstructured meshes, or N-body simulations, many of these techniques cannot be
straightforwardly applied to existing formulations of the Einstein equations.
We develop a 3+1 a formulation of the Einstein equations which shows a striking
resemblance to the equations of relativistic MHD and to EM in material media.
The fundamental variables of this formulation are the frame fields, their
exterior derivatives, and the Nester-Witten and Sparling forms. These mirror
the roles of the electromagnetic 4-potential, the electromagnetic field
strengths, the field excitations and the electric current. The role of the
lapse function and shift vector, corresponds exactly to that of the scalar
electric potential. The formulation, that we name dGREM (for differential
forms, General Relativity and Electro-Magnetism), is manifestly first order and
flux-conservative, which makes it suitable for high-resolution shock capturing
schemes and finite-element methods. Being derived as a system of equations in
exterior derivatives, it is directly applicable to any coordinate system and to
unstructured meshes, and leads to a natural discretization potentially suitable
for the use of machine-precision constraint propagation techniques such as the
Yee algorithm and constrained transport. Due to these properties, we expect
this new formulation to be beneficial in simulations of many astrophysical
systems, such as binary compact objects and core-collapse supernovae as well as
cosmological simulations of the early universe.

sensing, microwave photonics and signal processing. Here we report the first
experimental study of SBS in chiral photonic crystal fiber (PCF), which
displays optical activity and robustly maintains circular polarization states
against external perturbations. As a result, circularly polarized pump light is
cleanly back-scattered into a Stokes signal with the orthogonal circular
polarization state, as is required by angular momentum conservation. By
comparison, untwisted PCF generates a Stokes signal with an unpredictable
polarization state, owing to its high sensitivity to external perturbations. We
use chiral PCF to realize a circularly polarized continuous-wave Brillouin
laser. The results pave the way to a new generation of stable circularly
polarized SBS systems with applications in quantum manipulation, optical
tweezers, optical gyroscopes and fiber sensors.

Unfortunately, there are several challenges in using existing model-checking
techniques on these systems. Event-driven applications often loop indefinitely
and thus pose a challenge for stateless model checking techniques. On the other
hand, deploying purely stateful model checking can explore large sets of
equivalent executions.
  In this work, we explore a new technique that combines dynamic partial order
reduction with stateful model checking to support non-terminating applications.
Our work is (1) the first dynamic partial order reduction algorithm for
stateful model checking that is sound for non-terminating applications and (2)
the first dynamic partial reduction algorithm for stateful model checking of
event-driven applications. We experimented with the IoTCheck dataset: a study
of interactions in smart home app pairs. This dataset consists of app pairs
originated from 198 real-world smart home apps. Overall, our DPOR algorithm
successfully reduced the search space for the app pairs, enabling 69 pairs of
apps that did not finish without DPOR to finish and providing a 7X average

the radial density profile of these clusters and a Gaussian Mixture Model on
their two dimensional distribution of members. We also evaluated the degree of
mass segregation of the clusters. Our methodology performs well on 389 clusters
out of the 467 selected ones. We report the detection of vast coronae around
almost all the clusters and the detection of 71 OCs with tidal tails,
multiplying by more than four the number of such structures identified. We find
the size of the cores to be on average smaller for old clusters than for young

age while the fraction of stars in the halo seems to decrease. As expected the
mass segregation is more pronounced in the oldest clusters but a clear trend
with age is not seen. OCs are more extended than previously expected,
regardless of their age. The decrease in the proportion of stars populating the
clusters halos highlights the different cluster evaporation processes and the
short timescales they need to affect the clusters. Reported parameters all
depend on cluster ages but can not be described as single functions of time.

share the universal property of being stable at different wavenumbers $q$,
i.e., they are multistable. The stable wavenumber range of the stripe patterns,
which is limited by the Eckhaus- and zigzag instabilities even in finite
systems for several boundary conditions, increases with decreasing system size.
This enlargement comes about because suppressing degrees of freedom from the
two instabilities goes along with the system reduction, and the enlargement
depends on the boundary conditions, as we show analytically and numerically
with the generic Swift-Hohenberg (SH) model and the universal
Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation. We also describe how, in very small system
sizes, any periodic pattern that emerges from the basic state is simultaneously
stable in certain parameter ranges, which is especially important for Turing

Furthermore, we show with numerical simulations of the SH model in medium-sized

the `effective small corrections theorem' to show that such an effective
horizon behavior is not compatible with the requirement that the black hole
radiate like a piece of coal as seen from outside. This theorem thus
concretizes the fact that the proposals within the wormhole paradigm require
some nonlocality linking the hole and its distant radiation. We try to
illustrate various proposals for nonlocality by making simple bit models to
encode the nonlocal effects. In each case, we find either nonunitarity of
evolution in the black hole interior or a nonlocal Hamiltonian interaction
between the hole and infinity; such an interaction is not present for burning
coal. We examine recent arguments about the Page curve and observe that the
quantity that is argued to follow the Page curve of a normal body is not the
entanglement entropy but a different quantity. It has been suggested that this
replacement of the quantity to be computed arises from the possibility of
topology change in gravity which can generate replica wormholes. We examine the
role of topology change in quantum gravity but do not find any source of
connections between different replica copies in the path integral for the
R\'{e}nyi entropy. We also contrast the wormhole paradigm with the fuzzball
paradigm, where the fuzzball does radiate like a piece of coal. Just as in the
case of a piece of coal, the fuzzball does not have low-energy semiclassical
dynamics at its surface at energies $E\sim T$ (effective dynamics at energies
$E\gg T$ is possible under the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity, but

This is achieved by sharing weights across the depth of transformer networks.
The proposed method can obtain a substantial gain (~2%) simply using naive

designing principles of networks, and introduces minimal computational overhead
to the training procedure. To reduce the additional computation caused by
recursive operation while maintaining the superior accuracy, we propose an
approximating method through multiple sliced group self-attentions across
recursive layers which can reduce the cost consumption by 10~30% with minimal

novel and parameter-efficient vision transformer design that is compatible with
a broad range of other designs for efficient ViT architectures. Our best model
establishes significant improvement on ImageNet-1K over state-of-the-art

mechanism by sliced recursion structure allows us to build a transformer with
more than 100 or even 1000 shared layers with ease while keeping a compact size

Maximum Vector Length (MVL). Unfortunately, both approaches have drawbacks. On
the one hand, short vector length VP designs struggle to provide high
efficiency for applications featuring long vectors with high Data Level

magnetic field is applied that is initially oriented either perpendicular and

the magnitude of the magnetic field governed by the non-dimensional parameter
$\beta \in (0.5, 10^6)$ and the inclination angle of density interface $\alpha
\in (0.30, 1.52)$. The regular MHD shock refraction process results in a pair
of outer fast shocks (reflected and transmitted) and a set of inner nonlinear
magneto-sonic waves. By varying magnetic field (strength and direction) and
inclination interface angle, the latter waves can be slow shocks, slow
expansion fans, intermediate shocks or slow-mode compound waves. For a chosen
incident shock strength, and density ratio, the MHD shock refraction
transitions from regular (all nonlinear waves meeting at a single point) into
irregular when the inclined density interface angle is less than a critical
value. Since the MHD shock refraction is self-similar, we further explore by
converting the initial value problem (IVP) into a boundary value problem (BVP)
by a self-similar coordinate transformation. The self-similar solution to the
BVP is numerically solved using an iterative method and implemented using the
p4est adaptive mesh framework. The simulation shows that a Mach stem occurs in
irregular MHD shock refraction, the flow structure can be an MHD equivalent to

simulating the formation of the disks of satellites of the Milky Way and
Andromeda galaxies. The initial conditions of the simulation were tuned to
reproduce the observed positions, velocities and disk orientations of the
galaxies. The simulation showed that the galaxies had a close flyby 6.8Gyr ago.
One of the tidal tails produced by the Milky Way was captured by Andromeda. It
formed a cloud of particles resembling the disk of satellites at Andromeda by
its size, orientation, rotation and mass. A hint of a disk of satellites was
formed at the Milky Way too. In addition, the encounter induced a warp in the
disk of the simulated Milky Way that resembles the real warp by its magnitude
and orientation. We present here, for the first time, the proper motions of the
members of the disk of satellites of Andromeda predicted by our simulation.
Finally, we point out some of the remaining open questions which this
hypothesis for the formation of disks of satellites brings up.

the solution of a PDE. The last decade has seen the emergence of deep learning

neural networks with spectral methods to solve PDEs. In particular, we use a
deep learning technique known as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), to
identify candidate functions on which to expand the solution of PDEs. We have
devised an approach which uses the candidate functions provided by the DeepONet
as a starting point to construct a set of functions which have the following
properties: i) they constitute a basis, 2) they are orthonormal, and 3) they
are hierarchical i.e., akin to Fourier series or orthogonal polynomials. We
have exploited the favorable properties of our custom-made basis functions to
both study their approximation capability and use them to expand the solution
of linear and nonlinear time-dependent PDEs.

three-dimensional semimetals, incorporating various features like tilt,

finite MHE response is possible in materials without TRS. If TRS is preserved,
broken inversion symmetry is needed to prevent the cancellation of the MHE
contributions while summing over the Brillouin zone. The amount of tilt of the
node of a semimetal greatly affects the transport coefficients. In presence of
anisotropic dispersions, we find that the MHE features differ depending on the
directions of measurements (as expected). To demonstrate these dependencies,
our investigations include Weyl, multi-Weyl, multi-fold, and nodal-line

improving the overall performance of all tasks. Experimental results

Product formulas, or Trotterization, are the oldest and still remain an
appealing method to simulate quantum systems. For an accurate product formula
approximation, the state-of-the-art gate complexity depends on the number of
terms in the Hamiltonian and a local energy estimate. In this work, we give
evidence that product formulas, in practice, may work much better than
expected. We prove that the Trotter error exhibits a qualitatively better
scaling for the vast majority of input states, while the existing estimate is
for the worst states. For general $k$-local Hamiltonians and higher-order
product formulas, we obtain gate count estimates for input states drawn from
any orthogonal basis. The gate complexity significantly improves over the worst
case for systems with large connectivity. Our typical-case results generalize
to Hamiltonians with Fermionic terms, with input states drawn from a
fixed-particle number subspace, and with Gaussian coefficients (e.g., the SYK
models). Technically, we employ a family of simple but versatile inequalities
from non-commutative martingales called $\textit{uniform smoothness}$, which
leads to $\textit{Hypercontractivity}$, namely $p$-norm estimates for $k$-local
operators. This delivers concentration bounds via Markov's inequality. For
optimality, we give analytic and numerical examples that simultaneously match
our typical-case estimates and the existing worst-case estimates. Therefore,
our improvement is due to asking a qualitatively different question, and our
results open doors to the study of quantum algorithms in the average case.

robust test accuracy starts to decrease during training. In this paper, we
focus on reducing robust overfitting by using common data augmentation schemes.
We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, when combined with model
weight averaging, data augmentation can significantly boost robust accuracy.
Furthermore, we compare various augmentations techniques and observe that
spatial composition techniques work the best for adversarial training. Finally,
we evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 against $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$
norm-bounded perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$ and $\epsilon = 128/255$,
respectively. We show large absolute improvements of +2.93% and +2.16% in
robust accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. In particular,
against $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$,
our model reaches 60.07% robust accuracy without using any external data. We
also achieve a significant performance boost with this approach while using
other architectures and datasets such as CIFAR-100, SVHN and TinyImageNet.

observational or randomized, can be computationally combined to provide an
overall assessment of a research question in meta-analysis. However, an
irreproducibility crisis currently afflicts a wide range of scientific
disciplines, including nutritional epidemiology. An evaluation was undertaken
to assess the reliability of a meta-analysis examining the association between
red and processed meat and selected human health effects (all-cause mortality,
cardiovascular mortality, overall cancer mortality, breast cancer incidence,
colorectal cancer incidence, type 2 diabetes incidence).
  Methods: The number of statistical tests and models were counted in 15
randomly selected base papers (14%) from 105 used in the meta-analysis.
Relative risk with 95% confidence limits for 125 risk results were converted to
p-values and p-value plots were constructed to evaluate the effect
heterogeneity of the p-values.
  Results: The number of statistical tests possible in the 15 randomly selected
base papers was large, median = 20,736 (interquartile range = 1,728 to
331,776). Each p-value plot for the six selected health effects showed either a
random pattern (p-values > 0.05), or a two-component mixture with small
p-values < 0.001 while other p-values appeared random. Given potentially large
numbers of statistical tests conducted in the 15 selected base papers,
questionable research practices cannot be ruled out as explanations for small
p-values.
  Conclusions: This independent analysis, which complements the findings of the
original meta-analysis, finds that the base papers used in the red and
resulting processed meat meta-analysis do not provide evidence for the claimed
health effects.

homogeneous (uniform energy density) solution for illustration. Qualitatively,
the effect of positive (negative) cosmological constant tends to destabilize
(stabilize) the sphere. In the absence of cosmological constant, the privileged
position of (3+1)-dimensional spacetime is manifest in its own right. As it is
the marginal dimensionality in which a monatomic ideal fluid sphere is stable
but not too stable to trigger the onset of gravitational collapse. Furthermore,
it is the unique dimensionality that can accommodate stable hydrostatic
equilibrium with positive cosmological constant. However, given the current
cosmological constant observed no stable configuration can be larger than
$10^{21}~{\rm M}_\odot$. On the other hand, in (2+1) dimensions it is too
stable either in the context of Newtonian Gravity (NG) or Einstein's General
Relativity (GR). In GR, the role of negative cosmological constant is crucial
not only to guarantee fluid equilibrium (decreasing monotonicity of pressure)
but also to have the Ba{\~n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution. Owing to
the negativeness of the cosmological constant, there is no unstable
configuration for a homogeneous fluid disk with mass $0<\mathcal{M}\leq0.5$ to
collapse into a naked singularity, which supports the Cosmic Censorship
Conjecture. However, the relativistic instability can be triggered for a
homogeneous disk with mass $0.5<\mathcal{M}\lesssim0.518$ under causal limit,
which implies that BTZ holes of mass $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BTZ}>0$ could emerge
from collapsing fluid disks under proper conditions. The implicit assumptions
and implications are also discussed.

The neutron star powering the source has a spin period of 2.8s, orbits its

is evident in its X-ray lightcurve. Here we present NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data
on the source from 2019 obtained when the source was near its peak brightness.
We detect the pulsations, having spun up at a rate of 3$\pm0.5\times10^{-10}$ s
s$^{-1}$ since they were previously detected in 2018. The data also provide the
first high-quality broadband spectrum of the source. We find it to be very
similar to that of other ULXPs, with two disk-like components, and a high
energy tail. When combined with XMM-Newton data obtained in 2018, we explore
the evolution of the spectral components with super-orbital phase, finding that
the luminosity of the hotter component drives the super-orbital flux
modulation. The inclination the disk components appear to change with phase,
which may support the idea that these super-orbital periods are caused by disk
precession. We also reexamine the super-orbital period with 3 years of
Swift/XRT monitoring, finding that the period is variable, increasing from
38.2$\pm0.5$ days in 2018--2019 to 44.2$\pm0.9$ days in 2020--2021, which rules
out alternative explanations for the super-orbital period.

has recently provided observations of the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) phase of the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) of M31, using HST/COS absorption spectra along
$\sim40$ background QSO sightlines, located up to and beyond the galaxy virial
radius. Based on these data, and by the means of semi-analytic models and
Bayesian inference, we provide here a physical description of the origin and
dynamics of the cool CGM of M31. We investigate two competing scenarios, in
which (i) the cool gas is mostly produced by supernova(SN)-driven galactic
outflows or (ii) it mostly originates from infall of gas from the intergalactic
medium. In both cases, we take into account the effect of gravity and
hydrodynamical interactions with a hot corona, which has a cosmologically
motivated angular momentum. We compare the outputs of our models to the
observed covering factor, silicon column density and velocity distribution of
the AMIGA absorbers. We find that, to explain the observations, the outflow
scenario requires an unphysically large (> 100\%) efficiency for SN feedback.
Our infall models, on the other hand, can consistently account for the AMIGA
observations and the predicted accretion rate, angular momentum and metallicity
are consistent with a cosmological infall from the intergalactic medium.

path integral admits a round two-sphere saddle for $h=0$. We show that the OPE

$g{\to}gg$, where double logarithms can also be absorbed using the same
effective $\hat q_{\rm eff}$. In this paper, I study whether the same holds
true for potentially large, subleading, *single*-logarthim corrections. The
correspondence is more indirect for single logarithms, but I show (in the
large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit) that single logarithms from soft radiation in the case
of $p_\perp$ broadening also determine the single logarithms from soft
radiative corrections to hard $g{\to}gg$ splitting. Along the way, there is an
interesting variation of the original BDMPS-Z calculation of splitting rates in
the $\hat q$ approximation. I also discuss how, for soft-radiative corrections
to hard splitting processes, there are two different types of ""$\hat q_{\rm
eff}$"" that come into play, which differ by ""$i\pi$"" terms that multiply single
logarithms.

the shutdown of star formation in massive galaxies. While dust continuum is an
efficient and affordable tracer, this method relies upon the assumption of a
""normal"" molecular-gas to dust mass ratio, $\delta_{\mathrm{GDR}}$, typically
of order one hundred. Recent null detections of quiescent galaxies in deep dust
continuum observations support a picture where the cold gas and dust has been
rapidly depleted or expelled. In this work, we present another viable
explanation: a significant fraction of galaxies with low star formation per
unit stellar mass are predicted to have extreme $\delta_{\mathrm{GDR}}$ ratios.
We show that simulated massive quiescent galaxies at $0 < z < 3$ in the
\textsc{simba} cosmological simulations have $\delta_{\mathrm{GDR}}$ values
that extend $>$4 orders of magnitude. The dust in most simulated quiescent
galaxies is destroyed significantly more rapidly than the molecular gas
depletes, and cannot be replenished. The transition from star-forming to
quiescent halts dust formation via star formation processes, with dust
subsequently destroyed by supernova shocks and thermal sputtering of dust
grains embedded in hot plasma. After this point, the dust growth rate in the
models is not sufficient to overcome the loss of $>$3 orders of magnitude in
dust mass to return to normal values of $\delta_{\mathrm{GDR}}$ despite having
high metallicity. Our results indicate that it is not straight forward to use a
single observational indicator to robustly pre-select exotic versus normal
ratios. These simulations make strong predictions that can be tested with
millimeter facilities.

full information of the thermodynamic potentials at the high-density limit
together with thermodynamic stability and causality. This requires considering
the pressure as a function of chemical potential $p(\mu)$ instead of the

$(\epsilon - p)$-plane. This provides information complementary to
astrophysical observations that should be taken into account in any complete

independent of astrophysical neutron-star input, and hence, they can also be

galaxies at $z=9-11$ (three spectroscopically confirmed) to constrain the
chemical enrichment and growth of stellar mass of early galaxies. We use the
flexible Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector
with a range of star-formation histories (SFHs), a flexible dust attenuation
law and a self-consistent modeling of emission lines. This approach allows us
to assess how different priors affect our results, and how well we can break
degeneracies between dust attenuation, stellar ages, metallicity and emission
lines using data which probe only the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical
wavelengths. We measure a median observed ultraviolet spectral slope
$\beta=-1.87_{-0.43}^{+0.35}$ for relatively massive star-forming galaxies
($9<\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10$), consistent with no change from $z=4$ to
$z=9-10$ at these stellar masses, implying rapid enrichment. Our SED-fitting
results are consistent with a star-forming main sequence with sub-linear slope
($0.7\pm0.2$) and specific star-formation rates of $3-10~\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$.
However, the stellar ages and SFHs are less well constrained. Using different
SFH priors, we cannot distinguish between median mass-weighted ages of
$\sim50-150$ Myr, which corresponds to 50\% formation redshifts of
$z_{50}\sim10-12$ at $z\sim9$ and is of the order of the dynamical timescales
of these systems. Importantly, the models with different SFH priors are able to
fit the data equally well. We conclude that the current observational data
cannot tightly constrain the mass-buildup timescales of these $z=9-11$
galaxies, with our results consistent with SFHs implying both a shallow and
steep increase of the cosmic SFR density with time at $z>10$.

characterize our universe. LIM data of CO spectral lines are becoming
available, such as those obtained by the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP).
COMAP data can be used to probe the molecular gas content of the universe from
the last stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) ($z < 8.0$) to $z \sim 2.5$.
In this work, we examine the prospects for deriving voxel-level statistical
constraints on high-redshift galaxies from COMAP data by considering the
additional information available from observations of LAEs galaxies using the
Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) on the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope (HET). We post-process the IllustrisTNG300 galaxy-formation
simulation with a set of prescriptions to consistently determine CO and
Ly$\alpha$ line luminosities. The different line prescriptions span the
uncertainty in the CO line luminosity according to current observations by the
VLA high-z CO surveys and set the Ly$\alpha$ emission to be compatible with
observational LAE luminosity functions. We produce mock observations for the
two surveys over a $(300\, {\rm Mpc})^3$ volume. These are then used to
formulate and test methodologies for data analysis and to predict COMAP
constraints on CO emission. We use combinations of masking, stacking, voxel
intensity distribution (VID), and other statistics. We find that in combination
with VIRUS/HET, a voxel-level analysis of the COMAP Pathfinder survey can
detect and characterize the CO signal from $z\sim3$ and improve current
constraints on the $z\sim6$ signal, identify individual voxels with bright
CO(1-0) emission at $z\sim3$ and probe the redshift evolution of the CO
emission. This study illustrates the potential of synergies between LIM and
galaxy surveys both to improve the significance of a detection and to aid the
interpretation of noisy LIM data.

from aerosols emitted from large ships traversing our oceans, a phenomenon that
global climate models cannot directly reproduce. Ship tracks are observable
examples of marine cloud brightening, a potential solar climate intervention
that shows promise in helping combat climate change. Whether or not a ship's
emission path visibly impacts the clouds above and how long a ship track
visibly persists largely depends on the exhaust type and properties of the
boundary layer with which it mixes. In order to be able to statistically infer
the longevity of ship-emitted aerosols and characterize atmospheric conditions
under which they form, a first step is to simulate, with mathematical surrogate
model rather than an expensive physical model, the path of these cloud-aerosol
interactions with parameters that are inferable from imagery. This will allow
us to compare when/where we would expect to ship tracks to be visible,
independent of atmospheric conditions, with what is actually observed from
satellite imagery to be able to infer under what atmospheric conditions do ship
tracks form. In this paper, we will discuss an approach to stochastically
simulate the behavior of ship induced aerosols parcels within naturally
generated clouds. Our method can use wind fields and potentially relevant
atmospheric variables to determine the approximate movement and behavior of the
cloud-aerosol tracks, and uses a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to
model the persistence behavior of cloud-aerosol paths. This SDE incorporates
both a drift and diffusion term which describes the movement of aerosol parcels
via wind and their diffusivity through the atmosphere, respectively. We
successfully demonstrate our proposed approach with an example using simulated

infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been demonstrated to
result in an excess of orbital poles of dark matter halo particles towards the
LMC orbital pole. This was suggested to help explain the observed preference of
MW satellite galaxies to co-orbit along the Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). We
test this idea by correcting the positions and velocities of the MW satellites
for the Galactocentric-distance-dependent shifts inferred from a LMC-infall
simulation. While this should substantially reduce the observed clustering of
orbital poles if it were mainly caused by the LMC, we instead find that the
strong clustering remains preserved. We confirm the initial study's main result
with our simulation of an MW-LMC-like interaction, and use it to identify two
reasons why this scenario is unable to explain the VPOS: (1) the orbital pole
density enhancement in our simulation is very mild (~10% within 50-250 kpc)
compared to the observed enhancement (~220-300%), and (2) it is very sensitive
to the specific angular momenta (AM) of the simulation particles, with higher
AM particles being affected the least. Particles in simulated dark matter halos
tend to follow more radial orbits (lower AM), so their orbital poles are more
easily affected by small offsets in position and velocity caused by an LMC
infall than objects with more tangential velocity (higher AM), such as the
observed dwarf galaxies surrounding the MW. The origin of the VPOS thus remains
unexplained.

to the occurrence of vacuum degeneracy unrelated to spontaneous symmetry
breaking in $\mathcal{A}_3$, the confinement pattern shows novel features

printing was utilized, which involved collecting computed tomography (CT)
images of a patient as a reference, contouring the organs, projecting them onto
polystyrene panels, and pouring appropriate material into them. Balloons
attached to a ventilator and an air compressor were used to periodically
generate a breathing cycle. A silicone tumor was also implanted in the lower
lobe of the right balloon to investigate its displacement during respiration.
During silent and deep breathing, qualitative and quantitative tests were
conducted, and the results were compared to research conducted on real humans.
Results: The CT images and the shape of the phantom matches those of the real
patient. However, few organs densities can be optimized. The air pressure in
the ventilator was so weak that it could only create quiet breathing phantom
motion on its own. However, deep breathing phantom motion was obtained manually
by only using the air compressor. As a consequence, reproducibility and
repeatability studies were done only for quiet breathing and results were
acceptable. When compared to the real scenario, the phantom's motion amplitudes
were appropriate, except in the lateral direction and abdomen section, near the
diaphragm, they were negligible. In addition, the tumor displacement was
predominant in the Anterior-Posterior direction rather than the
Superior-Inferior direction as it should be. Conclusions: As a prototype, the
work was successful, nevertheless, several improvements are required, such as
optimization of the shape of the mediastinum and developing a mechanical
diaphragm movement system synced with a high-pressure air pump.

We present GOAT, a modification to the state-of-the-art graph matching

(SIS) epidemics on regular, Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks.
It is known that the contact network influences the spread of an epidemic
within a population. Therefore, observations of an epidemic, in this case at
the population-level, contain information about the underlying network. This
information, in turn, is useful for predicting the future course of an ongoing
epidemic. To exploit this in a prediction framework, the exact high-dimensional
stochastic model of an SIS epidemic on a network is approximated by a
lower-dimensional surrogate model. The surrogate model is based on a
birth-and-death process; the effect of the underlying network is described by a
parametric model for the birth rates. We demonstrate empirically that the
surrogate model captures the intrinsic stochasticity of the epidemic once it
reaches a point from which it will not die out. Bayesian parameter inference
allows for uncertainty about the model parameters and the class of the
underlying network to be incorporated directly into probabilistic predictions.
An evaluation of a number of scenarios shows that in most cases the resulting
prediction intervals adequately quantify the prediction uncertainty. As long as
the population-level data is available over a long-enough period, even if not
sampled frequently, the model leads to excellent predictions where the
underlying network is correctly identified and prediction uncertainty mainly
reflects the intrinsic stochasticity of the spreading epidemic. For predictions
inferred from shorter observational periods, uncertainty about parameters and
network class dominate prediction uncertainty. The proposed method relies on
minimal data and is numerically efficient, which makes it attractive either as
a standalone inference and prediction scheme or in conjunction with other
methods.

planets in the solar system, but they are also distinct from one another,
particularly in their relative internal heat flux. Not only does Neptune emit
about ten times the amount of heat that emitted by Uranus, the relative amount
of emitted heat to the energy they absorb from the sun also differs greatly,
being comparable at Uranus and the largest of all giant planets at Neptune. As
a result, it is questionable whether thermal convection occurs within the
interior of Uranus. However, the presence of an intrinsic magnetic field
implies that interior fluid motions must exist. Here, we consider compositional
convection driven by the release of hydrogen associated with the formation of
large organic networks or diamond precipitation in the deep interior. We test
this hypotheses using a set of numerical rotating convection models where the
convective driving is varied between thermal and compositional sources and is
sufficiently vigorous to not be strongly constrained by rotation. In most
cases, we find ice-giant-like zonal flows develop, with three bands
characterized by a retrograde equatorial jet and prograde jets at higher
latitudes. Large-scale circulation cells also develop and lead to heat and mass
fluxes that tend to exhibit local maxima along the equatorial plane. This
similarity between convective flows driven by thermal and compositional
buoyancy therefore predict Uranus and Neptune to have similar interior dynamics
despite Uranus' minimal internal heat flow and may thus explain why both ice
giants have comparable magnetic fields.

be evident in globular clusters. Observations have indicated that hot Jupiters
are at least an order of magnitude less prevalent in the central region of the
globular cluster 47 Tucanae than in the field. In this work, we explore the
claims in the literature for additional consequences for the low mass stellar
initial mass function. Tidal capture, the mechanism that produces X-ray
binaries in globular clusters, applies also to brown dwarfs (BDs). This process
produces tight stellar-BD binaries that would be detectable by transit surveys.
Applying a Monte Carlo dynamical evolution model, we compute the overall BD
capture rates. We find that the number of captures is lower than previous
estimates. Capture efficiency increases steeply with stellar mass, which means
that mass segregation reduces capture efficiency as BDs and low mass stars
occupy the same regions. The result of this effect is that the current
constraints on the short period companion fraction remains marginally
consistent with initially equal numbers of BDs and stars. However, our findings
suggest that expanding the sample in 47 Tuc or surveying other globular
clusters for close sub-stellar companions can yield constraints on the
sub-stellar initial mass function in these environments. We estimate the
capture rates in other globular clusters and suggest that 47 Tuc remains a
promising target for future transit surveys.

the relationship between nanogel magnetic properties and its behaviour in a
hydrodynamic flow. Considering the size of the MNG and typical time and
velocity scales involved in their nanofluidics, experimental characterisation
of the system is challenging. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations combined with the Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) scheme aiming at
describing the impact of the shear rate on the shape, magnetic structure and
motion of an MNG. We find that in a shear flow the centre of mass of an MNG
tends to be in the centre of a channel and to move preserving the distance to
both walls. The MNG monomers along with translation are involved in two more
types of motion, they rotate around the centre of mass and oscillate with
respect to the latter. It results in synchronised tumbling and wobbling of the
whole MNG accompanied by its volume oscillates. The fact the MNG is a highly
compressible and permeable for the carrier liquid object makes its behaviour
different from that predicted by classical Taylor-type models. We show that the
frequency of volume oscillations and rotations are identical and are growing
function of the shear rate. We find that the stronger magnetic interactions in
the MNG are, the higher is the frequency of this complex oscillatory motion,
and the lower is its amplitude. Finally, we show that the oscillations of the
volume lead to the periodic changes in MNG magnetic energy.

expected that low-dimensional magnets are more sensitive to lattice distortions

interactions depend on local lattice distortions, of the prototypical
two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI$_3$. We extract an effective measure of the
spin-lattice coupling in CrI$_3$ which is up to ten times larger than what is
found for bcc Fe. The magnetic exchange interactions, including Heisenberg and
relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, are sensitive both to the
in-plane motion of Cr atoms and out-of-plane motion of ligand atoms. We find
that significant magnetic pair interactions change sign from ferromagnetic (FM)
to anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) for atomic displacements larger than 0.16 {\AA}. We
explain the observed strong spin-lattice coupling by analyzing the orbital
decomposition of isotropic exchange interactions, involving different
crystal-field-split Cr$-3d$ orbitals. The competition between the AFM t$_{2g}$
- t$_{2g}$ and FM t$_{2g}$ - e$_{g}$ contributions depends on the bond angle
formed by Cr and I atoms as well as Cr-Cr distance. In particular, if a Cr atom
is displaced, the FM-AFM sign change when the I-Cr-I bond angle approaches
90$^\circ$. The obtained spin-lattice coupling constants, along with the

many issues need to be addressed. Among those, the reliability of AI systems
needs to be demonstrated so that the AI systems can be used with confidence by
the general public. In this paper, we provide statistical perspectives on the
reliability of AI systems. Different from other considerations, the reliability
of AI systems focuses on the time dimension. That is, the system can perform
its designed functionality for the intended period. We introduce a so-called
SMART statistical framework for AI reliability research, which includes five
components: Structure of the system, Metrics of reliability, Analysis of
failure causes, Reliability assessment, and Test planning. We review
traditional methods in reliability data analysis and software reliability, and
discuss how those existing methods can be transformed for reliability modeling
and assessment of AI systems. We also describe recent developments in modeling
and analysis of AI reliability and outline statistical research challenges in
this area, including out-of-distribution detection, the effect of the training
set, adversarial attacks, model accuracy, and uncertainty quantification, and
discuss how those topics can be related to AI reliability, with illustrative
examples. Finally, we discuss data collection and test planning for AI
reliability assessment and how to improve system designs for higher AI
reliability. The paper closes with some concluding remarks.

a surrogate for the MAP solution. In essence, the MAP solution is approximated
by the LDA estimate, but to take the GP prior into account, we adopt the
prior-norm adjustment to estimate LDA's shared variance parameters, which
ensures that the adjusted estimate is consistent with the GP prior. This
enables closed-form differentiable GP posteriors and predictive distributions,
thus allowing fast meta training. We demonstrate considerable improvement over

Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of

Namely, we show that the condition $m_i\geq 3$ is sufficient for $\Gamma$ such

presented for the tractable case of the resistive interchange. Externally
prescribed static magnetic perturbations convert the eigenmode problem to a

The dynamics are rendered multi-scale, due to the size disparity between the
test mode and magnetic perturbations. Maintaining quasi-neutrality at all
orders requires that small-scale convective cell turbulence be driven by
disparate scale interaction. The cells in turn produce turbulent mixing of
vorticity and pressure, which is calculated by fluctuation-dissipation type
analyses, and are relevant to pump-out phenomena. The development of
correlation between the ambient magnetic perturbations and the cells is
demonstrated, showing that turbulence will `lock on' to ambient stochasticity.
Magnetic perturbations are shown to produce a magnetic braking effect on
vorticity generation at large scale. Detailed testable predictions are
presented. The relations of these findings to the results of available

Probe observations that connect the presence of ion-cyclotron waves directly to
signatures of resonant damping in observed proton-velocity distributions. We
show that the observed cyclotron wave population coincides with both flattening
in the phase space distribution predicted by resonant quasilinear diffusion and
steepening in the turbulent spectra at the ion-cyclotron resonant scale. In
measured velocity distribution functions where cyclotron resonant flattening is
weaker, the distributions are nearly uniformly subject to ion-cyclotron wave

context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has
focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive
surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data
and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To
address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research
questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open
surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural
network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to
the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs.
full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other
modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like
oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a
comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated
with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance
increases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the
input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed
data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing
size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to
whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04),
which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard
deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image
modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages
over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional
functional tissue information. Code and pre-trained models:

egocentric viewpoints is a challenging task as the view is skewed and the body
parts farther from the cameras are occluded. One such example is the view from
cameras installed below VR headsets. To achieve this task, we first make use of
conditional GANs to translate the egocentric views to full body third-person
views. This increases the comprehensibility of the image and caters to
occlusions. The generated third-person view is further sent through the 3D
reconstruction module that generates a 3D mesh of the body. We also train a
network that can take the third person full-body view of the subject and
generate the texture maps for applying on the mesh. The generated mesh has
fairly realistic body proportions and is fully rigged allowing for further
applications such as real-time animation and pose transfer in games. This
approach can be key to a new domain of mobile human telepresence.

hundreds of clusters of galaxies acting as lenses that produce a magnification
bias on the SMGs, and to estimate their associated masses and concentrations

observed by Herschel with 1.2<z<4.0 (mean redshift at ~2.3) while the
foreground sample is made up of galaxy clusters extracted from the SDSS III
with photometric redshifts of 0.05< z< 0.8 (mean redshift at ~0.38).
Measurements are obtained by stacking the SMG--cluster pairs to estimate the
cross-correlation function using the Davis-Peebles estimator. This methodology
allows us to derive the mass density profile for a wide range of angular
scales, ~2-250 arcsec or ~10-1300 kpc for z=0.38, with a high radial
resolution. We find that It is impossible to fit the data with a single mass
density profile at all scales. As for the outer part, the estimated average
masses increase from $M_{200c}=5.8$ to $51.5\times 10^{13} M_\odot$ and the
concentration parameter from C=0.74 to 1.74. In the small-scale regions, the
obtained average masses fluctuate around $M_{200c}=3-4 \times 10^{13}M_\odot$
with average C~4. The total average masses are in perfect agreement with the
M-R relationship estimated from the cluster catalogue. While the estimated
average C values of the central galactic halos are in agreement with
traditional M-C relationships, we find low concentrations for the outer part.
Moreover, C decrease for lower R values, probably indicating that the group of
galaxies cannot be considered to be relaxed systems. Finally, we notice a
systematic lack of signal at the transition between the dominance of the
cluster halo and the central galactic halo (~100 kpc). This feature is also
present in previous studies using different catalogues and/or methodologies,
but is never discussed.

advantages both in compression fidelity and ratio compared to traditional data

the local PSF (GaLNet-2). We have compared the results from the GaLNets with
structural parameters (total magnitude, effective radius, Sersic index etc.)
derived on a set of galaxies from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) by 2DPHOT, as a

shows that GaLNet-2 can reach an accuracy as high as 2DPHOT, while GaLNet-1
performs worse because it misses the information on the local PSF. Both GaLNets
are three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods in terms of
computational speed. This first application of CNNs to ground-based galaxy

distribution. Conversely, cosmic voids are under-dense patches of the universe.
Probing the mass distribution of the universe requires various approaches,
including weak gravitational lensing that subtly modifies the shape of distant
sources, and Doppler lensing that changes the apparent size and magnitude of
objects due to peculiar velocities. In this work, we adopt both gravitational
and Doppler lensing effects to study the underlying matter distribution in and
around cosmic voids/halos. We use the relativistic $N$-body code
\texttt{gevolution}, to generate the mass perturbations and develop a new
ray-tracing code that relies on the design of the ray bundle method. We
consider three categories of halo masses and void radii, and extract the
cosmological information by stacking weak-lensing and Doppler lensing signals
around voids/halos. The results of this paper show that the most optimal
strategy that combines both gravitational and Doppler lensing effects to map
the mass distribution should focus on the redshift range $z\approx 0.3-0.4$.
The recommendation of this paper is that future spectroscopic surveys should
focus on these redshifts and utilise the gravitational and Doppler lensing
techniques to extract information about underlying matter distribution across
the cosmic web, especially inside cosmic voids. This could provide a
complimentary cosmological analysis for ongoing or future low-redshift
spectroscopic surveys.

suggest that they formed at dense matter peaks in the early universe. However,
few studies have found definitive evidence that the quasars lie at cosmic
density peaks, in clear contrast with theory predictions. Here we present new
evidence that the radio-loud quasar SDSS J0836+0054 at z=5.8 could be part of a
surprisingly rich structure of galaxies. This conclusion is reached by
combining a number of findings previously reported in the literature: Bosman et
al. (2020) obtained the redshifts of three companion galaxies, confirming an
overdensity of i-dropouts found by Zheng et al. (2006). By comparing this
structure with those found near other quasars and large overdense regions in
the field at z~6-7, we show that the SDSS J0836+0054 field is among the densest
structures known at these redshifts. One of the spectroscopic companions is a
very massive star-forming galaxy (log M_*/M_sun ~ 10.3) based on its
unambiguous detection in a Spitzer 3.6 um image. This suggests that the quasar
field hosts not one, but at least two rare, massive dark matter halos (log
M_halo/M_sun > 12), corresponding to a galaxy overdensity of at least 20. We
discuss the properties of the young radio source. We conclude that the
environment of SDSS J0836+0054 resembles, at least qualitatively, the type of
conditions that may have spurred the direct collapse of a massive black hole

undirected graph constantly updates its information. The goal is to keep every
other node in the graph about the root as freshly informed as possible. Our
synchronous information spreading model uses telephone calls at each time step,
in which any node can call at most one neighbor, thus forming a matching over
which information is transmitted at each step. We introduce two problems in
minimizing two natural objectives (Maximum and Average) of the latency of the
root's information at all nodes in the network.
  After deriving a simple reduction from the maximum rooted latency problem to
the well-studied minimum broadcast time problem, we focus on the average rooted
latency version. We introduce a natural problem of finding a finite schedule
that minimizes the average broadcast time from a root. We show that any average
rooted latency induces a solution to this average broadcast problem within a
constant factor and conversely, this average broadcast time is within a
logarithmic factor of the average rooted latency. Then, by approximating the
average broadcast time problem via rounding a time-indexed linear programming
relaxation, we obtain a logarithmic approximation to the average latency
problem.
  Surprisingly, we show that using the average broadcast time for average
rooted latency introduces this necessary logarithmic factor overhead even in
trees. We overcome this hurdle and give a 40-approximation for trees. For this,
we design an algorithm to find near-optimal locally-periodic schedules in trees
where each vertex receives information from its parent in regular intervals. On
the other side, we show how such well-behaved schedules approximate the optimal
schedule within a constant factor.

We draw a connection between the bandwidth of classical and quantum kernels and
show analogous behavior in both cases. Furthermore, we show that optimizing the

$R_{\odot}$ and a mass of 0.83 $M_{\odot} $, which was observed by the Kepler

starspots had an average radius of $(17 \pm 7)\times 10^3$ km and a mean
temperature of $3800 \pm 700$ K. Visual inspection of the light curves of
Kepler-411 yields the identification of 65 superflares. The detected
superflares lasted from 8 to 260 min and their energy varied from $10^{33} -
10^{35}$ ergs. The power-law index of the flare frequency distribution as a
function of energy is (-2.04 $\pm$ 0.13) for the flare on Kepler-411. A
positive correlation between the area of starspots and the energy of
superflares was found when considering the averages taken every 16 to 35 days,
with the highest correlation occurring for averages every 21 days. This timing

fail to significantly improve upon standard techniques. Nonetheless, we find
that the use of continuous and time-reversible dynamics benefits models of all

~ 10^8 particles) simulation, performed with the Ramses code, starts from an
axisymmetric non-equilibrium configuration constructed within the AGAMA
framework. This is a self-consistent dynamical model of the MW defined by the
best available parameters for the dark matter halo, the stellar disc and the
bulge.
  For the known (stellar and gas) disc mass (4.5 x 10^10 Msun) and disc mass
fraction at R ~ 2.2 R_d (f_d ~ 0.3 - 0.6), the low mass limit does not yield a
bar in a Hubble time. The high mass limit adopted here produces a box/peanut
bar within about 2 Gyr with the correct mass (~10^10 Msun), size (~5 kpc) and
peak pattern speed (~ 40-45 km/s/kpc).
  In agreement with earlier work, the bar formation timescale scales inversely
with f_d (i.e. log [T/Gyr] ~ 0.60/f_d - 0.83 for 1 < f_d < 0.3). The disc
radial heating is strong, but, in contrast to earlier claims, we find that disc
vertical heating outside of the box/peanut bulge structure is negligible.
  The synthetic barred MW exhibits long-term stability, except for the slow
decline (roughly -2 km/s/kpc/Gyr) of the bar pattern speed, consistent with
recent estimates. If our model is indicative of the Milky Way, we estimate that
the bar first emerged 3-4 Gyr ago.

Next-Generation Radio Access Networks (NG-RAN). The RAN protocol stack is split
into eight disaggregated options combined in three network units, i.e.,
Central, Distributed, and Radio. Besides that, further advances allow the RAN
functions to be virtualized on top of general-purpose hardware, using the
concept of virtualized RAN (vRAN). The Combination of NG-RAN and vRAN results
in vNG-RAN, which enables the management of the disaggregated units and
protocols as a set of radio functions. However, the orchestration-based
placement of these radio functions is a challenging issue since the best
decision can be determined by multiple constraints involving RAN
disaggregation, crosshaul networks requirements, availability of computational
resources, etc. This article proposes OPlaceRAN, a vNG-RAN deployment
orchestrator framed within the NFV reference architecture and aligned with the
Open RAN initiative. OPlaceRAN supports the dynamic placement of radio

this way, the complex scenes in the ReID task are effectively disentangled, and
the burden of each branch is relieved. The results from extensive experiments

path planning in autonomous driving on highways are challenging. One reason is
that conventional hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches are not
amenable to autonomous driving due to its riskiness: the agent must move
avoiding multiple obstacles such as other agents that are highly unpredictable,
thus safe regions are small, scattered, and changeable over time. To overcome
this challenge, we propose a spatially hierarchical reinforcement learning
method for state space and policy space. The high-level policy selects not only
behavioral sub-policy but also regions to pay mind to in state space and for
outline in policy space. Subsequently, the low-level policy elaborates the
short-term goal position of the agent within the outline of the region selected
by the high-level command. The network structure and optimization suggested in
our method are as concise as those of single-level methods. Experiments on the
environment with various shapes of roads showed that our method finds the
nearly optimal policies from early episodes, outperforming a baseline
hierarchical reinforcement learning method, especially in narrow and complex
roads. The resulting trajectories on the roads were similar to those of human
strategies on the behavioral planning level.

generalizations of sub-optimal actions as in standard single-agent decision

multi-agent systems is whether agents can learn to efficiently eliminate all
dominated actions in an unknown game if they can only observe noisy bandit
feedback about the payoff of their played actions. Surprisingly, despite a
seemingly simple task, we show a quite negative result; that is, standard no
regret algorithms -- including the entire family of Dual Averaging algorithms
-- provably take exponentially many rounds to eliminate all dominated actions.
Moreover, algorithms with the stronger no swap regret also suffer similar
exponential inefficiency. To overcome these barriers, we develop a new
algorithm that adjusts Exp3 with Diminishing Historical rewards (termed
Exp3-DH); Exp3-DH gradually forgets history at carefully tailored rates. We
prove that when all agents run Exp3-DH (a.k.a., self-play in multi-agent
learning), all dominated actions can be iteratively eliminated within
polynomially many rounds. Our experimental results further demonstrate the
efficiency of Exp3-DH, and that state-of-the-art bandit algorithms, even those

-- denoted by $W_4$ -- where arbitrary nonmetricity is allowed. This class of
geometry includes the so called teleparallel spaces $Z_4$, which are the
geometric basement of the symmetric teleparallel theories (STTs). The guiding
principle in our discussion is Weyl gauge symmetry (WGS), which is a manifest
symmetry of $W_4$ spaces. Here we derive the master equation that drives the
gauge invariant variations of the length of vectors during parallel transport
in $W_4$. This is the mathematical basis of the second clock effect (SCE). We
are able to give qualitative and quantitative estimates for the SCE, as well as
for the perihelion shift, in the coincident gauge of $Z_4$ space. We conclude
that generalized Weyl spaces do not represent phenomenologically viable
descriptions of Nature due to the SCE and, also to their predictions for the
perihelion shift. All of the present results are based in the assumption of:
(i) a gauge invariant parallel transport law and (ii) a consistency hypothesis
which enables identifying hypothetical vectors and tensors defined in $W_4$,
with related physical vectors and tensors arising in the given gravitational
theory. Our discussion is mostly geometrical without relying on specific
theories of gravity, unless it is absolutely necessary.

micro-structured with a 100 micron window. We found that when measured locally
around the window, the MT signal deviate from the expected behavior. We studied
possible causes, including film micro-structuration, electrical contact
geometry as well as magnetic field tilt from the normal direction. These MT
measurements were carried using the Van-der-Pauw method, with a set a four
microscopic contacts directly surrounding the window, and a set of four
contacts positioned several millimeters away from the window. We found that
tilting the magnetic field direction with respect to the normal does not
significantly affect the MT signal, whereas the positioning and geometry of the
contacts seem to highly affect the MT signal. When the contacts are directly
surrounding the window, the shape of the EHE signal is drastically deformed,
suggesting that the electron path is disturbed by the presence of the window
and the proximity of the electric contacts. If, on the other hand, the contacts
are sufficiently far apart, the MT signal is not significantly affected by the
presence of the window. Furthermore, the deformed EHE signal measured on the
inner contacts can be modeled as a mix of the EHE and MR signals measured on
the outer contacts.

potential Kitaev quantum spin liquid, predicted to display Majorana fermions as
low energy excitations. In practice, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ undergoes a transition
to a state with antiferromagnetic order below a temperature $T_{\rm N}$
$\approx$ 7 K, but this order can be suppressed by applying an external
in-plane magnetic field of $H_\parallel$ = 7 T. Whether a quantum spin liquid
phase exists just above that field is still an open question, but the reported
observation of a quantized thermal Hall conductivity at $H_\parallel$ $>$ 7 T
by Kasahara and co-workers $\big[$Kasahara ${\it et \ al}$., Nature ${\bf
559}$, 227 (2018)$\big]$ has been interpreted as evidence of itinerant Majorana
fermions in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. In this study, we re-examine
the origin of the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our measurements of $\kappa_{\rm xy}$($T$) on several
different crystals yield a temperature dependence very similar to that of the
phonon-dominated longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xx}$($T$), for
which the natural explanation is that $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is also mostly carried
by phonons. Upon cooling, $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ peaks at $T \simeq$ 20 K, then
drops until $T_{\rm N}$, whereupon it suddenly increases again. The abrupt
increase below $T_{\rm N}$ is attributed to a sudden reduction in the
scattering of phonons by low-energy spin fluctuations as these become partially
gapped when the system orders. The fact that $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ also increases
suddenly below $T_{\rm N}$ is strong evidence that the thermal Hall effect in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is also carried predominantly by phonons. This implies that
any quantized signal from Majorana edge modes would have to come on top of a
sizable -- and sample-dependent -- phonon background.

such as scalar-valued output or single residual block, these models have no
nonlinearities at the final residual representation that feeds into the final

estimation property, we define ResNEsts, i.e., Residual Nonlinear Estimators,
by simply dropping nonlinearities at the last residual representation from
standard ResNets. We show that wide ResNEsts with bottleneck blocks can always
guarantee a very desirable training property that standard ResNets aim to
achieve, i.e., adding more blocks does not decrease performance given the same
set of basis elements. To prove that, we first recognize ResNEsts are basis
function models that are limited by a coupling problem in basis learning and
linear prediction. Then, to decouple prediction weights from basis learning, we
construct a special architecture termed augmented ResNEst (A-ResNEst) that
always guarantees no worse performance with the addition of a block. As a
result, such an A-ResNEst establishes empirical risk lower bounds for a ResNEst
using corresponding bases. Our results demonstrate ResNEsts indeed have a
problem of diminishing feature reuse; however, it can be avoided by
sufficiently expanding or widening the input space, leading to the
above-mentioned desirable property. Inspired by the DenseNets that have been
shown to outperform ResNets, we also propose a corresponding new model called
Densely connected Nonlinear Estimator (DenseNEst). We show that any DenseNEst
can be represented as a wide ResNEst with bottleneck blocks. Unlike ResNEsts,
DenseNEsts exhibit the desirable property without any special architectural

Here we present a precise measurement of HHG phase difference between two

Gouy phase interferometer. The measured phase difference is about 200 mrad,
corresponding to 3 attoseconds (1 as = 10^-18 s) time delay which is nearly

Numerical simulations also reveal the effects of molecular orientation and
intra-molecular two-centre interference on the measured phase difference. This

different atoms and molecules. Together with isomeric or isotopic comparisons
it also enables the observation of subtle effects of molecular structures and

cosmic voids from SDSS Data Release 12 for redshift range 0.2-0.7 for
moderately bright and bright AGN. We separated inner and outer void regions
based on the void size, given by its effective void radius. We classified
galaxies at a distance < 0.6Reff as inner void members and galaxies in the
interval 0.6 < R/Reff < 1.3 as outer void galaxies. We found higher average
fractions in the inner voids (4.9+-0.7)% than for their outer counterparts

weak dependence on the environment for the inner and outer regions for two out

at one-to-one level in voids which may be suppressed in denser environments due
to higher velocity dispersions. It could also indicate less prominent ram

framework where a central parameter server (PS) coordinates many local users to

relies on a centralized topology with a PS. As a result, it will paralyze once
the PS fails. To alleviate such a single point failure, especially on the PS,
some existing work has provided decentralized FL (DFL) implementations like
CDSGD and D-PSGD to facilitate FL in a decentralized topology. However, there
are still some problems with these methods, e.g., significant divergence
between users' final models in CDSGD and a network-wide model average necessity
in D-PSGD. In order to solve these deficiency, this paper devises a new DFL
implementation coined as DACFL, where each user trains its model using its own
training data and exchanges the intermediate models with its neighbors through
a symmetric and doubly stochastic matrix. The DACFL treats the progress of each
user's local training as a discrete-time process and employs a first order
dynamic average consensus (FODAC) method to track the \textit{average model} in
the absence of the PS. In this paper, we also provide a theoretical convergence
analysis of DACFL on the premise of i.i.d data to strengthen its rationality.
The experimental results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 validate the
feasibility of our solution in both time-invariant and time-varying network
topologies, and declare that DACFL outperforms D-PSGD and CDSGD in most cases.

successful training methods, guaranteeing that an object function converges to
the local minima. Nevertheless, designing an efficient and competitive training
method is still a challenging task due to the cyclic behaviors of some
gradient-based ways and the expensive computational cost of these methods based
on the Hessian matrix. This paper proposed the adaptive Composite Gradients
(ACG) method, linearly convergent in bilinear games under suitable settings.
Theory and toy-function experiments suggest that our approach can alleviate the
cyclic behaviors and converge faster than recently proposed algorithms.
Significantly, the ACG method is not only used to find stable fixed points in
bilinear games as well as in general games. The ACG method is a novel
semi-gradient-free algorithm since it does not need to calculate the gradient
of each step, reducing the computational cost of gradient and Hessian by
utilizing the predictive information in future iterations. We conducted two
mixture of Gaussians experiments by integrating ACG to existing algorithms with
Linear GANs. Results show ACG is competitive with the previous algorithms.
Realistic experiments on four prevalent data sets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA) with DCGANs show that our ACG method outperforms several
baselines, which illustrates the superiority and efficacy of our method.

equipartitioned into k colour classes in which the common neighbourhoods of

that the peak trajectories separate as $O(\sqrt{|t|})$ as $|t| \to \infty$, and
all the peak heights approach the same constant value corresponding to that of

has the risk of disclosure. The ""right to be forgotten"" was introduced in a
timely manner, stipulating that individuals have the right to withdraw their

To solve this problem, machine unlearning is proposed, which allows the model
to erase all memory of private information. Previous studies, including
retraining and incremental learning to update models, often take up extra
storage space or are difficult to apply to neural networks. Our method only
needs to make a small perturbation of the weight of the target model and make
it iterate in the direction of the model trained with the remaining data subset
until the contribution of the unlearning data to the model is completely
eliminated. In this paper, experiments on five datasets prove the effectiveness
of our method for machine unlearning, and our method is 15 times faster than

leads to better generalization is not well-understood, limiting our ability to
select appropriate data transformations for a given dataset. This paper studies
the generalization benefit of model invariance by introducing the sample cover
induced by transformations, i.e., a representative subset of a dataset that can
approximately recover the whole dataset using transformations. Based on this
notion, we refine the generalization bound for invariant models and
characterize the suitability of a set of data transformations by the sample
covering number induced by transformations, i.e., the smallest size of its
induced sample covers. We show that the generalization bound can be tightened
for suitable transformations that have a small sample covering number.
Moreover, our proposed sample covering number can be empirically evaluated,
providing a practical guide for selecting transformations to develop model
invariance for better generalization. We evaluate the sample covering numbers
for commonly used transformations on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the
smaller sample covering number for a set of transformations indicates a smaller
gap between the test and training error for invariant models, thus validating
our propositions.

we studied the EPC in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212) and

the data with a localized Lang-Firsov model that allows for the coherent
excitations of two phonon modes. While electronic band dispersion effects are
non-negligible, we are able to perform a study of the relative values of EPC
matrix elements in these cuprate families. In the case of NBCO, the choice of
the excitation energy allows us to disentangle modes related to the CuO$_3$
chains and the CuO$_2$ planes. Combining the results from the two families, we
find the EPC strength decreases with doping at $\mathbf{q_\parallel}=(-0.25,
0)$ r.l.u., but has a non-monotonic trend as a function of doping at smaller
momenta. This behavior is attributed to the screening effect of charge
carriers. We also find that the phonon intensity is enhanced in the vicinity of
the charge-density-wave (CDW) excitations while the extracted EPC strength
appears to be less sensitive to their proximity. By performing a comparative
study of two cuprate families, we are able to identify general trends in the
EPC for the cuprates and provide experimental input to theories invoking a
synergistic role for this interaction in $d$-wave pairing.

cheaper digital cameras, have gained wide applications in many fields. Besides
point measurement, photogrammetry can also create a three-dimensional (3D)
model of the scene. Accurate 3D model reconstruction depends on high quality
images. Degraded images will result in large errors in the reconstructed 3D
model. In this paper, we propose a method that can be used to improve the
visibility of the images, and eventually reduce the errors of the 3D scene
model. The idea is inspired by image dehazing. Each original image is first
transformed into multiple exposure images by means of gamma-correction
operations and adaptive histogram equalization. The transformed images are
analyzed by the computation of the local binary patterns. The image is then
enhanced, with each pixel generated from the set of transformed image pixels
weighted by a function of the local pattern feature and image saturation.
Performance evaluation has been performed on benchmark image dehazing datasets.
Experimentations have been carried out on outdoor and indoor surveys. Our
analysis finds that the method works on different types of degradation that
exist in both outdoor and indoor images. When fed into the photogrammetry

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), especially those that present long-lasting X-ray
plateau emissions. By solving the field equations, we find that when the
rotational speed of the magnetar is approaching the breakup limit, its radius
$R$ and moment of inertia $I$ would undergo an obvious evolution as the
magnetar spins down. Meanwhile, the values of $R$ and $I$ would sensitively
depend on the adoption of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) and the NS
baryonic mass. With different EoSs and baryonic masses considered, the magnetic
dipole radiation luminosity ($L_{\rm dip}$) could be variant within one to two
orders of magnitude. We thus suggest that when using the X-ray plateau data of
GRBs to diagnose the properties of the nascent NSs, EoS and NS mass information
should be invoked as simultaneously constrained parameters. On the other hand,
due to the evolution of $R$ and $I$, the temporal behavior of $L_{\rm dip}$
would become more complicated. For instance, if the spin-down process is
dominated by gravitational wave emission due to the NS asymmetry caused by
magnetic field distortion ($\epsilon\propto B_{p}^{2}$), the segment $L_{\rm
dip}\propto t^{0}$ could be followed by $L_{\rm dip}\propto t^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma$ larger than 3. This case could naturally interpret the so-called
internal X-ray plateau feature shown in some GRB afterglows, which means the
sharp decay following the plateau is unnecessarily corresponding to the NS
collapsing. This may explain why some internal X-ray plateaus are followed by
late time central engine activity, manifested through flares and second shallow
plateaus.

type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and cosmic microwave background to explore the
expansion history of the high-redshift universe, mainly because they are bright
enough to be detected at greater distances. Although they lack definite
physical explanations, many empirical correlations between GRB isotropic
energy/luminosity and some directly detectable spectral/temporal properties
have been proposed to make GRBs standard candles. Since the observed GRB rate
falls off rapidly at low redshifts, thus preventing a cosmology independent
calibration of these correlations. In order to avoid the circularity problem,
SN Ia data are usually used to calibrate the luminosity relations of GRBs in
the low redshift region (limited by the redshift range for SN Ia sample), and
then extrapolate it to the high redshift region. This approach is based on the
assumption of no redshift evolution for GRB luminosity relations. In this work,
we suggest the use a complete quasar sample in the redshift range of
$0.5<z<5.5$ to test such an assumption. We divide the quasar sample into
several sub-samples with different redshift bins, and use each sub-sample to
calibrate the isotropic $\gamma$-ray equivalent energy of GRBs in relevant
redshift bins. By fitting the newly calibrated data, we find strong evidence
that the most commonly used Amati relation between spectral peak energy and
isotropic-equivalent radiated energy shows no, or marginal, evolution with
redshift. Indeed, at different redshifts, the coefficients in the Amati
relation could have a maximum variation of 0.93\% at different redshifts, and
there could be no coincidence in the range of 1$\sigma$.

minimum size defensive alliance. Our main results are the following: (1) The
Defensive Alliance problem has been studied extensively during the last twenty
years, but the question whether it is FPT when parameterized by feedback vertex
set has still remained open. We prove that the problem is W[1]-hard
parameterized by a wide range of fairly restrictive structural parameters such
as the feedback vertex set number, treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the
input graph; (2) the problem parameterized by the vertex cover number of the
input graph does not admit a polynomial compression unless coNP $\subseteq$
NP/poly, (3) it does not admit $2^{o(n)}$ algorithm under ETH, and (4) the
Defensive Alliance problem on circle graphs is NP-complete.

among women leading to a high mortality rate. Due to the heterogeneous nature
of breast cancer, there is a need to identify differentially expressed genes
associated with breast cancer subtypes for its timely diagnosis and treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a small gene set for each of the four breast cancer
subtypes that could act as its signature, the paper proposes a novel algorithm
for gene signature identification. METHODS: The present work uses interpretable
AI methods to investigate the predictions made by the deep neural network
employed for subtype classification to identify biomarkers using the TCGA
breast cancer RNA Sequence data. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm led to the
discovery of a set of 43 differentially expressed gene signatures. We achieved
a competitive average 10-fold accuracy of 0.91, using neural network
classifier. Further, gene set analysis revealed several relevant pathways, such
as GRB7 events in ERBB2 and p53 signaling pathway. Using the Pearson
correlation matrix, we noted that the subtype-specific genes are correlated
within each subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed technique enables us to find a
concise and clinically relevant gene signature set.

learn a feature embedding and thus fail to well utilize the available
discriminative information from cluster assignments, resulting performance
limitation. To this end, we propose a novel method, namely deep
attention-guided graph clustering with dual self-supervision (DAGC).
Specifically, DAGC first utilizes a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to
adaptively integrate the features of an auto-encoder and a graph convolutional
network in each layer and then uses a scale-wise fusion module to dynamically
concatenate the multi-scale features in different layers. Such modules are
capable of learning a discriminative feature embedding via an attention-based
mechanism. In addition, we design a distribution-wise fusion module that
leverages cluster assignments to acquire clustering results directly. To better
explore the discriminative information from the cluster assignments, we develop
a dual self-supervision solution consisting of a soft self-supervision strategy
with a triplet Kullback-Leibler divergence loss and a hard self-supervision
strategy with a pseudo supervision loss. Extensive experiments validate that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmark
datasets. Especially, our method improves the ARI by more than 18.14% over the

lensed by objects of different mass scales. Besides a single recent claim, no
lensed GRB has been detected so far by using the gamma-ray data only. In this
paper, we suggest that the multi-band afterglow data might be an efficient way
to search for lensed GRB events. Using the standard afterglow model we
calculate the characteristics of the lensed afterglow lightcurves under the
assumption of two popular analytic lens models: point mass and Singular
Isothermal Sphere (SIS) model. In particular, when different lensed images
cannot be resolved, their signals would be superimposed together with a given
time delay. In this case, the X-ray afterglows are likely to contain several
X-ray flares of similar width in linear scale and similar spectrum, and the
optical afterglow lightcurve will show rebrightening signatures. Since the
lightcurves from the image arriving later would be compressed and deformed in
the logarithmic time scale, the larger time delay (i.e. the larger mass of the
lens), the easier is to identify the lensing effect. We analyzed the archival
data of optical afterglows and found one potential candidate of the lensed GRB
(130831A) with time delay $\sim$500 s, however, observations of this event in
gamma-ray and X-ray band seem not to support the lensing hypothesis. In the
future, with the cooperation of the all-sky monitoring gamma-ray detectors and
multi-band sky survey projects, our method proposed in this paper would be more
efficient in searching for strongly lensed GRBs.

auction architecture is widely used to enable efficient ad allocation on a
large set of corpus within a limited response time. The current deployed
two-stage ad auction usually retrieves an ad subset by a coarse ad quality
metric in a pre-auction stage, and then determines the auction outcome by a
refined metric in the subsequent stage. However, this simple and greedy
solution suffers from serious performance degradation, as it regards the
decision in each stage separately, leading to an improper ad selection metric
for the pre-auction stage. In this work, we explicitly investigate the relation
between the coarse and refined ad quality metrics, and design a two-stage ad
auction by taking the decision interaction between the two stages into account.
We decouple the design of the two-stage auction by solving a stochastic subset
selection problem in the pre-auction stage and conducting a general second
price (GSP) auction in the second stage. We demonstrate that this decouple
still preserves the incentive compatibility of the auction mechanism. As the
proposed formulation of the pre-auction stage is an NP-hard problem, we propose
a scalable approximation solution by defining a new subset selection metric,
namely Pre-Auction Score (PAS). Experiment results on both public and
industrial dataset demonstrate the significant improvement on social welfare
and revenue of the proposed two-stage ad auction, than the intuitive greedy
two-stage auction and other baselines.

determine the parameter of the effective distance $D_\text{eff}$ for CRDM

from the major heavy CR nuclear species. We obtain $D_\text{eff}\simeq 9$ kpc

the corresponding exclusion lower bounds down to $\sigma_{\chi p} \sim 4\times

the nuclear form factor leaded to typical exclusion upper bounds of

Using both the analytic and numerical approaches, we show that for CRDM
particles, the presence of the nuclear form factor strongly suppresses the
effect of Earth attenuation. Consequently, the cross section that can be
excluded by the XENON1T data can be a few orders of magnitude higher, which
closes the gap in the cross sections excluded by the XENON1T experiment and

due to the valley-addressability by helicity-specific light beam. But the short
valley lifetime for excitons have hindered potential valleytronic applications.
In this paper, we demonstrate a strategy for prolonging the valley lifetime by
converting excitons to trions through effective gate control and by taking
advantage of much longer valley lifetime for trions than for excitons. In
continuous-wave experiments, we found the valley polarization increases as gate
voltage is tuned away from the charge neutrality, with the degree of valley
polarization increased from near zero to 38 % for excitons and to 33 % for
trions. This is the first successful observation of valley-polarization in
MoTe2 without a magnetic field. In pump-probe experiments, we found that the
intervalley scattering process of excitons is significantly suppressed as gate
voltage is tuned away from charge neutrality, with scattering time from 0.85 ps
to ~ 2.17 ps. In contrast, the intervalley scattering rate for trions increases
due to increased availability of partner charges for trion spin flipping, with
scattering time from 1.39 ns down to ~100 ps away from charge neutrality.
Interestingly, our results show that, despite the accelerated intervalley
scattering, the trion polarization degree increases due to polarized trion
generation from the exciton-to-trion conversion overtaking the intervalley
trion scatterings. Importantly, the efficient exciton-to-trion conversion
changed the dominant depolarization mechanisms. As a result, the valley
lifetime is dramatically improved by 1000 times from excitons to trions at the
charge neutrality. Our results shed new light into the depolarization dynamics
and the interplay of various depolarization channels for excitons and trions
and provide an effective strategy for prolonging the valley polarization.

the way to a generic approach for learning dynamical features in glassy

introduce TNE, a generic framework to enhance the embeddings of nodes acquired

various statistical graph models and community detection methods and then

a moving frame of reference and an artificial damping to isolate the fronts in

to Re = $10^5$ with affordable computation power. We measured the propagation
speed of the downstream front and observed that a fit of
$1.971-(Re/1925)^{-0.825}$ (in unit of bulk speed) well captures this speed
above $Re\simeq 5000$. The speed increases monotonically as Re increases, in
stark contrast to the decreasing trend above $Re\simeq 10000$ reported by
Wygnanski & Champagne (1973). The speed of the upstream front overall agrees
with the former studies and $0.024 + (Re/1936)^{-0.528}$ well fits our data and

proposed that both front speeds would keep their respective monotonic trends as
the Reynolds number increases further. We show that, at high Reynolds numbers,
the local transition at the upstream front tip is via high-azimuthal-wavenumber
structures in the high-shear region near the pipe wall, whereas at the
downstream front tip is via low-azimuthal-wavenumber structures in the

interest in situations of information overload in a personalized way, using
knowledge about the needs and preferences of individual users. In
conversational recommendation approaches, these needs and preferences are
acquired by the system in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. A common approach
in the literature to drive such dialogs is to incrementally ask users about
their preferences regarding desired and undesired item features or regarding
individual items. A central research goal in this context is efficiency,
evaluated with respect to the number of required interactions until a
satisfying item is found. This is usually accomplished by making inferences
about the best next question to ask to the user. Today, research on dialog
efficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example,
that one strategy for selecting questions is better than another one in a given
application. With this work, we complement empirical research with a
theoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This
model, which is designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us
to investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way, in
particular with respect to the computational complexity of devising optimal
interaction strategies. Through such a theoretical analysis we show that
finding an efficient conversational strategy is NP-hard, and in PSPACE in
general, but for particular kinds of catalogs the upper bound lowers to
POLYLOGSPACE. From a practical point of view, this result implies that catalog
characteristics can strongly influence the efficiency of individual
conversational strategies and should therefore be considered when designing new
strategies. A preliminary empirical analysis on datasets derived from a
real-world one aligns with our findings.

11.2~$\mu$m in several locations and a spectrum from 3 to 45~$\mu$m in one
location. We study the behaviour of band flux ratios, which are sensitive to
external conditions, as revealed by their variations with the distance from an
ionizing source. Assuming that the mid-IR emission arises mostly from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and that a weak emission feature at
3.4~$\mu$m is related to PAHs with extra hydrogen atoms (H-PAHs), we trace
variations of the ratios using a model for PAH evolution. Namely, we estimate
how populations of PAHs of different sizes, hydrogenation and ionization states
change across the Orion Bar over a time interval approximately equal to its
lifetime. The obtained ensembles of PAHs are further used to calculate the
corresponding synthetic spectra and band flux densities. The model
satisfactorily describes the main features of the ratios $I_{3.6}/I_{11.2}$,
$I_{7.7}/I_{11.2}$, $I_{7.7}/I_{3.6}$ and $I_{3.3}/I_{3.4}$. We conclude that
the best coincidence between modelling and observations is achieved if C loss
of PAHs is limited by the number of carbon atoms $N_{\rm C}=60$, and the band
at 3.4~$\mu$m may indeed be attributed to H-PAHs. We confirm that large cations

problem across data-science and engineering disciplines. Most existing schemes
assume that observations from all nodes are available, but in many practical
environments, only a subset of nodes is accessible. A natural (and sometimes
effective) approach is to disregard the role of unobserved nodes, but this
ignores latent network effects, deteriorating the quality of the estimated
graph. Differently, this paper investigates the problem of inferring the
topology of a network from nodal observations while taking into account the
presence of hidden (latent) variables. Our schemes assume the number of
observed nodes is considerably larger than the number of hidden variables and
build on recent graph signal processing models to relate the signals and the
underlying graph. Specifically, we go beyond classical correlation and partial
correlation approaches and assume that the signals are smooth and/or stationary
in the sought graph. The assumptions are codified into different constrained
optimization problems, with the presence of hidden variables being explicitly
taken into account. Since the resulting problems are ill-conditioned and
non-convex, the block matrix structure of the proposed formulations is
leveraged and suitable convex-regularized relaxations are presented. Numerical
experiments over synthetic and real-world datasets showcase the performance of
the developed methods and compare them with existing alternatives.

integrating derivative-free optimization schemes and multi-fidelity Gaussian
processes within a Bayesian optimization framework. The proposed scheme uses
two Gaussian processes for the stochastic system, one emulates the (known)
process model, and another, the true system through measurements. In this way,
low fidelity samples can be obtained via a model, while high fidelity samples
are obtained through measurements of the system. This framework captures the
system's behavior in a non-parametric fashion while driving exploration through
acquisition functions. The benefit of using a Gaussian process to represent the
system is the ability to perform uncertainty quantification in real-time and
allow for chance constraints to be satisfied with high confidence. This results
in a practical approach that is illustrated in numerical case studies,

in many countries after the vaccination and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical
interventions, we propose a mathematical model on time-varying networks for the
spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in a partially vaccinated population. The
model encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different
effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe
symptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical
interventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals,
and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the
epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold,
we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These
theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing
practices are key toward avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found
that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the
outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be
a double-edged sword, whereby in some cases it might favour resurgent
outbreaks, calling for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and
responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of
non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve complete eradication.

contact with a surface from which they can detach and reattach. These problems
are of particular importance in glaciology, where they arise in the study of
grounding lines and subglacial cavities. In this work, we propose a novel
numerical method for solving viscous contact problems based on a mixed
formulation with Lagrange multipliers of a variational inequality involving the
Stokes equation. The advection equation for evolving the geometry of the domain
occupied by the fluid is then solved via a specially-built upwinding scheme,
leading to a robust and accurate algorithm for viscous contact problems. We
first verify the method by comparing the numerical results to analytical
results obtained by a linearised method. Then, we use this numerical scheme to
reconstruct friction laws for glacial sliding with cavitation. Finally, we
compute the evolution of cavities from a steady state under oscillating water
pressures. The results depend strongly on the location of the initial steady
state along the friction law. In particular, we find that if the steady state
is located on the downsloping or rate-weakening part of the friction law, the
cavity evolves towards the upsloping section, indicating that the downsloping
part is unstable.

study an Eulerian time stepping scheme for moving domain problems applied to a
model problem where the domain motion is implicit to the problem. We consider a
parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in the bulk domain, and the
domain motion is described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), coupled
to the bulk partial differential equation through the transfer of forces at the
moving interface. The discretisation is based on an unfitted finite element
discretisation on a time-independent mesh. The method-of-lines time
discretisation is enabled by an implicit extension of the bulk solution through
additional stabilisation, as introduced by Lehrenfeld & Olshanskii (ESAIM:
M2AN, 53:585-614, 2019). The analysis of the coupled problem relies on the
Lagrange-multiplier formulation, the fact that the Lagrange-multiplier solution
is equal to the normal stress at the interface and that the motion of the
interface is given through rigid body motion. This paper covers the complete
stability analysis of the method and an error estimate in the energy norm,
under an assumption on the discrete interface velocity. This includes the
dynamic error in the domain motion resulting from the discretised ODE and the
forces from the discretised PDE. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
error analysis of this type of coupled moving domain problem in a fully
Eulerian framework. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results.

an important research area in modern computer vision. Its applications range
from augmented reality to robotics and digital content creation. Typically this
task is performed through direct object shape and pose predictions which is
inaccurate. A promising research direction ensures meaningful shape predictions
by retrieving CAD models from large scale databases and aligning them to the
objects observed in the image. However, existing work does not take the object
geometry into account, leading to inaccurate object pose predictions,
especially for unseen objects. In this work we demonstrate how cross-domain
keypoint matches from an RGB image to a rendered CAD model allow for more
precise object pose predictions compared to ones obtained through direct
predictions. We further show that keypoint matches can not only be used to
estimate the pose of an object, but also to modify the shape of the object
itself. This is important as the accuracy that can be achieved with object
retrieval alone is inherently limited to the available CAD models. Allowing
shape adaptation bridges the gap between the retrieved CAD model and the
observed shape. We demonstrate our approach on the challenging Pix3D dataset.
The proposed geometric shape prediction improves the AP mesh over the
state-of-the-art from 33.2 to 37.8 on seen objects and from 8.2 to 17.1 on
unseen objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate more accurate shape predictions
without closely matching CAD models when following the proposed shape
adaptation. Code is publicly available at

set of branches, where each branch has trajectory information of a target or

dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for
fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen
carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough
bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we
determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions $\dim_{\,
\theta}\Lambda$ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet $\Lambda$ for the whole spectrum
of $\theta \in [0,1]$, in terms of a certain large deviations rate function.
The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly increasing in $\theta$, and
the function $\theta\mapsto \dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ exhibits interesting
features not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many
phase transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave.
  We make an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis by showing that two
carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres have equal intermediate dimensions if
and only if the Hausdorff multifractal spectra of the uniform Bernoulli
measures on the two carpets are equal. Since intermediate dimensions are
bi-Lipschitz invariant, this shows that the equality of these multifractal
spectra is a necessary condition for two such carpets to be Lipschitz
equivalent.

increased in recent years. To enable access to personal data, Trusted Research
environments (TREs) provide safe and secure environments in which researchers
can access sensitive personal data and develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning models. However currently few TREs support the use of
automated AI-based modelling using Machine Learning. Early attempts have been
made in the literature to present and introduce privacy preserving machine
learning from the design point of view [1]. However, there exists a gap in the
practical decision-making guidance for TREs in handling models disclosure.
Specifically, the use of machine learning creates a need to disclose new types
of outputs from TREs, such as trained machine learning models. Although TREs
have clear policies for the disclosure of statistical outputs, the extent to
which trained models can leak personal training data once released is not well
understood and guidelines do not exist within TREs for the safe disclosure of
these models.
  In this paper we introduce the challenge of disclosing trained machine
learning models from TREs. We first give an overview of machine learning models
in general and describe some of their applications in healthcare and medicine.
We define the main vulnerabilities of trained machine learning models in
general. We also describe the main factors affecting the vulnerabilities of
disclosing machine learning models. This paper also provides insights and
analyses methods that could be introduced within TREs to mitigate the risk of
privacy breaches when disclosing trained models.

interest to be divided into sub-bands with unequal bandwidths. Also, we
investigate the impact of sub-band assignment on multi-connectivity (MC)
enabled THzCom systems, where users associate and communicate with multiple

the primary focus on spectrum allocation, to determine sub-band assignment,
sub-band bandwidth, and optimal transmit power. Thereafter, we propose
reasonable approximations and transformations, and develop iterative algorithms
based on the successive convex approximation technique to analytically solve
the formulated problems. Aided by numerical results, we show that by enabling

to adopting equal sub-band bandwidth, and this throughput gain is most profound
when the power budget constraint is more stringent. We also show that our
sub-band assignment strategy in MC-enabled THzCom systems outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-band assignment strategies and the performance gain is
most profound when the spectrum with the lowest average molecular absorption

how the Lee-Yang edge singularity can be used to probe the chiral phase

and we are often interested in the discussion of who is/was the greatest player
of all time. While we do not try to answer this question here, we delve into
comparing some key statistics related to dominance over their opponents for the
male players with the most Grand Slam titles, currently: Djokovic, Federer and
Nadal, in alphabetical order. Here we consider the minutes played and the
relative points in each of their completed matches, as a measure of dominance
against other players. We consider important covariates such as surface, win or
loss, type of tournament and whether their opponent was a top 20 ranked player
in the world or not, to create a more complete comparison of their performance.
We consider a Bayesian quantile regression model for multiple-output response
variables to take into account the dependence between minutes and relative
points won. This approach is compelling since we do not need to choose a
probability distribution for the joint probability distribution of our response
variable. Our results agree with the common intuition of Nadal's superiority in
clay courts, Federer's superiority in grass courts and Djokovic's superiority
in hard courts given their success in each of these surfaces; though Nadal's
dominance in clay court games is unique. Federer shows his dominance regarding
minutes spent in the court in wins, while Djokovic takes the edge when
considering the dimension of relative points won, for most of the comparisons.
While minutes can be directly connected to style of play, the relative points
dimension could express more directly different levels of advantage over their
opponent, in which Djokovic seems to be the overall leader in this analysis.

the wall temperature decreases, especially for the extremely cooled wall. The
integral analysis is applied to explain the overshoot behaviours of the
skin-friction and heat transfer coefficients in hypersonic transitional
boundary layers. The overshoot of the skin-friction coefficient is mainly
caused by the drastic change of the mean velocity profiles, and the overshoot
of the heat transfer coefficient is primarily due to the viscous dissipation.
In the hypersonic turbulent boundary layers, the skin-friction and heat
transfer coefficients increase significantly as the wall temperature decreases.
The effects of the mean velocity gradients and the Reynolds shear stress
contribute dominantly to the wall skin friction, and have weak correlations
with the wall temperature, except for the strongly cooled wall condition. The
strongly cooled wall condition and high Mach number can enhance the effect of
the Reynolds shear stress, and weaken the impact of the mean velocity

parameter $\eta$ that is the equivalent of the ratio of relationships between
adjacent circles in the discrete case, with a value $\eta\sim 6$. We confirm
this prediction using three different datasets coming from phone records,
face-to-face contacts, and interactions in Facebook. As the sample size
increases, the distributions of estimated parameters smooth around the
predicted value of $\eta$. The existence of a characteristic value of the
parameter at the population level indicates that the model is capturing a
seemingly universal feature on how humans manage relationships. Our analyses
also confirm earlier results showing the existence of social signatures arising
from having to allocate finite resources into different relationships, and that
the structure of online personal networks mirrors those in the off-line world.

terms of time complexity. Nevertheless, in order to bridge towards experimental
realizations with several qubits and harvest such potential in a short-term

three-body decay is reduced to various quasi two-body decays, where the $B$

resonance decays into the other two final-state mesons. The quasi two-body
decays are calculated within the light-cone sum rule approach utilizing the
leading twist $B$ meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. Finally, the decay
branching fraction contribution from each resonance are calculated. Some of
them are compatible with experiment or previous theoretical works. Including
the effects of non-resonant and final-state interactions, we also evaluate the

apps, which enables message-based control flow transferring and data passing
between Android components. Effective ICC resolution requires precisely
identifying entry points, analyzing data values of ICC fields, modeling related
framework APIs, etc. Due to various control-flow- and data-flow-related
characteristics involved and the lack of oracles for real-world apps, the
comprehensive evaluation of ICC resolution techniques is challenging.
  To fill this gap, we collect multiple-type benchmark suites with 4,104 apps,
covering hand-made apps, open-source, and commercial ones. Considering their
differences, various evaluation metrics, e.g., number count, graph structure,
and reliable oracle based metrics, are adopted on-demand. As the oracle for
real-world apps is unavailable, we design a dynamic analysis approach to
extract the real ICC links triggered during GUI exploration. By auditing the
code implementations, we carefully check the extracted ICCs and confirm 1,680
ones to form a reliable oracle set, in which each ICC is labeled with 25 code
characteristic tags. The evaluation performed on six state-of-the-art ICC
resolution tools shows that 1) the completeness of static ICC resolution
results on real-world apps is not satisfactory, as up to 38%-85% ICCs are
missed by tools; 2) many wrongly reported ICCs are sent from or received by
only a few components and the graph structure information can help the
identification; 3) the efficiency of fundamental tools, like ICC resolution
ones, should be optimized in both engineering and research aspects. By
investigating both the missed and wrongly reported ICCs, we discuss the
strengths of different tools for users and summarize eight common FN/FP
patterns in ICC resolution for tool developers.

mixed-parity superconducting state, which is an admixture of \emph{s}-wave and
\emph{p}-wave pairing components induced by strong spin-orbit coupling inherent
to inversion symmetry breaking at the heterointerface of a-YAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$.
Our work suggests an unconventional nature of the underlying pairing

  In this paper we explore the porting of Alya's incompressible flow matrix

at the kernel level, we then explore sharing the workload between the FPGA and

the performance of our approach on a Xilinx Alveo U280 against a 24-core Xeon
Platinum CPU and Nvidia V100 GPU, with the FPGA significantly out-performing
the CPU and performing comparably against the GPU, whilst drawing substantially
less power. The result of this work is both an experience report describing
appropriate dataflow optimisations which we believe can be applied more widely

evidence for this relies on the interpretation of scanning tunnelling

structural information. We show that surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) uniquely
provides unambiguous identification of these metal adatoms. We present the
results of a detailed structural study of the Au(111)-F4TCNQ system, combining
surface characterisation by STM, low energy electron diffraction and soft X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy with quantitative experimental structural
information from normal incidence X-ray standing waves (NIXSW) and SXRD,
together with dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Excellent agreement is found between the NIXSW data and the DFT
calculations regarding the height and conformation of the adsorbed molecule,
which has a twisted geometry rather than the previously supposed inverted bowl
shape. SXRD measurements provide unequivocal evidence for the presence and
location of Au adatoms, while the DFT calculations show this reconstruction to
be strongly energetically favoured.

In-situ X-ray measurements of the tip shape in metals have been unsuccessful so
far due to insufficient spatial resolution or high image noise. To overcome
these limitations, high-resolution synchrotron radiography and advanced image
processing techniques are applied to a thin sample of a solidifying Ga-35wt.%In
alloy. Quantitative in-situ measurements are performed of the growth of
dendrite tips during the fast initial transient and the subsequent steady

The value of the dendrite tip shape selection parameter is found to be
$\sigma^* = 0.0768$, which suggests an interface energy anisotropy of
$\varepsilon_4 = 0.015$ for the present Ga-In alloy. The non-axisymmetric

multi-messenger paradigm, characterized by a continuous increase in the
quantity and quality of experimental data that is obtained by the detection of
the various cosmic messengers (photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays and
gravitational waves) from numerous origins. They give us information about
their sources in the universe and the properties of the intergalactic medium.
Moreover, multi-messenger astronomy opens up the possibility to search for
phenomenological signatures of quantum gravity. On the one hand, the most
energetic events allow us to test our physical theories at energy regimes which
are not directly accessible in accelerators; on the other hand, tiny effects in
the propagation of very high energy particles could be amplified by
cosmological distances. After decades of merely theoretical investigations, the
possibility of obtaining phenomenological indications of Planck-scale effects
is a revolutionary step in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity, but it
requires cooperation between different communities of physicists (both
theoretical and experimental). This review is aimed at promoting this
cooperation by giving a state-of-the art account of the interdisciplinary
expertise that is needed in the effective search of quantum gravity footprints
in the production, propagation and detection of cosmic messengers.

the first law of thermodynamics of the LQC is still valid as expected. This in

distribution of the sequences $(s_n)$, $(t_n)$ and $(u_n)$. For sets
$\mathcal{S}$ with desirable pseudorandom properties, more precisely, sets with
low correlation measures, we show the following:
  1. The sequence $(s_n)$ is (asymptotically) balanced and has uniform pattern
distribution if $T$ is of smaller order of magnitude than $q$.
  2. The sequence $(t_n)$ is balanced and has uniform pattern distribution if
$T$ is approximately $\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{1/(m-1)}}\right)q$.
  3. The sequence $(u_n)$ is balanced and has uniform pattern distribution if
$T$ is approximately $\frac{q}{2}$.
  These results are motivated by earlier results for the sets of quadratic
residues and primitive roots modulo a prime. We unify these results and derive
many further (asymptotically) balanced sequences with uniform pattern
distribution from pseudorandom subsets.

single-letter lower and upper bounds on the information-theoretically optimal

particularized to the so-called erasures-only metric. The lower bound is
obtained based on a modified random coding union bound with pulse position

The proof of the upper bound relies on a non-trivial combination of analytical

conductivities specifically based on structural properties. To this end it is
necessary to gain an understanding of the energy landscape where the thermally
activated hopping motion of the ions takes place. For alkali borophosphate
glasses, a statistical mechanical approach was suggested to predict essential
characteristics of the distribution of energies at the residence sites of the
mobile alkali ions. The corresponding distribution of site energies was derived
from the chemical units forming the glassy network. A hopping model based on
the site energy landscape allowed to model the change of conductivity
activation energies with the borate to phosphate mixing ratio. Here we refine
and extend this general approach to cope with minimal local activation barriers
and to calculate dc-conductivities without the need of performing extensive
Monte-Carlo simulations. This calculation relies on the mapping of the
many-body ion dynamics onto a network of local conductances derived from the
elementary jump rates of the mobile ions. Application of the theoretical
modelling to three series of alkali borophosphate glasses with the compositions

and experimentally demonstrate that a semiconductor laser subject to delayed
optical feedback can exhibit unusual large intensity fluctuations characterized
by power-law distributions. Such an intensity fluctuation consists of distinct
intermittent bursts of light intensity, whose peak values attain tens of times
the intensity of the maximum gain mode. This burst behavior emerges when a
laser with a long time delay (over 100 ns) and an optimal feedback strength
operates around the lasing threshold. The intensity and waiting time statistics
follow power-law-like distributions. This implies the emergence of
nonequilibrium critical phenomena, namely self-organized criticality. In
addition to numerical results, we report experimental results that suggest the
power-law intensity dynamics in a semiconductor laser with delayed feedback.

the mass conserving properties of VOF. Thus, the numerical character of the
breakup does not allow obtaining the desired convergence of the droplet size

to detect and perforate thin structures. First, thin films or ligaments are
identified by taking quadratic moments of an indicator obtained from the volume

impressive performance in various applications. However, physical limitations,
budget restrictions, and many other factors usually impose \textit{constraints}
on a multi-agent system (MAS), which cannot be handled by traditional MARL
frameworks. Specifically, this paper focuses on constrained MASes where agents
work \textit{cooperatively} to maximize the expected team-average return under
various constraints on expected team-average costs, and develops a
\textit{constrained cooperative MARL} framework, named DeCOM, for such MASes.
In particular, DeCOM decomposes the policy of each agent into two modules,
which empowers information sharing among agents to achieve better cooperation.
In addition, with such modularization, the training algorithm of DeCOM
separates the original constrained optimization into an unconstrained
optimization on reward and a constraints satisfaction problem on costs. DeCOM
then iteratively solves these problems in a computationally efficient manner,
which makes DeCOM highly scalable. We also provide theoretical guarantees on
the convergence of DeCOM's policy update algorithm. Finally, we validate the
effectiveness of DeCOM with various types of costs in both toy and large-scale
(with 500 agents) environments.

generalize, or learn, based on various statistical properties of the training
data. The assumption underlying statistical ML resulting in theoretical or
empirical performance guarantees is that the distribution of the training data
is representative of the production data distribution. This assumption often
breaks; for instance, statistical distributions of the data may change. We term
changes that affect ML performance `data drift' or `drift'.
  Many classification techniques compute a measure of confidence in their
results. This measure might not reflect the actual ML performance. A famous
example is the Panda picture that is correctly classified as such with a
confidence of about 60\%, but when noise is added it is incorrectly classified
as a Gibbon with a confidence of above 99\%. However, the work we report on
here suggests that a classifier's measure of confidence can be used for the
purpose of detecting data drift.
  We propose an approach based solely on classifier suggested labels and its
confidence in them, for alerting on data distribution or feature space changes
that are likely to cause data drift. Our approach identities degradation in
model performance and does not require labeling of data in production which is
often lacking or delayed. Our experiments with three different data sets and
classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting data
drift. This is especially encouraging as the classification itself may or may
not be correct and no model input data is required. We further explore the
statistical approach of sequential change-point tests to automatically
determine the amount of data needed in order to identify drift while
controlling the false positive rate (Type-1 error).

(MGCLS) is a programme of long-track MeerKAT L-band (900-1670 MHz) observations
of 115 galaxy clusters, observed for $\sim$6-10 hours each in full
polarisation. The first legacy product data release (DR1), made available with
this paper, includes the MeerKAT visibilities, basic image cubes at $\sim$8""
resolution, and enhanced spectral and polarisation image cubes at $\sim$8"" and
15"" resolutions. Typical sensitivities for the full-resolution MGCLS image
products are $\sim$3-5 {\mu}Jy/beam. The basic cubes are full-field and span 4
deg^2. The enhanced products consist of the inner 1.44 deg^2 field of view,
corrected for the primary beam. The survey is fully sensitive to structures up
to $\sim$10' scales and the wide bandwidth allows spectral and Faraday rotation
mapping. HI mapping at 209 kHz resolution can be done at $0<z<0.09$ and
$0.19<z<0.48$. In this paper, we provide an overview of the survey and DR1
products, including caveats for usage. We present some initial results from the
survey, both for their intrinsic scientific value and to highlight the
capabilities for further exploration with these data. These include a primary
beam-corrected compact source catalogue of $\sim$626,000 sources for the full
survey, and an optical/infrared cross-matched catalogue for compact sources in

useful in all aspects of life and scientific research. T-carbon is a novel
carbon allotrope with many appealing properties. Since the proposal of
T-carbon, there has been a lot of intensive studies devoted to its physical,
chemical, optical, magnetic, thermoelectrical and topological properties and
possible applications in diverse areas in recent years. In this review, we
provide a comprehensive review on the advances of the experiments, intriguing
properties and various potential applications of T-carbon in energy storage,
optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, topological states, etc. As intercalation and
doping are effective methods to modify the electronic structure of materials or
even to convert into sparkly different new structures or phases, we also
discuss different atom doped T-carbon, which exhibit more intriguing properties
and lead to promising potential applications in solar cells, photocatalysis,
magnetism, superconductivity and so on. In addition, it is interesting to
mention that the hydrogenated T-carbon molecules werefound to be possibly
related to the physical origin of the UV extinction feature in interstellar
medium that has been the half-century long unsolved puzzle. Many novel
derivative structures either derived or inspired from T-carbon are included as
well. Finally, we give prospects and outlook for future directions of study on
T-carbon and related structures.

presence of bias in the publicly available Chest X-Ray datasets which have been
used by the majority of the researchers. In this paper, we propose a 2 staged
methodology to address this topical issue. Two experiments have been conducted
as a part of stage 1 of the methodology to exhibit the presence of bias in the
datasets. Subsequently, an image segmentation, super-resolution and CNN based
pipeline along with different image augmentation techniques have been proposed
in stage 2 of the methodology to reduce the effect of bias. InceptionResNetV2
trained on Chest X-Ray images that were augmented with Histogram Equalization
followed by Gamma Correction when passed through the pipeline proposed in stage
2, yielded a top accuracy of 90.47% for 3-class (Normal, Pneumonia, and

the illuminant estimation problem and have often led to state-of-the-art
results. Standard approaches operate directly on the input image. In this
paper, we argue that this problem can be decomposed into three channel-wise

illumination estimation approach based on this decomposition. The proposed
method substantially reduces the number of parameters needed to solve the task
while achieving competitive experimental results compared to state-of-the-art

techniques typically requires identifying the extreme error cases. This can be
achieved using an uncertainty estimation technique. In this work, we propose a
novel color constancy uncertainty estimation approach that augments the trained
model with an auxiliary branch which learns to predict the error based on the
feature representation. Intuitively, the model learns which feature
combinations are robust and are thus likely to yield low errors and which
combinations result in erroneous estimates. We test this approach on the
proposed method and show that it can indeed be used to avoid several extreme
error cases and, thus, improves the practicality of the proposed technique.

a fish-inspired robotic template, namely Magnetic, Modular, Undulatory Robotics
($\mu$Bots). Through this platform, we systematically explored the effects of
design and fluid parameters on the swimming performance via reinforcement
learning. The mathematical model was composed of two interacting subsystems,
the robot dynamics and the hydrodynamics, and the hydrodynamic model consisted
of reactive components (added-mass and pressure forces) and resistive
components (drag and friction forces), which were then nondimensionalized for
deriving key ""control parameters"" of robot-fluid interaction. The $\mu$Bot was
actuated via magnetic actuators controlled with harmonic voltage signals, which
were optimized via EM-based Policy Hyper Parameter Exploration (EPHE) to
maximize swimming speed. By varying the control parameters, total 36 cases with
different robot template variations (Number of Actuation (NoA) and stiffness)
and hydrodynamic parameters were simulated and optimized via EPHE. Results
showed that wavelength of optimized gaits (i.e., traveling wave along body) was
independent of template variations and hydrodynamic parameters. Higher NoA
yielded higher speed but lower speed per body length however with diminishing
gain and lower speed per body length. Body and caudal-fin gait dynamics were
dominated by the interaction among fluid added-mass, spring, and actuation
torque, with negligible contribution from fluid resistive drag. In contrast,
thrust generation was dominated by pressure force acting on caudal fin, as
steady swimming resulted from a balance between resistive force and pressure
force, with minor contributions from added-mass and body drag forces.
Therefore, added-mass force only indirectly affected the thrust generation and
swimming speed via the caudal fin dynamics.

their influence on heart performance have been documented not only for

computer models of cardiac electromechanics (EM) have to integrate effects of
the circulatory system on heart function to be relevant for clinical
applications. Currently it is not feasible to consider three-dimensional (3D)
models of the entire circulation. Instead, simplified representations of the
circulation are used, ensuring a satisfactory trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. In this work, we propose a novel and stable strategy to
couple a 3D EM model of the heart to a one-dimensional (1D) model of blood flow
in the arterial system. A personalised coupled 3D-1D model of LV and arterial
system is built and used in a numerical benchmark to demonstrate robustness and
accuracy of our scheme over a range of time steps. Validation of the coupled
model is performed by investigating the coupled system's physiological response
to variations in the arterial system affecting pulse wave propagation,
comprising aortic stiffening, aortic stenosis or bifurcations causing wave
reflections. Our results show that the coupled 3D-1D model is robust, stable

3D-0D models, additional computational costs are negligible, thus facilitating
the use of our coupled 3D-1D model as a key methodology in studies where wave

mechanisms in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve computer vision
tasks. Most of these methods learn to explicitly identify and highlight
relevant parts of the scene and pass the attended image to further layers of
the network. In this paper, we argue that such an approach might not be
optimal. Arguably, explicitly learning which parts of the image are relevant is
typically harder than learning which parts of the image are less relevant and,
thus, should be ignored. In fact, in vision domain, there are many
easy-to-identify patterns of irrelevant features. For example, image regions
close to the borders are less likely to contain useful information for a
classification task. Based on this idea, we propose to reformulate the
attention mechanism in CNNs to learn to ignore instead of learning to attend.
Specifically, we propose to explicitly learn irrelevant information in the
scene and suppress it in the produced representation, keeping only important
attributes. This implicit attention scheme can be incorporated into any
existing attention mechanism. In this work, we validate this idea using two
recent attention methods Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block and Convolutional
Block Attention Module (CBAM). Experimental results on different datasets and

yields superior performance compared to the standard approaches.

  Sparsification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sparse training is a natural idea to accelerate the training speed of deep
neural networks and save the memory usage, especially since large modern neural
networks are significantly over-parameterized. However, most of the existing
methods cannot achieve this goal in practice because the chain rule based
gradient (w.r.t. structure parameters) estimators adopted by previous methods
require dense computation at least in the backward propagation step. This paper
solves this problem by proposing an efficient sparse training method with
completely sparse forward and backward passes. We first formulate the training
process as a continuous minimization problem under global sparsity constraint.
We then separate the optimization process into two steps, corresponding to
weight update and structure parameter update. For the former step, we use the
conventional chain rule, which can be sparse via exploiting the sparse
structure. For the latter step, instead of using the chain rule based gradient
estimators as in existing methods, we propose a variance reduced policy
gradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward
propagation, thus achieving completely sparse training. We prove that the
variance of our gradient estimator is bounded. Extensive experimental results
on real-world datasets demonstrate that compared to previous methods, our
algorithm is much more effective in accelerating the training process, up to an
order of magnitude faster.

equilibrium. We find two environments that are particularly suited to this
purpose: an all-pay auction with uniformly distributed values, and a
first-price auction with the possibility of cancelled bids. We then implement
both of these environments in a virtual laboratory in order to see which theory
can best explain observed bidding behaviour. We find that, when plausibly
calibrated, the level-k model substantially under-predicts the observed bids
and is clearly out-performed by equilibrium. Moreover, attempting to fit the
level-k model to the observed data results in implausibly high estimated
levels, which in turn bear no relation to the levels inferred from a game known
to trigger level-k reasoning. Finally, subjects almost never appeal to iterated
reasoning when asked to explain how they bid. Overall, these findings suggest
that, despite its notable success in predicting behaviour in other strategic
settings, the level-k model (and its close cousin cognitive hierarchy) cannot
explain behaviour in auctions.

well established; however, it is a very challenging task for superposition due
to the nonorthogonality of the basis states. We show that there are sets of

We bridge the gap between the resource theory of superposition and coherence in

graph-related tasks. However, real-world problems involve very large graphs,
and the compute resources needed to fit GNNs to those problems grow rapidly.
Moreover, the noisy nature and size of real-world graphs cause GNNs to over-fit
if not regularized properly. Surprisingly, recent works show that large graphs
often involve many redundant components that can be removed without
compromising the performance too much. This includes node or edge removals
during inference through GNNs layers or as a pre-processing step that
sparsifies the input graph. This intriguing phenomenon enables the development
of state-of-the-art GNNs that are both efficient and accurate. In this paper,
we take a further step towards demystifying this phenomenon and propose a
systematic method called Locality-Sensitive Pruning (LSP) for graph pruning
based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing. We aim to sparsify a graph so that similar
local environments of the original graph result in similar environments in the
resulting sparsified graph, which is an essential feature for graph-related
tasks. To justify the application of pruning based on local graph properties,
we exemplify the advantage of applying pruning based on locality properties

removes a significant amount of edges from large graphs without compromising

various types of Markov processes, namely discrete-time Markov chains,

if $|\langle e,f\rangle |^2 = 1/d$ whenever $e$ and $f$ are basis vectors in
distinct bases. A natural question is for which pairs $(d,k)$ there exist $k$
mutually unbiased bases in dimension $d$. The (well-known) upper bound $k \leq
d+1$ is attained when $d$ is a power of a prime. For all other dimensions it is
an open problem whether the bound can be attained. Navascu\'es, Pironio, and
Ac\'in showed how to reformulate the existence question in terms of the
existence of a certain $C^*$-algebra. This naturally leads to a noncommutative
polynomial optimization problem and an associated hierarchy of semidefinite
programs. The problem has a symmetry coming from the wreath product of $S_d$
and $S_k$.
  We exploit this symmetry (analytically) to reduce the size of the
semidefinite programs making them (numerically) tractable. A key step is a
novel explicit decomposition of the $S_d \wr S_k$-module $\mathbb C^{([d]\times
[k])^t}$ into irreducible modules. We present numerical results for small $d,k$

for the (well-known) fact that there do not exist $d+2$ mutually unbiased bases
in dimensions $d=2,3,4,5,6,7,8$. Moreover, our numerical results indicate that
a sum-of-squares refutation, in the above-mentioned framework, of the existence
of more than $3$ MUBs in dimension $6$ requires polynomials of total degree at

enables a weighted guided image filter with a smaller radius to further reduce
the morphological artifacts while preserve the fine structure in the image. A

different levels and applying different haze removal and noise reduction
approaches to restore the scene radiance at different levels of the pyramid.
The resultant pyramid is collapsed to restore a haze-free image. Experiment

dehazing algorithms and the noise is indeed prevented from being amplified in

of a modified transformer SE network and a speaker-specific masking (SSM)

To evaluate OSSEM, we designed a modified Voice Bank-DEMAND dataset, in which
one utterance from the testing set was used for model adaptation, and the
remaining utterances were used for testing the performance. Moreover, we set
restrictions allowing the enhancement process to be conducted in real time, and
thus designed OSSEM to be a causal SE system. Experimental results first show
that OSSEM can effectively adapt a pretrained SE model to a particular speaker
with only one utterance, thus yielding improved SE results. Meanwhile, OSSEM
exhibits a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art causal SE

  Drug-Drug Interactions",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Motivation: Computational prediction of multiple-type drug-drug interaction
(DDI) helps reduce unexpected side effects in poly-drug treatments. Although
existing computational approaches achieve inspiring results, they ignore that
the action of a drug is mainly caused by its chemical substructures. In
addition, their interpretability is still weak. Results: In this paper, by
supposing that the interactions between two given drugs are caused by their
local chemical structures (sub-structures) and their DDI types are determined
by the linkages between different substructure sets, we design a novel
Substructure-ware Tensor Neural Network model for DDI prediction (STNN-DDI).
The proposed model learns a 3-D tensor of (substructure, in-teraction type,
substructure) triplets, which characterizes a substructure-substructure
interaction (SSI) space. According to a list of predefined substructures with
specific chemical meanings, the mapping of drugs into this SSI space enables
STNN-DDI to perform the multiple-type DDI prediction in both transductive and
inductive scenarios in a unified form with an explicable manner. The
compar-ison with deep learning-based state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates
the superiority of STNN-DDI with the significant improvement of AUC, AUPR,
Accuracy, and Precision. More importantly, case studies illustrate its
interpretability by both revealing a crucial sub-structure pair across drugs
regarding a DDI type of interest and uncovering interaction type-specific
substructure pairs in a given DDI. In summary, STNN-DDI provides an effective
approach to predicting DDIs as well as explaining the interaction mechanisms
among drugs.

policy and technology innovations spreading to other cities. In this way,
cities can be conceptualized as nodes in a globe-spanning learning network. The
dynamics of this process are important for society's response to climate change
and other challenges, but remain poorly understood on a macroscopic level. In
this contribution, we develop an approach to identify whether network-based
complex contagion effects are a feature of sustainability policy adoption by
cities, based on dose-response contagion and surrogate data models. We apply
this methodology to an example data set, comprising empirical data on the
spreading of a public transport innovation (Bus Rapid Transit Systems) and a
global inter-city connection network based on scheduled flight routes. We find
evidence pointing towards a contagious spreading process which cannot be
explained by either the network structure or the increase in global adoption
rate alone. This suggests that the actions of a city's abstract ""global
neighborhood"" within the network of cities may be an important factor in which
policies and innovations are implemented, with potential connections to the
emergence of social tipping processes. The methodology is generic, and can be
used to compare the predictive power for innovation spreading of different
kinds of inter-city network connections, e.g. via transport links, trade, or
co-membership in political networks.

use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction

rigorously that a bimodal steady-state distribution is admitted. This behavior
corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for low-latency
model/gradient-updates aggregation in federated edge learning (FEEL). By
integrating communication and computation into a joint design, AirComp can
significantly enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of
aggregation errors caused by channel fading and noise. This paper studies a
particular type of FEEL with federated averaging (FedAvg) and AirComp-based
model-update aggregation, namely over-the-air FedAvg (Air-FedAvg). We
investigate the transmission power control to combat against the AirComp
aggregation errors for enhancing the training accuracy and accelerating the
training speed of Air-FedAvg. Towards this end, we first analyze the
convergence behavior (in terms of the optimality gap) of Air-FedAvg with
aggregation errors at different outer iterations. Then, to enhance the training
accuracy, we minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmission
power control at edge devices and the denoising factors at edge server, subject
to a series of power constraints at individual edge devices. Furthermore, to
accelerate the training speed, we also minimize the training latency of
Air-FedAvg with a given targeted optimality gap, in which learning
hyper-parameters including the numbers of outer iterations and local training
epochs are jointly optimized with the power control. Finally, numerical results
show that the proposed transmission power control policy achieves significantly
faster convergence for Air-FedAvg, as compared with benchmark policies with
fixed power transmission or per-iteration mean squared error (MSE)
minimization. It is also shown that the Air-FedAvg achieves an
order-of-magnitude shorter training latency than the conventional FedAvg with
digital orthogonal multiple access (OMA-FedAvg).

inhomogeneous refracting and absorbing medium as inverse source problem for the
associated transport equation. Following Fermat's principle the Riemannian
metric in the considered domain is generated by the refractive index of the
medium. There is wealth of results for the inverse problem of recovering a
tensor field from its longitudinal ray transform in a static euclidean setting,
whereas there are only few inversion formulas and algorithms existing for
general Riemannian metrics and time-dependent tensor fields. It is a well-known
fact that tensor field tomography is equivalent to an inverse source problem
for a transport equation where the ray transform serves as given boundary data.
We prove that this result extends to the dynamic case. Interpreting dynamic
tensor tomography as inverse source problem represents a holistic approach in
this field. To guarantee that the forward mappings are well-defined, it is
necessary to prove existence and uniqueness for the underlying transport
equations. Unfortunately, the bilinear forms of the associated weak
formulations do not satisfy the coercivity condition. To this end we transfer
to viscosity solutions and prove their unique existence in appropriate Sobolev
(static case) and Sobolev-Bochner (dynamic case) spaces under a certain
assumption that allows only small variations of the refractive index. Numerical
evidence is given that the viscosity solution solves the original transport
equation if the viscosity term turns to zero.

thus corresponding to short-distance dependencies. Then, SPDE-based random

contagious diseases. The most widely known set of models are the compartmental
ones, which are based on a set of differential equations. But these are not the
only models. This review visits many different families of models.
Additionally, we show these families, not as unrelated entities, but following
a common thread in which the problems or assumptions of a model are solved or
generalized by another model. In this way, we can understand their
relationships, assumptions, simplifications, and, ultimately, limitations.
Prompted by the current Covid19 pandemic, we have a special focus on spread
forecasting. We illustrate the difficulties encountered to do realistic
predictions. In general, they are only approximations to a reality whose
biological and societal complexity is much larger. Particularly troublesome are
the large underlying variability, the problem's time-varying nature, and the
difficulty to estimate the required parameters for a faithful model.
Additionally, we will also see that these models have a multiplicative nature
implying that small errors in the system parameters cause a huge uncertainty in
the prediction. Stochastic or agent-based models can overcome some of the
modeling problems of systems based on differential or stochastic equations.
Their main difficulty is that they are as accurate and realistic as the data
available to estimate their detailed parametrization, and very often this
detailed data is not at the modeller's disposal. Although the predictive power
of mathematical models to forecast the evolution of a contagious disease is
very limited, these models are still very useful to plan interventions as they
can calculate their impact if all other parameters stay fixed. They are also
very useful to understand the properties of disease propagation in complex
systems.

whilst managing demand for limited resources such as testing. For both clinical

However, few efforts have been devoted to detecting when the phone distraction

Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if

cup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the
contact object's damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time

a CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the
handheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design an adaptive
window-based filter to correct the classification errors and identify each

Extensive experiments with fourteen people, three phones and two car models

the posteriors of the cosmological parameters due to the EdS approximation, but
a marginal difference in $\ln (10^{10} A_s)$ due to the effective redshift

holds on simulations of volume like DESI in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with a BBN

advocate systematic assessments on redshift selection for ongoing and future

baryon asymmetry of the Universe along with its dark matter content. To this
goal, we employ the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy bath states into a
feebly coupled dark matter particle and Standard Model charged fermions. These
decays lead to dark matter production via the freeze-in mechanism and, assuming
that they further violate $CP$, can generate a viable matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the resonant regime. We illustrate this mechanism by studying a
particular realization of this general scenario, where the role of the heavy
bath particles is played by $SU(3)_{\text{c}}\times SU(2)_{\text{L}}$-singlet
vectorlike fermions with a non-zero hypercharge and dark matter is identified
with a gauge-singlet real scalar field. We show that in the context of this
simple model the cosmological constraints for the dark matter abundance and the
baryon asymmetry are satisfied for masses of heavy vectorlike fermion states of
a few TeV, potentially within reach of the High-Luminosity Run of the Large
Hadron Collider. Dark matter, in turn, is predicted to be rather light, with a
mass of a few keV.

physics, neutron star mergers, and compact object magnetospheres. Despite the
need to accurately capture the dynamics of these plasmas and the implications
for relativistic transients, their fluid modeling is typically done using a
number of (overly) simplifying assumptions, which do not hold in general. This
is especially true when the mean free path in the plasma is large compared to
the system size, and kinetic effects start to become important. Going beyond
common approaches used in the literature, we describe a fully relativistic
covariant 14-moment based two-fluid system appropriate for the study of
electron-ion or electron-positron plasmas. This generalized Israel-Stewart-like
system of equations of motion is obtained directly from the relativistic
Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. Crucially, this new formulation can account for
non-ideal effects, such as anisotropic pressures and heat fluxes. We show that
a relativistic two-fluid plasma can be recast as a single fluid coupled to
electromagnetic fields with (potentially large) out-of-equilibrium corrections.
In particular, we keep all electron degrees of freedom, which provide
self-consistent evolution equations for electron temperature and momentum. The
equations outlined in this paper are able to capture the full two-fluid
character of collisionless plasmas found in black hole accretion and flaring
processes around compact objects, as well Braginskii-like two-fluid
magnetohydrodynamics applicable to weakly collisional plasmas inside accretion
disks. This new formulation will be instrumental in the construction of a large
class of next-generation simulations of relativistic transient phenomena
produced around black holes and neutron stars.

from $p$$+$$p$, $p$$+$Al, $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. Measurements were performed with different
centrality selections as well as the total inelastic, 0%--100%, selection for
all collision systems. For 0%--100% collisions, the nuclear modification
factors, $R_{xA}$, are consistent with unity for $p_T$ above 8 GeV/$c$, but
exhibit an enhancement in peripheral collisions and a suppression in central
collisions. The enhancement and suppression characteristics are similar for all
systems for the same centrality class. It is shown that for high-$p_T$-$\pi^0$
production, the nucleons in the $d$ and $^3$He interact mostly independently
with the Au nucleus and that the counter intuitive centrality dependence is
likely due to a physical correlation between multiplicity and the presence of a
hard scattering process. These observations disfavor models where parton energy
loss has a significant contribution to nuclear modifications in small systems.
Nuclear modifications at lower $p_T$ resemble the Cronin effect -- an increase
followed by a peak in central or inelastic collisions and a plateau in
peripheral collisions. The peak height has a characteristic ordering by system
size as $p$$+$Au $>$ $d$$+$Au $>$ $^{3}$He$+$Au $>$ $p$$+$Al. For collisions
with Au ions, current calculations based on initial state cold nuclear matter
effects result in the opposite order, suggesting the presence of other
contributions to nuclear modifications, in particular at lower $p_T$.

Inhomogeneous energy density, anisotropic pressure, heat dissipation and
modified terms create complexity within the self-gravitating system. We
evaluate the structure scalars by orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor to
evaluate a complexity factor which incorporates all the fundamental properties
of the system. Moreover, we examine the dynamics of the sphere by assuming
homologous mode as the simplest pattern of evolution. We also discuss
dissipative as well as non-dissipative scenarios corresponding to homologous
and complexity free conditions. Finally, we establish a criterion under which
the complexity free condition remains stable throughout the process of
evolution. We conclude that the presence of dark source terms of $f(G,T)$
gravity increase the system's complexity.

configuration space (OCS), it is shown that to know the wave function implies
not only statistical restrictions on the measurement results: the integrand in
the standard formula for calculating the average values of (self-adjoint)
operators and the Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the modulus and phase of the
wave function uniquely also define ' fields of operators' as functions of
coordinate and time. A key role in establishing the physical meaning of these
fields is played by the fact that the field of the kinetic energy operator
contains two heterogeneous contributions: the first is determined by the field
of the momentum operator, which is related only to the phase of the wave
function, and the second coincides with the so-called ""quantum mechanical
potential"", which is related only to the amplitude of the wave function. The
values of these fields at each point of the OCS are considered as the average
values of the corresponding observables for a pair of noninteracting particles
(for a pair of systems of a one-particle ensemble). At each such point, the
first contribution to the field of kinetic energy describes the kinetic energy
of the center of mass of a pair of particles, and the second -- the energy of
their motion relative to the center of mass. The field of the momentum operator
and the field of the kinetic energy operator, taking into account the K\""{o}nig
theorem, uniquely determine in the OCS two fields of particle momentum values
at each point of the OCS. An analogue of the Heisenberg inequality for the
deviations of both momentum fields from the field of the momentum operator is
obtained.

with the classic one dimensional mass-spring system, the linear dispersion
relation of the considered model has different characteristics in the low
frequency limit. By introducing disorder in the masses of the lattice
particles, we investigate how different nonlinearities (cubic, quartic and
their combination) lead to energy delocalization, equipartition and chaotic
dynamics. We excite the lattice using single site initial momentum excitations
corresponding to a strongly localized linear mode and increase the initial
energy of excitation. Beyond a certain energy threshold, when the cubic
nonlinearity is present, the system is found to reach energy equipartition and
total delocalization. On the other hand, when only the quartic nonlinearity is
activated, the system remains localized and away from equipartition at least
for the energies and evolution times considered here. However, for large enough
energies for all types of nonlinearities we observe chaos. This chaotic
behavior is combined with energy delocalization when cubic nonlinearities are
present, while the appearance of only quartic nonlinearity leads to energy
localization. Our results reveal a rich dynamical behavior and show differences
with the relevant Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model. Our findings pave the way for
the study of models relevant to bending (flexural) waves in the presence of
nonlinearity and disorder, anticipating different energy transport behaviors.

advances on various downstream tasks. Existing methods often model the
cross-modal interaction either via the similarity of the global feature of each
modality which misses sufficient information, or finer-grained interactions
using cross/self-attention upon visual and textual tokens. However,
cross/self-attention suffers from inferior efficiency in both training and
inference. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale Fine-grained Interactive
Language-Image Pre-training (FILIP) to achieve finer-level alignment through a
cross-modal late interaction mechanism, which uses a token-wise maximum
similarity between visual and textual tokens to guide the contrastive
objective. FILIP successfully leverages the finer-grained expressiveness
between image patches and textual words by modifying only contrastive loss,
while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute image and text
representations offline at inference, keeping both large-scale training and
inference efficient. Furthermore, we construct a new large-scale image-text
pair dataset called FILIP300M for pre-training. Experiments show that FILIP
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language
tasks including zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. The
visualization on word-patch alignment further shows that FILIP can learn
meaningful fine-grained features with promising localization ability.

this robustness can be partially explained by the calibration behavior of
modern CNNs, and may be improved with overconfidence. This is due to an
intuitive result: low confidence predictions are more likely to change
post-quantization, whilst being less accurate. High confidence predictions will
be more accurate, but more difficult to change. Thus, a minimal drop in
post-quantization accuracy is incurred. This presents a potential conflict in
neural network design: worse calibration from overconfidence may lead to better
robustness to quantization. We perform experiments applying post-training
quantization to a variety of CNNs, on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.

Most conventional feature selection methods focus on handling homogeneous

features with high relevance to class labels and ignore the redundancy among
features. The determination of an appropriate feature subset is also a

final feature subset for mixed-type data. SFSDFC decomposes the feature space
into a set of disjoint feature clusters using a novel density-based clustering

subset of important features with minimal redundancy from those feature

applications from space propulsion to focused ion beam microetching. Ionic
liquid ion sources produce ion beams by extracting single ions and metastable
solvated ion clusters from the surface of the ionic liquid and accelerating
them using an electric field generated by applying a voltage between a sharp
tip and a plate with an aperture. The solvated ion clusters often fragment in
the electric field region, reducing the specific impulse and efficiency for
propulsion applications and increasing the beam spot size for focused ion beam
applications.
  Fragmentation behavior has previously been characterized in the region with
no electric field. However, fragmentation in an electric field has not been
investigated as experimental results are difficult to interpret. The goal of
this work is to use various numerical methods to characterize fragmentation
under the effect of an electric field. Molecular dynamics simulations are
performed of various ionic liquid clusters under different conditions to
determine the rate of fragmentation. Physics-based models are compared to the
molecular dynamics results with the goal of deriving a new model that accounts
for the effect of the electric field on fragmentation. Approximate Bayesian
computational methods are employed to infer the temperature of different ionic
liquid cluster types and the percentage of the beam composed of each species by
comparing simulated retarding potential analysis curves to experimental ones.
Finally, the results of multi-scale N-body simulations are postprocessed and
compared to experimental data. Results show agreement between experimental data
and N-body simulations using the fragmentation rates determined by molecular
dynamics.

availability of multimodal data. The boost in performance of MSA models is
mainly hindered by two problems. On the one hand, recent MSA works mostly focus
on learning cross-modal dynamics, but neglect to explore an optimal solution
for unimodal networks, which determines the lower limit of MSA models. On the
other hand, noisy information hidden in each modality interferes the learning
of correct cross-modal dynamics. To address the above-mentioned problems, we
propose a novel MSA framework \textbf{M}odulation \textbf{M}odel for
\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis ({$ M^3SA $}) to
identify the contribution of modalities and reduce the impact of noisy
information, so as to better learn unimodal and cross-modal dynamics.
Specifically, modulation loss is designed to modulate the loss contribution
based on the confidence of individual modalities in each utterance, so as to
explore an optimal update solution for each unimodal network. Besides, contrary
to most existing works which fail to explicitly filter out noisy information,
we devise a modality filter module to identify and filter out modality noise
for the learning of correct cross-modal embedding. Extensive experiments on

popular techniques that have both been employed to analyze categorical
biological sequences. At face value, the methods seem entirely dissimilar.
Minimizers use min-wise hashing on a rolling window to extract a single
important k-mer feature per window. CNNs start with a wide array of randomly
initialized convolutional filters, paired with a pooling operation, and then
multiple additional neural layers to learn both the filters themselves and how
those filters can be used to classify the sequence. In this manuscript, we
demonstrate through a careful mathematical analysis of hash function properties
that for sequences over a categorical alphabet, random Gaussian initialization
of convolutional filters with max-pooling is equivalent to choosing a minimizer
ordering such that selected k-mers are (in Hamming distance) far from the
k-mers within the sequence but close to other minimizers. In empirical
experiments, we find that this property manifests as decreased density in
repetitive regions, both in simulation and on real human telomeres. This
provides a partial explanation for the effectiveness of CNNs in categorical
sequence analysis.

learning, but its main drawback is the unavailability of labeled data samples
in practical applications. It is still a key challenge to train the deep
generative models and learn comprehensive representations without supervision.
Even though continuous latent variables are employed primarily in deep latent
variable models, discrete latent variables, with their enhanced
understandability and better compressed representations, are effectively used
by researchers. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised discrete latent
variable model for multi-class text classification and text generation. The
proposed model employs the concept of transfer learning for training a
quantized transformer model, which is able to learn competently using fewer
labeled instances. The model applies decomposed vector quantization technique
to overcome problems like posterior collapse and index collapse. Shannon
entropy is used for the decomposed sub-encoders, on which a variable
DropConnect is applied, to retain maximum information. Moreover, gradients of
the Loss function are adaptively modified during backpropagation from decoder
to encoder to enhance the performance of the model. Three conventional datasets
of diversified range have been used for validating the proposed model on a
variable number of labeled instances. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed model has surpassed the state-of-the-art models remarkably.

companions to 47 UMa, rho CrB, and 51 Peg. They are assumed to have formed in
situ according to the basic model that a core formed first by accretion of
solid particles, then later it captured substantial amounts of gas from the
protoplanetary disk. In most of the calculations we prescribe a constant
accretion rate for the solid core. The evolution of the gaseous envelope
assumes that: (1) it is in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, (2) the gas accretion
rate is determined by the requirement that the outer radius of the planet is
the place at which the thermal velocity of the gas allows it to reach the
boundary of the planet's Hill sphere, (3) the gas accretion rate is limited,
moreover, by the prescribed maximum rate at which the nebula can supply the
gas, and (4) the growth of the planet stops once it obtains approximately the
minimum mass determined from radial velocity measurements. Calculations are
carried out through an initial phase during which solid accretion dominates,
past the point of crossover when the masses of solid and gaseous material are
equal, through the phase of rapid gas accretion, and into the final phase of
contraction and cooling at constant mass. Alternative calculations are
presented for the case of 47 UMa in which the solid accretion rate is
calculated, not assumed, and the dissolution of planetesimals within the
gaseous envelope is considered. In all cases there is a short phase of high
luminosity (1e-3-1e-2 Lsun) associated with rapid gas accretion. The height and
duration of this peak depend on uncertain model parameters. The conclusion is
reached that in situ formation of all of these companions is possible under
some conditions. However, it is more likely that orbital migration was an
important component of the evolution, at least for the planets around rho CrB
and 51 Peg.

predict the risk of hospital mortality and 30-day mortality in sepsis patients.
From the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word
representations and embeddings. Supervised learning classifiers and a deep
learning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The
configurations that utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features
yielded competitive F-measure of 0.512. Our results showed that the approaches
integrating both structured and unstructured clinical features can be
effectively applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of mortality
in sepsis patients upon admission to the ICU.

However, few studies exist concerning how distance factors have affected the
international collaboration in AI research. In this study, we investigate this
problem by using 1,294,644 AI related collaborative papers harvested from the
Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset. A framework including 13 indicators to
quantify the distance factors between countries from 5 perspectives (i.e.,
geographic distance, economic distance, cultural distance, academic distance,
and industrial distance) is proposed. The relationships were conducted by the
methods of descriptive analysis and regression analysis. The results show that
international collaboration in the field of AI today is not prevalent (only
15.7%). All the separations in international collaborations have increased over
years, except for the cultural distance in masculinity/felinity dimension and
the industrial distance. The geographic distance, economic distance and
academic distances have shown significantly negative relationships with the
degree of international collaborations in the field of AI. The industrial
distance has a significant positive relationship with the degree of
international collaboration in the field of AI. Also, the results demonstrate
that the participation of the United States and China have promoted the
international collaboration in the field of AI. This study provides a
comprehensive understanding of internationalizing AI research in geographic,
economic, cultural, academic, and industrial aspects.
