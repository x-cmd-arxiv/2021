from the switchboard corpus and investigates how variables such as length,
number of topic transitions, topic transitions share by participants and
turns/topic are related. This work presents an empirical study on topic
transition in switchboard corpus followed by modelling topic transition with a
precision of 83% for in-domain(id) test set and 82% on 10 out-of-domain}(ood)
test set. It is envisioned that this work will help in emulating human-human
like topic transition in open-domain dialog systems.

of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Gravitational Waves (GWs) in the Universe.
These models are based on no-scale theory. By breaking the
SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry we fix one of the two chiral fields and we
derive effective scalar potentials which are capable of generating PBHs and
GWs. As it is known in the literature there is an important unification of the
no-scale models, which leads to the Starobinsky effective scalar potential
based on the coset SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1). We use this unification in order
to additionally explain the generation of PBHs and GWs. Concretely, we modify
well-known superpotentials, which reduce to Starobinsky-like effective scalar
potentials. Thus, we derive scalar potentials which, on the one hand, explain
the production of PBHs and GWs and, on the other hand, they conserve the
transformation laws, which yield from the parametrization of the coset
SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) as well as the unification between the models which
are yielded this coset. We numerically evaluate the scalar power spectra with
the effective scalar potential based on this theory. Furthermore, we evaluate
the fractional abundances of PBHs by comparing two methods the Press-Schechter
approach and the peak theory, while focusing on explaining the dark matter in
the Universe. By using the resulting scalar power spectrum we evaluate the
amount of GWs. All models are in complete consistence with Planck constraints.

carried out for stars with mass on the main sequence $M_0=0.82M_\odot$,
$0.85M_\odot$, $0.9M_\odot$ and with initial abundances of helium and heavier
elements $Y=0.25$ and $Z=10^{-3}$, respectively. For each value of $M_0$ the
AGB and post--AGB evolutionary phases were computed with three values of the
mass loss parameter in the Bl\""ocker formula: $\eta_B=0.02$, 0.05 and 0.1. The
variable star RU~Cam with pulsation period $\Pi\approx 22$ day is shown to be
in the post--AGB stage and the pulsation amplitude decrease in years 1962--1963
is due to movement of the star across the HR diagram beyond the pulsation
instability region. Theoretical estimates of the mass and the luminosity of
RU~Cam are $0.524M_\odot\le M\le 0.532M_\odot$ and $2.20\times 10^3L_\odot\le
L\le 2.33\times 10^3L_\odot$, respectively. Hydrodynamic calculations of
nonlinear stellar pulsations show that while the star approaches the
instability boundary a significant reduction ($\approx 90\%$) in the pulsation
amplitude occurs for nearly two years with subsequent slow decay of
low--amplitude oscillations. Solution of the equations of hydrodynamics with
time--dependent inner boundary conditions describing evolutionary changes in
the radius and the luminosity at the bottom of the pulsating envelope allows us
to conclude that decay of radial oscillations in RU~Cam is accompanied by the
effect of oscillation hysteresis. In particular, the stage of large--amplitude
limit cycle oscillations extends by $\approx 12$ years and the subsequent stage
of decaying small--amplitude oscilations spreads beyond the formal boundary of
pulsation instability.

spontaneous symmetry breaking, obviously these mass terms are invariant under a
global SU(2) symmetry that is unbroken. The pure gauge terms are also invariant
under this symmetry. This symmetry is called the {\em custodial symmetry} (CS).
In $\rm SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge theories, CS implies a mass relation between
the $W$ and the $Z$ bosons. The Standard Model (SM), as well as various
extensions of it in the scalar sector, possess such a symmetry. In this paper,
we critically examine the notion of CS and show that there may be three
different classes of CS, depending on the gauge couplings and self-couplings of
the scalars. Among old models that preserve CS, we discuss the Two-Higgs
Doublet Model and the one doublet plus two triplet model by Georgi and
Machacek. We show that for two-triplet extensions, the Georgi-Machacek model is
not the most general possibility with CS. Rather, we find, as the most general
extension, a new model with more parameters and hence a richer phenomenology.
Some of the consequences of this new model have also been discussed.

exhibits the 2 electron redox reaction of vanadium (V5+ to V3+) along with the
1 electron redox reaction of iron within the voltage window of 1.5-3.8V. This
results in a high specific capacity of ~350mAhg-1 which can be extracted from

initiate a dissolution process at ~2.5V, resulting in a loss of active material

switching to a superconcentrated electrolyte, wherein the amount of 'free'
solvent is low. An electrolyte, consisting of seven molar lithium

  Generalized Linear Models and Beyond",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Response functions linking regression predictors to properties of the
response distribution are fundamental components in many statistical models.
However, the choice of these functions is typically based on the domain of the
modeled quantities and is not further scrutinized. For example, the exponential
response function is usually assumed for parameters restricted to be positive
although it implies a multiplicative model which may not necessarily be
desired. Consequently, applied researchers might easily face misleading results
when relying on defaults without further investigation. As an alternative to
the exponential response function, we propose the use of the softplus function
to construct alternative link functions for parameters restricted to be
positive. As a major advantage, we can construct differentiable link functions
corresponding closely to the identity function for positive values of the
regression predictor, which implies an quasi-additive model and thus allows for
an additive interpretation of the estimated effects by practitioners. We
demonstrate the applicability of the softplus response function using both
simulations and real data. In four applications featuring count data regression
and Bayesian distributional regression, we contrast our approach to the
commonly used exponential response function.

very intricate nature of their axioms. Various approaches have been explored,
based on different shapes given to the cells. Interestingly, homotopy type
theory encompasses a definition of weak $\omega$-groupoid in a globular
setting, since every type carries such a structure. Starting from this remark,
Brunerie could extract this definition of globular weak
$\omega$\nobreakdash-groupoids, formulated as a type theory. By refining its
rules, Finster and Mimram have then defined a type theory called CaTT, whose
models are weak $\omega$-categories. Here, we generalize this approach to
monoidal weak $\omega$-categories. Based on the principle that they should be
equivalent to weak $\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, we are able to
derive a type theory MCaTT whose models are monoidal categories. This requires
changing the rules of the theory in order to encode the information carried by
the unique $0$-cell. The correctness of the resulting type theory is shown by
defining a pair of translations between our type theory MCaTT and the type
theory CaTT. Our main contribution is to show that these translations relate
the models of our type theory to the models of the type theory CaTT consisting
of $\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, by analyzing in details how the
notion of models interact with the structural rules of both type theories.

Primarily focusing on the latter, recent studies of emergent communication
overlook the sketches; they do not account for the evolution process through
which symbolic sign systems emerge in the trade-off between iconicity and
symbolicity. In this work, we take the very first step to model and simulate
this process via two neural agents playing a visual communication game; the
sender communicates with the receiver by sketching on a canvas. We devise a
novel reinforcement learning method such that agents are evolved jointly
towards successful communication and abstract graphical conventions. To inspect
the emerged conventions, we define three fundamental properties -- iconicity,
symbolicity, and semanticity -- and design evaluation methods accordingly. Our
experimental results under different controls are consistent with the
observation in studies of human graphical conventions. Of note, we find that
evolved sketches can preserve the continuum of semantics under proper
environmental pressures. More interestingly, co-evolved agents can switch
between conventionalized and iconic communication based on their familiarity
with referents. We hope the present research can pave the path for studying
emergent communication with the modality of sketches.

predict test error using just the training dataset and the network parameters.
While generalization bounds can give many insights about architecture design,
training algorithms, etc., what they do not currently do is yield good
predictions for actual test error. A recently introduced Predicting
Generalization in Deep Learning competition~\citep{jiang2020neurips} aims to
encourage discovery of methods to better predict test error. The current paper
investigates a simple idea: can test error be predicted using {\em synthetic
data,} produced using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that was trained
on the same training dataset? Upon investigating several GAN models and
architectures, we find that this turns out to be the case. In fact, using GANs
pre-trained on standard datasets, the test error can be predicted without
requiring any additional hyper-parameter tuning. This result is surprising
because GANs have well-known limitations (e.g. mode collapse) and are known to
not learn the data distribution accurately. Yet the generated samples are good
enough to substitute for test data. Several additional experiments are
presented to explore reasons why GANs do well at this task. In addition to a
new approach for predicting generalization, the counter-intuitive phenomena
presented in our work may also call for a better understanding of GANs'
strengths and limitations.

FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across
clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable
compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the

restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by
second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL.
Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly
strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our
findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to
overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign

from its leading hemisphere. The leading/trailing hemispherical asymmetry in
the distribution of CO2 ice is consistent with radiolytic production of CO2,
formed by charged particle bombardment of H2O ice and carbonaceous material in
Ariel's regolith. This longitudinal distribution of CO2 on Ariel was previously
characterized using 13 near-infrared reflectance spectra collected at 'low'
sub-observer latitudes between 30S to 30N. Here, we investigated the
distribution of CO2 ice on Ariel using 18 new spectra: two collected over low
sub-observer latitudes, five collected at 'mid' sub-observer latitudes (31 -
44N), and eleven collected over 'high' sub-observer latitudes (45 - 51N).
Analysis of these data indicates that CO2 ice is primarily concentrated on
Ariel's trailing hemisphere. However, CO2 ice band strengths are diminished in
the spectra collected over mid and high sub-observer latitudes. This
sub-observer latitudinal trend may result from radiolytic production of CO2
molecules at high latitudes and subsequent migration of this constituent to low
latitude cold traps. We detected a subtle feature near 2.13 microns in two
spectra collected over high sub-observer latitudes, which might result from a
'forbidden' transition mode of CO2 ice that is substantially stronger in well
mixed substrates composed of CO2 and H2O ice, consistent with regolith-mixed
CO2 ice grains formed by radiolysis. Additionally, we detected a 2.35-micron
feature in some low sub-observer latitude spectra, which might result from CO
formed as part of a CO2 radiolytic production cycle.

removal (zapping) on a digitized signal of averaged power values. Spectral
kurtosis is a hypothesis test, analogous to the t-test, with a null hypothesis
that the amplitudes from which power is formed belong to a `good' distribution
-- typically Gaussian with zero mean -- where power values are zapped if the
hypothesis is rejected at a specified confidence level. We derive
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as a function of amount of zapping for folded
radio pulsar observations consisting of a sum of signals from multiple
telescopes in independent radio-frequency interference (RFI) environments,
comparing four methods to compensate for lost data with coherent (tied-array)
and incoherent summation. For coherently summed amplitudes, scaling amplitudes
from non-zapped telescopes achieves a higher SNR than replacing zapped
amplitudes with artificial noise. For incoherently summed power values, the
highest SNR is given by scaling power from non-zapped telescopes to maintain a
constant mean. We use spectral kurtosis to clean a tied-array radio pulsar
observation by the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP): the signal from one
telescope is zapped with time and frequency resolutions of 6.25 $\mu$s and 0.16

profile shape, with 0.6 per cent of data zapped and a reduction from 1.22 to

weights are randomly fixed and only a subset are trained.
  In this thesis we prove results about reservoir computers trained on
deterministic dynamical systems, and stochastic processes. We focus mostly on a
special type of reservoir computer called an Echo State Network (ESN).
  In the deterministic case, we prove (under some assumptions) that if a
reservoir computer has the Echo State Property (ESP), then there is a C1
generalised synchronisation between the input dynamical system and the dynamics
in the reservoir space. Furthermore, we prove that a reservoir computer with
the local ESP in several disjoint subsets of the reservoir space will admit
several distinct generalised synchronisations. In the special case that the
reservoir map is linear, and has the ESP, we prove that the generalised
synchronisation is generically an embedding. This result admits Takens'
embedding Theorem as a special case.
  We go to show that ESNs trained on scalar observations of an ergodic
dynamical system can approximate an arbitrary target function, including the
next step map used in time series forecasting. This universal approximation
property holds despite the training process being entirely linear.
  We prove analogous results for ESNs trained on observations of a stochastic
process, which are not be Markovian in general. We use these results to develop
supervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms supported by an ESN.
  In the penultimate chapter of this thesis, we use a reservoir computer to
numerically solve linear PDEs. In the final chapter, we conclude and discuss
directions for future work.

another. Then, we use 120-day rolling data to capture the financial system's

contributions of nodes and network complexity to changes in system stability
frequently cancel each other out. Edge change may be a determinant of systemic
stability. Furthermore, the total flows in the network are highly correlated
with the volatility. It main advantage is the tractability and potential

optimized to predict adjacent words, the human brain would be tuned to make
long-range and hierarchical predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyze
the fMRI brain signals of 304 subjects each listening to 70min of short

long-range forecast representations improves their brain-mapping. The results
further reveal a hierarchy of predictions in the brain, whereby the
fronto-parietal cortices forecast more abstract and more distant

a cylinder condition naturally arises as the thermal dimension becomes

through a careful choice of strategy. A powerful class of such ""payoff control""
strategies was discovered by Press and Dyson (2012). Their so-called
""zero-determinant"" (ZD) strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a
linear relationship between both players' payoffs. It was subsequently shown by
Chen and Zinger (2014) that when the slope of this linear relationship is
positive, ZD strategies are robustly effective against a selfishly optimizing
co-player, in that all adapting paths of the selfish player lead to the maximal
payoffs for both players (at least when there are certain restrictions on the
game parameters). In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of selfish
learning against a fixed player in more general settings, for both ZD and
non-ZD strategies. We first prove that in any symmetric $2\times 2$ game, the
selfish player's final strategy must be of a certain form and cannot be fully
stochastic. We then show that there are prisoner's dilemma interactions for
which selfish optimization does not always lead to maximal payoffs against
fixed ZD strategies with positive slope. We give examples of selfish adapting
paths that lead to locally but not globally optimal payoffs, undermining the
robustness of payoff control strategies. For non-ZD strategies, these
pathologies arise regardless of the original restrictions on the game
parameters. Our results illuminate the difficulty of implementing robust payoff

feature-aligned federated learning framework to resolve this issue by
establishing a firm structure-feature alignment across the collaborative
models. Fed2 is composed of two major designs: First, we design a
feature-oriented model structure adaptation method to ensure explicit feature
allocation in different neural network structures. Applying the structure
adaptation to collaborative models, matchable structures with similar feature
information can be initialized at the very early training stage. During the
federated learning process, we then propose a feature paired averaging scheme
to guarantee aligned feature distribution and maintain no feature fusion
conflicts under either IID or non-IID scenarios. Eventually, Fed2 could
effectively enhance the federated learning convergence performance under
extensive homo- and heterogeneous settings, providing excellent convergence
speed, accuracy, and computation/communication efficiency.

of systolic arrays, but usually based on a number of oversimplified assumptions
(e.g., only considering divisors for loop tiling, pruning based on off-chip
data communication) to reduce the design space.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive design space exploration tool named
Odyssey for systolic array optimization. Odyssey does not rely on artificial
assumptions to limit the design space, and yet it is highly efficient and
scalable with a hybrid optimization technique. For example, for a
1024x1024x1024 matrix multiplication, it finds designs that reach 90% of the
optimal performance in 5 seconds with a single CPU thread. Moreover, using
Odyssey, we unveil and quantify the suboptimality introduced by multiple
commonly used oversimplifications in prior studies for systolic array design

for loop tiling leads to a 39% performance loss, and pruning based on off-chip

computational complexity and call for comprehensive collaboration for

wisely adjust model concurrency and interleave DNN model operators, maintaining
a continuously balanced resource utilization across the entire inference

most essential concerns in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution,
deep learning-based high-quality MR image restoration has been investigated to
generate highly-resolved and motion artifact-free MR images from lower
resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time or motion
artifact-corrupted images. However, numerous problems still exist to prevent
deep learning approaches from becoming practical in the clinic environment.
Specifically, most of the prior works focus solely on the network but ignore
the impact of various down-sampling strategies on the acquisition time.
Besides, the long inference time and high GPU consumption are also the
bottlenecks to deploy most of the prior works in clinics. Furthermore, prior
studies employ random movement in retrospective motion artifact generation,
resulting in uncontrollable severity of motion artifact. More importantly,
doctors are unsure whether the generated MR images are trustworthy, making
diagnosis difficult. To overcome all these problems, we adopted a unified
framework of 2D deep learning neural network for both 3D MRI super-resolution
and motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such a framework can achieve
better performance in 3D MRI restoration tasks compared to other
state-of-the-art methods and remain the GPU consumption and inference time
significantly low, thus easier to deploy. We also analyzed several
down-sampling strategies based on the acceleration factor, including multiple
combinations of in-plane and through-plane down-sampling, and developed a
controllable and quantifiable motion artifact generation method. At last, the
pixel-wise uncertainty was calculated and used to estimate the accuracy of the

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Contrastive learning has led to substantial improvements in the quality of
learned embedding representations for tasks such as image classification.
However, a key drawback of existing contrastive augmentation methods is that
they may lead to the modification of the image content which can yield
undesired alterations of its semantics. This can affect the performance of the
model on downstream tasks. Hence, in this paper, we ask whether we can augment
image data in contrastive learning such that the task-relevant semantic content
of an image is preserved. For this purpose, we propose to leverage
saliency-based explanation methods to create content-preserving masked
augmentations for contrastive learning. Our novel explanation-driven supervised
contrastive learning (ExCon) methodology critically serves the dual goals of
encouraging nearby image embeddings to have similar content and explanation. To
quantify the impact of ExCon, we conduct experiments on the CIFAR-100 and the
Tiny ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that ExCon outperforms vanilla
supervised contrastive learning in terms of classification, explanation
quality, adversarial robustness as well as probabilistic calibration in the
context of distributional shift.

used to help identify if a proposed decision policy is better than a current
baseline policy. However, a new decision policy may be better than a baseline
policy for some individuals but not others. This has motivated a push towards
personalization and accurate per-state estimates of heterogeneous treatment
effects (HTEs). Given the limited data present in many important applications,
individual predictions can come at a cost to accuracy and confidence in such
predictions. We develop a method to balance the need for personalization with
confident predictions by identifying subgroups where it is possible to
confidently estimate the expected difference in a new decision policy relative
to a baseline. We propose a novel loss function that accounts for uncertainty
during the subgroup partitioning phase. In experiments, we show that our method
can be used to form accurate predictions of HTEs where other methods struggle.

In
the layers in which the Fe-peak elements dominate the mean opacity (the
so-called Z-bump), Ni is the second contributor to the Rosseland opacity after
iron, according to the Opacity Project data. Reliable nickel cross sections are
therefore mandatory for building realistic stellar models, especially for
main-sequence pulsators such as $\beta$ Cep and slowly pulsating B stars, whose
oscillations are triggered by the $\kappa$-mechanism of the Fe-peak elements.
Unfortunately, the Opacity Project data for Ni were extrapolated from those of
Fe, and previous studies have shown that they were underestimated in comparison
to detailed calculations. We investigate the impact of newly computed
monochromatic cross sections on the Rosseland mean opacity of Ni and on the
structure of main-sequence massive pulsators. We compare our results with the
widely used Opacity Project and OPAL data. Monochromatic cross sections for Ni
were obtained with the SCO-RCG code. The Toulouse-Geneva evolution code was
used to build the stellar models. With the new data, the Rosseland opacities of
Ni are roughly the same as those of the Opacity Project or OPAL at high
temperatures ($\log\ T>6$). At lower temperatures, significant departures are
observed; the ratios are up to six times higher with SCO-RCG. These
discrepancies span a wider temperature range in the comparison with OPAL than
in comparison with the Opacity Project. For massive star models, the results of
the comparison with a structure computed with Opacity Project data show that
the Rosseland mean of the global stellar mixture is only marginally altered in
the Z-bump. The maximum opacity is shifted towards slightly more superficial
layers. A new maximum appears in the temperature derivative of the mean
opacity, and the driving of the pulsations should be affected.

This applied problem can be considered to overlap with the problem of finding a

off-the-shelf grid needs to be restructured to have higher grid density in some
regions than others. This should be done in a way that avoids tangling, hence,
the attractiveness of diffeomorphic mapping techniques. For exact diffeomorphic
mapping on the sphere a major tool used is Optimal Transport, which allows for
diffeomorphic mapping between even non-continuous source and target densities.
However, recently Optimal Information Transport was rigorously developed
allowing for exact and inexact diffeomorphic mapping and the solving of a
simpler partial differential equation.
  In this manuscript, we perform the first side-by-side comparison of using
Optimal Transport and Optimal Information Transport on the sphere for adaptive
mesh problems. We introduce how to generalize these computations to more
general manifolds. In this manuscript, we choose to perform this comparison
with provably convergent solvers, which is generally challenging for either

in the partial differential equation formulation. It appears that Optimal
Information Transport produces better results and is more easily generalizable
for the moving mesh problem. In order to use Optimal Transport for moving mesh

spatially explicit version of the Hegselmann-Krause model for the dynamics of
opinions. Individuals are located on the vertices of a finite connected graph
representing a social network, and are characterized by their opinion, with the
set of opinions $\Delta$ being a general bounded convex subset of a finite
dimensional normed vector space. Having a confidence threshold $\tau$, two
individuals are said to be compatible if the distance (induced by the norm)
between their opinions does not exceed the threshold $\tau$. Each vertex $x$
updates its opinion at rate the number of its compatible neighbors on the
social network, which results in the opinion at $x$ to be replaced by a convex
combination of the opinion at $x$ and the nearby opinions: $\alpha$ times the
opinion at $x$ plus $(1 - \alpha)$ times the average opinion of its compatible
neighbors. The main objective is to derive a lower bound for the probability of
consensus when the opinions are initially independent and identically
distributed with values in the opinion set $\Delta$.

3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable
synthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which
often occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its
reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the
first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an
analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the
blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this
simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models
spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each
spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized,
inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an
MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly
optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We
demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus
blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on
both synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several
baselines. The synthetic and real datasets along with the source code is

use step by step. On the other hand, the concept of personal mobility is also
getting popular, and its autonomous driving specialized for individual drivers
is expected for a new step. However, it is difficult to collect a large driving
dataset, which is basically required for the learning of autonomous driving,
from the individual driver of the personal mobility. In addition, when the
driver is not familiar with the operation of the personal mobility, the dataset
will contain non-optimal data. This study therefore focuses on an autonomous
driving method for the personal mobility with such a small and noisy, so-called
personal, dataset. Specifically, we introduce a new loss function based on
Tsallis statistics that weights gradients depending on the original loss
function and allows us to exclude noisy data in the optimization phase. In
addition, we improve the visualization technique to verify whether the driver
and the controller have the same region of interest. From the experimental
results, we found that the conventional autonomous driving failed to drive
properly due to the wrong operations in the personal dataset, and the region of
interest was different from that of the driver. In contrast, the proposed
method learned robustly against the errors and successfully drove automatically

agents (e.g., schooling fish, flocking birds, swarming insects) perform
complicated collective behaviors for efficiency and safety, the first element
uses three simple rules to maintain a swarm formation. The second element
provides a means to select promising regions to explore (and cover) by
minimising a cost function involving robots' relative distance to frontier
cells and the frontier's size. We tested the performance of our approach on
heterogeneous and homogeneous groups of mobile robots in different

The interaction representation for the open quantum system is used to
distribute excitations among the bath degrees of freedom so that the occupation
of each bath oscillator is ensured to be low. The interaction picture also
causes the matrix dimensions to be much smaller in a matrix product state of a
chain-mapped open quantum system than in the Schr\""odinger picture. Using the
interaction representation accelerates the calculations by 1-2 orders of

Using these two equivalent complex structures, we develop a clear exposition on
the analytic dependence of involved mappings between certain subspaces.
Especially, we examine the parametrization of a chord-arc curve by using the
Riemann mapping and its dependence on the arc-length parametrization. As a

that the minimum between cycles 24 and 25 was the second consecutive minimum

regions observed at the Sun's surface are manifestations of the magnetic field
generated in the interior, it is crucial to investigate/understand the dynamics
below the surface. In this context, we report, by probing the solar interior
with helioseismic techniques applied to long-term oscillations data from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), that the seismic minima in deeper
layers have been occurring about a year earlier than that at the surface for
the last two consecutive solar cycles. Our findings also demonstrate a decrease
in strong magnetic fields at the base of the convection zone, the primary
driver of the surface magnetic activity. We conclude that the magnetic fields
located in the core and near-surface shear layers, in addition to the
tachocline fields, play an important role in modifying the oscillation
frequencies. This provides evidence that further strengthens the existence of a
relic magnetic field in the Sun's core since its formation.

inducing a large tsunami wave. We model tsunamis induced by bathymetry change
using the shallow water equations on an idealized slice through the sea. The
earthquake slip model is based on a sum of multivariate log-normal

mechanisms have smoothly varying fault slip patches that lead to an expansive

compressed as they approach shore and reach close-to-vertical leading wave edge
close to shore.

performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to

performance of quantum search algorithm. The Grover search and similar
techniques are widely used in various quantum algorithms, including cases where
rival parties are fighting over confidential data. Hence, the oracle-box wires
become the subject of competing activity with an alteration of their normal
functioning. Of course, many kinds of errors could arise in this way. Possible
influence of dephasing on quantum search was already addressed in the
literature. Amplitude damping is another type of errors that should be analyzed
first. To study the problem, we introduce a simple model of collective
distortions with the use of amplitude damping channel. All the quantities of
interest should be considered as functions of the number of Grover's
iterations. In particular, we investigate the success probability with respect
to the parameter that characterizes the level of amplitude errors. The success
probability degrades significantly even if the error amount is not essential.
Namely, this probability soon enough reduces to a value close to one half. We
also study trade-off relations between quantum coherence and the success
probability in the presence of amplitude noise.

discover that there are two types of PSFs that achieve high performance for
resolving emitters in 3D, as quantified by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds for
estimating the separation between two closely spaced emitters. One PSF is very
similar to the existing Tetrapod PSFs; the other is a rotating single-spot PSF,

localizing single emitters throughout a 1-$\mu$m focal volume (localization
precisions of 7.3~nm in $x$, 7.7~nm in $y$, and 18.3~nm in $z$ using 1000

emitters with superior accuracy ($25$-$53\%$ lower error rates than the
best-performing Tetrapod PSF, averaged throughout a 1-$\mu$m focal volume). Our
study provides additional insights into optimal strategies for encoding 3D

(DFL) architecture that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT
applications. Inspired by Knowledge Distillation (KD) that can increase the

training, which occupies negligible network resources. The soft targets are
generated by local sample predictions of each AIoT device after each round of
local training and used for the next round of model training. During the local
training of DFL, both soft targets and hard labels are used as approximation

we design a dynamic adjustment strategy for tuning the ratio of two loss

after data generation, this work provides a toolkit to mitigate unfairness
during data generation, given by the Unfair Edge Prioritization algorithm, in
addition to de-biasing data after generation, given by the Discrimination
Removal algorithm. We assume that a non-parametric Markovian causal model
representative of the data generation procedure is given. The edges emanating
from the sensitive nodes in the causal graph, such as race, are assumed to be
the sources of unfairness. We first quantify Edge Flow in any edge X -> Y,
which is the belief of observing a specific value of Y due to the influence of
a specific value of X along X -> Y. We then quantify Edge Unfairness by
formulating a non-parametric model in terms of edge flows. We then prove that
cumulative unfairness towards sensitive groups in a decision, like race in a
bail decision, is non-existent when edge unfairness is absent. We prove this
result for the non-trivial non-parametric model setting when the cumulative
unfairness cannot be expressed in terms of edge unfairness. We then measure the
Potential to mitigate the Cumulative Unfairness when edge unfairness is
decreased. Based on these measurements, we propose the Unfair Edge
Prioritization algorithm that can then be used by policymakers. We also propose
the Discrimination Removal Procedure that de-biases a data distribution by
eliminating optimization constraints that grow exponentially in the number of
sensitive attributes and values taken by them. Extensive experiments validate
the theorem and specifications used for quantifying the above measures.

that adapts a model to the target domain using self-distillation with sample
pairs. Each sample pair is composed of a teacher sample from a labeled dataset

transferring an intermediate style between the teacher and the student, and
then train the model by minimizing the output discrepancy between the student

discrepancy between the two domains, thus allowing the student to easily learn
from the teacher. Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that our
method effectively minimizes both the inter-domain and intra-domain

characteristics into a super sensor that has superior noise performance. To
achieve sensor fusion, complementary filters are used in current
gravitational-wave detectors to combine relative displacement sensors and
inertial sensors for active seismic isolation. Complementary filters are a set
of digital filters, which have transfer functions that are summed to unity.
Currently, complementary filters are shaped and tuned manually rather than
optimized, which can be suboptimal and hard to reproduce for future detectors.
In this paper, an optimization-based method called $\mathcal{H}_\infty$
synthesis is proposed for synthesizing optimal complementary filters according
to the sensor noises themselves. The complementary filter design problem is
converted into an optimization problem that seeks minimization of an objective
function equivalent to the maximum difference between the super sensor noise
and the lower bound in logarithmic scale. The method is exemplified by
synthesizing complementary filters for sensor fusion of 1) a relative
displacement sensor and an inertial sensor, 2) a relative displacement sensor
coupled with seismic noise and an inertial sensor, and 3) hypothetical
displacement sensor and inertial sensor, which have slightly different noise
characteristics compared to the typical ones. In all cases, the method produces
complementary filters that suppress the super sensor noise equally close to the
lower bound at all frequencies in logarithmic scale. The synthesized filters
contain features that better suppress the sensor noises compared to the
pre-designed complementary filters. Overall, the proposed method allows the
synthesis of optimal complementary filters according to the sensor noises
themselves and is a better and versatile method for solving sensor fusion
problems.

yet effective model. To achieve this goal, a small student model is trained to
exploit the knowledge of a large well-trained teacher model. However, due to
the capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the student's performance
is hard to reach the level of the teacher. Regarding this issue, existing
methods propose to reduce the difficulty of the teacher's knowledge via a proxy
way. We argue that these proxy-based methods overlook the knowledge loss of the
teacher, which may cause the student to encounter capacity bottlenecks. In this
paper, we alleviate the capacity gap problem from a new perspective with the
purpose of averting knowledge loss. Instead of sacrificing part of the
teacher's knowledge, we propose to build a more powerful student via
adversarial collaborative learning. To this end, we further propose an
Adversarial Collaborative Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) method that effectively
improves the performance of knowledge distillation. Specifically, we construct
the student model with multiple auxiliary learners. Meanwhile, we devise an

adversarial learning to enhance the capacity of the student. Extensive
experiments on four classification tasks show the superiority of the proposed

unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising
performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model,
which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two
steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise
from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and
using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in
the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast
algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high
performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show
that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances
over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised

The use of unsupervised denoisers, on the other hand, necessitates a more
detailed understanding of the underlying image statistics. In particular, it is
well known that apparent differences between clean and noisy images are most
prominent on high-frequency bands, justifying the use of low-pass filters as

without considering frequency domain information. To address this limitation,
in this study we propose a frequency-sensitive unsupervised denoising method.

how technologies to improve linkage might fit with prevailing work practices

rigid-band approximation, our pairing phase diagram is occupied by the triplet

national defense. However, the mixed effect of the maintenance and the pure

these advances have led to the comprehensive acquisition and quantification of

the field of artificial intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks
alongside corresponding advances in hardware accelerators with large memory
capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled
practitioners to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that
achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields spanning
computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and more widely
used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more
apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues
that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to
requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Collective behavior,
commonly observed in nature, tends to produce systems that are robust,
adaptable, and have less rigid assumptions about the environment configuration.
Collective intelligence, as a field, studies the group intelligence that
emerges from the interactions of many individuals. Within this field, ideas
such as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular
automata were developed to model and explain complex systems. It is therefore
natural to see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods. In
this review, we will provide a historical context of neural network research's
involvement with complex systems, and highlight several active areas in modern
deep learning research that incorporate the principles of collective
intelligence to advance its current capabilities. We hope this review can serve
as a bridge between the complex systems and deep learning communities.

depth-aware LiDAR point clouds and semantic-rich stereo images would benefit 3D
object detection. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to explore the inherently
unnatural interaction between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. To ease
this difficulty, the recent proposals generally project the 3D points onto the
2D image plane to sample the image data and then aggregate the data at the
points. However, this approach often suffers from the mismatch between the
resolution of point clouds and RGB images, leading to sub-optimal performance.
Specifically, taking the sparse points as the multi-modal data aggregation
locations causes severe information loss for high-resolution images, which in
turn undermines the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we
present VPFNet -- a new architecture that cleverly aligns and aggregates the
point cloud and image data at the `virtual' points. Particularly, with their
density lying between that of the 3D points and 2D pixels, the virtual points
can nicely bridge the resolution gap between the two sensors, and thus preserve
more information for processing. Moreover, we also investigate the data
augmentation techniques that can be applied to both point clouds and RGB
images, as the data augmentation has made non-negligible contribution towards
3D object detectors to date. We have conducted extensive experiments on KITTI
dataset, and have observed good performance compared to the state-of-the-art
methods. Remarkably, our VPFNet achieves 83.21\% moderate 3D AP and 91.86\%
moderate BEV AP on the KITTI test set, ranking the 1st since May 21th, 2021.
The network design also takes computation efficiency into consideration -- we
can achieve a FPS of 15 on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU. The code will be
made available for reproduction and further investigation.

emission associated with nine short GRBs detected by the Swift and/or Fermi
satellites using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) rapid-response observing
mode. The MWA began observing these events within 30 to 60s of their
high-energy detection, enabling us to capture any dispersion delayed signals
emitted by short GRBs for a typical range of redshifts. We conducted transient
searches at the GRB positions on timescales of 5s, 30s and 2min, resulting in
the most constraining flux density limits on any associated transient of 0.42,
0.29, and 0.084Jy, respectively. We also searched for dispersed signals at a
temporal and spectral resolution of 0.5s and 1.28MHz but none were detected.
However, the fluence limit of 80-100Jy ms derived for GRB 190627A is the most
stringent to date for a short GRB. We compared the fluence and persistent
emission limits to short GRB coherent emission models, placing constraints on
key parameters including the radio emission efficiency of the nearly merged
neutron stars ($\lesssim10^{-4}$), the fraction of magnetic energy in the GRB
jet ($\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$), and the radio emission efficiency of the
magnetar remnant ($\lesssim10^{-3}$). Comparing the limits derived for our full
GRB sample to the same emission models, we demonstrate that our 30-min flux
density limits were sensitive enough to theoretically detect the persistent
radio emission from magnetar remnants up to a redshift of $z\sim0.6$. Our
non-detection of this emission could imply that some GRBs in the sample were
not genuinely short or did not result from a binary neutron star merger, the
GRBs were at high redshifts, these mergers formed atypical magnetars, the
radiation beams of the magnetar remnants were pointing away from Earth, or the

been proposed and investigated including various combinations of deflagrations
and detonations in white dwarfs of different masses up to the Chandrasekhar
mass. One of these is the gravitationally confined detonation model. In this
case a weak deflagration burns to the surface, wraps around the bound core, and
collides at the antipode. A subsequent detonation is then initiated in the
collision area. Since the parameter space for this scenario, that is, varying
central densities and ignition geometries, has not been studied in detail, we
used pure deflagration models of a previous parameter study dedicated to Type
Iax supernovae as initial models to investigate the gravitationally confined
detonation scenario. We aim to judge whether this channel can account for one
of the many subgroups of Type Ia supernovae, or even normal events. To this
end, we employed a comprehensive pipeline for three-dimensional Type Ia
supernova modeling that consists of hydrodynamic explosion simulations, nuclear
network calculations, and radiative transfer. The observables extracted from
the radiative transfer are then compared to observed light curves and spectra.
The study produces a wide range in masses of synthesized 56 Ni ranging from
0.257 to 1.057 $M_\odot$ , and, thus, can potentially account for subluminous
as well as overluminous Type Ia supernovae in terms of brightness. However, a
rough agreement with observed light curves and spectra can only be found for
91T-like objects. Although several discrepancies remain, we conclude that the
gravitationally confined detonation model cannot be ruled out as a mechanism to
produce 91T-like objects. However, the models do not provide a good explanation
for either normal Type Ia supernovae or Type Iax supernovae.

  First, using the classical recursive decomposition algorithm, we obtain a
rough upper bound valid for all Hall bases. We then introduce new notions
(which we call alphabetic subsets and relative foldings) related to structural
properties of the Lie brackets created by the algorithm, which allow us to
prove a sharp upper bound for the general case. We also prove that the length

  Second, for the celebrated historical length-compatible Hall bases and the
Lyndon basis, we prove tighter sharp upper bounds, which turn out to be
geometric in the length of the brackets.
  Third, we construct two new Hall bases, illustrating two opposite behaviors
in the two-indeterminates case. One is designed so that its structure constants
have the minimal growth possible, matching exactly the general lower bound,
linked with the Fibonacci sequence. The other one is designed so that its
structure constants grow super-geometrically.
  Eventually, we investigate asymmetric growth bounds which isolate the role of
one particular indeterminate. Despite the existence of super-geometric Hall
bases, we prove that the asymmetric growth with respect to each fixed

ore formation as well as weathering. Natural observations and experiments have
shown that in such systems the shape of reaction fronts can vary significantly
ranging from smooth, rough to highly irregular. It remains unclear what
process-related knowledge can be derived from these reaction front patterns. In
this contribution we show a numerical approach to test the effect of relative
rates of advection, diffusion and reaction on the development of reaction
fronts patterns in granular aggregates with permeable grain boundaries. The
numerical model takes (i) fluid infiltration along permeable grain boundaries,
(ii) reactions and (iii) elemental diffusion into account. We monitor the
change in element concentration within the fluid, while reactions occur at a
pre-defined rate as a function of the local fluid concentration. In
non-dimensional phase space using P{\'e}clet and Damk{\""o}hler numbers, results
show that there are no rough fronts without advection (P{\'e}clet<70) nor if
the reaction is too fast (Damk{\""o}hler>10-3). As advection becomes more
dominant and reaction slower, roughness develops across several grains with a
full microstructure mimicking replacement in the most extreme cases. The
reaction front patterns show an increase in roughness with increasing
P{\'e}clet number from P{\'e}clet 10 to 100 but then a decrease in roughness
towards higher P{\'e}clet numbers controlled by the Damk{\""o}hler number. Our
results indicate that reaction rates are crucial for pattern formation and that
the shape of reaction fronts is only partly due to the underlying transport
mechanism.

Enantiomerically pure $\Delta$- or $\Lambda$-Ru(acac)$_3$, characterized by

to produce a supersonic beam and photoionized by circularly-polarized VUV light
from the DESIRS beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Photoelectron spectroscopy
(PES) and PECD experiments were conducted using a double imaging electron/ion
coincidence spectrometer, and compared to density functional theory (DFT) and
time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. The open-shell character of
Ru(acac)$_3$, which is not taken into account in our DFT approach, is expected
to give rise to a wide multiplet structure, which is not resolved in our PES
signals but whose presence might be inferred from the additional striking
features observed in the PECD curves. Nevertheless, the DFT-based assignment of
the electronic bands leads to the characterisation of the ionized orbitals. In
line with other recent works, the results confirm that PECD persists
independently on the localization and/or on the achiral or chiral nature of the
initial orbital, but is rather a probe of the molecular potential as a whole.
Overall, the measured PECD signals on Ru(acac)$_3$, a system exhibiting D$_3$
propeller-type chirality, are of similar magnitude compared to those on
asymmetric-carbon-based chiral organic molecules which constitute the vast
majority of species investigated so far, thus suggesting that PECD is a
universal mechanism, inherent to any type of chirality.

$^{14}$O, and by sequential 2p emission to the ground state (g.s.) of $^{13}$N
via the $1^-$ resonance of $^{14}$O. Gamow shell model (GSM) analysis of the

study which base theories $U$ have the property that, for any finitely

Corto.
  The consistency-like statements provided by a Friedman-reflexive base $U$ can
be used to define a provability-like notion for a finitely axiomatised $A$ that
interprets $U$ via an interpretation $K$ of $U$ in $A$. We call the modal

L\""ob Conditions. We provide conditions for when these logics extend {\sf S}4,

then the condition for extending L\""ob's Logic is fulfilled. Moreover, if our
base theory $U$ is sequential and if, in addition, its interpreters can be
effectively found, we prove Solovay's Theorem. This holds even if the

method estimates high resolution and highly precise depth maps iteratively, by
traversing the continuous space of feasible depth values at each pixel in a

architecture: this computes a pixelwise binary mask that establishes whether
each pixel actual depth is in front or behind its current iteration individual
depth hypothesis. Moreover, in order to handle occluded regions, at each
iteration the results from different source images are fused using pixelwise
weights estimated by a second network. Thanks to the adopted binary decision
strategy, which permits an efficient exploration of the depth space, our method
can handle high resolution images without trading resolution and precision.
This sets it apart from most alternative learning-based Multi-View Stereo

However, undesirable SS is

generation caused by CCM, we still do not fully understand the main cause of SS
generation. An attempt is made here to offer some answers to these questions by
considering the rearrangement of cell monolayers. The SS generation represents
a consequence of natural and forced convection. While forced convection is
dependent on cell speed, the natural convection is induced by the gradient of
tissue surface tension. The phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect. The
gradient of tissue surface tension induces directed cell spreading from the
regions of lower tissue surface tension to the regions of higher tissue surface
tension. This directed cell migration is described by the Marangoni flux. The
phenomenon has been recognized during the rearrangement of (1) epithelial cell
monolayers and (2) mixed cell monolayers made by epithelial and mesenchymal
cells. The consequence of the Marangoni effect is an intensive spreading of
cancer cells through an epithelium. In this work, a review of existing
literature about SS generation caused by CCM is given along with the assortment
of published experimental findings, in order to invite experimentalists to test

task, we introduce an Agent-Centric Relation Graph (ACRG) for learning the
visual representation based on the relationships in the environment. ACRG is a
highly effective and reasonable structure that consists of two relationships,
i.e., the relationship among objects and the relationship between the agent and
the target. On the one hand, we design the Object Horizontal Relationship Graph

the vertical relationship is not involved in OHRG, and we argue that OHRG is
suitable for the control strategy. On the other hand, we propose the
Agent-Target Depth Relationship Graph (ATDRG) that enables the agent to
perceive the distance to the target. To achieve ATDRG, we utilize image depth
to represent the distance. Given the above relationships, the agent can
perceive the environment and output navigation actions. Given the visual
representations constructed by ACRG and position-encoded global features, the
agent can capture the target position to perform navigation actions.

  Mislabeling Noise Model",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the generalization properties of a self-training algorithm
with halfspaces. The approach learns a list of halfspaces iteratively from
labeled and unlabeled training data, in which each iteration consists of two
steps: exploration and pruning. In the exploration phase, the halfspace is
found sequentially by maximizing the unsigned-margin among unlabeled examples
and then assigning pseudo-labels to those that have a distance higher than the
current threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then added to the training
set, and a new classifier is learned. This process is repeated until no more
unlabeled examples remain for pseudo-labeling. In the pruning phase,
pseudo-labeled samples that have a distance to the last halfspace greater than
the associated unsigned-margin are then discarded. We prove that the
misclassification error of the resulting sequence of classifiers is bounded and
show that the resulting semi-supervised approach never degrades performance
compared to the classifier learned using only the initial labeled training set.
Experiments carried out on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency
of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Simulation-based safety testing must take into account the fact that human

worker behavior is simulated, critical hazards can remain undiscovered. On the
other hand, simulating all possible worker behaviors is computationally
infeasible. This raises the problem of how to find interesting (i.e.,
potentially hazardous) worker behaviors given a limited number of simulation
runs. We frame this as a search problem in the space of possible worker
behaviors. Because this search space can get quite complex, we introduce the
following measures: (1) Search space restriction based on workflow-constraints,
(2) prioritization of behaviors based on how far they deviate from the nominal
behavior, and (3) the use of a risk metric to guide the search towards
high-risk behaviors which are more likely to expose hazards. We demonstrate the
approach in a collaborative workflow scenario that involves a human worker, a
robot arm, and a mobile robot.

solve this issue, several solutions have emerged to identify device models and

and compares the device model identification performance of a centralized DL
model with an FL one while using execution time-based events. For experimental
purposes, a dataset containing execution-time features of 55 Raspberry Pis

down, losing rotational energy through the magnetic poles. The magnetic field
is assumed to be dipolar; however, the star has a non-zero azimuthal component
due to the misalignment. The magnetic field induces an electric field for a
force-free condition. The magnetic field decreases as the misalignment
increases and is minimum along the equatorial plane of the star. In contrast,
the electric field remains almost constant initially but decreases rapidly at a
high misalignment angle. The charge separation at the star surface is
qualitatively similar to that of Newtonian calculation. We find that the power

planning of future energy systems needs to accommodate societal preferences,
e.g. low levels of acceptance for transmission expansion or onshore wind
turbines, and must also acknowledge the inherent uncertainties of technology
cost projections. To date, however, many capacity expansion models lean heavily
towards only minimising system cost and only studying a few cost projections.
Here, we address both criticisms in unison. While taking account of technology
cost uncertainties, we apply methods from multi-objective optimisation to
explore trade-offs in a fully renewable European electricity system between
increasing system cost and extremising the use of individual technologies for
generating, storing and transmitting electricity to build robust insights about
what actions are viable within given cost ranges. We identify boundary
conditions that must be met for cost-efficiency regardless of how cost
developments will unfold; for instance, that some grid reinforcement and
long-term storage alongside a significant amount of wind capacity appear
essential. But, foremost, we reveal that near the cost-optimum a broad spectrum
of regionally and technologically diverse options exists in any case, which
allows policymakers to navigate around public acceptance issues. The analysis
requires managing many computationally demanding scenario runs efficiently, for
which we leverage multi-fidelity surrogate modelling techniques using sparse

particular choice of natural frequencies but for all possible choices of
frequencies. We have observed such a behaviour in the case of 1:1
synchronization, where we have seen a variety of couplings in the literature
that forces the oscillators to have almost equal frequencies and makes the
system to oscillate with a common frequency independent of whether the
oscillators are identical or non-identical. Similarly, in this article we
observe that, whether the initial choice of frequencies is of the ratio 1:2 or
not, the given nonlinear coupling forces the system to oscillate with the
frequency ratio 1:2. Further, we present synchronization and other dynamical
behaviours of the system by considering different choices of natural
frequencies.

novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model
the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point
transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a
radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance
(values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray
by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models
the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel
value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the
corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume
rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into
HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the
supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the
proposed method. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenes
validate that our method can not only accurately control the exposures of

the improvement of low lightness only, or simply deal with all the degeneration
factors as a whole, therefore leading to a sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we propose to decouple the enhancement model into two sequential stages.
The first stage focuses on improving the scene visibility based on a pixel-wise
non-linear mapping. The second stage focuses on improving the appearance
fidelity by suppressing the rest degeneration factors. The decoupled model
facilitates the enhancement in two aspects. On the one hand, the whole
low-light enhancement can be divided into two easier subtasks. The first one
only aims to enhance the visibility. It also helps to bridge the large
intensity gap between the low-light and normal-light images. In this way, the
second subtask can be shaped as the local appearance adjustment. On the other
hand, since the parameter matrix learned from the first stage is aware of the
lightness distribution and the scene structure, it can be incorporated into the
second stage as the complementary information. In the experiments, our model
demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and
quantitative comparisons, compared with other low-light image enhancement
models. In addition, the ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of

appearance of highly motion-blurred objects from a video. To this end, we model
the blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by
parametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces,
shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning
multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all
parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video
via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur
by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose,
we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To
account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory
as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of
the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods for fast moving object
deblurring and 3D reconstruction.

densities derived using these absorption processes has been observed within
Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio sources.
While it is possible that this correlation exists within the broader radio

broader radio population by analysing a historic sample of 168 radio sources
compiled from the literature in such a way so as to minimise selection bias.
From this historic sample we conclude that there is some evidence for a
correlation between HI and soft X-ray absorption outside of peaked spectrum

analysis difficult using current samples. We discuss this in the context of the
SEAFOG project and how forthcoming data will change the landscape of future

Hamiltonian constraint acts in the $q$-deformed spin network basis as

under Pachner moves of the canonical surface. We find that those

two-body non-leptonic $D$ meson decays, where a promising QCD inspired approach
from first principles is still missing. It was also applied to $B$ meson decays
whose subleading power contributions are difficult to calculate. By factorizing
topological amplitudes into short distance Wilson coefficients and long
distance hadronic matrix elements either to be calculated or to be
parameterized, it provides an effective framework to extract information of
nonperturbative dynamics involved. With important flavor SU(3) breaking effects
taken into account, the data of the decay branching ratios (and also CP
asymmetries in $B$ decays) can be fitted well. The extracted amplitudes were
further applied to make predictions for other observables, such as CP
asymmetries in $D$ decays, mixing parameters in the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ system, and
so on. By this review, we will describe the formulation of the

Theoretical studies proposed that magnetized winds launched from the discs (MHD

the observed disc demographics in the framework of MHD disc winds, combining
analytical solutions of disc evolution and a disc population synthesis
approach. We show that MHD disc winds alone can account for both disc dispersal
and accretion properties. The decline of disc fraction over time is reproduced
by assuming that the initial accretion timescale (a generalization of the
viscous timescale) varies from disc to disc and that the decline of the
magnetic field strength is slower than that of the gas. The correlation between
accretion rate and disc mass, and the dispersion of the data around the mean
trend as observed in Lupus is then naturally reproduced. The model also
accounts for the rapidity of the disc dispersal. This paves the way for planet
formation models in the paradigm of wind-driven accretion.

nuclei is faced with a major challenge in that there are several different
types of nuclei, some of them exhibiting large intra-class variability. To help
drive forward research and innovation for automatic nuclei recognition in
CPath, we organise the Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC)
Challenge. The challenge encourages researchers to develop algorithms that
perform segmentation, classification and counting of nuclei within the current
largest known publicly available nuclei-level dataset in CPath, containing
around half a million labelled nuclei. Therefore, the CoNIC challenge utilises
over 10 times the number of nuclei as the previous largest challenge dataset
for nuclei recognition. It is important for algorithms to be robust to input
variation if we wish to deploy them in a clinical setting. Therefore, as part
of this challenge we will also test the sensitivity of each submitted algorithm
to certain input variations.

Doeblin condition, and has a limiting marginal distribution p, then it cannot

Sinai's factor theorem to the nonsingular setting. As a consequence of our
results we also obtain that every transitive twice continuously differentiable
Anosov diffeomorphism on a compact manifold, endowed with volume measure, has

size, their dipole-dipole interaction at micrometer-scale distances and their
coupling to external fields are huge. Recent experiments vividly exhibit their
interest for quantum simulation, in spite of limitations due to the relatively
short lifetime of optically-accessible Rydberg levels. These limitations
motivate a renewed interest for the long-lived circular Rydberg states .
However, detecting them is so far either destructive or complex. Moreover,
alkali circular states can be manipulated only by microwave fields, unable to
address individual atoms. Alkaline earth circular states, with their optically
active second valence electron, can circumvent these problems. Here we show how
to use the electrostatic coupling between the two valence electrons of
strontium to coherently manipulate a circular Rydberg state with optical
pulses. We also use this coupling to map the state of the Rydberg electron onto
that of the ionic core. This experiment opens the way to a state-selective

beyond, to the realization of a hybrid optical-microwave platform for quantum

computer vision. Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for
their ability to represent a wide range of shapes with few parameters. However,
as the first and foremost step, recovering superquadrics accurately and
robustly from 3D data still remains challenging. The existing methods are
subject to local optima and sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world
scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geometric shapes. In this
paper, we propose the first probabilistic method to recover superquadrics from
point clouds. Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the
parametric surface of a superquadric, which explicitly models the generation of
outliers and noise. The superquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation,
Maximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers
are predicted from the posterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is
optimized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are
avoided by globally searching and switching among parameters encoding similar
superquadrics. We show that our method can be extended to the
multi-superquadrics recovery for complex objects. The proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The code is at

system where the shock is followed by a combustion front which is deconfining
hadronic matter to quark matter. The maximum mass of the daughter quark star
(generated from the combustion of the parent neutron star) is consistent with
the maximum mass limit for the EoS sequence. We find that matter velocities for
GR shocks under suitable conditions can break the speed of light limit
indicating a very fast combustion process. Also, the matter velocities imply
that for space-like shocks the combustion process is most probably a
deflagration and for time-like shocks, it is a detonation and can even proceed
with velocities that are super-luminous.

without a soda tax as a control group. The results suggest a counter-intuitive
positive effect of the tax on soda consumption in Hungary. The reason for this
finding could be the substitution of other unhealthy beverages, which are taxed
at a higher rate, by sodas. The effect of the soda tax in France is as expected
negative, but insignificant which might be caused by a low tax rate. The body
mass index (BMI) is not affected by the tax in any country. Consequently,
policy makers should think carefully about the design and the tax rate before

below 2.5\,K in the quasi-one dimensional crystals of non-centrosymmetric

consequence of inversion symmetry breaking as the same material also stabilizes
in a centro-symmetric structure (space group: $P4/mnc$) where it behaves like a
non-magnetic insulator. The coexistence here upfront contradicts the popular
belief that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are two apparently
antagonistic phenomena. Notably, here, for the first time, we have clearly
detected Meissner effect in the superconducting state despite the coexisting
ferromagnetic order. The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism
projects non-centrosymmetric (TaSe$_4$)$_3$I as a host for complex ground
states of quantum matter including possible unconventional superconductivity
with elusive spin-triplet pairing.

consideration are only assumed to satisfy natural assumptions, namely the
preservation of non-negativity and a control of the total mass. It is proved in
dimension one that if nonlinearities have (slightly super-) cubic growth rates
then the system has a unique global classical solutions. Moreover, in the case
of mass dissipation, the solution is bounded uniformly in time in sup-norm. One
key idea in the proof is the H\""older continuity of gradient of solutions to
parabolic equation with possibly discontinuous diffusion coefficients and low
regular forcing terms. When the system possesses additionally an entropy
inequality, the global existence and boundedness of a unique classical solution
is shown for nonlinearities satisfying a cubic intermediate sum condition,
which is a significant generalization of cubic growth rates. The main idea in
this case is to combine a modified Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and the newly
developed $L^p$-energy method in
\cite{morgan2021global,fitzgibbon2021reaction}. This idea also allows us to
deal with the case of discontinuous diffusion coefficients in higher

two planets around a circular or eccentric orbit binary. The orbits of the two
planet are initially circular and coplanar to each other, but misaligned with
respect to the binary orbital plane. The binary-planet and planet-planet
interactions result in complex planet tilt oscillations. We use analytic models
and numerical simulations to explore the effects of various values of the
planet semi-major axes, binary eccentricity, and initial inclination. Around a
circular orbit binary, secular tilt oscillations are driven by planet-planet
interactions and are periodic. In that case, planets undergo mutual libration
if close together and circulation if far apart with an abrupt transition at a
critical separation. Around an eccentric orbit binary, secular tilt
oscillations are driven by both planet-planet interactions and binary-planet
interactions. These oscillations generally display more than one frequency and
are generally not periodic. The transition from mutual planet libration to
circulation is not sharp and there is a range of separations for which the
planets are on orbits that are sometimes mutually librating and sometimes
circulating. In addition, at certain separations, there are resonances for
which tilt oscillations are complicated but periodic. For planets that are
highly misaligned with respect to an eccentric orbit binary, there are
stationary (non-oscillating) tilt configurations that are generalisations of
polar configurations for the single planet case. Tilt oscillations of highly
inclined planets occur for initial tilts that depart from the stationary
configuration.

of magnetic fields on large scales in molecular clouds. However, due to
insufficient resolution, Planck observations are unable to constrain the

resolution of 11.7 arcsec provided by NIKA2-Pol 1.15 mm polarimetric imaging,

how this effect can be corrected for, leading to reliable exploitable data in a

Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where an effective inverse-square attraction is
induced as a consequence of the dipole-charge interaction between a
hydrogenlike heavy-light atom and a far-separated heavy particle. Because the
resulting Efimovian states emerge toward the second or higher dissociation
threshold, they are to be realized as quasibound states and may be observed by
exciting hydrogen molecular ions and trions in excitonic systems. We also
consider the same system but with a logarithmic Coulomb potential relevant to
quantum vortices in two-dimensional superfluids, where the Efimovian states are

VideoQA framework needs to understand the video content at different semantic

question-related content. To this end, we propose a Lightweight
Visual-Linguistic Reasoning framework named LiVLR. Specifically, LiVLR first
utilizes the graph-based Visual and Linguistic Encoders to obtain multi-grained
visual and linguistic representations. Subsequently, the obtained
representations are integrated with the devised Diversity-aware
Visual-Linguistic Reasoning module (DaVL). The DaVL considers the difference
between the different types of representations and can flexibly adjust the
importance of different types of representations when generating the
question-related joint representation, which is an effective and general
representation integration method. The proposed LiVLR is lightweight and shows
its performance advantage on two VideoQA benchmarks, MRSVTT-QA and KnowIT VQA.

been the subject of intensive study but mostly in the stationary case when the
coarse-grained system dynamics remains unchanged over time. Nonstationary

states, were also reported, however not investigated systematically because of
their complexity. In this paper we suggest a semi-analytic solution to the

relies on the consideration of an integro-differential equation describing the

a self-consistency equation for these solutions and carry out their stability
analysis. We show that our approach correctly predicts macroscopic features of

  Pretrained Models Against Adversarial Attack","TMI under review",,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks are discovered to be non-robust when attacked by
imperceptible adversarial examples, which is dangerous for it applied into
medical diagnostic system that requires high reliability. However, the defense
methods that have good effect in natural images may not be suitable for medical
diagnostic tasks. The preprocessing methods (e.g., random resizing,
compression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical
image. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical
for medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is
necessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for
medical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less
Diagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack
(i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pertained medical model.
Specifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of
noisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the
pretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies,
MedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In
addition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as
the confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to
utilize MedRDF to convert pre-trained non-robust diagnostic models into robust
ones. The experimental results on COVID-19 and DermaMNIST datasets verify the
effectiveness of our MedRDF in improving the robustness of medical diagnostic
models.

saturates, which is characterized by the formation of a helicoidal current
sheet at the boundary of the deformed plasma column, followed by a weaker
almost flat phase, in which turbulence develops. The detailed properties of
these two phases depend on the equilibrium configuration and other parameters,
in particular on the steepness of the pitch radial profile, on the presence of
an external axial magnetic field and on the amount of magnetization. These
results are relevant for high energy astrophysical sources, since current
sheets can be the sites of magnetic reconnection where particles can be
accelerated to relativistic energies and give rise to the observed radiation.

disruptive, modern networks in turn provide Fast ReRoute (FRR) mechanisms to

performance until the slower convergence protocols kick in. The fast failover
routes commonly involve unnecessary loops and detours, disturbing other traffic
while causing costly packet loss.
  In this paper, we make a case for augmenting FRR mechanisms to avoid such

fashion, avoiding costly detours and decreasing link load. ShortCut achieves
this by leveraging data plane programmability: when a loop is locally observed,
it can be removed by short-cutting the respective route parts. As such,
ShortCut is topology-independent and agnostic to the type of FRR currently
deployed. Our first experimental simulations show that ShortCut can outperform

real-world applications since group label annotations are expensive and can
conflict with privacy issues. In this paper, we consider a more practical
scenario, dubbed as Algorithmic Group Fairness with the Partially annotated
Group labels (Fair-PG). We observe that the existing methods to achieve group
fairness perform even worse than the vanilla training, which simply uses full
data only with target labels, under Fair-PG. To address this problem, we
propose a simple Confidence-based Group Label assignment (CGL) strategy that is
readily applicable to any fairness-aware learning method. CGL utilizes an
auxiliary group classifier to assign pseudo group labels, where random labels
are assigned to low confident samples. We first theoretically show that our
method design is better than the vanilla pseudo-labeling strategy in terms of
fairness criteria. Then, we empirically show on several benchmark datasets that
by combining CGL and the state-of-the-art fairness-aware in-processing methods,
the target accuracies and the fairness metrics can be jointly improved compared
to the baselines. Furthermore, we convincingly show that CGL enables to
naturally augment the given group-labeled dataset with external target

scaffolding is employed, instructors provide learners with support throughout
their autonomous learning process. We hypothesize that the usage of scaffolding
techniques within a search system can be an effective way to help learners
achieve their learning objectives whilst searching. As such, this paper
investigates the incorporation of scaffolding into a search system employing
three different strategies (as well as a control condition): (I) AQE_{SC}, the
automatic expansion of user queries with relevant subtopics; (ii) CURATED_{SC},
the presenting of a manually curated static list of relevant subtopics on the
search engine result page; and (iii) FEEDBACK_{SC}, which projects real-time
feedback about a user's exploration of the topic space on top of the
CURATED_{SC} visualization. To investigate the effectiveness of these
approaches with respect to human learning, we conduct a user study (N=126)
where participants were tasked with searching and learning about topics such as
`genetically modified organisms'. We find that (I) the introduction of the
proposed scaffolding methods does not significantly improve learning gains.
However, (ii) it does significantly impact search behavior. Furthermore, (iii)
immediate feedback of the participants' learning leads to undesirable user
behavior, with participants focusing on the feedback gauges instead of
learning.

self-supervised learning method. Most successful approaches are based on Noise
Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as
positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives,
that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn
from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good
data representation should contain relations, or semantic similarity, between
the instances. Contrastive learning implicitly learns relations but considering
all negatives as noise harms the quality of the learned relations. To
circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning
using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive
Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive learning one.
Instead of hard classifying positives and negatives, we estimate from one view
of a batch a continuous distribution to push or pull instances based on their
semantic similarities. This target similarity distribution is sharpened to
eliminate noisy relations. The model predicts for each instance, from another
view, the target distribution while contrasting its positive with negatives.
Experimental results show that SCE is Top-1 on the ImageNet linear evaluation
protocol at 100 pretraining epochs with 72.1% accuracy and is competitive with
state-of-the-art algorithms by reaching 75.4% for 200 epochs with multi-crop.
We also show that SCE is able to generalize to several tasks. Source code is

leveraging machine learning in ways that inform theoretical calculations of jet

identify optimally discriminating observables that are in principle calculable

our methodology using Monte Carlo event generators, where we find that
important information about jet quenching is contained not only in hard
splittings but also in soft emissions and IRC-unsafe physics inside the jet.

on the second moments of the relevant series (e.g., of the regressors and

The nuisance parameters entering the fixed-b limiting distribution can be

larger than that of HAR tests based on HAC estimators under conventional

standard physics, they are expected to lie within a few hundred megaparsecs
from us. Indeed, over cosmological distances cosmic rays lose energy to
interactions with background photons, at a rate depending on their mass number
and energy and properties of photonuclear interactions and photon backgrounds.
The universe is not homogeneous at such scales, hence the distribution of the
arrival directions of cosmic rays is expected to reflect the inhomogeneities in
the distribution of galaxies; the shorter the energy loss lengths, the stronger
the expected anisotropies. Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields can blur
and distort the picture, but the magnitudes of the largest-scale anisotropies,
namely the dipole and quadrupole moments, are the most robust to their effects.
Measuring them with no bias regardless of any higher-order multipoles is not
possible except with full-sky coverage. In this work, we achieve this in three
energy ranges (approximately 8--16 EeV, 16--32 EeV, and 32--$\infty$ EeV) by
combining surface-detector data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory until
2020 and at the Telescope Array (TA) until 2019, before the completion of the

applied to this challenge, they cannot identify important non-linear
relationships. Thus, a self-supervised means of identifying non-linear
relationships between neural dynamics and behavior, in order to compute neural
representations, remains an important open problem. To address this challenge,
we generated a new multimodal dataset consisting of the spontaneous behaviors
generated by fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster -- a popular model organism
in neuroscience research. The dataset includes 3D markerless motion capture
data from six camera views of the animal generating spontaneous actions, as
well as synchronously acquired two-photon microscope images capturing the
activity of descending neuron populations that are thought to drive actions.
Standard contrastive learning and unsupervised domain adaptation techniques
struggle to learn neural action representations (embeddings computed from the
neural data describing action labels) due to large inter-animal differences in
both neural and behavioral modalities. To overcome this deficiency, we
developed simple yet effective augmentations that close the inter-animal domain
gap, allowing us to extract behaviorally relevant, yet domain agnostic,

VQAs can maintain quantum advantage under the intrinsic noise of the NISQ
devices, which deteriorates the quantumness. Here we propose a measure, called
fermionic nonlinearity, to quantify the classical simulatability of quantum
circuits designed for simulating fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, we
construct a Monte Carlo type classical algorithm based on the classical
simulatability of fermionic linear optics, whose sampling overhead is
characterized by the fermionic nonlinearity. As a demonstration of these
techniques, we calculate the upper bound of the fermionic nonlinearity of a
rotation gate generated by four fermionic modes under the dephasing noise.
Moreover, we estimate the sampling costs of the unitary coupled cluster singles

noise. We find that, depending on the error probability and atomic spacing,
there are regions where the fermionic nonlinearity becomes very small or unity,
and hence the circuits are classically simulatable. We believe that our method

K7--M0 dwarf star TOI-1238 were announced by TESS. We aim to validate their
planetary nature using precise radial velocities (RV) taken with the CARMENES
spectrograph. We obtained 55 CARMENES RV data that span 11 months. For a better
characterization of the parent star's activity, we also collected
contemporaneous optical photometric observations and retrieved archival
photometry from the literature. We performed a combined TESS+CARMENES
photometric and spectroscopic analysis by including Gaussian processes and
Keplerian orbits to account for the stellar activity and planetary signals
simultaneously. We estimate that TOI-1238 has a rotation period of 40 $\pm$ 5 d
based on photometric and spectroscopic data. The combined analysis confirms the
discovery of two transiting planets, TOI-1238 b and c, with orbital periods of
$0.764597^{+0.000013}_{-0.000011}$ d and $3.294736^{+0.000034}_{-0.000036}$ d,

$2.11^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ R$_{\oplus}$. They orbit their parent star at semimajor
axes of 0.0137$\pm$0.0004 au and 0.036$\pm$0.001 au, respectively. The two
planets are placed on opposite sides of the radius valley for M dwarfs and lie
between the star and the inner border of TOI-1238's habitable zone. The inner
super-Earth TOI-1238 b is one of the densest ultra-short-period planets ever
discovered ($\rho=11.7^{+4.2}_{-3.4}$ g $\rm cm^{-3}$). The CARMENES data also
reveal the presence of an outer, non-transiting, more massive companion with an
orbital period and radial velocity amplitude of $\geq$600 d and $\geq$70 m
s$^{-1}$, which implies a likely mass of $M \geq 2 \sqrt{1-e^2}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$

defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the
$3$-dimensional space seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\""odinger, Lorentz,
and Einstein. This continues to be seen as an important problem in the
foundations of quantum mechanics even today. Despite this, in Phys. Rev. A 100,
042115 (2019) (arXiv:1906.12229) it was shown that it is possible to represent
the wavefunction as classical fields on space or spacetime, although in a
rather complicated way, meant as a proof of concept.
  But in this article it will be shown that the wavefunction already is a
genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction has
no qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in the
objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. This will be shown
to be true also in Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. The relation with the
classification of quantum particles by the representations of the spacetime
isometries realized by Wigner and Bargmann is discussed. It is argued that
overwhelming empirical support already shows that the wavefunction is an object
on space.

In this paper, we propose a novel medical image classification algorithm,
called Weakly-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (WSGAN), which only
uses a small number of real images without labels to generate fake images or
mask images to enlarge the sample size of the training set. First, we combine
with MixMatch to generate pseudo labels for the fake images and unlabeled
images to do the classification. Second, contrastive learning and
self-attention mechanism are introduced into the proposed problem to enhance
the classification accuracy. Third, the problem of mode collapse is well
addressed by cyclic consistency loss. Finally, we design global and local
classifiers to complement each other with the key information needed for
classification. The experimental results on four medical image datasets show
that WSGAN can obtain relatively high learning performance by using few labeled
and unlabeled data. For example, the classification accuracy of WSGAN is 11%
higher than that of the second-ranked MIXMATCH with 100 labeled images and 1000
unlabeled images on the OCT dataset. In addition, we also conduct ablation

pre-processing in $z\sim1$ clusters by analysing the infalling galaxy
population in the outskirts of 15 galaxy clusters at $0.8<z<1.4$ drawn from the
GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys. We find significant differences between the
infalling galaxies and a control sample; in particular, an excess of massive
quiescent galaxies in the infalling region. These massive infalling galaxies
likely reside in larger dark matter haloes than similar-mass control galaxies
because they have twice as many satellite galaxies. Furthermore, these
satellite galaxies are distributed in an NFW profile with a larger scale radius
compared to the satellites of the control galaxies. Based on these findings, we
conclude that it may not be appropriate to use 'field' galaxies as a substitute
for infalling pre-cluster galaxies when calculating the efficiency and mass
dependency of environmental quenching in high redshift clusters. By comparing
the quiescent fraction of infalling galaxies at $1<R/R_{200}<3$ to the cluster
sample ($R/R_{200}<1$) we find that almost all quiescent galaxies with masses
$>10^{11}M_{\odot}$ were quenched prior to infall, whilst up to half of lower
mass galaxies were environmentally quenched after passing the virial radius.
This means most of the massive quiescent galaxies in $z\sim1$ clusters were
self-quenched or pre-processed prior to infall.

dynamics of quantum optics systems, to simplify the system Hamiltonian through
neglecting certain modes that are driven strongly or couple weakly with other
modes. While in practical quantum systems, the quantum correlations between
different modes might lead to unanticipated quantum effects and lead to
significantly distinct system dynamics. Here, we provide a general and
systematic theoretical framework based on the perturbation theory in company
with the MFT to capture these quantum effects. The form of nonlinear
dissipation and parasitic Hamiltonian are predicted, which scales inversely
with the nonlinear coupling rate. Furthermore, the indicator is also proposed
as a measure of the accuracy of mean-field treatment. Our theory is applied to
the example of quantum frequency conversion, in which mean-field treatment is
commonly applied, to test its limitation under strong pump and large coupling
strength. The analytical results show excellent agreement with the numerical
simulations. Our work clearly reveals the attendant quantum effects under
mean-field treatment and provides a more precise theoretical framework to

and time-reversible due to absence of nonlinear effects. For example, if the
fluid is sheared by its boundary motion that is subsequently reversed, then all
the fluid elements return to their initial positions. Consequently, mixing in
microchannels happens solely due to molecular diffusion and is very slow. Here,
we show, numerically, that the introduction of a single, freely-floating,
flexible filament in a time-periodic linear shear flow can break reversibility
and give rise to chaos due to elastic nonlinearities, if the bending rigidity
of the filament is within a carefully chosen range. Within this range, not only
the shape of the filament is spatiotemporally chaotic, but also the flow is an
efficient mixer. Overall, we find five dynamical phases: the shape of a stiff
filament is time-invariant -- either straight or buckled; it undergoes a
period-two bifurcation as the filament is made softer; becomes spatiotemporally
chaotic for even softer filaments but, surprisingly, the chaos is suppressed if
bending rigidity is decreased further.

performance for time series data due to the following reasons. First, they
mainly rely on large-scale dataset (i.e., ImageNet) for the source pretraining,
which is not applicable for time-series data. Second, they ignore the temporal
dimension on the feature space of the source and target domains during the
domain alignment step. Last, most of prior UDA methods can only align the

design a self-supervised learning module that utilizes forecasting as an

we propose a novel autoregressive domain adaptation technique that incorporates
temporal dependency of both source and target features during domain alignment.
Finally, we develop an ensemble teacher model to align the class-wise
distribution in the target domain via a confident pseudo labeling approach.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world time series
applications with 30 cross-domain scenarios. Results demonstrate that our

long-distance sensing device. The complicated underwater environment, such as
noise interference, low target intensity or background dynamics, has brought
many negative effects on sonar imaging. Among them, the problem of nonlinear
intensity is extremely prevalent. It is also known as the anisotropy of
acoustic sensor imaging, that is, when autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)
carry sonar to detect the same target from different angles, the intensity
variation between image pairs is sometimes very large, which makes the
traditional matching algorithm almost ineffective. However, image matching is
the basis of comprehensive tasks such as navigation, positioning, and mapping.
Therefore, it is very valuable to obtain robust and accurate matching results.
This paper proposes a combined matching method based on phase information and
deep convolution features. It has two outstanding advantages: one is that the
deep convolution features could be used to measure the similarity of the local
and global positions of the sonar image; the other is that local feature
matching could be performed at the key target position of the sonar image. This
method does not need complex manual designs, and completes the matching task of
nonlinear intensity sonar images in a close end-to-end manner. Feature matching
experiments are carried out on the deep-sea sonar images captured by AUVs, and

identification, security becomes a major concern to their deployment in
safety-critical systems. Since the accuracy and robustness of deep learning
models are primarily attributed from the purity of the training samples,
therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial
attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations
to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously
confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. What is so special in the
slightest intelligent perturbations or noise additions over normal images that
it leads to catastrophic classifications by the deep neural networks? Using
statistical hypothesis testing, we find that Conditional Variational
AutoEncoders (CVAE) are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image
perturbations. In this paper, we show how CVAEs can be effectively used to
detect adversarial attacks on image classification networks. We demonstrate our
results over MNIST, CIFAR-10 dataset and show how our method gives comparable
performance to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversaries while not
getting confused with noisy images, where most of the existing methods falter.

the first clinical signs of a serious neurological disorder. Thus, rapid
recognition and treatment are necessary to prevent serious fatalities. The use
of electroencephalography (EEG) in the field of neurology allows precise
diagnosis of several medical conditions. However, interpreting EEG signals
needs the attention of highly specialized staff since the infant brain is
developmentally immature during the neonatal period. Detecting seizures on time
could potentially prevent the negative effects on the neurocognitive
development of the infants. In recent years, neonatal seizure detection using
machine learning algorithms have been gaining traction. Since there is a need
for the classification of bio-signals to be computationally inexpensive in the
case of seizure detection, this research presents a machine learning (ML) based
architecture that operates with comparable predictive performance as previous
models but with minimum level configuration. The proposed classifier was
trained and tested on a public dataset of NICU seizures recorded at the
Helsinki University Hospital. Our architecture achieved a best sensitivity of
87%, which is 6% more than that of the standard ML model chosen in this study.
The model size of the ML classifier is optimized to just 4.84 KB with minimum
prediction time of 182.61 milliseconds, thus enabling it to be deployed on
wearable ultra-edge devices for quick and accurate response and obviating the
need for cloud-based and other such exhaustive computational methods.

surface processes. However, cloud contamination and the tradeoff between the
spatial and temporal resolutions greatly impede the access to high-quality
thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data. Despite the massive efforts made to
solve these dilemmas, it is still difficult to generate LST estimates with
concurrent spatial completeness and a high spatio-temporal resolution. Land
surface models (LSMs) can be used to simulate gapless LST with a high temporal
resolution, but this usually comes with a low spatial resolution. In this
paper, we present an integrated temperature fusion framework for
satellite-observed and LSM-simulated LST data to map gapless LST at a 60-m
spatial resolution and half-hourly temporal resolution. The global linear model
(GloLM) model and the diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) model are
respectively performed as preprocessing steps for sensor and temporal
normalization between the different LST data. The Landsat LST, Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, and Community Land Model
Version 5.0 (CLM 5.0)-simulated LST are then fused using a filter-based
spatio-temporal integrated fusion model. Evaluations were implemented in an
urban-dominated region (the city of Wuhan in China) and a natural-dominated
region (the Heihe River Basin in China), in terms of accuracy, spatial
variability, and diurnal temporal dynamics. Results indicate that the fused LST
is highly consistent with actual Landsat LST data (in situ LST measurements),
in terms of a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (0.97-0.99), a mean
absolute error of 0.71-0.98 K (0.82-3.17 K), and a root-mean-square error of

buildings is not only essential for urban dynamic monitoring but also necessary
for suburban construction inspection. Nowadays, accurate building extraction
from remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex background
and diverse appearances of buildings. The convolutional neural network (CNN)
based building extraction methods, although increased the accuracy
significantly, are criticized for their inability for modelling global
dependencies. Thus, this paper applies the Vision Transformer for building
extraction. However, the actual utilization of the Vision Transformer often
comes with two limitations. First, the Vision Transformer requires more GPU
memory and computational costs compared to CNNs. This limitation is further
magnified when encountering large-sized inputs like fine-resolution remote
sensing images. Second, spatial details are not sufficiently preserved during
the feature extraction of the Vision Transformer, resulting in the inability
for fine-grained building segmentation. To handle these issues, we propose a
novel Vision Transformer (BuildFormer), with a dual-path structure.
Specifically, we design a spatial-detailed context path to encode rich spatial
details and a global context path to capture global dependencies. Besides, we
develop a window-based linear multi-head self-attention to make the complexity
of the multi-head self-attention linear with the window size, which strengthens
the global context extraction by using large windows and greatly improves the
potential of the Vision Transformer in processing large-sized remote sensing
images. The proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance (75.74% IoU) on
the Massachusetts building dataset. Code will be available.

Equally important is the findings of cross-structural governance for
