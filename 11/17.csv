exists as an electron donor that causes an observed negative shift in the drain

Normally, hydrogen is thought to create shallow electronic states just below
the conduction band mobility edge, with the donor ionization state controlled
by equilibrium thermodynamics involving the position of the Fermi level with
respect to the donor ionization energy. However, hydrogen does not behave as a
normal donor as revealed by the subgap density of states (DoS) measured by the
photoconduction response of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs to within 0.3 eV of the CBM

edge growing at the same rate that $\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$ transfer curve
measurements suggest that hydrogen was incorporated into the channel layer.
Such hydrogen donor behavior in a-IGZO is anomalous and can be understood as
follows: Non-bonded hydrogen ionization precedes its incorporation into the
a-IGZO network as a bonded species. Ionized hydrogen bonds to a charged
oxygen-on-an-oxygen-site anion, resulting in the formation of a defect complex
denoted herein as, $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$. Formation of an

extending the algorithm to accept feedback from this larger group of humans,
the trainers, while also estimating each trainer's reliability. We show how
aggregating feedback from multiple trainers improves the total feedback's

approach addresses the case of some of the trainers being adversarial.
Secondly, having access to the information about each trainer reliability
provides a second layer of robustness and offers valuable information for
people managing the whole system to improve the overall trust in the system. It
offers an actionable tool for improving the feedback collection process or
modifying the reward function design if needed. We empirically show that our

high basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation between the index and
individual farm yields, has limited its adoption to date. Basis risk arises
from two fundamental sources: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance
zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design
risk). Whereas previous work has focused almost exclusively on design risk, a
theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of zonal risk is still
lacking.
  Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, using the
case of maize yields in Kenya. Our first contribution is to derive a formal
decomposition of basis risk, providing a simple upper bound on the insurable
basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone. Our second
contribution is to provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of the
extent of zonal versus design risk. To do so, we use satellite estimates of
yields at 10m resolution across Kenya, and investigate the effect of using
smaller zones versus using different indices. Our results show a strong local
heterogeneity in yields, underscoring the challenge of implementing index
insurance in smallholder systems, and the potential benefits of low-cost yield
measurement approaches that can enable more local definitions of insurance
zones.

representing a small quantum bath, that interacts locally with an Anderson
insulator with a finite density of localized particles. Using static Hartree
approximation to obtain an effective disorder strength, we formulate an
analytic criterion for the perturbative stability of the localization. Next, we
use an approximate dynamical Hartree method and the quasi-exact time-evolved
block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the dynamics of the system. We find
that the dynamical Hartree approach which completely ignores entanglement
between the impurity and localized particles predicts the delocalization of the
system. In contrast, the full numerical simulation of the unitary dynamics with
TEBD suggests the stability of localization on numerically accessible
timescales. Finally, using an extension of the density matrix renormalization
group algorithm to excited states (DMRG-X), we approximate the highly excited
eigenstates of the system. We find that the impurity remains localized in the
eigenstates and entanglement is enhanced in a finite region around the position
of the impurity, confirming the dynamical predictions. Dynamics and the DMRG-X

With the help of Deep Learning models, pneumonia and covid-19 can be detected
instantly from Chest X-rays or CT scans. This way, the process of diagnosing
Pneumonia/Covid-19 can be made more efficient and widespread. In this paper, we
aim to elicit, explain, and evaluate, qualitatively and quantitatively, major

community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), viral pneumonia, and covid-19 from images
of chest X-rays and CT scans. Being a systematic review, the focus of this
paper lies in explaining deep learning model architectures which have either
been modified or created from scratch for the task at hand wiwth focus on
generalizability. For each model, this paper answers the question of why the
model is designed the way it is, the challenges that a particular model
overcomes, and the tradeoffs that come with modifying a model to the required
specifications. A quantitative analysis of all models described in the paper is
also provided to quantify the effectiveness of different models with a similar

cost: there is an order of magnitude price difference between ""cloud-grade""

\emph{At the system level}, it relies on a re-developed communication stack for

communication. \emph{At the application level}, it provides \emph{seamless,
parameter-free} integration with popular frameworks, so that end-users do not
have to modify training recipes, nor significant training code. This is
complemented by a \emph{layer-wise adaptive compression} technique which
dynamically balances compression gains with accuracy preservation. CGX
integrates with popular ML frameworks, providing up to 3X speedups for
multi-GPU nodes based on commodity hardware, and order-of-magnitude
improvements in the multi-node setting, with negligible impact on accuracy.

of the arrays is essential for the energy efficiency of the system. In existing
works, array placement has been optimized mostly based on common channel
models, which rely on a given statistical distribution and Euclidean distance
between user locations and arrays. These models are justified if applied to
sufficiently large cells, where the statistical description of the channel is
expected to fit its empirical condition. However, with the advent of small
cells, this is no longer the case. The channel propagation condition becomes
highly environment-specific. This paper investigates array placement
optimization with different ways of modeling the propagation conditions taking
the environment information (e.g., buildings) into account. We capture the
environment information via a graph. Two shortest path-based propagation models
are introduced based on the graph. We validate the performance of the models
with a ray-tracing simulator considering different signal coverage levels. The
simulation results demonstrate that higher energy efficiency is achieved by
using the array placements found via the proposed models compared to a

method deploys variational mode decomposition (VMD) and a generalised
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model for signal
processing and feature extraction. To this end, VMD decomposes the response
signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Afterwards, the GARCH model is
utilised to represent the statistics of IMFs. The model coefficients of IMFs
construct the primary feature vector. Kernel-based principal component analysis
(PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are utilised to reduce the
redundancy of the primary features by mapping them to the new feature space.
The informative features are then fed separately into three supervised
classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN),
and fine tree. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two
experimentally scaled models in terms of linear and nonlinear damage
assessment. Kurtosis and ARCH tests proved the compatibility of the GARCH
model.

branch of the flow curve, in which the flow profile of the flowing band is set
by the applied shear rate $\dot \gamma$ instead of $\dot \gamma_c$. As a
consequence, the material slips at the walls with a velocity that shows a

improved estimates of the state or parameters of a dynamical system of
interest. The data assimilation procedures used in many geoscience
applications, such as numerical weather forecasting, are variants of the
our-dimensional variational (4D-Var) algorithm. The cost of solving the
underlying 4D-Var optimization problem is dominated by the cost of repeated
forward and adjoint model runs. This motivates substituting the evaluations of
the physical model and its adjoint by fast, approximate surrogate models.
Neural networks offer a promising approach for the data-driven creation of
surrogate models. The accuracy of the surrogate 4D-Var solution depends on the
accuracy with each the surrogate captures both the forward and the adjoint
model dynamics. We formulate and analyze several approaches to incorporate
adjoint information into the construction of neural network surrogates. The
resulting networks are tested on unseen data and in a sequential data
assimilation problem using the Lorenz-63 system. Surrogates constructed using
adjoint information demonstrate superior performance on the 4D-Var data

continuous-aperture MIMO (CAP-MIMO) is reinvestigated to achieve improved
communication performance with limited antenna apertures. Unlike the classical
MIMO composed of discrete antennas, CAP-MIMO has a quasi-continuous antenna
surface, which is expected to generate any current distribution (i.e., pattern)
and induce controllable spatial electromagnetic waves. In this way, the
information is directly modulated on the electromagnetic waves, which makes it
promising to approach the ultimate capacity of finite apertures. The pattern
design is the key factor to determine the communication performance of
CAP-MIMO, but it has not been well studied in the literature. In this paper, we
develop the pattern-division multiplexing (PDM) to design the patterns for
CAP-MIMO. Specifically, we first study and model a typical multi-user CAP-MIMO
system, which allows us to formulate the sum-rate maximization problem. Then,
we develop a general PDM technique to transform the design of the continuous
pattern functions to the design of their projection lengths on finite
orthogonal bases, which can overcome the challenge of functional programmings.
Utilizing PDM, we further propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) based
pattern design scheme to solve the formulated sum-rate maximization problem.
Simulation results show that, the sum-rate achieved by the proposed scheme is
about 300% higher than that achieved by the benchmark scheme, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed PDM for CAP-MIMO.

  Invariant Training",,,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The goal of speech separation is to extract multiple speech sources from a
single microphone recording. Recently, with the advancement of deep learning
and availability of large datasets, speech separation has been formulated as a
supervised learning problem. These approaches aim to learn discriminative
patterns of speech, speakers, and background noise using a supervised learning
algorithm, typically a deep neural network. A long-lasting problem in
supervised speech separation is finding the correct label for each separated
speech signal, referred to as label permutation ambiguity. Permutation
ambiguity refers to the problem of determining the output-label assignment
between the separated sources and the available single-speaker speech labels.
Finding the best output-label assignment is required for calculation of
separation error, which is later used for updating parameters of the model.
Recently, Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) has been shown to be a promising
solution in handling the label ambiguity problem. However, the overconfident
choice of the output-label assignment by PIT results in a sub-optimal trained
model. In this work, we propose a probabilistic optimization framework to
address the inefficiency of PIT in finding the best output-label assignment.
Our proposed method entitled trainable Soft-minimum PIT is then employed on the
same Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture used in Permutation Invariant
Training (PIT) speech separation method. The results of our experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms conventional PIT speech separation
significantly (p-value $ < 0.01$) by +1dB in Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR)
and +1.5dB in Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR).

each group receives in the council to minimise the expected quadratic deviation
of the council vote from a hypothetical referendum of the overall population.
The mean-field model exhibits different behaviour depending on the intensity of
interactions between voters. When interaction is weak, we obtain optimal
weights given by the sum of a constant term equal for all groups and a term
proportional to the square root of the group's population. When interaction is
strong, the optimal weights are in general not uniquely determined. Indeed,
when all groups are positively coupled, any assignation of weights is optimal.
For two competing clusters of groups, the difference in total weights must be a
specific number, but the assignation of weights within each cluster is
arbitrary. We also obtain conditions for both interaction regimes under which
it is impossible to reach the minimal democracy deficit due to the negativity
of weights.

that can be activated at finite temperature in condensed matter systems with
gapless fermions. The chiral vortical effect (CVE) is an anomalous chiral
current along a rotation axis, expressed in terms of a gravimagnetic field and
a gravitational anomaly. Another one, the chiral torsional effect (CTE), arises
from hydrodynamically independent frame fields and connection. We discuss the
relation of CVE, CTE and gravitational anomalies for relativistic fermions from
the perspective of torsion and the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The DC transport
coefficients of the two anomalies are found to be closely related depending
whether or not torsion is non-zero in the hydrodynamics. The relativistic
anomaly from torsion is well defined if instead of an ultraviolet divergent
term, the chemical potential or temperature enter. The anomaly term is 2nd
order in gradients and contributes in linear response for CTE, implying also
the same for CVE. As an example, we consider chiral $p+ip$ Weyl
superfluids/conductors. At low-energies, the system is effectively relativistic
along a special anisotropy axis. The hydrodynamics is governed by two
velocities, normal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_n$ and superfluid velocity
$\boldsymbol{v}_s$. The two anomalies follow from the normal component rotation
and the dependence of the momentum density on the superfluid velocity (order
parameter). In the CVE the chiral current is produced by solid body rotation of
the normal component with (angular) velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_n=
\boldsymbol\Omega \times \boldsymbol{r}$. In the CTE, a chiral current is
produced the vorticity $\nabla \times \boldsymbol{v}_s$, which in the
low-energy effective theory is torsion. In equilibrium, $\langle\langle \nabla
\times \boldsymbol{v_s}\rangle\rangle= 2\boldsymbol\Omega$ on average and the
two anomaly currents cancel.

is recognized as an efficiency bottleneck by the community. To cope with this
decision-making problem, we develop and evaluate the open-source, Machine
Learning-based tool SCAN (SCattering Ai aNalysis) to provide recommendations on

models and a simulation tool implemented in the SasView package for generating
a well defined set of datasets. Our evaluation shows that SCAN delivers an
overall accuracy of 95%-97%. The XGBoost Classifier has been identified as the
most accurate method with a good balance between accuracy and training time.
With eleven predefined structural models for common nanostructures and an easy

accelerate the SAXS data analysis workflow.

established theories of planet formation. PDS 70 is one of the few cases where
robust evidence favours the presence of two planetary mass companions inside
the gap of the transition disk. Those planets are believed to be going through
the last stages of accretion from the protoplanetary disk, a process likely
mediated by a circumplanetary disk (CPD). We aim to develop a three dimensional
radiative transfer model for the dust component of the PDS 70 system which
reproduces the system's global features observed at two different wavelengths:
855 $\mu\, \mathrm{m}$ with ALMA and 1.25 $\mu\, \mathrm{m}$ with VLT/SPHERE.
We use this model to investigate the physical properties of the planetary
companion PDS 70 c and its potential circumplanetary disk. We select initial
values for the physical properties of the planet and CPD through appropriate
assumptions about the nature and evolutionary stage of the object. We modify
iteratively the properties of the protoplanetary disk until the predictions
retrieved from the model are consistent with both data sets. We provide a model
that jointly explains the global features of the PDS 70 system seen in
submillimeter and polarised-scattered light. Our model suggests that spatial
segregation of dust grains is present in the protoplanetary disk. The
submillimeter modelling of the PDS 70 c source favours the presence of an
optically thick CPD and places an upper limit to its dust mass of 0.7
$M_\oplus$. Furthermore, analysis of the thermal structure of the CPD
demonstrates that the planet luminosity is the dominant heating mechanism of
dust grains inside 0.6 au from the planet while heating by stellar photons
dominates at larger planetocentric distances.

Comparing with analysing the scalar-tensor theory directly, it is simpler to
map the spatially covariant gravity to the generally covariant scalar-tensor
theory using the gauge recovering procedures. In order to ensure the resulting
scalar-tensor theory to be ghostfree absolutely, i.e., no matter if the unitary

required. We develop a method of covariant 3+1 correspondence, which map the
spatially covariant gravity to the scalar-tensor theory in 3+1 decomposed form
without fixing any coordinates. Then the degeneracy conditions to remove the
extra degrees of freedom can be found easily. As an illustration of this

only a few stiff parameter combinations that have strong effects, while the
other sloppy directions are irrelevant. This suggest an algorithm that
efficiently explores the space of parameters by primarily moving along the

and show that it recovers all possible dynamics of the unemployment rate. The
application of this method to Agent-based Models may lead to a more thorough
and robust understanding of their features, and provide enhanced parameter
sensitivity analyses. Several promising paths for future research are

tweets collected with COVID-19-related hashtags is used for this study. Five
methods, from earlier to new methods, are selected among the embedding methods:
Word2Vec, fastText, GloVe, BERT and T5. Five clustering methods are
investigated in this paper that are: k-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, spectral and
Jarvis-Patrick. Euclidian distance and Cosine distance as the most important
distance metrics in this field are also examined. First, more than 7,500 tests
are performed to tune the parameters. Then, all the different combinations of
embedding methods with distance metrics and clustering methods are investigated
by silhouette metric. The number of these combinations is 50 cases. First, the
results of these 50 tests are examined. Then, the rank of each method is taken
into account in all the tests of that method. Finally, the major variables of
the research (embedding methods, distance metrics and clustering methods) are
studied separately. Averaging is performed over the control variables to
neutralize their effect. The experimental results show that T5 strongly
outperforms other embedding methods in terms of silhouette metric. In terms of
distance metrics, cosine distance is weakly better. DBSCAN is also superior to
other methods in terms of clustering methods.

'change probabilities' for describing fracture roughness. In order to detect
and visualize anisotropy of rock joint surfaces, the roughness of
one-dimensional profiles taken in different directions is quantified. The
central quantifiers, 'change probabilities', are based on counting monotone
changes in discretizations of a profile. These probabilities, which are usually
varying with the scale, can be reinterpreted as scale-dependent Hurst
exponents. For a large class of Gaussian stochastic processes change
probabilities are shown to be directly related to the classical Hurst exponent,
which generalizes a relationship known for fractional Brownian motion. While
being related to this classical roughness measure, the proposed method is more
generally applicable, increasing therefore the flexibility of modeling and
investigating surface profiles. In particular, it allows a quick and efficient
visualization and detection of roughness anisotropy and scale dependence of
roughness.

crime. New York State's Bail Elimination Act went into effect on January 1,
2020, eliminating money bail and pretrial detention for nearly all misdemeanor
and nonviolent felony defendants. Our analysis of effects on aggregate crime
rates after the reform informs the understanding of bail reform and general
deterrence. We conduct a synthetic control analysis for a comparative case
study of impact of bail reform. We focus on synthetic control analysis of
post-intervention changes in crime for assault, theft, burglary, robbery, and
drug crimes, constructing a dataset from publicly reported crime data of 27
large municipalities. Our findings, including placebo checks and other
robustness checks, show that for assault, theft, and drug crimes, there is no
significant impact of bail reform on crime; for burglary and robbery, we
similarly have null findings but the synthetic control is also more variable so
these are deemed less conclusive.

  and Constant-Round",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  From the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers,
we build the first $\epsilon$-simulatable two-party computation (2PC) against
quantum polynomial-time (QPT) adversaries that is both constant-round and
black-box (for both the construction and security reduction). A recent work by
Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa (FOCS'21) shows that post-quantum 2PC with
standard simulation-based security is impossible in constant rounds, unless
either $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$ or relying on non-black-box
simulation. The $\epsilon$-simulatability we target is a relaxation of the
standard simulation-based security that allows for an arbitrarily small
noticeable simulation error $\epsilon$. Moreover, when quantum communication is
allowed, we can further weaken the assumption to post-quantum secure one-way
functions (PQ-OWFs), while maintaining the constant-round and black-box
property.
  Our techniques also yield the following set of constant-round and black-box
two-party protocols secure against QPT adversaries, only assuming black-box
access to PQ-OWFs:
  - extractable commitments for which the extractor is also an
$\epsilon$-simulator;
  - $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge commit-and-prove whose commit stage is
extractable with $\epsilon$-simulation;
  - $\epsilon$-simulatable coin-flipping;
  - $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge for $\mathbf{NP}$ for
which the knowledge extractor is also an $\epsilon$-simulator;
  - $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathbf{QMA}$.
  At the heart of the above results is a black-box extraction lemma showing how
to efficiently extract secrets from QPT adversaries while disturbing their
quantum state in a controllable manner, i.e., achieving
$\epsilon$-simulatability of the post-extraction state of the adversary.

change with time. Furthermore, we show that the developed model correctly
captures the underlying physical phenomena of fluid displacements. We simulate
oil-water flows and verify that the measured values of irreducible water and

annotations to support their own comprehension. In order to support the
documentation usage behaviors we found, we built the Adamite annotation tool,
which supports features such as multi-anchoring, annotation types, and pinning.
In our user study, we found that developers are able to create annotations that
are useful to themselves and are able to utilize annotations created by other
developers when learning a new API, with readers of the annotations completing
67% more of the task, on average, than the baseline.

generate a high-resolution (HR) HSI with higher spectral and spatial fidelity
from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. The generative adversarial network
(GAN) has proven to be an effective deep learning framework for image
super-resolution. However, the optimisation process of existing GAN-based
models frequently suffers from the problem of mode collapse, leading to the
limited capacity of spectral-spatial invariant reconstruction. This may cause
the spectral-spatial distortion on the generated HSI, especially with a large
upscaling factor. To alleviate the problem of mode collapse, this work has
proposed a novel GAN model coupled with a latent encoder (LE-GAN), which can
map the generated spectral-spatial features from the image space to the latent
space and produce a coupling component to regularise the generated samples.
Essentially, we treat an HSI as a high-dimensional manifold embedded in a
latent space. Thus, the optimisation of GAN models is converted to the problem
of learning the distributions of high-resolution HSI samples in the latent
space, making the distributions of the generated super-resolution HSIs closer
to those of their original high-resolution counterparts. We have conducted
experimental evaluations on the model performance of super-resolution and its
capability in alleviating mode collapse. The proposed approach has been tested
and validated based on two real HSI datasets with different sensors (i.e.
AVIRIS and UHD-185) for various upscaling factors and added noise levels, and
compared with the state-of-the-art super-resolution models (i.e. HyCoNet, LTTR,
BAGAN, SR- GAN, WGAN).

communities to nations, remains one of the main challenges of disease modeling.
Here, we revisit one of the largest public health efforts deployed against a
localized epidemic: the 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra
Leone. We leverage the data collected by the surveillance and contact tracing
protocols of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and other responding partners to validate a
network epidemiology framework connecting the population (incidence), community
(local forecasts), and individual (secondary infections) scales of disease
transmission. In doing so, we gain a better understanding of what brought the
EVD epidemic to an end: Reduction of introduction in new clusters (primary
cases), and not reduction in local transmission patterns (secondary
infections). We also find that the first 90 days of the epidemic contained
enough information to produce probabilistic forecasts of EVD cases; forecasts
which we show are confirmed independently by both disease surveillance and
contact tracing. Altogether, using data available two months before the start
of the international support to the local response, network epidemiology could
have inferred heterogeneity in local transmissions, the risk for superspreading
events, and probabilistic forecasts of eventual cases per community. We expect
that our framework will help connect large data collection efforts with
individual behavior, and help reduce uncertainty during health emergencies and
emerging epidemics.

marked by the advances in AI technologies, are profoundly reshaping the
industry and the society. However, down the road, a key challenge awaits us,
that is, our capability of meeting rapidly-growing scenario-specific demands is
severely limited by the cost of acquiring a commensurate amount of training
data. This difficult situation is in essence due to limitations of the
mainstream learning paradigm: we need to train a new model for each new
scenario, based on a large quantity of well-annotated data and commonly from
scratch. In tackling this fundamental problem, we move beyond and develop a new
learning paradigm named INTERN. By learning with supervisory signals from
multiple sources in multiple stages, the model being trained will develop
strong generalizability. We evaluate our model on 26 well-known datasets that
cover four categories of tasks in computer vision. In most cases, our models,
adapted with only 10% of the training data in the target domain, outperform the
counterparts trained with the full set of data, often by a significant margin.
This is an important step towards a promising prospect where such a model with
general vision capability can dramatically reduce our reliance on data, thus
expediting the adoption of AI technologies. Furthermore, revolving around our
new paradigm, we also introduce a new data system, a new architecture, and a
new benchmark, which, together, form a general vision ecosystem to support its
future development in an open and inclusive manner. See project website at

phase behavior of aqueous solutions of proteins induced by multivalent ions,
where the solution phase separates upon heating. This phenomenon is linked to
complex hydration effects that result in a net entropy gain upon phase
separation. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanism, we use all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations along with the two-phase thermodynamic method
for entropy calculation. Based on simulations of a single BSA protein in
various salt solutions (NaCl, CaCl_2, MgCl_2, and YCl_3) at temperatures (T)
ranging 283-323 K, we find that the cation-protein binding affinity increases
with T, reflecting its thermodynamic driving force to be entropic in origin. We
show that in the cation binding process, many tightly bound water molecules
from the solvation shells of a cation and the protein are released to the bulk,
resulting in entropy gain. To rationalize the LCST behavior, we calculate the
{\zeta}-potential that shows charge inversion of the protein for solutions
containing multivalent ions. The {\zeta}-potential increases with T. Performing
simulations of two BSA proteins, we demonstrate that the protein-protein
binding is mediated by multiple cation bridges and involves similar dehydration
effects that cause a large entropy gain which more than compensates for
rotational and translational entropy losses of the proteins. Thus, the LCST
behavior is entropy-driven, but the associated solvation effects are markedly
different from hydrophobic hydration. Our findings have direct implications for
tuning the phase behavior of biological and soft-matter systems, e.g., protein
condensation and crystallization.

fixed particle number even in the nonrelativistic limit. By carrying out
relativistic $3+1$d simulations, we show that these oscillons can be long-lived

important application in day-to-day activities such as accessing banking

several biometric devices are often used. Such a combined system is known as a
multimodal biometric system. This paper reports a benchmarking study carried
out within the framework of the BioSecure DS2 (Access Control) evaluation
campaign organized by the University of Surrey, involving face, fingerprint,
and iris biometrics for person authentication, targeting the application of
physical access control in a medium-size establishment with some 500 persons.
While multimodal biometrics is a well-investigated subject, there exists no
benchmark for a fusion algorithm comparison. Working towards this goal, we
designed two sets of experiments: quality-dependent and cost-sensitive
evaluation. The quality-dependent evaluation aims at assessing how well fusion
algorithms can perform under changing quality of raw images principally due to
change of devices. The cost-sensitive evaluation, on the other hand,
investigates how well a fusion algorithm can perform given restricted
computation and in the presence of software and hardware failures, resulting in
errors such as failure-to-acquire and failure-to-match. Since multiple
capturing devices are available, a fusion algorithm should be able to handle
this nonideal but nevertheless realistic scenario. In both evaluations, each
fusion algorithm is provided with scores from each biometric comparison
subsystem as well as the quality measures of both template and query data. The
response to the call of the campaign proved very encouraging, with the
submission of 22 fusion systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to benchmark quality-based multimodal fusion algorithms.

networks is remarkable and robust. In the context of how the brain learns, one
aspect of gradient descent that appears biologically difficult to realize (if
not implausible) is that its updates rely on feedback from later layers to
earlier layers through the same connections. Such bidirected links are
relatively few in brain networks, and even when reciprocal connections exist,
they may not be equi-weighted. Random Feedback Alignment (Lillicrap et al.,
2016), where the backward weights are random and fixed, has been proposed as a
bio-plausible alternative and found to be effective empirically. We investigate
how and when feedback alignment (FA) works, focusing on one of the most basic
problems with layered structure -- low-rank matrix factorization. In this
problem, given a matrix $Y_{n\times m}$, the goal is to find a low rank
factorization $Z_{n \times r}W_{r \times m}$ that minimizes the error
$\|ZW-Y\|_F$. Gradient descent solves this problem optimally. We show that FA
converges to the optimal solution when $r\ge \mbox{rank}(Y)$. We also shed
light on how FA works. It is observed empirically that the forward weight
matrices and (random) feedback matrices come closer during FA updates. Our
analysis rigorously derives this phenomenon and shows how it facilitates
convergence of FA*, a closely related variant of FA. We also show that FA can
be far from optimal when $r < \mbox{rank}(Y)$. This is the first provable
separation result between gradient descent and FA. Moreover, the
representations found by gradient descent and FA can be almost orthogonal even
when their error $\|ZW-Y\|_F$ is approximately equal. As a corollary, these
results also hold for training two-layer linear neural networks when the
training input is isotropic, and the output is a linear function of the input.

isothermal, which can lead to non-Gaussian line-of-sight velocity dispersion
(LOSVD) under anisotropic stellar orbits. However, recent observations of local
ETGs in the MASSIVE Survey reveal outer kinematic structures at $1.5
R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (effective radius) that are inconsistent with fixed
isothermal density profiles; the authors proposed varying density profiles as
an explanation. We aim to verify this conjecture and understand the influence
of stellar assembly on these kinematic features through mock ETGs in
IllustrisTNG. We create mock Integral-Field-Unit observations to extract
projected stellar kinematic features for 207 ETGs with stellar mass
$M_{\ast}\geqslant 10^{11} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in TNG100-1. The mock
observations reproduce the key outer ($1.5R_{\mathrm{eff}}$) kinematic
structures in the MASSIVE ETGs, including the puzzling positive correlation
between velocity dispersion profile outer slope $\gamma_{\mathrm{outer}}$ and
the kurtosis $h_{4}$'s gradient. We find that $h_{4}$ is uncorrelated with
stellar orbital anisotropy beyond $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$; instead we find that the
variations in $\gamma_{\mathrm{outer}}$ and outer $h_{4}$ (a good proxy for
$h_{4}$ gradient) are both driven by variations of the density profile at the
outskirts across different ETGs. These findings corroborate the proposed
conjecture and rule out velocity anisotropy as the origin of non-Gaussian outer
kinematic structure in ETGs. We also find that the outer kurtosis and
anisotropy correlate with different stellar assembly components, with the
former related to minor mergers or flyby interactions while the latter is
mainly driven by major mergers, suggesting distinct stellar assembly origins
that decorrelates the two quantities.

nonergodicity that can emerge in quantum many-body systems hosting gauge
symmetries when the initial state is prepared in a superposition of gauge
superselection sectors. Thermalization is then prevented up to all accessible
evolution times despite the model being nonintegrable and
translation-invariant. In a recent work [Halimeh, Zhao, Hauke, and Knolle,
arXiv:2111.02427], it has been shown that terms linear in the gauge-symmetry
generator stabilize disorder-free localization in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge
theories against gauge errors that couple different superselection sectors.
Here, we show in the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories that disorder-free
localization can not only be stabilized, but also \textit{enhanced} by the
addition of translation-invariant terms linear in a local $\mathbb{Z}_2$
\textit{pseudogenerator} that acts identically to the full generator in a
single superselection sector, but not necessarily outside of it. We show
analytically and numerically how this leads through the quantum Zeno effect to
the dynamical emergence of a renormalized gauge theory with an enhanced local
symmetry, which contains the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry of the ideal model,
associated with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pseudogenerator. The resulting proliferation
of superselection sectors due to this dynamically emergent gauge theory creates
an effective disorder greater than that in the original model, thereby
enhancing disorder-free localization. We demonstrate the experimental
feasibility of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pseudogenerator by providing a detailed
readily implementable experimental proposal for the observation of
disorder-free localization in a Rydberg setup.

tidal interactions or collision with the central star. We present a numerical
study of secular chaos in systems with two planets and test particles using the
ring-averaging method, with emphasis on the relationship between the planets'

secular chaos can excite extreme eccentricities on time-scales spanning several
orders of magnitude in a given system. We apply our results to the evolution of
planetary systems around white dwarfs (WDs), specifically the tidal disruption
and high-eccentricity migration of planetesimals and planets. We find that
secular chaos in a planetesimal belt driven by large ($\gtrsim 10 M_{\oplus}$),
distant ($\gtrsim 10 \, {\rm au}$) planets can sustain metal accretion onto a
WD over Gyr time-scales. We constrain the total mass of planetesimals initially
present within the chaotic zone by requiring that the predicted mass delivery
rate to the Roche limit be consistent with the observed metal accretion rates
of WDs with atmospheric pollution throughout the cooling sequence. Based on the
occurrence of long-period exoplanets and exo-asteroid belts, we conclude that
secular chaos can be a significant (perhaps dominant) channel for polluting
solitary WDs. Secular chaos can also produce short-period planets and
planetesimals around WDs in concert with various circularization mechanisms. We
discuss prospects for detecting exoplanets driving secular chaos around WDs
using direct imaging and microlensing.

observations and the characteristics of the observed lens systems. Using
simulated data, we measure the lowest detectable NFW mass at each location of
the lens plane, in the form of detailed \emph{sensitivity maps}. In summary, we
find that: (i) the lowest detectable mass $M_{\rm low}$ decreases linearly as
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases and the sensitive area is larger when
we decrease the noise; (ii) a moderate increase in angular resolution (0.07"" vs
0.09"") and pixel scale (0.01"" vs 0.04"") improves the sensitivity by on average
0.25 dex in halo mass, with more significant improvement around the most
sensitive regions; (iii) the sensitivity to low-mass objects is largest for
bright and complex lensed galaxies located inside the caustic curves and lensed
into larger Einstein rings (i.e $r_{E}\geq1.0""$). We find that for the
sensitive mock images considered in this work, the minimum mass that we can
detect at the redshift of the lens lies between $1.5\times10^{8}$ and
$3\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$. We derive analytic relations between $M_{\rm low}$,
the SNR and resolution and discuss the impact of the lensing configuration and
source structure. Our results start to fill the gap between approximate
predictions and real data and demonstrate the challenging nature of calculating
precise forecasts for gravitational imaging. In light of our findings, we
discuss possible strategies for designing strong lensing surveys and the

6.22$^{+0.03}_{-0.05}\times$10$^6$ M$_\odot$, consistent with previous

observed kinematics are caused by a collection of stellar mass BHs by modeling
an extended dark mass as a Plummer profile. The upper limit on the size scale
of the extended mass is 0.56 pc (95% confidence), which does not rule out an
extended mass. There is compelling evidence that B023-G078 is the tidally

including its high mass, two-component luminosity profile, color, metallicity

Here we explore the evolution of perturbation in this flow in the presence of
an additional force. Such a force, which is expected to be stochastic in nature
hence behaving as noise, could result from thermal fluctuations (however small
be), grain-fluid interactions, feedback from outflows in astrophysical disks,
etc. We essentially establish the evolution of nonlinear perturbation in the
presence of Coriolis and external forces, which is the modified Landau
equation. We obtain that even in the linear regime, under suitable forcing and
Reynolds number, the otherwise least stable perturbation evolves to a very
large saturated amplitude, leading to nonlinearity and plausible turbulence.
Hence, forcing essentially leads a linear stable mode to unstable. We further
show that nonlinear perturbation diverges at a shorter time-scale in the
presence of force, leading to a fast transition to turbulence. Interestingly,
the emergence of nonlinearity depends only on the force but not on the initial
amplitude of perturbation, unlike the original Landau equation-based solution.

the VIPERS and VVDS surveys, to investigate the connection between AGN activity
and physical properties of their host galaxies. The host stellar mass is
estimated through spectral energy distribution fitting with the CIGALE code,
and star formation rates are derived from the [OII]$\lambda$3727 $\r{A}$ line
luminosity. We find that 49% of the AGN host galaxies are on or above the main
sequence (MS), 40% lie in the sub-MS locus, and 11% in the quiescent locus.
Using the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 $\r{A}$ line luminosity as a proxy of the AGN
power, we find that at fixed AGN power Type II AGN host galaxies show a bimodal
behaviour: systems with host galaxy stellar mass <10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, reside
along the MS or in the starbursts locus (high-SF Type II AGN), while systems
residing in massive host-galaxies (>10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) show a lower level
of star formation (low-SF Type II AGN). At all stellar masses, the offset from
the MS is positively correlated with the AGN power. We interpret this
correlation as evidence of co-evolution between the AGN and the host, possibly
due to the availability of cold gas. In the most powerful AGN with host
galaxies below the MS we find a hint, though weak, of asymmetry in the [OIII]
line profile, likely due to outflowing gas, consistent with a scenario in which
AGN feedback removes the available gas and halts the star formation in the most
massive hosts.

$A=\{\mathrm{Cu},\mathrm{Sr},\mathrm{Nb}\}$, becomes a nematic superconductor
below $T_{c}\sim3-4\,\mathrm{K}$. The associated electronic nematic director is
described by an angle $\alpha$ and is experimentally manifested in the
elliptical shape of the in-plane critical magnetic field $H_{c2}$. Because of
the threefold rotational symmetry of the lattice, $\alpha$ is expected to align
with one of three high-symmetry directions corresponding to the in-plane
nearest-neighbor bonds, consistent with a $Z_{3}$-Potts nematic transition.
Here, we show that the nematic coupling to the acoustic phonons, which makes
the nematic correlation length tend to diverge along certain directions only,
can fundamentally alter this phenomenology in trigonal lattices. Compared to
hexagonal lattices, the former possesses a sixth independent elastic constant
$c_{14}$ due to the fact that the in-plane shear strain doublet
$(\epsilon_{xx}-\epsilon_{yy},-2\epsilon_{xy})$ and the out-of-plane shear
strain doublet $(2\epsilon_{yz},-2\epsilon_{xz})$ transform as the same
irreducible representation. We find that, when $c_{14}$ overcomes a threshold
value, which is expected to be the case in doped $\mathrm{Bi_{2}Se_{3}}$, the
nematic director $\alpha$ unlocks from the high-symmetry directions due to the
competition between the quadratic phonon-mediated interaction and the cubic
nematic anharmonicity. This implies the breaking of the residual in-plane
twofold rotational symmetry ($C_{2x}$), resulting in a triclinic phase. We
discuss the implications of these findings to the structure of nematic domains
and to the shape of the in-plane $H_{c2}$ in $A_{x}\mathrm{Bi_{2}Se_{3}}$, and
to presence of nodes inside the superconducting state.

wavelength of 1550nm. From the bolometric effect, we are able to extract the
temperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductance Gth, which
remarkably has a non-zero value Gth = 0.19 pW/K at 35mK and in the low
temperature limit is consistent with a power law dependence, as expected for
nodal superconductors. Photo-voltage measurements on this non-optimized device
reveal a peak responsivity of S = 5.8 x 10^7 V/W when the device is biased
close to Ic, with a noise-equivalent power of NEP = 5.5 x 10^-16 WHz^-1/2.
Analysis of the intrinsic perfor-mance shows that a theoretically achievable

superconducting MATBG as a revolutionizing active material for ultra-sensitive

Wasserstein distance complements commonly used point-wise difference methods

spatial displacement in addition to magnitude. As a test case we consider
Chlorophyll (a key indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in the North-East
Pacific Ocean, obtained from model simulations, in situ measurements, and

successfully isolates temporal and depth variability and quantifies shifts in

study the theory of ADMR in correlated layered materials, paying special
attention to the role of angle dependent quasiparticle weights

of popular models of the cuprate materials, particularly when underdoped.
Further, in the limit of weak interlayer hopping the quasiparticle weight will
affect the $c$-axis transport measured in ADMR experiments. We show that proper

Dispersal inside the habitat provides a rescue effect on population-depleted
areas, enhancing the population resilience to environmental fluctuations.
Habitat reduction decreases the effectiveness of the dispersal rescue
mechanism. We report here how the population resilience to environmental
fluctuations decreases when the dispersal length or the habitat size are
reduced. The resilience reduction is characterized by a decrease of the
extinction threshold for environmental fluctuations. The extinction threshold
is shown to scale with the ratio between the dispersal length and the scale of
environmental synchrony, i.e., it is the dispersal connection between
non-environmentally-correlated regions that provides resilience to
environmental fluctuations. Habitat reduction also decreases the resilience to
environmental fluctuations, when the habitat size is similar to or smaller than
the characteristic dispersal distances. The power laws of these scaling
behaviors are characterized here. Alternative scaling functions with spatial
scales of population synchrony are found to fit the simulations worse. These

designed as a high-performance computing post-processing tool relying on a
hybrid parallelization that combines MPI tasks with C++11 std::threads. In this
paper, we describe how realistic cosmological observables can be computed from
numerical simulation using ray-tracing techniques. We discuss in particular the
production of simulated catalogues and sky maps that account for all the
observational effects considering first-order metric perturbations (such as
peculiar velocities, gravitational potential, integrated Sachs-Wolfe,

phantom dark energy model. Light-cone data from the simulations have been
generated using a parallel ray-tracing algorithm that has accurately solved
billion geodesic equations. Catalogues and maps with relativistic weak-lensing
which include post-Born effects, magnification bias (MB) and redshift space
distortions (RSD) due to gravitational redshift, Doppler, transverse Doppler,
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe/Rees-Sciama effects, are publicly released. Using this
dataset, we are able to reproduce the linear and quasi-linear predictions from
the Class relativistic code for the 10 (cross-)power spectra (3$\times$2
points) of the matter density fluctuation field and the gravitational
convergence at $z=0.7$ and $z=1.8$. We find 1-30\% level contribution from both
MB and RSD to the matter power spectrum, while the Fingers-of-God effect is
visible at lower redshift in the non-linear regime. MB contributes at the
$10-30\%$ level to the convergence power spectrum leading to a deviation
between the shear power-spectrum and the convergence power-spectrum. MB also
plays a significant role in the galaxy-galaxy lensing by decreasing the
density-convergence spectra by $20\%$, while coupling non-trivial
configurations (such as the one with the convergence at the same or even lower
redshift than the density field).

focused on developing sonar systems that adapt to their acoustic environment,
referred to as ""cognitive"" sonars. Cognitive active sonar systems utilize
principles of the perception action cycle of cognition to leverage information
gathered from earlier sensing interactions with the underwater acoustic
environment. This in turn informs the selection of system parameters to
optimize target detection, classification, localization, and tracking
performance in that acoustic environment. Of the many system parameters such a
cognitive sonar system could potentially adapt, the acoustic signal transmitted
into the medium, also known as the transmit waveform, has a profound impact on
system performance. Many of the physical characteristics of the acoustic
environment are contained in the return echo signal that is composed of
amplitude scaled (target strength), time-delayed (target range) and Doppler
shifted (target range-rate) echoes of the transmit waveform. This paper briefly
describes a spectrally compact adaptive FM waveform model using Multi-Tone
Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation (MTSFM). The MTSFM waveform's frequency and
phase modulation functions are composed of a finite set of weighted sinusoidal
harmonics. The weights for each harmonic are utilized as a discrete set of
design coefficients. Adjusting these coefficients results in constant
amplitude, spectrally compact FM waveforms with unique characteristics. The
adaptability of the MTSFM combined with its transmitter friendly properties
make it an attractive waveform type for a variety of active sonar applications
and may provide a cognitive sonar system the ability to generate a
complementary set of finely tuned waveforms for the novel scenarios and
environments that it may encounter.

often extremely difficult to engineer in reality. We first take the
second-order Taylor expansion of the value function. The Bellman optimality
equation is then approximated by a partial differential equation, which only
relies on the first and second moments of the transition model. By combining
the kernel representation of the value function, we then design an efficient
policy iteration algorithm whose policy evaluation step can be represented as a
linear system of equations characterized by a finite set of supporting states.
We first validate the proposed method through extensive simulations in $2D$
obstacle avoidance and $2.5D$ terrain navigation problems. The results show
that the proposed approach leads to a much superior performance over several
baselines. We then develop a system that integrates our decision-making
framework with onboard perception and conduct real-world experiments in both
cluttered indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. The results from the

subsequently decaying via gravitational waves. In this work, we determine the

Recently, LiDAR and other sensors have made large amounts of data available in
the form of temporal sequences of point cloud frames. In this work, we propose
a novel problem -- sequential scene flow estimation (SSFE) -- that aims to
predict 3D scene flow for all pairs of point clouds in a given sequence. This
is unlike the previously studied problem of scene flow estimation which focuses
on two frames.
  We introduce the SPCM-Net architecture, which solves this problem by
computing multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations between neighboring point
clouds and then aggregating the correlation across time with an order-invariant
recurrent unit. Our experimental evaluation confirms that recurrent processing
of point cloud sequences results in significantly better SSFE compared to using
only two frames. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach can be
effectively modified for sequential point cloud forecasting (SPF), a related
problem that demands forecasting future point cloud frames.
  Our experimental results are evaluated using a new benchmark for both SSFE
and SPF consisting of synthetic and real datasets. Previously, datasets for
scene flow estimation have been limited to two frames. We provide non-trivial
extensions to these datasets for multi-frame estimation and prediction. Due to
the difficulty of obtaining ground truth motion for real-world datasets, we use
self-supervised training and evaluation metrics. We believe that this benchmark
will be pivotal to future research in this area. All code for benchmark and
models will be made accessible.

equally likely message bits are first encoded by distribution matcher to
generate amplitude symbols with the desired distribution. The binary
representations of the distribution matcher outputs are then encoded by a CRC.
Finally, the CRC-encoded bits are encoded and modulated by Ungerboeck's TCM
scheme, which consists of a $\frac{k_0}{k_0+1}$ systematic tail-biting
convolutional code and a mapping function that maps coded bits to channel
signals with capacity-achieving distribution. This paper proves that, for the
proposed transmitter, the CRC bits have uniform distribution and that the
channel signals have symmetric distribution. In the receiver, the serial list
Viterbi decoding (S-LVD) is used to estimate the information bits. Simulation
results show that, for the proposed CRC-TCM-PAS system with 87 input bits and
65-67 8-AM coded output symbols, the decoding performance under additive white
Gaussian noise channel achieves the RCU bound with properly designed CRC and

HARPS and CORALIE spectrographs, we searched for planets around the bright and
slightly evolved Sun-like star HD 137496. We precisely estimated the stellar
parameters, $M_*$ = 1.035 +/- 0.022 $M_\odot$, $R_*$ = 1.587 +/- 0.028
$R_\odot$, $T_\text{eff}$ = 5799 +/- 61 K, together with the chemical
composition of the slightly evolved star. We detect two planets orbiting HD
137496. The inner planet, HD 137496 b, is a super-Mercury (an Earth-sized
planet with the density of Mercury) with a mass of $M_b$ = 4.04 +/- 0.55
$M_\oplus$, a radius of $R_b = 1.31_{-0.05}^{+0.06} R_\oplus,$ and a density of
$\rho_b = 10.49_{-1.82}^{+2.08}$ $\mathrm{g cm^{-3}}$. With an interior
modeling analysis, we find that the planet is composed mainly of iron, with the
core representing over 70% of the planet's mass ($M_{core}/M_{total} =
0.73^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$). The outer planet, HD 137496 c, is an eccentric ($e$ =
0.477 +/- 0.004), long period ($P$ = $479.9_{-1.1}^{+1.0}$ days) giant planet
($M_c\sin i_c$ = 7.66 +/- 0.11 $M_{Jup}$) for which we do not detect a transit.
HD 137496 b is one of the few super-Mercuries detected to date. The accurate
characterization reported here enhances its role as a key target to better
understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The detection of
an eccentric long period giant companion also reinforces the link between the
presence of small transiting inner planets and long period gas giants.

programmed to integrate dose and measure pulse width of each radiation pulse

scintillator was mounted in solid water phantom and placed underneath mice skin
for in vivo dose monitoring. Additionally, the scintillator was characterized
in terms of its radiation stability, mean dose-rate, and dose per pulse
dependence. Dose integration was performed for each radiation pulse and
displayed in real-time. The scintillator was shown to be linear with mean
dose-rate (40-380 Gy/s) and dose per pulse (0.3-1.3 Gy/Pulse) to within +/- 3%.
However, the plastic scintillator was subject to significant radiation damage
(16%/kGy) and would need to be calibrated frequently. Pulse-counting control
was accurately implemented with direct correspondence between the intended and
the actual delivered pulses. The dose-based control was sufficient to gate on
any pulse of the LINAC. In-vivo dosimetry monitoring with a 1 cm circular

average dose per pulse was ~0.045 +/- 0.004 Gy/Pulse, whereas after the ramp-up

ejections (CMEs). Many models aim in accurately reconstructing the magnetic
field topology of CMEs, considering its importance in assessing their impact on
modern technology and human activities in space and on ground. However, so far
there is little discussion about how the details of the magnetic structure of a
spheromak affect its evolution through the ambient field in the modelling
domain, and what impact this has on the accuracy of magnetic field topology
predictions. If the spheromak has its axis of symmetry (geometric axis) at an
angle with respect to the direction of the ambient field, then the spheromak
starts rotating so that its symmetry axis finally aligns with the ambient
field. When using the spheromak in space weather forecasting models this
tilting can happen already during insertion and significantly affects the
results. In this paper we highlight this issue previously not examined in the
field of space weather and we estimate the angle by which the spheromak rotates
under different conditions. To do this we generated simple purely radial
ambient magnetic field topologies (weak/strong positive/negative) and inserted
spheromaks with varying initial speed and tilt, and magnetic helicity sign. We
employ different physical and geometric criteria to locate the magnetic centre
of mass and axis of symmetry of the spheromak. We confirm that spheromaks
rotate in all investigated conditions and their direction and angle of rotation
depend on the spheromak's initial properties and ambient magnetic field
strength and orientation.

opportunity to probe the geology of exoplanetary systems. However, the nature
of the bodies which pollute white dwarfs is not well understood: are they small
asteroids, minor planets, or even terrestrial planets? We present a novel
method to infer pollutant masses from detections of Ni, Cr and Si. During
core--mantle differentiation, these elements exhibit variable preference for
metal and silicate at different pressures (i.e., object masses), affecting
their abundances in the core and mantle. We model core--mantle differentiation
self-consistently using data from metal--silicate partitioning experiments. We
place statistical constraints on the differentiation pressures, and hence
masses, of bodies which pollute white dwarfs by incorporating this calculation
into a Bayesian framework. We show that Ni observations are best suited to
constraining pressure when pollution is mantle-like, while Cr and Si are better
for core-like pollution. We find 3 systems (WD0449-259, WD1350-162 and
WD2105-820) whose abundances are best explained by the accretion of fragments
of small parent bodies ($<0.2M_\oplus$). For 2 systems (GD61 and WD0446-255),
the best model suggests the accretion of fragments of Earth-sized bodies,
although the observed abundances remain consistent ($<3\sigma$) with the
accretion of undifferentiated material. This suggests that polluted white
dwarfs potentially accrete planetary bodies of a range of masses. However, our
results are subject to inevitable degeneracies and limitations given current
data. To constrain pressure more confidently, we require serendipitous
observation of (nearly) pure core and/or mantle material.

changing bounded-degree pattern of interconnections between nodes, but the
network topology and the selection of routing paths must both be oblivious to
the traffic demand matrix. Our focus is on the trade-off between maximizing
throughput and minimizing latency in these networks. For every constant
throughput rate, we characterize (up to a constant factor) the minimum latency
achievable by an oblivious reconfigurable network design that satisfies the
given throughput guarantee. The trade-off between these two objectives turns
out to be surprisingly subtle: the curve depicting it has an unexpected
scalloped shape reflecting the fact that load-balancing becomes more difficult

all the path lengths is not possible. The proof of our lower bound uses LP
duality to verify that Valiant load balancing is the most efficient oblivious
routing scheme when used in combination with an optimally-designed

construction in which the network nodes are identified with vectors over a
finite field, the network topology is described by either the elementary basis

selecting columns of these matrices to yield the appropriate mixture of path
lengths within the shortest possible time interval.

differentially private algorithms to analyze streaming data. Specifically, we
consider the problem of estimating the density of a stream of users (or, more
generally, elements), which expresses the fraction of all users that actually
appear in the stream. We focus on one of the strongest privacy guarantees for
the streaming model, namely user-level pan-privacy, which ensures that the
privacy of any user is protected, even against an adversary that observes, on
rare occasions, the internal state of the algorithm. Our proposed algorithms
employ optimally all the allocated privacy budget, are specially tailored for
the streaming model, and, hence, outperform both theoretically and

AutoAttack (Croce and Hein, 2020b) framework have drawn a lot of attention.
While AutoAttack has shown a very high attack success rate, most defense
approaches are focusing on network hardening and robustness enhancements, like
adversarial training. This way, the currently best-reported method can
withstand about 66% of adversarial examples on CIFAR10. In this paper, we
investigate the spatial and frequency domain properties of AutoAttack and
propose an alternative defense. Instead of hardening a network, we detect
adversarial attacks during inference, rejecting manipulated inputs. Based on a
rather simple and fast analysis in the frequency domain, we introduce two
different detection algorithms. First, a black box detector that only operates
on the input images and achieves a detection accuracy of 100% on the AutoAttack
CIFAR10 benchmark and 99.3% on ImageNet, for epsilon = 8/255 in both cases.
Second, a whitebox detector using an analysis of CNN feature maps, leading to a
detection rate of also 100% and 98.7% on the same benchmarks.

demonstrated to be capable of reducing the delocalization error effectively and
producing accurate descriptions for many critical and challenging problems,

localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method. LibSC will serve as a
light-weight and open-source library that can be easily accessed by the quantum

provide the essential functionalities for conducting calculations of the SC

support multiple popular programing languages, including C, C++ and Python. In
addition to the development of the library, we also integrated LibSC with two
popular and open-source quantum chemistry packages, the Psi4 package and the
PySCF package, which provides immediate access for general users to perform

cylinders with elliptical and circular-shaped cross-sections. Numerical
simulations of fully nonlinear visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics are carried
out to illustrate how the plasma dynamics are affected by shaping. It is shown
that independent of the plasma shape, the quantity $\beta$, comparing the
hydrodynamic pressure to the magnetic pressure, decreases for increasing values
of the Lundquist number, but the pressure gradient fluctuations remain roughly
constant, when compared to the Lorentz force. Different elliptical shapes of
the cross-section of the domain lead to the excitation of different toroidal
(or axial) magnetic and dynamic modes. Furthermore, it is found that in a
geometry with circular cross-section a significant local poloidal angular
momentum is observed, absent in the geometries with elliptical cross-section.
Since the confinement is dominantly determined by plasma movement, and the
dynamics of the velocity and magnetic field are modified by the modification of
the geometry, shaping can thus affect the performance of RFP-devices.

us to resolve the pulsar from a close-by galaxy and measure the optical fluxes
more accurately. Using the newly measured fluxes and a new calibration of the
HST's far-UV detector, we fit the optical-UV pulsar's spectrum with a model
that consists of a nonthermal power-law ($f_\nu\propto \nu^\alpha$) and a
thermal blackbody components. We obtained the spectral slope $\alpha=-0.3\pm
0.3$, considerably flatter than found from groundbased observations, and the
best-fit temperature in the range of $(6$--$12)\times 10^4$ K (as seen by a
distant observer), depending on interstellar extinction and NS radius. The
temperature is lower than reported previously, but still much higher than
predicted by NS passive cooling scenarios for such an old pulsar. This means
that some heating mechanisms operate in NSs, e.g., caused by interaction of the
faster rotating neutron superfluid with the slower rotating normal matter in

presence of strong stabilizing density stratification is derived via asymptotic
analysis of the Boussinesq equations in the simultaneous limits of small Froude
and large Reynolds numbers. The analysis explicitly recognizes the occurrence
of dynamics on disparate spatiotemporal scales, yielding simplified partial
differential equations governing the coupled evolution of slow large-scale
hydrostatic flows and fast small-scale isotropic instabilities and internal
waves. The dynamics captured by the coupled reduced equations is illustrated in
the context of two-dimensional strongly stratified Kolmogorov flow. A
noteworthy feature of the reduced model is that the fluctuations are
constrained to satisfy quasilinear (QL) dynamics about the comparably
slowly-varying large-scale fields. Crucially, this QL reduction is not invoked
as an ad hoc closure approximation, but rather is derived in a physically
relevant and mathematically consistent distinguished limit. Further analysis of
the resulting slow-fast QL system shows how the amplitude of the fast
stratified-shear instabilities is slaved to the slowly-evolving mean fields to
ensure the marginal stability of the latter. Physically, this marginal
stability condition appears to be compatible with recent evidence of
self-organized criticality in both observations and simulations of stratified
turbulence. lgorithmically, the slaving of the fluctuation fields enables
numerical simulations to be time-evolved strictly on the slow time scale of the
hydrostatic flow. The reduced equations thus provide a solid mathematical
foundation for future studies of three-dimensional strongly stratified
turbulence in extreme parameter regimes of geophysical relevance and suggest
avenues for new sub-grid-scale parameterizations.

forecasting framework for enhancing hours-ahead utility-scale PV forecasting.
The hybrid framework consists of two forecasting models: a physics-based trend
forecasting (TF) model and a data-driven cloud-event forecasting (CF) model.
Three TCNs are integrated in the framework for: i) blending the inputs from
different Numerical Weather Prediction sources for the TF model to achieve
superior performance on forecasting hourly PV profiles, ii) capturing
spatial-temporal correlations between detector sites and the target site in the
CF model to achieve more accurate forecast of intra-hour PV power drops, and
iii) reconciling TF and CF results to obtain coherent hours-ahead PV forecast
with both hourly trends and intra-hour fluctuations well preserved. To
automatically identify the most contributive neighboring sites for forming a
detector network, a scenario-based correlation analysis method is developed,
which significantly improves the capability of the CF model on capturing large
power fluctuations caused by cloud movements. The framework is developed,
tested, and validated using actual PV data collected from 95 PV farms in North
Carolina. Simulation results show that the performance of 6 hours ahead PV

functionality can be complemented by embracing the recently developed vortex
electron beams (VEBs), made up of electrons with orbital angular momentum,
which could in addition probe induced magnetic near fields. In this work we
revisit the theoretical description of this technique, dubbed vortex Electron
Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (v-EELS). We map the fundamental, quantum-mechanical
picture of the scattering of the VEB electrons, to the intuitive classical
models which treat the electron beams as superposition of linear electric and
magnetic currents. We then apply this formalism to characterise the optical
response of dielectric nanoantennas with v-EELS. Our calculations reveal that
VEB electrons probe electric or magnetic modes with different efficiency, which
can be adjusted by changing either beam vorticity or acceleration voltage, to
determine the nature of the probed excitations. We also study a
chirally-arranged nanostructure, which in the interaction with electron
vortices produces dichroism in electron energy loss spectra. Our theoretical
work establishes VEBs as versatile probes that could provide information on
optical excitations otherwise inaccessible with conventional electron beams.

patterns for all n seem similar to the known calculation of H*(Gr(d,m);Q), the

  We use a novel method to show that higher differentials can't occur: we get a
lower bound on the size of K(n)*(Gr(d,m)) by constructing an action of C = the
cyclic group of order 4, on our Grassmanians, and then applying the chromatic
fixed point theory of the authors' previous paper. In essence, we bound the
size of K(n)*(Gr(d,m)) from below by computing K(n-1)*(Gr(d,m)^C).
  Meanwhile, the AHSS after the first differential is determined by
Q_n-homology, where Q_n is Milnor's nth primitive operation in mod 2
cohomology. Whenever we are able to calculate this, we have found that it
agrees with our lower bound for the size of K(n)*(Gr(d,m)). We have two general
families where we prove this: m at most 2^{n+1} and all d, and d=2 and all m
and n. Computer calculations have allowed us to check many other examples with

terms of the molecular gas properties. We have obtained the first detections of
the plasma-embedded Helix molecular knots (globules) in HCN, HNC, HCO+, and
other trace molecules. Analysis of the HNC/HCN integrated line intensity ratio
reveals an increase with radial distance from the Helix central star. In the
context of molecular line ratios of other planetary nebulae from the
literature, the HNC/HCN ratio appears to be anticorrelated with UV emission
over four orders of magnitude in incident flux. Models of the photodissociation
regions within the Helix using the RADEX and Meudon codes reveal strong
constraints on column density of the molecular gas, as well as pressure and

X-ray irradiation is likely driving HCO+ production in the outer regions of
planetary nebulae, where photodissociation is limited, yet cold gas and ionized

renewable energy (VRE) power plants, such as wind and photovoltaic power
plants, leads to a 100% renewable energy supply in 2030 because of its inherent
exponential growth function. This behavior is related to the exponential cost
reduction of its generated energy and the nearly unconstrained available
potential of its natural resources. The cost reduction results from the
continuous improvements in development, research, manufacturing, and
installation, also showing a growth of its installation power per power plant
or aero generator. We prove that if the historic exponential growth is followed
in the future, it is possible to decarbonize the world's electric energy
systems' power supply in 2026. Furthermore, the global demand on primary energy
can be supplied in 2030, which leads to the total suppression of CO2 emissions
related to the energy need of humanity. Because of the related cost reduction,
energy costs are not anymore relevant. Our extrapolation is based on the
continuation of the historic growth functions of the globally installed PV and
the wind power plants, and we also discuss the conditions necessary to enable a
transition to such a 100% renewable energy production. Considering a
non-constrained growth of VRE power plants' installation power, decarbonization
related to energy generation and use can be accomplished in a much shorter time
frame as previously scheduled. As a result, climate change mitigation, energy
cost reduction, and high employment are attained much earlier than previously
planned.

protohaloes seeded by two or three crossed sine waves of various relative
initial amplitudes, by comparing Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) up to
10th order to high-resolution cosmological simulations performed with the
public Vlasov code ColDICE. Accurate analyses of the density, the velocity, and
related quantities such as the vorticity are performed by exploiting the fact
that ColDICE can follow locally the phase-space sheet at the quadratic level.
To test LPT predictions beyond shell-crossing, we employ a ballistic
approximation, which assumes that the velocity field is frozen just after
shell-crossing. In the generic case, where the amplitudes of the sine waves are
all different, high-order LPT predictions match very well the exact solution,
even beyond collapse. As expected, convergence slows down when going from
quasi-1D dynamics where one wave dominates over the two others, to the
axial-symmetric configuration, where all the amplitudes of the waves are equal.
It is also noticed that LPT convergence is slower when considering velocity
related quantities. Additionally, the structure of the system at and beyond
collapse given by LPT and the simulations agrees very well with singularity
theory predictions, in particular with respect to the caustic and vorticity
patterns that develop beyond collapse. Again, this does not apply to
axial-symmetric configurations, that are still correct from the qualitative
point of view, but where multiple foldings of the phase-space sheet produce
very high density contrasts, hence a strong backreaction of the gravitational
force.

probability, the probability that all of them occur is also strictly positive.
The Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL) asserts that this remains true if the events are
not too strongly negatively correlated. The formulation of the lemma involves a
graph with one vertex per event, with edges indicating potential negative
dependence. The word ""Local"" in LLL reflects that the condition for the
negative correlation can be expressed solely in terms of the neighborhood of
each vertex. In contrast to this local view, Shearer developed an exact
criterion for the avoidance probability to be strictly positive, but it
involves summing over all independent sets of the graph.
  In this work we make two contributions. The first is to develop a hierarchy
of increasingly powerful, increasingly non-local lemmata for bounding the
avoidance probability from below, each lemma associated with a different set of
walks in the graph. Already, at its second level, our hierarchy is stronger
than all known local lemmata. To demonstrate its power we prove new bounds for
the negative-fugacity singularity of the hard-core model on several lattices, a
central problem in statistical physics.
  Our second contribution is to prove that Shearer's connection between the
probabilistic setting and the independent set polynomial holds for
\emph{arbitrary supermodular} functions, not just probability measures. This
means that all LLL machinery can be employed to bound from below an arbitrary
supermodular function, based only on information regarding its value at
singleton sets and partial information regarding their interactions. We show
that this readily implies both the quantum LLL of Ambainis, Kempe, and
Sattath~[JACM 2012], and the quantum Shearer criterion of Sattath, Morampudi,
Laumann, and Moessner~[PNAS 2016].

  Buildings: A Probabilistic Approach","11 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Building performance is commonly calculated during the last phases of design,
where most design specifications get fixed and are unlikely to be majorly
modified based on design programs. Predictive models could play a significant
role in informing architects and designers of the impact of their design
decisions on energy consumption in buildings during early design stages. A
building outline is a significant predictor of the final energy consumption and
is conceptually determined by architects in the early design phases. This paper
evaluates the impact of a building's outline on energy consumption using
synthetic data to achieve appropriate predictive models in estimating a
building's energy consumption. Four office outlines are selected in this study,
including square, T, U, and L shapes. Besides the shape parameter, other
building features commonly used in literature (i.e., Window to Wall Ratio
(WWR), external wall material properties, glazing U value, windows' shading
depth, and building orientation) are utilized in generating data distribution
with a probabilistic approach. The results show that buildings with square
shapes, in general, are more energy-efficient compared to buildings with T, U,
and L shapes of the same volume. Also, T, U, and L shape samples show very
similar behavior in terms of energy consumption. Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) is applied to assess the variables' correlations on data distribution;
the results show that wall material specifications explain about 40% of data
variation. Finally, we applied polynomial regression models with different
degrees of complexity to predict the synthesized building models' energy
consumptions based on their outlines. The results show that degree 2 polynomial
models, fitting the data over 98% R squared (coefficient of determination),
could be used to predict new samples with high accuracy.

hardness to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. The PSD capability, average
pulse shapes, and light output of four types of organic scintillator were
characterized before and after neutron and gamma-ray irradiation. The main goal
of this investigation is to study the effects of long-term irradiation that may
be experienced in space applications on the light output and particle
discriminating capabilities of each material. EJ-270, EJ-276, organic glass,

not observed in any of the scintillators up to $2.56\times10^{11}$ n/cm$^2$,

scintillators presented some light output reduction after ionizing (gamma-ray)
irradiation, with reductions of 17$\%$ (EJ-276 and OGS), 32$\%$ (EJ-270), and
42$\%$ (Stilbene) observed immediately after 100 kRad.

generally increase with time. We therefore derive the angular velocity $\Omega$

barred galaxies using photometric data. Mass maps are constructed by assuming a
dynamical mass-to-light ratio and then solving the Poisson equation for the
gravitatonal potential. The location of Lindblad resonances and the corotation
resonance radius are then derived using the standard precession frequency
curves in conjunction with bar pattern speeds recently estimated from the
Tremaine-Weinberg method as applied to Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data.
Correlations between physical properties of bars and their host galaxies
indicate that bar {\it length} and the corotation radius depend on the disk
circular velocity while bar {\it strength} and pattern speed do not. As the bar
pattern speed decreases, bar strength, length, and corotation radius incease,
but when bars are subclassified into fast, medium, and slow domains, no
significant change in bar length is found. Only a hint of an increase of bar
strength from fast to slow bars is found. These results suggest that bar length
in galaxies undergoes little evolution, being instead determined mainly by the
size of their host galaxy.

performance on various classification and pattern recognition tasks. However,
many real-world prediction problems have ordinal response variables, and this
ordering information is ignored by conventional classification losses such as
the multi-category cross-entropy. Ordinal regression methods for deep neural
networks address this. One such method is the CORAL method, which is based on
an earlier binary label extension framework and achieves rank consistency among
its output layer tasks by imposing a weight-sharing constraint. However, while
earlier experiments showed that CORAL's rank consistency is beneficial for
performance, it is limited by a weight-sharing constraint in a neural network's
fully connected output layer, which may restrict the expressiveness and
capacity of a network trained using CORAL. We propose a new method for
rank-consistent ordinal regression without this limitation. Our rank-consistent
ordinal regression framework (CORN) achieves rank consistency by a novel
training scheme. This training scheme uses conditional training sets to obtain
the unconditional rank probabilities through applying the chain rule for
conditional probability distributions. Experiments on various datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method to utilize the ordinal target
information, and the absence of the weight-sharing restriction improves the
performance substantially compared to the CORAL reference approach.
Additionally, the suggested CORN method is not tied to any specific
architecture and can be utilized with any deep neural network classifier to
train it for ordinal regression tasks.

We use an equivalent cost functional method to deal with the MF-LQJ problem

to establish a bridge between indefinite and positive-definite MF-LQJ problems.
With such a bridge, solvabilities of stochastic Hamiltonian system and Riccati

As a by-product, the method provides a new way to prove the existence and

V2: consolidated results for filtering, updated figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Adversarially robust training has been shown to reduce the susceptibility of
learned models to targeted input data perturbations. However, it has also been
observed that such adversarially robust models suffer a degradation in accuracy
when applied to unperturbed data sets, leading to a robustness-accuracy
tradeoff. Inspired by recent progress in the adversarial machine learning
literature which characterize such tradeoffs in simple settings, we develop
tools to quantitatively study the performance-robustness tradeoff between
nominal and robust state estimation. In particular, we define and analyze a
novel $\textit{adversarially robust Kalman Filtering problem}$. We show that in
contrast to most problem instances in adversarial machine learning, we can
precisely derive the adversarial perturbation in the Kalman Filtering setting.
We provide an algorithm to find this perturbation given data realizations, and
develop upper and lower bounds on the adversarial state estimation error in
terms of the standard (non-adversarial) estimation error and the spectral
properties of the resulting observer. Through these results, we show a natural
connection between a filter's robustness to adversarial perturbation and
underlying control theoretic properties of the system being observed, namely
the spectral properties of its observability gramian.

classical Lagrangian of this model has scale invariance, which can be broken by
radiative corrections to the effective potential. It is possible to calculate
the effective potential using the RGE and the renormalization group functions
that are obtained directly from loop calculations of the model and, using the
leading logs approximation, information about higher loop orders can be
included in the effective potential thus obtained. To show this, we use the
renormalization group functions reported in the literature, obtained with a
four loop calculation, and obtain a five loop approximation to the effective
potential, in doing so, we have to properly take into account the fact that the
model has multiple scales, and convert the functions that were originally
calculated in the minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization scheme to another
scheme which is adequate for the RGE method. This result is then used to study
the DSB, and we present evidence for a rich structure of classical vacua,

We also show that if the conjecture is known for the cyclotomic

three temporal architectures: one focused in reducing inference with a

interaction, and properties of the gap strongly depend on the planetary mass
and disk parameters. Many numerical simulations of this process have been
conducted, but detailed simulations and analysis of gap formation by a
super-Jupiter mass planet have not been thoroughly conducted. We performed
two-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations of the gap formation process
by a super-Jupiter mass planet and examined the eccentricity of the gap. When
the planet is massive, the radial motion of gas is excited, causing the
eccentricity of the gap's outer edge to increase. Our simulations showed that
the critical planetary mass for the eccentric gap was $\sim3~M_{\rm J}$ in a
disk with $\alpha=4.0\times10^{-3}$ and $h/r=0.05$, a finding that was
consistent with that reported in a previous work. The critical planetary mass
for the eccentric gap depends on the viscosity and the disk scale height. We
found that the critical mass could be described by considering a dimensionless
parameter related to the gap depth. The onset of gap eccentricity enhanced the
surface density inside the gap, shallowing the gap more than the empirical
relation derived in previous studies for a planet heavier than the critical
mass. Therefore, our results suggest that the mass accretion rate, which
strongly depends on the gas surface density in the gap is also enhanced for
super-Jupiter mass planets. These results may substantially impact the
formation and evolution processes of super-Jupiter mass planets and population

  Many approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by

a particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world

apparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,
there is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the

each individual a given treatment based on his/her observed characteristics.
Most of the existing works in the literature consider settings with binary or
finitely many treatment options. In this paper, we focus on the continuous
treatment setting and propose a jump interval-learning to develop an
individualized interval-valued decision rule (I2DR) that maximizes the expected
outcome. Unlike IDRs that recommend a single treatment, the proposed I2DR
yields an interval of treatment options for each individual, making it more
flexible to implement in practice. To derive an optimal I2DR, our jump
interval-learning method estimates the conditional mean of the outcome given
the treatment and the covariates via jump penalized regression, and derives the
corresponding optimal I2DR based on the estimated outcome regression function.
The regressor is allowed to be either linear for clear interpretation or deep
neural network to model complex treatment-covariates interactions. To implement
jump interval-learning, we develop a searching algorithm based on dynamic
programming that efficiently computes the outcome regression function.
Statistical properties of the resulting I2DR are established when the outcome
regression function is either a piecewise or continuous function over the
treatment space. We further develop a procedure to infer the mean outcome under
the (estimated) optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real data
application to a warfarin study are conducted to demonstrate the empirical
validity of the proposed I2DR.

large catalog of synthetic dust-continuum compact sources from our 250 pc,
SN-driven, star formation simulation. Here, we compute synthetic $\rm
N_{2}H^{+}$ line profiles for a subsample of those sources and compare their
properties with the observations and with those of the corresponding
three-dimensional (3D) clumps in the simulation. We find that the velocity
dispersion of the sources estimated from the $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$ line is a good
estimate of that of the 3D clumps, although its correlation with the source
size is weaker than the velocity-size correlation of the 3D clumps. The
relation between the mass of the 3D clumps, $M_{\rm main}$, and that of the
corresponding synthetic sources, $M_{\rm SED}$, has a large scatter and a slope
of 0.5, $M_{\rm main} \propto M_{\rm SED}^{0.5}$, due to uncertainties arising
from the observational band-merging procedure and from projection effects along
the line of sight. As a result, the virial parameters of the 3D clumps are not
correlated with the clump masses, even if a negative correlation is found for
the compact sources, and the virial parameter of the most massive sources may
significantly underestimate that of the associated clumps.

performances on both the natural and synthetic rainy datasets. As an essential
low-level pre-processing stage, a deraining network should clear the rain
streaks and preserve the fine semantic details. However, most existing methods
only consider low-level image restoration. That limits their performances at
high-level tasks requiring precise semantic information. To address this issue,
in this paper, we present a segmentation-aware progressive network (SAPNet)
based upon contrastive learning for single image deraining. We start our method
with a lightweight derain network formed with progressive dilated units (PDU).
The PDU can significantly expand the receptive field and characterize
multi-scale rain streaks without the heavy computation on multi-scale images. A
fundamental aspect of this work is an unsupervised background segmentation
(UBS) network initialized with ImageNet and Gaussian weights. The UBS can
faithfully preserve an image's semantic information and improve the
generalization ability to unseen photos. Furthermore, we introduce a perceptual
contrastive loss (PCL) and a learned perceptual image similarity loss (LPISL)
to regulate model learning. By exploiting the rainy image and groundtruth as
the negative and the positive sample in the VGG-16 latent space, we bridge the
fine semantic details between the derained image and the groundtruth in a fully
constrained manner. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy
images show our model surpasses top-performing methods and aids object
detection and semantic segmentation with considerable efficacy. A Pytorch

food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central
challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine
learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally
complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land
surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine
learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these
models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study
over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and
temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural
network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and
temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method
is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the
US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the
first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield
prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also
laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning
baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep
learning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our
proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods

periodic orbits of the generalized tent map. The invariant set containing
periodic orbits is a repelling set with a complicated Cantor-like structure.
Therefore, a simple local stabilization of the orbit may not be enough to find
a periodic orbit, due to the small measure of the basin of attraction. It is
shown that for certain values of the control parameter, both the local behavior
and the global behavior of solutions change in the controlled system; in
particular, the invariant set enlarges to become an interval or the entire real

considered, and necessary conditions for the orbit to be periodic are given.
The question of local asymptotic stability of subcycles of the controlled

recent advances in astrophysical observations, we explore the possibility of
the appearance of quarks inside neutron stars and check its compatibility with
current constraints. We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark pasta
phases and their influences on the equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars.
In this work, we extend the energy minimization (EM) method to describe the
hadron-quark pasta phase, where the surface and Coulomb contributions are
included in the minimization procedure. By allowing different electron
densities in the hadronic and quark matter phases, the total electron chemical
potential with the electric potential remains constant, and local ? equilibrium
is achieved inside the Wigner-Seitz cell. The mixed phase described in the EM
method shows the features lying between the Gibbs and Maxwell constructions,
which is helpful for understanding the transition from the Gibbs construction
(GC) to the Maxwell construction (MC) with increasing surface tension. We
employ the relativistic mean-field model to describe the hadronic matter, while
the quark matter is described by the MIT bag model with vector interactions. It
is found that the vector interactions among quarks can significantly stiffen
the EOS at high densities and help enhance the maximum mass of neutron stars.
Other parameters like the bag constant can also affect the deconfinement phase
transition in neutron stars. Our results show that hadron-quark pasta phases
may appear in the core of massive neutron stars that can be compatible with
current observational constraints.

it is quite difficult to extract discriminative features to identify the subtle

Moreover, how to fully utilize both audio and visual information is still an
open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion attention
network for audio-visual emotion recognition based on adaptive and multi-level
factorized bilinear pooling (FBP). First, for the audio stream, a fully
convolutional network (FCN) equipped with 1-D attention mechanism and local
response normalization is designed for speech emotion recognition. Next, a
global FBP (G-FBP) approach is presented to perform audio-visual information
fusion by integrating selfattention based video stream with the proposed audio
stream. To improve G-FBP, an adaptive strategy (AG-FBP) to dynamically
calculate the fusion weight of two modalities is devised based on the
emotion-related representation vectors from the attention mechanism of
respective modalities. Finally, to fully utilize the local emotion information,
adaptive and multi-level FBP (AMFBP) is introduced by combining both
global-trunk and intratrunk data in one recording on top of AG-FBP. Tested on
the IEMOCAP corpus for speech emotion recognition with only audio stream, the
new FCN method outperforms the state-ofthe-art results with an accuracy of

regression, namely where regret is defined with respect to an arbitrary
function class which has bounded complexity. Our contributions are two-fold:
  - In the realizable setting of nonparametric online regression with the
absolute loss, we propose a randomized proper learning algorithm which gets a
near-optimal cumulative loss in terms of the sequential fat-shattering
dimension of the hypothesis class. In the setting of online classification with
a class of Littlestone dimension $d$, our bound reduces to $d \cdot {\rm poly}
\log T$. This result answers a question as to whether proper learners could
achieve near-optimal cumulative loss; previously, even for online
classification, the best known cumulative loss was $\tilde O( \sqrt{dT})$.
Further, for the real-valued (regression) setting, a cumulative loss bound with
near-optimal scaling on sequential fat-shattering dimension was not even known
for improper learners, prior to this work.
  - Using the above result, we exhibit an independent learning algorithm for
general-sum binary games of Littlestone dimension $d$, for which each player
achieves regret $\tilde O(d^{3/4} \cdot T^{1/4})$. This result generalizes
analogous results of Syrgkanis et al. (2015) who showed that in finite games
the optimal regret can be accelerated from $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial
setting to $O(T^{1/4})$ in the game setting.
  To establish the above results, we introduce several new techniques,
including: a hierarchical aggregation rule to achieve the optimal cumulative
loss for real-valued classes, a multi-scale extension of the proper online
realizable learner of Hanneke et al. (2021), an approach to show that the
output of such nonparametric learning algorithms is stable, and a proof that
the minimax theorem holds in all online learnable games.

distribution (i.e., a few classes occupy the majority of the data, while most
classes have only a limited number of samples), which results in a challenging
long-tailed learning scenario. Some recently published datasets in
ophthalmology AI consist of more than 40 kinds of retinal diseases with complex
abnormalities and variable morbidity. Nevertheless, more than 30 conditions are
rarely seen in global patient cohorts. From a modeling perspective, most deep
learning models trained on these datasets may lack the ability to generalize to
rare diseases where only a few available samples are presented for training. In
addition, there may be more than one disease for the presence of the retina,
resulting in a challenging label co-occurrence scenario, also known as
\textit{multi-label}, which can cause problems when some re-sampling strategies
are applied during training. To address the above two major challenges, this
paper presents a novel method that enables the deep neural network to learn
from a long-tailed fundus database for various retinal disease recognition.
Firstly, we exploit the prior knowledge in ophthalmology to improve the feature
representation using a hierarchy-aware pre-training. Secondly, we adopt an
instance-wise class-balanced sampling strategy to address the label
co-occurrence issue under the long-tailed medical dataset scenario. Thirdly, we
introduce a novel hybrid knowledge distillation to train a less biased

superiority of our proposed methods with recognition accuracy outperforming the

comparison between reference and candidate captions. However, they have some
insuperable drawbacks, e.g., they cannot handle videos without references, and
they may result in biased evaluation due to the one-to-many nature of
video-to-text and the neglect of visual relevance. From the human evaluator's
viewpoint, a high-quality caption should be consistent with the provided video,
but not necessarily be similar to the reference in literal or semantics.
Inspired by human evaluation, we propose EMScore (Embedding Matching-based
score), a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly
measures similarity between video and candidate captions. Benefit from the
recent development of large-scale pre-training models, we exploit a well
pre-trained vision-language model to extract visual and linguistic embeddings
for computing EMScore. Specifically, EMScore combines matching scores of both
coarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels,
which takes the overall understanding and detailed characteristics of the video
into account. Furthermore, considering the potential information gain, EMScore
can be flexibly extended to the conditions where human-labeled references are
available. Last but not least, we collect VATEX-EVAL and ActivityNet-FOIl
datasets to systematically evaluate the existing metrics. VATEX-EVAL
experiments demonstrate that EMScore has higher human correlation and lower
reference dependency. ActivityNet-FOIL experiment verifies that EMScore can
effectively identify ""hallucinating"" captions. The datasets will be released to
facilitate the development of video captioning metrics. The code is available

transport in convection. The effective mass, momentum, and heat transports in
the convective turbulence are investigated in the framework of time--space
double averaging procedure, where a field quantity is decomposed into three
parts: the spatiotemporal mean (spatial average of the time-averaged) field,
the dispersion or coherent fluctuation, and the random or incoherent
fluctuation. With this framework, turbulent correlations in the mean-field
equations are divided into the dispersion/coherent and random/incoherent
correlation part. By reckoning the plume as the coherent fluctuation, a
transport model for the convective turbulence is constructed with the aid of
the non-equilibrium effect, in which the change of turbulence characteristics
along the mean stream is taken into account for the modelling of the turbulent
transport coefficients. In this work, for the first time, change of turbulence
properties along plume motions is incorporated into the expression of the
turbulent transport coefficients. This non-equilibrium model is applied to a
stellar convective flow. One of the prominent characteristics of a surface
cooling-driven convection, the enhanced and localised turbulent mass flux below
the surface layer, which cannot be reproduced at all by the usual
eddy-diffusivity model with mixing length theory (MLT), is well reproduced by
the present model. Our results show that the incorporation of plume motion into
turbulent transport model is an important and very relevant extension of
mean-field theory beyond the heuristic gradient transport model with MLT.

developing a traversing algorithm based on this adjacency. Our polytope

of the traversing algorithm is determined by the number of a ReLU NN's

realize quantum anomalous Hall insulator with unit Chern number. For the weakly
coupled pairings, the system corresponds to the topological superconductor
(TSC) with the Chern number $C=\pm 2$. We answer the following questions
whether the local Chern numbers and chiral Majorana edge modes of such a TSC
distribute around the surface layers. By the numerical calculations based on a
theoretic model of AFTI, we find that when the local Chern numbers are always
dominated by the surface layers, the wavefunctions of chiral Majorana edge
modes must not localize on the surface layers and show a smooth crossover from
spatially occupying all layers to only distributing near the surface layers,
similar to the hinge states in a three dimensional second-order topological
phases. The latter phase can be distinguished from the former phase by the
measurements of the local density of state. In addition we also study the
superconducting vortex phase transition in this system and find that the
exchange field in the AFTI not only enlarges the phase space of topological
vortex phase but also enhances its topological stability. These conclusions
will stimulate the investigations on superconducting effects of AFTI and drive

neuroimaging in humans for nearly a hundred years. Because it is inexpensive,
easy to implement, and noninvasive, it also represents an excellent candidate
modality for use in the BCI setting. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of
how EEG measurements (voltage fluctuations) relate to information processing in
the brain remains somewhat elusive. A deeper understanding of the
neuroanatomical underpinnings of the EEG signal may help explain
inter-individual variability in evoked and induced potentials, which may
improve BCI therapies targeted to the individual. According to classic
biophysical models, EEG fluctuations are primarily a reflection of locally
synchronized neuronal oscillations within the gray matter oriented
approximately orthogonal to the scalp. In contrast, global models ignore local
signals due to dendritic processing, and suggest that propagation delays due to
white matter architecture are responsible for the EEG signal, and are capable
of explaining the coherence between numerous rhythms (e.g., alpha) at spatially
distinct areas of the scalp. Recently, combined local-global models suggest
that the EEG signal may reflect a superposition of local processing along with
global contributors including transduction along white matter tracts in the
brain. Incorporating both local and global (e.g., white matter) priors into EEG
source models may therefore improve source estimates. These models may also
help disentangle which aspects of the EEG signal are predicted to colocalize
spatially with measurements from functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we explore the
possibility that white matter conductivity contributes to EEG measurements via
a generative model based on classic axonal transduction models, and discuss its
potential implications for source estimation.

networking and computing resources can be dynamically reallocated through live
migration of Virtual Machines (VMs). Dynamic resource management such as load
balancing and energy-saving policies can request multiple migrations when the
algorithms are triggered periodically. There exist notable research efforts in
dynamic resource management that alleviate single migration overheads, such as
single migration time and co-location interference while selecting the
potential VMs and migration destinations. However, by neglecting the resource
dependency among potential migration requests, the existing solutions of
dynamic resource management can result in the Quality of Service (QoS)
degradation and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during the migration
schedule. Therefore, it is essential to integrate both single and multiple
migration overheads into VM reallocation planning. In this paper, we propose a
concurrency-aware multiple migration selector that operates based on the
maximal cliques and independent sets of the resource dependency graph of
multiple migration requests. Our proposed method can be integrated with
existing dynamic resource management policies. The experimental results
demonstrate that our solution efficiently minimizes migration interference and
shortens the convergence time of reallocation by maximizing the multiple
migration performance while achieving the objective of dynamic resource
management.

questions: (i) can we unlearn a single or multiple class(es) of data from a ML
model without looking at the full training data even once? (ii) can we make the
process of unlearning fast and scalable to large datasets, and generalize it to
different deep networks? We introduce a novel machine unlearning framework with
error-maximizing noise generation and impair-repair based weight manipulation
that offers an efficient solution to the above questions. An error-maximizing
noise matrix is learned for the class to be unlearned using the original model.
The noise matrix is used to manipulate the model weights to unlearn the
targeted class of data. We introduce impair and repair steps for a controlled
manipulation of the network weights. In the impair step, the noise matrix along
with a very high learning rate is used to induce sharp unlearning in the model.
Thereafter, the repair step is used to regain the overall performance. With
very few update steps, we show excellent unlearning while substantially
retaining the overall model accuracy. Unlearning multiple classes requires a
similar number of update steps as for a single class, making our approach
scalable to large problems. Our method is quite efficient in comparison to the
existing methods, works for multi-class unlearning, does not put any
constraints on the original optimization mechanism or network design, and works
well in both small and large-scale vision tasks. This work is an important step
towards fast and easy implementation of unlearning in deep networks. Source

However, these applications are accompanied by the deployment of a massive
number of IoT devices that require a significant radio spectrum for wireless
connectivity. IoT devices usually have low data rate requirements and limited
power provision but desirably a long life.Recently, the development of passive
radio systems has opened new paradigms of spectrum sharing and coexistence.
These systems utilize the radio resources and infrastructure of the active
radio systems to perform their functionalities. By enabling the dependent
coexistence, a new technology named symbiotic radio (SRad) enables the
symbiotic relationships between the different radio systems ranging from mutual
benefits or competition in terms of sharing the resources, in particular for
IoT devices. This survey first provides the motivation for dependent
coexistence and background of spectrum sharing through coexistence along with
existing literature. Then, it describes the active and passive radio systems
definition and a brief overview. Afterward, the history of symbiosis and the
role of SRad technology in spectrum sharing and coexistence are defined while
focusing on symbiotic communication. Lastly, we discuss research challenges,

spreading in a constant population of individuals. Each individual is in one of
the states susceptible (${\bf S}$), infected (${\bf I}$) or recovered (${\bf

finite time interval. In the first part, we introduce a random life time or
duration of immunity which is drawn from a certain probability density
function. Once the time of immunity is elapsed an individual makes an
instantaneous transition to the susceptible state. By introducing a random
duration of immunity a memory effect is introduced into the process which
crucially determines the epidemic dynamics. In the second part, we investigate
the influence of the memory effect on the space-time dynamics of the epidemic
spreading by implementing this approach into computer simulations and employ a
multiple random walker's model. If a susceptible walker meets an infectious one
on the same site, then the susceptible one gets infected with a certain
probability. The computer experiments allow us to identify relevant parameters
for spread or extinction of an epidemic. In both parts, the finite duration of
immunity causes persistent oscillations in the number of infected individuals
with ongoing epidemic activity preventing the system from relaxation to a
steady state solution. Such oscillatory behavior is supported by real-life
observations and cannot be captured by standard SIR models.

The new criterion directly penalizes subband errors and includes a sparsity
penalty term which is minimized using the damped regularized Newton's method.
The impact of the proposed generalized PtNSAF (GPtNSAF) is studied for the
system identification problem via computer simulations. Specifically, we study
the effects of using different numbers of subbands and various sparsity penalty
terms for quasi-sparse, sparse, and dispersive systems. The results show that
the benefit of increasing the number of subbands is larger than promoting
sparsity of the estimated filter coefficients when the target system is
quasi-sparse or dispersive. On the other hand, for sparse target systems,
promoting sparsity becomes more important. More importantly, the two aspects
provide complementary and additive benefits to the GPtNSAF for speeding up
convergence.

by means of logratios. Logratios between pairs of compositional parts (pairwise
logratios) are the easiest to interpret in many research problems. When the
number of parts is large, some form of logratio selection is a must, for
instance by means of an unsupervised learning method based on a stepwise
selection of the pairwise logratios that explain the largest percentage of the
logratio variance in the compositional dataset. In this article we present
three alternative stepwise supervised learning methods to select the pairwise
logratios that best explain a dependent variable in a generalized linear model,
each geared for a specific problem. The first method features unrestricted
search, where any pairwise logratio can be selected. This method has a complex
interpretation if some pairs of parts in the logratios overlap, but it leads to
the most accurate predictions. The second method restricts parts to occur only
once, which makes the corresponding logratios intuitively interpretable. The
third method uses additive logratios, so that $K-1$ selected logratios involve
exactly $K$ parts. This method in fact searches for the subcomposition with the
highest explanatory power. Once the subcomposition is identified, the
researcher's favourite logratio representation may be used in subsequent
analyses, not only pairwise logratios. Our methodology allows logratios or
non-compositional covariates to be forced into the models based on theoretical
knowledge, and various stopping criteria are available based on information
measures or statistical significance with the Bonferroni correction. We present
an illustration of the three approaches on a dataset from a study predicting
Crohn's disease. The first method excels in terms of predictive power, and the
other two in interpretability.

is being refined, evolving into a rich and detailed picture. Our model moves
away from conventional black-box GAN architectures that feature a flat and

sample of 4-lepton events that could indicate a new scalar resonance produced
mainly via gluon-gluon fusion. These data suggest the existence of a new heavy
state $H$ whose mass $660\div 680$ GeV would fit well with the theoretical
range $M_H = 690 \pm 10 ~({\rm stat}) \pm 20 ~({\rm sys})~ {\rm GeV}$ for the
hypothetical second resonance of the Higgs field that has been recently
proposed and which would couple to longitudinal W's with the same typical
strength of the low-mass state at $125$ GeV. Since the total width $\Gamma_H$
is very poorly determined, to sharpen the analysis of the precious ATLAS data,
we have considered a particular correlation between resonating peak cross
section $\sigma_R(pp\to H \to 4l)$ and the ratio $\gamma_H=\Gamma_H/M_H$. This
correlation should be nearly insensitive to the precise value of $\Gamma_H$ and
mainly determined by the lower mass $m_h=$ 125 GeV. Equivalently, if this
correlation holds true, one could also fit $m_h$ from the 4-lepton data in the
high-mass range 620$\div$740 GeV. The result $(m_h)^{\rm fit} \sim (125 \pm
13)$ GeV reproduces the direct measurement of the Higgs particle mass and thus
supports the idea that $m_h$ and $M_H$ are the masses of two different
excitations of the same field. Therefore, if we combine with the excess at 680
GeV in the ATLAS $\gamma\gamma$ distribution, there are now two signals for a
new resonance in the same mass region. Even though, quantitatively, the global
statistical significance of each effect is modest, still the sharp correlation
$\gamma_H-\sigma_R$ in the 4-lepton channel should induce to consider seriously
these indications.

relatively weak longitudinal magnetic fields through magneto-optical (MO)
effects. We theoretically investigate the sensitivity of the scattering
polarization wings of the Ca I 4227 {\AA} line to the MO effects, and we
explore its diagnostic potential for inferring information on the longitudinal
component of the photospheric magnetic field. We calculate the intensity and
polarization profiles of the Ca I 4227 {\AA} line by numerically solving the
problem of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation under non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium conditions in one-dimensional semi-empirical models
of the solar atmosphere, taking into account the joint action of the Hanle,
Zeeman, and MO effects. We consider volume-filling magnetic fields as well as
magnetic fields occupying a fraction of the resolution element. In contrast to
the circular polarization signals produced by the Zeeman effect, we find that
the linear polarization angle in the scattering polarization wings of Ca I 4227
presents a clear sensitivity, through MO effects, not only to the flux of the
photospheric magnetic field, but also to the fraction of the resolution element
that the magnetic field occupies. We identify the linear polarization angle in
the wings of strong resonance lines as a valuable observable for diagnosing
unresolved magnetic fields. Used in combination with observables that encode
information on the magnetic flux and other properties of the observed
atmospheric region, it can provide constraints on the filling factor of the
magnetic field.

change in work organization is the switch to a 4-day work week, which some
companies investigated in experiments. Also, recent studies show that ASD teams
are affected by the switch to remote work since the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak
in 2020. Objective: Our study presents empirical findings on the effects on ASD
teams operating remote in a 4-day work week organization. Method: We performed
a qualitative single case study and conducted seven semi-structured interviews,
observed 14 agile practices and screened eight project documents and protocols
of agile practices. Results: We found, that the teams adapted the agile method
in use due to the change to a 4-day work week environment and the switch to
remote work. The productivity of the two ASD teams did not decrease. Although
the stress level of the ASD team member increased due to the 4-day work week,
we found that the job satisfaction of the individual ASD team members is
affected positively. Finally, we point to affects on social facets of the ASD

However, deep learning for 3D point clouds is still vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, e.g., iterative attacks, point transformation attacks, and generative

and a discriminator with an auxiliary classifier to generate realistic point

diverse pedestrian appearance features individually as most existing methods
do, we propose to perform contrastive learning to guide the feature learning in
such a way that the semantic distance between pedestrians with different

appearance diversities, whilst the distance between pedestrians and background

used in certain synchronizers, thus our improvement directly carries over to
such synchronizers. Furthermore, for keeping the \emph{total} number of

algorithm provides the following guarantees. Given $\beta\in (0,1]$, we compute
a low diameter decomposition with diameter bound $O\left(\frac{\log

advantages - being a direct measurement of the transmitted particles' charge,

difficulties in measuring it result in relatively few experimental works,
especially in single-atom structures. Here we describe a local shot-noise
measurement apparatus, and demonstrate successful noise measurements through
single-atom junctions. Our apparatus, based on a scanning tunneling microscope
operates at liquid helium temperatures. It includes a broadband commercial
amplifier mounted in close proximity to the tunnel junction, thus reducing both
thermal noise and the input capacitance that limit traditional noise
measurements. The full capabilities of the microscope are maintained in the

increment in the number of computing elements results in significant growth of

driving the transition to more energy-efficient solutions. Often upgrade of
computing resources is done step-by-step, i.e. parts of older supercomputers
are removed from service and replaced with newer ones. A single SCC at any time
can operate several computing systems with different performance and power
consumption. That is why the problem of scheduling parallel programs execution
on SCC resources to optimize energy consumption and minimize the increase in

presented work was the development of a new energy-efficient algorithm for
scheduling computing resources at SCC. To reach the goal the authors analyzed
methods of scheduling computing resources in a shared facility, including
energy consumption minimizing methods. The study made it possible to formulate
the problem of energy-efficient scheduling for a set of CCs and propose an

can be either smooth or rough. Endwall roughness induces more curved particle
trajectories, while a smooth cylindrical wall enhances drift near the endwall.
This drift induces recirculation cells near the endwall. The use of mixed
roughness (cylindrical wall and endwalls having different roughness) shows the
influence of each wall on the drift and curvature of particle trajectories as
well as the modification of the free surface topography. The effects act in
opposite directions and have variable magnitude along the length of the tumbler
such that their sum determines both direction of net drift and the
recirculation cells. Near the endwalls, the dominant effect is always the
endwall effect, and the axial drift for surface particles is toward the
endwalls. For long enough tumblers, a counter-rotating cell occurs adjacent to
each of the endwall cells having a surface drift toward the center because the
cylindrical wall effect is dominant there. These cells are not dynamically
coupled with the two endwall cells. The competition between the drifts induced
by the endwalls and the cylindrical wall determines the width and drift
amplitude for both types of cells.

suffers irrevocable instability in terminating the unbounded problem domains.
It remains an open question whether a stable PML-like absorbing boundary
condition exists. For wave scattering in a layered orthotropic medium, this
question is affirmatively answered for the first time in this paper. In each
orthotropic medium, the permittivity tensor uniquely determines a change of
coordinates, that transforms the governing anisotropic Helmholtz equation into
an isotropic Helmholtz equation in the new coordinate system. This leads us to
propose a novel Sommerfeld radiation condition (SRC) to rigorously characterize
outgoing waves in the layered orthotropic medium. Naturally, the SRC motivates
a regionalized PML (RPML) to truncate the scattering problem, in the sense that
a standard PML is set up in the new coordinate system in each orthotropic
region. It is revealed that the RPML is unconditionally stable compared with
the unstable uniaxial PML. A high-accuracy boundary integral equation (BIE)
method is developed to solve the resulting boundary value problem. Numerical
experiments are carried out to validate the stability of the RPML and the
accuracy of the BIE method, showing exponentially decaying truncation errors as
the RPML parameters increase.

equations, to which noise must be added in order to capture thermal
fluctuations. In almost all cases, the resulting coarse-grained stochastic
partial differential equations carry a short-scale cutoff -- which is also
reflected in numerical discretisation schemes. We draw together our recent
findings concerning the construction of such schemes and the interpretation of
their continuum limits, focusing for simplicity on models with a purely
diffusive scalar field, such as `Model B' which describes phase separation in
binary fluid mixtures. We address the requirement that the steady state entropy
production rate (EPR) must vanish for any stochastic hydrodynamic model in
thermal equilibrium. Only if this is achieved can the given discretisation
scheme be relied upon to correctly calculate the nonvanishing EPR for `active
field theories' in which new terms are deliberately added to the fluctuating
hydrodynamic equations that break detailed balance. To compute the correct
probabilities of forward and time-reversed paths (whose ratio determines the
EPR) we must make a careful treatment of so-called `spurious drift' and other
closely related terms that depend on the discretisation scheme. We show that
such subtleties can arise not only in the temporal discretisation (as is well
documented for stochastic ODEs with multiplicative noise) but also from spatial
discretisation, even when noise is additive, as most active field theories
assume. We then review how such noise can become multiplicative, via
off-diagonal couplings to additional fields that encode thermodynamically the
underlying chemical processes responsible for activity. In this case the
spurious drift terms need careful accounting, not just to evaluate correctly
the EPR, but also to numerically implement the Langevin dynamics itself.

sensors are currently the most effective remote perception devices, and the
sonar images captured by them could provide rich environment information. In
order to analyze a certain scene, we often need to merge the sonar images from
different periods, various sonar frequencies and distinctive viewpoints.
However, the above scenes will bring nonlinear intensity differences to the
sonar images, which will make traditional matching methods almost ineffective.
This paper proposes a non-linear intensity sonar image matching method that
combines local feature points and deep convolution features. This method has
two key advantages: (i) we generate data samples related to local feature
points based on the self-learning idea; (ii) we use the convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Siamese network architecture to measure the similarity of the
local position in the sonar image pair. Our method encapsulates the feature
extraction and feature matching stage in a model, and directly learns the
mapping function from image patch pairs to matching labels, and achieves
matching tasks in a near-end-to-end manner. Feature matching experiments are
carried out on the sonar images acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)
in the real underwater environment. Experiment results show that our method has
better matching effects and strong robustness.

during the impulsive phase of jet formation and slow velocity surges
surrounding hot jets after the reconnection phase. Plasma characteristics of
solar jets, such as the emission measure, temperature, and density have been
quantified. A multi-layer atmosphere at the reconnection site based on observed
IRIS spectra has been proposed. IRIS evidenced bidirectional flows at
reconnection sites, and tilt along the spectra which were interpreted as the
signature of twist in jets. The search of possible sites for reconnection could
be achieved by the analysis of magnetic topology. Combining Solar Dynamics
Observatory/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) vector magnetograms and IRIS
observations, it was found that reconnection site could be located at null
points in the corona as well as in bald patch regions low in the photosphere.
In one case study a magnetic sketch could explain the initiation of a jet

the transfer of twist from a flux rope to the jet during the magnetic

planes of the most massive stars spontaneously self-align within a narrow disc.
We present a maximum entropy method to systematically determine this long-term
distribution of orientations and use it for a wide range of stellar orbital
parameters and initial conditions. The heaviest stellar objects are found to
live within a thin equatorial disk. The thickness of this disk depends on the
stars' initial mass function, and on the geometry of the initial cluster. This
work highlights a possible (indirect) novel method to constrain the
distribution of intermediate mass black holes in galactic nuclei.

a graph based on quantum walks, and Grover's algorithm can be regarded as a
quantum walk-based search algorithm on a special graph. However, the existing
quantum walk-based search algorithms suffer severely from the souffl\'{e}
problem which mainly means that the success probability of finding a marked
vertex could shrink dramatically even to zero when the number of search steps
is greater than the right one, thus heavily reducing the robustness and
practicability of the algorithm. Surprisingly, while the souffl\'{e} problem of
Grover's algorithm has attracted enough attention, how to address this problem
for general quantum walk-based search algorithms is missing in the literature.
Here we initiate the study of overcoming the souffl\'{e} problem for quantum
walk-based search algorithms by presenting a new quantum walk-based search
framework that achieves robustness without sacrificing the quantum speedup. In
this framework, for any adjustable parameter $\epsilon$, the quantum algorithm
can find a marked vertex on an $N$-vertex {\it complete bipartite graph} with
probability at least $ 1-\epsilon$, whenever the number of search steps $h$
satisfies $h \geq \ln(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})\sqrt{N} + 1$. Note that the
algorithm need not know the exact number of marked vertices. Consequently, we
obtain quantum search algorithms with stronger robustness and practicability.

low-lighting conditions and in case high frame rates are required. To recover
the original spatial resolution, single-image super-resolution techniques can
be applied for upscaling. To achieve a higher image quality after upscaling, we
propose a novel binning concept using tetromino-shaped pixels. It is embedded
into the field of compressed sensing and the coherence is calculated to
motivate the sensor layouts used. Next, we investigate the reconstruction
quality using tetromino pixels for the first time in literature. Instead of
using different types of tetrominoes as proposed elsewhere, we show that using
a small repeating cell consisting of only four T-tetrominoes is sufficient. For
reconstruction, we use a locally fully connected reconstruction (LFCR) network
as well as two classical reconstruction methods from the field of compressed
sensing. Using the LFCR network in combination with the proposed tetromino
layout, we achieve superior image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and visually
compared to conventional single-image super-resolution using the very deep

diagnosis, which has become a hot and difficult research area in recent years.
As we know, there are large corpuses (segments) within one subject. However,
too large segments will increase the complexity of the classification model.
Besides, the clinicians interested in finding diagnostic speech markers that
reflect the pathology of the whole subject. Since the optimal relevant features
of each speech sample segment are different, it is difficult to find the
uniform diagnostic speech markers. Therefore, it is necessary to reconstruct
the existing large segments within one subject into few segments even one
segment within one subject, which can facilitate the extraction of relevant
speech features to characterize diagnostic markers for the whole subject. To
address this problem, an enveloped deep speech sample learning algorithm for
Parkinson's subjects based on multilayer fuzzy c-mean (MlFCM) clustering and
interlayer consistency preservation is proposed in this paper. The algorithm
can be used to achieve intra-subject sample reconstruction for Parkinson's
disease (PD) to obtain a small number of high-quality prototype sample
segments. At the end of the paper, several representative PD speech datasets
are selected and compared with the state-of-the-art related methods,
respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is
effective signifcantly.

release and a remote prominence oscillation, where the prominence has a
realistic thread-like structure. We used an open source magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) code known as MPI-AMRVAC to create a multithreaded prominence body. We
introduced an additional energy source from which a shock wave originates,
thereby inducing prominence oscillation. We studied two cases with different
source amplitudes to analyze its effect on the oscillations. Our results show
that the frequently used pendulum model does not suffice to fully estimate the
period of the prominence oscillation, in addition to showing that the influence
of the source and the thread-like prominence structure needs to be taken into
account. Repeated reflections and transmissions of the initial shock wave occur
at the specific locations of multiple high-temperature and high-density
gradients in the domain. This includes the left and right transition region
(TR) located at the footpoints of the magnetic arcade, as well as the various
transition regions between the prominence and the corona (PCTR). This results
in numerous interferences of compressional waves. They contribute to the
restoring forces of the oscillation, causing the period to deviate from the
expected pendulum model, in addition to leading to differences in attributed
damping or even growth in amplitude between the various threads. Along with the
global longitudinal motion that result from the shock impact, small-scale
transverse oscillations are also evident. Multiple high-frequency oscillations
represent the propagation of magnetoacoustic waves. The damping we see is
linked to the conversion of energy and its exchange with the surrounding
corona. Our simulations demonstrate the exchange of energy between different
threads and their different modes of oscillation.

threads are maintained to execute tasks concurrently. The workers repeatedly
pick tasks and execute them to completion. Each task is sequential, with
possibly recursive code, and tasks communicate over shared memory. Executing a
task can lead to more new tasks being spawned. We consider the safety
verification problem for thread-pooled programs. We parameterize the problem
with two parameters: the size of the thread pool as well as the number of
context switches for each task. The size of the thread pool determines the
number of workers running concurrently. The number of context switches
determines how many times a worker can be swapped out while executing a single
task - like many verification problems for multithreaded recursive programs,
the context bounding is important for decidability.
  We show that the safety verification problem for thread-pooled,
context-bounded, Boolean programs is EXPSPACE-complete, even if the size of the
thread pool and the context bound are given in binary. Our main result, the
EXPSPACE upper bound, is derived using a sequence of new succinct encoding
techniques of independent language-theoretic interest. In particular, we show a
polynomial-time construction of downward closures of languages accepted by
succinct pushdown automata as doubly succinct nondeterministic finite automata.
While there are explicit doubly exponential lower bounds on the size of
nondeterministic finite automata accepting the downward closure, our result
shows these automata can be compressed. We show that thread pooling
significantly reduces computational power: in contrast, if only the context
bound is provided in binary, but there is no thread pooling, the safety
verification problem becomes 3EXPSPACE-complete.

stack for the noisy intermediatescale quantum (NISQ) device. It has a
significant impact on the reliability of computational tasks on NISQ devices.
To improve the overall fidelity of physical circuits, we propose a quantum
circuit mapping method based on multi-agent cooperation. This approach
considers the Spatio-temporal variation of quantum operation quality on the
NISQ device when inserting ancillary operation. It consists of two core
components: the qubit placement algorithm and the qubit routing method. The
qubit placement algorithm exploits the iterated local search framework to find
a desirable initial mapping for the reduced symmetric form of the original
circuit. The qubit routing method generates the physical circuit through
multi-agent communication and collaboration. Each agent inserts the ancillary
gates independently according to its environment state. The quality of the
physical circuit evolves according to an information-exchanging mechanism
between agents, which combines the local search and global search. To
experiment on the benchmark circuits (with hundreds of quantum gates) beyond
the capacity of current NISQ devices, we build a noisy simulator with gate
error 10x lower than that of the latest NISQ device of IBM. The experimental
results confirm the performance of our approach in improving circuit fidelity.
Compared with the stateof-the-art method, our method can improve the success
rate by 25.86% on average and 95.42% at maximum.

filled with cold plasma. Observations have shown that transverse oscillations
are frequent in these solar structures. The observations are usually
interpreted as the fundamental kink mode, while the detection of the first
harmonic remains elusive. Here, we aim to study how the density inhomogeneity
in the longitudinal and radial directions modify the periods and damping times
of kink oscillations, and how this effect would be reflected in observations.
We solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations through two different
methods: a) performing 3D numerical simulations, and b) solving a 2D
generalised eigenvalue problem. We study the dependence of the periods, damping
times and amplitudes of transverse kink oscillations on the ratio between the
densities at the centre and at the ends of the tube, and on the average
density. We apply forward modelling on our 3D simulations to compute synthetic
H$\alpha$ profiles. We confirm that the ratio of the period of the fundamental
oscillation mode to the period of the first harmonic increases as the ratio of
the central density to the footpoint density is increased or as the averaged
density of the tube is decreased. We find that the damping times due to
resonant absorption decrease as the central to footpoint density ratio
increases. Contrary to the case of longitudinally homogeneous tubes, we find
that the damping time to period ratio also increases as the density ratio is
increased or the average density is reduced. We present snapshots and
time-distance diagrams of the emission in the H$\alpha$ line. The results
presented here have implications for the field of prominence seismology. While
the H$\alpha$ emission can be used to detect the fundamental mode, the first
harmonic is barely detectable in H$\alpha$. This may explain the lack of
detections of the first harmonic.

The Subspace Iteration Method is a robust solver for these problems. In
practice, however, Lanczos schemes are often faster. In this paper, we
introduce the Hierarchical Subspace Iteration Method (HSIM), a novel solver for
sparse eigenproblems that operates on a hierarchy of nested vector spaces. The
hierarchy is constructed such that on the coarsest space all eigenpairs can be
computed with a dense eigensolver. HSIM uses these eigenpairs as initialization
and iterates from coarse to fine over the hierarchy. On each level, subspace
iterations, initialized with the solution from the previous level, are used to
approximate the eigenpairs. This approach substantially reduces the number of
iterations needed on the finest grid compared to the non-hierarchical Subspace
Iteration Method. Our experiments show that HSIM can solve Laplace--Beltrami
eigenproblems on meshes faster than state-of-the-art methods based on Lanczos
iterations, preconditioned conjugate gradients and subspace iterations.

a challenging task. The crucial point is to save computational cost and

time scale choice, which put an obstacle to solve the above issues. First one
is the numerical restriction. A number of research is dedicated to overcome
this limitation and it is shown that it can be relaxed with innovative
numerical schemes. The second one is the physical restriction. It is imposed by
properties of a material, phenomena itself and corresponding boundary
conditions. This work is focused on the study of a methodology that enables to
overcome the physical restriction on the time grid. So-called Average Reduced
Model (ARM) is suggested. It is based on smoothing the time-dependent boundary
conditions. Besides, the approximate solution is decomposed into average and
fluctuating components. The primer is obtained by integrating the equations
over time, whereas the latter is an user-defined empirical model. The
methodology is investigated for both heat diffusion and coupled heat and mass
transfer. It is demonstrated that the signal core of the boundary conditions is
preserved and the physical restriction can be relaxed. The model proved to be
reliable, accurate and efficient also in comparison with the experimental data
of two years. The implementation of the scarce time-step of $1 \, \sf{h}$ is
justified.
  It is shown, that by maintaining the tolerable error it is possible to cut
computational effort up to almost four times in comparison with the complete

In the field of Post-Silicon Validation for semiconductor devices (PSV), data
sets are typically provided that consist of various devices like, e.g., chips
of different manufacturing lines. In PSV, the task is to approximate the
underlying function of the data with multiple learning algorithms, each trained
on a device-specific subset, instead of improving the performance of arbitrary
classifiers on the entire data set. Furthermore, the expectation is that an
unknown number of subsets describe functions showing very different
characteristics. Corresponding ensemble members, which are called outliers, can
heavily influence the approximation. Our method aims to find a suitable
approximation that is robust to outliers and represents the best or worst case
in a way that will apply to as many types as possible. A 'soft-max' or
'soft-min' function is used in place of a maximum or minimum operator. A Neural
Network (NN) is trained to learn this 'soft-function' in a two-stage process.
First, we select a subset of ensemble members that is representative of the
best or worst case. Second, we combine these members and define a weighting
that uses the properties of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to increase the
influence of non-outliers and to decrease outliers. The weighting ensures
robustness to outliers and makes sure that approximations are suitable for most

high security defense systems, such as Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Low
Probability of Interception (LPI), or Low Prob-ability of Exploitation (LPE)
communication algorithms, are studied to prevent the military force loss. One
of the LPD, LPI, and LPE communication algorithm, physical-layer security, has
been discussed and studied. We propose a noise signaling system, a type of
physical-layer secu-rity, which modifies conventionally modulated I/Q data into
a noise-like shape. For presenting the possibility of realistic implementation,
we use Software-Defined Radio (SDR). Since there are certain limitations of
hardware, we present the limitations, requirements, and preferences of
practical implementation of noise signaling system, and the proposed system is
ring-shaped signaling. We present the ring-shaped signaling system algorithm,
SDR implementation meth-odology, and performance evaluations of the system by
the metrics of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Probability of Modulation
Identification (PMI), which we obtain by Convolutional Neural Net-work (CNN)
algorithm. We conclude that the ring-shaped signaling system can perform a high
LPI/LPE communication function due to the eavesdropper cannot obtain the
correct used modu-lation scheme information, and the performance can vary by
the configurations of the I/Q data modifying factors.

stability is ensured by using a recently proposed purely location-based

inference, the decoder is unrolled and acoustic feature generation is performed
in a streaming manner, allowing for a nearly constant latency which is
independent from the sentence length. Experimental results show that the

the maximum geodesic distance from any point in $P$ to its nearest vertex in
$S$. Alternatively, viewing each vertex in $S$ as a site to start a fire, the
goal is to select $S$ such that fires burning simultaneously and uniformly from

that PB is NP-hard when $k$ is arbitrary. We show that the discrete $k$-center
of the vertices of $P$ under the geodesic metric on $P$ provides a

CD$_3$OH in low-lying torsional states that is sufficiently accurate to
facilitate further searches for CD$_3$OH in space. We performed a new
measurement campaign for CD$_3$OH involving three spectroscopic laboratories
that covers the 34 GHz-1.1 THz and the 20-900 cm$^{-1}$ ranges. The analysis
was performed using the torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the
rho-axis method. We determined a model that describes the ground and first
excited torsional states of CD$_3$OH, up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 55$

observations. This list is accurate up to at least 1.1 THz and should be
sufficient for all types of radio-astronomical searches for this methanol

Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293-2422 using ALMA. CD$_3$OH is securely
detected in the data, with a large number of clearly separated and

temperature and magnetic field. Recently, magnetic quantum oscillations and
metallic low-temperature thermal conductivity have been observed in the Kondo
insulator YbB$_{12}$, whose resistivity is a few orders of magnitude higher
than those of conventional metals. As yet, these unusual observations are not
fully understood. Here we present a detailed investigation of the behavior of
YbB$_{12}$ under intense magnetic fields using both transport and torque
magnetometry measurements. A low-field Hall anomaly, reminiscent of the Hall
response associated with ""strange-metal"" physics, develops at $T < 1.5$ K. At
two characteristic magnetic fields ($\mu_0H_1= 19.6$ T and $\mu_0H_2 \sim 31$
T), signatures appear in the Hall coefficient, magnetic torque, and
magnetoresistance. We suggest that they are likely to be field-induced Lifshitz
transitions. Moreover, above 35 T, the background resistivity displays an
unusual, nonmetallic $T^{\alpha}$-behavior, with $\alpha$ being field-dependent
and varying between -1.5 and -2. By normalizing the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillation amplitude to this $T^{\alpha}$-dependence, the calculated cyclotron
mass becomes more consistent with that deduced from de Haas-van Alphen
oscillations. Our results support a novel two-fluid scenario in YbB$_{12}$: a
Fermi-liquid-like fluid of charge-neutral quasiparticles coexists with charge
carriers that remain in a nonmetallic state. The former experience successive
Lifshitz transitions and develop Landau quantization in applied magnetic
fields, whilst scattering between both fluids allows the Shubnikov-de Haas
effect to be observed in the electrical transport.

present a relatively straightforward generalization of this idea: the primary
computational task that the brain is faced with is to track the probabilistic
structure of observations themselves, without recourse to hidden states. Taking
this starting point seriously turns out to have considerable explanatory power,
and several key ideas are developed from it: (1) past experience, encoded in
prior expectations, has an influence over the future that is analogous to
regularization as known from machine learning; (2) action generation
(interpreted as constraint satisfaction) is a special case of such
regularization; (3) the concept of attractors in dynamical systems provides a
useful lens through which prior expectations, regularization, and action
induction can be viewed; these thus appear as different perspectives on the
same phenomenon; (4) the phylogenetically ancient imperative of acting to
ensure and thereby observe conditions beneficial for survival is likely the
same as that which underlies perceptual inference. The Bayesian brain
hypothesis has been touted as promising to deliver a ""unified science of mind

a final contraction. In this paper we review the chances which may await our
universe. In particular, there are new possible singular fates (sudden
singularities, big rip...), but there also other evolutions which cannot be
considered as singular. In addition to this, some of the singular fates are not
strong enough in the sense that the spacetime can be extended beyond the
singularity. For deriving our results we make use of generalised power and
asymptotic expansions of the scale factor of the universe.

from Whiting 1 and NGC 7492, which are projected against the Sagittarius
stream, we see no evidence for adjacent stellar populations to indicate any of
these clusters is associated with coherent tidal debris from a destroyed host
dwarf. We also find no evidence for tidal tails around any of the clusters in
our sample; however, both NGC 1904 and 6981 appear to possess outer envelopes.
Motivated by a slew of recent Gaia-based discoveries, we compile a sample of
clusters with robust detections of extra-tidal structure, and search for
correlations with orbital properties. While we observe that clusters with tidal
tails are typically on moderately or very eccentric orbits that are highly
inclined to the Galactic plane and often retrograde, these are neither
necessary nor sufficient conditions for the formation of extra-tidal structure.
That many objects with tidal tails appear to be accreted leads us to speculate
that this lack of consistency may stem from the inhomogeneous dynamical history
of the Milky Way globular cluster system. Finally, we note that clusters with
prominent stellar envelopes detected in ground-based imaging (such as NGC 1851
and 7089) are now all known from Gaia to possess long tidal tails --
experimental confirmation that the presence of an extended envelope is
indicative of tidal erosion.

suggest that these brightness asymmetries bf could be caused by large-scale
anticyclonic vortices triggered by the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI), which can
be excited at the edges of the accretionally inactive region, the dead zone
edge. Since vortices may play a key role in planet formation, investigating the
conditions of the onset of RWI and the long-term evolution of vortices is
inevitable. The aim of our work was to explore the effect of disc geometry (the
vertical thickness of the disc), viscosity, the width of the transition region
at the dead zone edge, and the disc mass on the onset, lifetime, strength and
evolution of vortices formed in the disc. We performed a parametric study
assuming different properties for the disc and the viscosity transition by
running 1980 2D hydrodynamic simulations in the locally isothermal assumption
with disc self-gravity included. Our results revealed that long-lived,
large-scale vortex formation favours a shallow surface density slope and low-
or moderate disc masses with Toomre $Q \lesssim 1/h$, where $h$ is the
geometric aspect ratio of the disc. In general, in low viscosity models,
stronger vortices form. However, rapid vortex decay and re-formation is more
widespread in these discs.

significantly increasing the quality of feature selection solutions achievable,

the original function at the final exploitation phase.

reduces the computation time compared to a baseline wrapper Genetic Algorithm

experiments show that SAGA can arrive at near-optimal solutions three times
faster than a wrapper GA, on average. We also showcase the importance of

the trained model tends to behave differently on its training data. We argue
that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures.
Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high
false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution

generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite
number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other
words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than

establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and
making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class
of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
  We first show how to efficiently ""dequantize"", with arbitrarily small
constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply
this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant
precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a
central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum
chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when
given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state)
can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a
complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same
problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the
superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that
said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum
setting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make

real-world graphs containing private information while maintaining the utility

and the introduction of the differentially private stochastic gradient descent
(DP-SGD) algorithm has facilitated the training of private neural models in a
number of domains. Recent advances in graph generation via deep generative
networks have produced several high performing models. We evaluate and compare
state-of-the-art models including adjacency matrix based models and edge based
models, and show a practical implementation that favours the edge-list approach
utilizing the Gaussian noise mechanism when evaluated on commonly used graph
datasets. Based on our findings, we propose a generative model that can
reproduce the properties of real-world networks while maintaining
edge-differential privacy. The proposed model is based on a stochastic neural
network that generates discrete edge-list samples and is trained using the
Wasserstein GAN objective with the DP-SGD optimizer. Being the first approach
to combine these beneficial properties, our model contributes to further
research on graph data privacy.

deficient. Recently, physics informed neural network (PINN) is popular to solve
the fluid flow problems, which basic concept is to embed the governing equation
and continuity equation into loss function, with the requirement of less
dataset for obtaining a reliable neural network. In this paper, the
mixed-variable PINN method, which convert the governing equation into continuum
and constitutive formulations, is proposed to solve the fluid dynamics (flow
past cylinder) without any labeled data. The initial/boundary conditions with
penalty factors are also embedded into the loss function to become a
well-imposed problem. The results show that mixed-variable PINN has better
predictive ability to construct the flow field than traditional PINN scheme.
Furthermore, the transfer learning method is adopted to is solve the fluid
solutions with different Reynold numbers with less computational cost. The
results also demonstrate that the transfer learning method can well simulate
the different Reynolds number in a short time.

be highly accurate and efficient for subtomogram classification, but suffer
from limited applicability due to scarcity of annotated data. While generating
simulated data for training supervised models is a potential solution, a
sizeable difference in the image intensity distribution in generated data as
compared to real experimental data will cause the trained models to perform
poorly in predicting classes on real subtomograms. In this work, we present
Cryo-Shift, a fully unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization framework
for deep learning-based cross-domain subtomogram classification. We use
unsupervised multi-adversarial domain adaption to reduce the domain shift
between features of simulated and experimental data. We develop a
network-driven domain randomization procedure with `warp' modules to alter the
simulated data and help the classifier generalize better on experimental data.
We do not use any labeled experimental data to train our model, whereas some of
the existing alternative approaches require labeled experimental samples for
cross-domain classification. Nevertheless, Cryo-Shift outperforms the existing
alternative approaches in cross-domain subtomogram classification in extensive
evaluation studies demonstrated herein using both simulated and experimental
data.

Spectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars, which combines all types of

present the SPIPS modeling of a sample of 63 Galactic Cepheids. Adopting Gaia
EDR3 parallaxes as an input associated with the best available dataset, we
derive consistent values of parameters for these stars such as the radius,
multiband apparent magnitudes, effective temperatures, color excesses, period
changes, Fourier parameters, and the projection factor. We then derive new
calibrations of the period-luminosity and period-radius relations. After
investigating the dependences of the p-factor on the parameters of the stars,
we find a high dispersion of its values and no evidence of its correlation with
the period or with any other parameters. Statistically, the p-factor has an
average value of p=1.26$\pm$0.07, but with an unsatisfactory agreement. In
absence of any clear correlation between the p-factor and other quantities, the

produced a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Matlab which allows the overlay of
known set information onto the loadings plot and thus improves the
interpretability of the multi-variate model. For each known set the optimal
convex hull, covering a subset of elements from the known set, is found through
a search algorithm and displayed. In this paper we discuss two main topics; the
details of the search algorithm for the optimal convex hull for this problem
and the GUI interface which is freely available for download for academic use.

for the JAXA/ISAS second strategic large class mission, LiteBIRD, and estimate
its impact on the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter, r, using
simulated data. We generate a set of simulated sky maps with CMB and polarized
foreground emission, and inject instrumental noise and polarization angle
offsets to the 22 (partially overlapping) LiteBIRD frequency channels. Our
in-flight angle calibration relies on nulling the EB cross correlation of the
polarized signal in each channel. This calibration step has been carried out by
two independent groups with a blind analysis, allowing an accuracy of the order
of a few arc-minutes to be reached on the estimate of the angle offsets. Both
the corrected and uncorrected multi-frequency maps are propagated through the
foreground cleaning step, with the goal of computing clean CMB maps. We employ
two component separation algorithms, the Bayesian-Separation of Components and
Residuals Estimate Tool (B-SeCRET), and the Needlet Internal Linear Combination
(NILC). We find that the recovered CMB maps obtained with algorithms that do
not make any assumptions about the foreground properties, such as NILC, are
only mildly affected by the angle miscalibration. However, polarization angle
offsets strongly bias results obtained with the parametric fitting method. Once
the miscalibration angles are corrected by EB nulling prior to the component
separation, both component separation algorithms result in an unbiased
estimation of the r parameter. While this work is motivated by the conceptual
design study for LiteBIRD, its framework can be broadly applied to any CMB
polarization experiment. In particular, the combination of simulation plus
blind analysis provides a robust forecast by taking into account not only
detector sensitivity but also systematic effects.

particles grow Brownian, sediment to the midplane and drift radially inward.
When collisional compaction sets in, the growing aggregates collect slower and
therefore dynamically smaller particles. This sedimentation and growth phase of
highly porous ice and dust aggregates is simulated with laboratory experiments
in which we obtained mm- to cm-sized ice aggregates with a porosity of 90\% as
well as cm-sized dust agglomerates with a porosity of 85\%. We modelled the
growth process during sedimentation in an analytical calculation to compute the
agglomerate sizes when they reach the midplane of the protoplanetary disc. In
the midplane, the dust particles form a thin dense layer and gain relative
velocities by, e.g., the streaming instability or the onset of shear
turbulence. To investigate also these collisions, we performed additional
laboratory drop tower experiments with the high-porosity aggregates formed in
the sedimentary-growth experiments and determined their mechanical parameters,
including their sticking threshold velocity, which is important for their
further collisional evolution on their way to form planetesimals. Finally, we
developed a method to calculate the packing-density-dependent fundamental
properties of our dust and ice agglomerates, the Young's modulus, the Poisson
ratio, the shear viscosity and the bulk viscosity from compression
measurements. With these parameters, it was possible to derive the coefficient
of restitution which fits our measurements. In order to physically describe
these outcomes, we applied a collision model. With this model, predictions
about general dust-aggregate collisions are possible.

of NH4+, PO43- and transition metals are environmentally harmful and toxic
pollutants. At the same time phosphorous and transition metals constitute
highly valuable resources. Typically, separate pathways have been considered to
extract hazardous transition metals or phosphate, independently from each
other. Investigations on the simultaneous removal of multiple components have
been studied only to a limited extent. Here, we report the synthesis routes for
Co- and Ni-struvites (NH4MPO4.6H2O, M = Ni2+, Co2+ ), which allow for P,
ammonia and metal co precipitation. By evaluating different reaction
parameters, the phase and stability of transition metal struvites, as well as
their crystal morphologies, and sizes could be optimized. Ni-struvite is stable
in a wide reactant concentration range and at different metal/phosphorus (M/P)
ratios, whereas Co-struvite only forms at low M/P ratios. Detailed
investigations of the precipitation process using ex situ and in situ
techniques provided insights into the crystallization mechanisms/crystal
engineering of these materials. M-struvites crystallize via intermediate
colloidal nanophases, which subsequently aggregate and condense to final
crystals after extended reaction times. However, the exact reaction kinetics of
the formation of a final crystalline product varies significantly depending on
the metal cation involved in the precipitation process: several seconds (Mg) to
minutes (Ni) to hours (Co). The achieved level of control over the morphology
and size, makes precipitation of metal struvites a promising method for direct
metal recovery and binding them in the form of valuable phosphate raw
materials. Under this paradigm, the crystals can be potentially upcycled as
precursor powders for electrochemical applications, which require transition
metal phosphates (TMPs).

recognized issue that the second-order, scalar-induced gravitational waves are
gauge dependent. This issue arises because they are not well-defined as tensors
in the physical spacetime at second-order and are thus unphysical. In this
paper, we propose the covariant transverse-traceless projection of the
extrinsic curvature to study cosmological gravitational waves on a spatial
hypersurface. We define a new energy density which is based purely on spacetime
tensors, independent of perturbation theory, and thus is gauge invariant by
definition. We show that, in the context of second-order perturbation theory,
this new energy density contains only propagating modes in the constant-time
hypersurface in the Newtonian gauge. We further show that we can recover the
same gravitational waves after a transformation to the synchronous gauge, so
long as we correctly identify the Newtonian hypersurface.

semiconductor quantum dots are currently leading the efforts toward spin-based
quantum information processing. The virtual absence of spinful nuclei in
purified samples yields long qubit coherence times and the intricate coupling
between spin and momentum in the valence band can provide very fast
spin-orbit-based qubit control, e.g., via electrically induced modulations of
the heavy-hole $g$-tensor. A thorough understanding of all aspects of the
interplay between spin-orbit coupling, the confining potentials, and applied
magnetic fields is thus quintessential for the development of the optimal
hole-spin-based qubit platform. Here we theoretically investigate the
manifestation of the effective $g$-tensor and effective mass of heavy holes in
two-dimensional hole gases as well as in lateral quantum dots. We include the
effects of the anisotropy of the effective Luttinger Hamiltonian (particularly
relevant for Si-based systems) and we focus on the detailed role of the
orientation of the transverse confining potential. We derive most general
analytic expressions for the anisotropic $g$-tensor and we present a general

localized holes due to various types of spin-orbit interaction, exemplifying
the approach by including a simple linear Rashba-like term. Our results thus
contribute to the understanding needed to find optimal points in parameter

spin-orbit-mediated electric control over the spin states is efficient.

Following the basic idea of Deng et al. [Phys. Rev. B 79, 075114 (2009)] and
extensions by Lanata et al. [Phys. Rev. B 85, 035133 (2012)], the ground state
is variationally determined through optimizing the total energy with respect to
the variational single particle density matrix (n0), which is called ""outer
loop"". In the corresponding ""inner loop"" where n0 is fixed, the non-interacting
wave function and the parameters contained in the Gutzwiller projector are
determined by a two-step iterative approach. All derivatives of the
implementation process have been analytically derived, which allows us to apply
some advanced minimization or root-searching algorithms for both the inner and
outer loops leading to the highly efficient convergence. In addition, an atomic
diagonalization method taking the point group symmetry into account has been
developed for the customized design of the Gutzwiller projector, making it
convenient to explore many interesting orders at a lower cost of computation.
As benchmarks, several different types of correlated models have been studied
utilizing the proposed method, which are in perfect agreement with the previous
results by DMFT and multi-orbital slave-boson mean field method. Compared with
the linear mixing method, the newton method with analytical derivatives shows
much faster convergence for the inner loop. As for the outer loop, the
minimization using analytical derivatives also shows much better stability and
efficiency compared with that using numerical derivatives.

In this context, with recent advancements in computer-vision based techniques,

trajectories from traffic scenes. However, classifying these trajectories by
movement type is quite challenging as characteristics of motion trajectories
obtained this way vary depending on camera calibrations. Although some existing
methods have addressed such classification tasks with decent accuracies, the
performance of these methods significantly relied on manual specification of
several regions of interest. In this study, we proposed an automated

left-turn and through movements) of vision-based vehicle trajectories. Our
classification framework identifies different movement patterns observed in a
traffic scene using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering technique
Thereafter a similarity-based assignment strategy is adopted to assign incoming
vehicle trajectories to identified movement groups. A new similarity measure
was designed to overcome the inherent shortcomings of vision-based
trajectories. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed classification approach and its ability to adapt to different traffic
scenarios without any manual intervention.

supermassive black holes as well as the dynamics and population of stars in the
centers of galaxies. In this Letter, we focus on studying how the debris disk
formation and circularization processes can impact the possibility of observing
prompt flares in TDEs. First, we investigate how the efficiency of disk
formation is determined by the key parameters, namely, the black hole mass
$M_{BH}$, the stellar mass $m_\star$, and the orbital penetration parameter
$\beta$ that quantifies how close the disrupted star would orbit around the
black hole. Then we calculate the intrinsic differential TDE rate as a function
of these three parameters. Combining these two results, we find that the rates
of TDEs with prompt disk formation are significantly suppressed around lighter
black holes, which provides a plausible explanation for why the observed TDE
host black hole mass distribution peaks between $10^6$ and $10^7M_\odot$.
Therefore, the consideration of the disk formation efficiency is crucial for
recovering the intrinsic black hole demographics from TDEs. Furthermore, we
find that the efficiency of the disk formation process also impacts the
distributions of both stellar orbital penetration parameter and stellar mass
observed in TDEs.

agent has a private type and settings in which the agent takes a hidden action.
Many practical problems, however, involve aspects of both. For example, brand X
may seek to hire an influencer Y to create sponsored content to be posted on
social media platform Z. This problem has a hidden action component (the brand
may not be able or willing to observe the amount of effort exerted by the
influencer), but also a private type component (influencers may have different
costs per unit-of-effort).
  This ""effort"" and ""cost per unit-of-effort"" perspective naturally leads to a
principal-agent problem with hidden action and single-dimensional private type,
which generalizes both the classic principal-agent hidden action model of
contract theory \`a la Grossman and Hart [1983] and the (procurement version)
of single-dimensional mechanism design \`a la Myerson [1981]. A natural goal in
this model is to design an incentive-compatible contract, which consist of an
allocation rule that maps types to actions, and a payment rule that maps types
to payments for the stochastic outcomes of the chosen action.
  Our main contribution is a linear programming (LP) duality based
characterization of implementable allocation rules for this model, which
applies to both discrete and continuous types. This characterization shares
important features of Myerson's celebrated characterization result, but also
departs from it in significant ways. We present several applications, including
a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal contract with a constant
number of actions. This is in sharp contrast to recent work on hidden action
problems with multi-dimensional private information, which has shown that the
problem of computing an optimal contract for constant numbers of actions is
APX-hard.

generated left modules of finite projective dimension over a basic Artin

contravariant finiteness of $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty} (\Lambda$ -mod$)$ in
$\Lambda$-mod to corner algebras $e \Lambda e$ for suitable idempotents $e \in
\Lambda$. The reduction substantially facilitates access to the numerous
homological benefits entailed by contravariant finiteness of

fact that this finiteness condition is known to be equivalent to the existence
of a strong tilting object in $\Lambda$-mod. We characterize the situation in
which the process of strongly tilting $\Lambda$-mod allows for arbitrary
iteration: This occurs precisely when, in the strongly tilted module category
mod-$\widetilde{\Lambda}$, the subcategory of modules of finite projective
dimension is in turn contravariantly finite; the latter can, once again, be
tested on suitable corners $e \Lambda e$ of the original algebra $\Lambda$. In
the (frequently occurring) positive case, the sequence of consecutive strong
tilts, $\widetilde{\Lambda}$, $ \widetilde{\widetilde{\Lambda}}$,
$\widetilde{\widetilde{\widetilde{\Lambda}}}, \dots$, is shown to be periodic
with period $2$ (up to Morita equivalence); moreover, any two adjacent

fluorescence from the excited states; and the secondary fluorescence from the
metastable state (forbidden lines). We find that the synergy of these lines
could measure three-dimensional magnetic direction: the polarizations of the
primary fluorescence lines could reveal the magnetic polar angle along the
line-of-sight, whereas the polarization of forbidden lines traces the
plane-of-sky magnetic direction. The expected degree of polarization is
$P>10\%$. Polarizations of both types of fluorescence emissions have shown
strong potential for observations, and are applicable to measure magnetic field

states comprising excitonic and plasmonic properties. Here we are studying the
wave-vector dependent photo-excitations in gold layers covered by molecular
films of zinc-phthalocyanine and its fluorinated derivatives (FnZnPc, with n =
0,4,8,16). These layered metal-organic samples show up to four anti-crossings
in their dispersions correlating in energy with the respective degree of ZnPc
fluorination. By means of complementary structural and theoretical data, we
attribute the observed anti-crossings to three main scenarios of surface
plasmon coupling: i) to aggregated $\alpha $-phase regions within the FnZnPc
layers at 1.75 eV and 1.85 eV , ii) to a coexisting F16ZnPc $\beta $-polymorph
at 1.51 eV, and iii) to monomers, preferentially located at the metal
interface, at 2.15 eV. Whereas energy and splitting of the monomer
anti-crossings depend on strength and average tilting of the molecular dipole
moments, the aggregate related anti-crossings show a distinct variation with
degree of fluorination. These observations can be consistently explained by a
change in FnZnPc dipole density induced by an increased lattice spacing due to
the larger molecular van der Waals radii upon fluorination. The reported
results prove Au/FnZnPc bilayers a model system to demonstrate the high
sensitivity of exciton-plasmon coupling on the molecular alignment at
microscopic length scales.

practices. ASATs are able to warn developers about potential problems in the
code. On the one hand, ASATs are based on best practices so there should be a
noticeable effect on software quality. On the other hand, ASATs suffer from
false positive warnings, which developers have to inspect and then ignore or
mark as invalid. In this article, we ask the question if ASATs have a
measurable impact on external software quality, using the example of PMD for
Java. We investigate the relationship between ASAT warnings emitted by PMD on
defects per change and per file. Our case study includes data for the history
of each file as well as the differences between changed files and the project
in which they are contained. We investigate whether files that induce a defect
have more static analysis warnings than the rest of the project. Moreover, we
investigate the impact of two different sets of ASAT rules. We find that, bug
inducing files contain less static analysis warnings than other files of the
project at that point in time. However, this can be explained by the overall
decreasing warning density. When compared with all other changes, we find a
statistically significant difference in one metric for all rules and two
metrics for a subset of rules. However, the effect size is negligible in all
cases, showing that the actual difference in warning density between bug
inducing changes and other changes is small at best.

normal-form games. In such games, the payoffs resulting from joint actions are
vector-valued. Taking a utility-based approach, we assume there exists a
utility function for each player which maps vectors to scalar utilities and
consider agents that aim to maximise the utility of expected payoff vectors. As
agents typically do not know their opponent's utility function or strategy,
they must learn policies to interact with each other. Inspired by Stackelberg
games, we introduce four novel preference communication protocols to aid agents
in arriving at adequate solutions. Each protocol describes a specific approach
for one agent to communicate preferences over their actions and how another
agent responds. Additionally, to study when communication emerges, we introduce
a communication protocol where agents must learn when to communicate. These
protocols are subsequently evaluated on a set of five benchmark games against
baseline agents that do not communicate. We find that preference communication
can alter the learning process and lead to the emergence of cyclic policies
which had not been previously observed in this setting. We further observe that
the resulting policies can heavily depend on the characteristics of the game
that is played. Lastly, we find that communication naturally emerges in both
cooperative and self-interested settings.

markets between different assets that live on that chain. In this paper we are
examining a specific class of AMMs called Constant Function Market Makers whose
trading profile, ignoring fees, is determined by their bonding curve. This
class of AMM suffers from what is commonly referred to as Impermanent Loss,
which we have previously identified as the Gamma component of the associated
self-financing trading strategy and which is the risk that LP providers wager
against potential fee earnings.
  The recent Uniswap v3 release has popularized the concept of leveraged
liquidity provision - wherein the trading range in which liquidity is provided
is reduced and achieves a higher degree of capital efficiency through
elimination of unused collateral. This leverage increases the fees earned, but
it also increases the risk taken, ie the IL. Fee levels on Uniswap v3 are well
publicized so, in this paper, we focus on calculating the IL.
  We found that for the 17 pools we analyzed, covering 43% of TVL and chosen by
size, composite tokens and data availability, total fees earned since inception
until the cut-off date was $199.3m. We also found that the total IL suffered by
LPs during this period was USD 260.1m, meaning that in aggregate those LPs
would have been better off by USD 60.8m had they simply HODLd.

exoplanetary discoveries, as the detection and characterisation of very young
planets is extremely challenging due to the intense stellar activity of their
host stars. However, the recent discoveries of young planetary transiting
systems allow to place initial constraints on evolutionary models. With an
estimated age of 20 million years, V1298\,Tau is one of the youngest solar-type
stars known to host transiting planets: it harbours a multiple system composed
of two Neptune-sized, one Saturn-sized, and one Jupiter-sized planets. Here we
report the analysis of an intense radial velocity campaign, revealing the
presence of two periodic signals compatible with the orbits of two of its
planets. We find that planet b, with an orbital period of 24 days, has a mass
of 0.64 Jupiter masses and a density similar to the giant planets of the Solar
System and other known giant exoplanets with significantly older ages. Planet
e, with an orbital period of 40 days, has a mass of 1.16 Jupiter masses and a
density larger than most giant exoplanets. This is unexpected for planets at
such a young age and suggests that some giant planets might evolve and contract
faster than anticipated, thus challenging current models of planetary
evolution.

considerable progress due to rapid developments in the field of quantum sensing
using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. These optically active defects in the
diamond lattice have been used to probe unprecedented small volumes on the
picoliter range with high spectral resolution. However, the NMR signal size
depends strongly on both the diamond sensor's and sample's geometry. Using
Monte-Carlo integration of sample spin dipole moments, the magnetic field
projection along the orientation of the NV center for different geometries has
been analysed. We show that the NMR signal strongly depends on the NV-center
orientation with respect to the diamond surface. While the signal of currently
used planar diamond sensors converges as a function of the sample volume, more
optimal geometries lead to a logarithmically diverging signal. Finally, we
simulate the expected signal for spherical, cylindrical and nearly-2D sample
volumes, covering relevant geometries for interesting applications in NV-NMR
such as single-cell biology or NV-based hyperpolarization. The results provide
a guideline for NV-NMR spectroscopy of microscopic objects. Keywords: Nitrogen

Analogous to the magnetization $\sigma$ associated with the total field
strength, we define a tangential magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ associated with
the tangential field component. We explore the jump conditions of magnetized
relativistic shocks, either with an ordered field of arbitrary inclination
angle or with a random field of arbitrary anisotropy. In either case, we find
that the jump conditions of relativistic shocks are governed by the tangential
magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ instead of the total magnetization $\sigma$,
insensitive to the inclination angles or the anisotropy of the pre-shock

could serve as a quick check for numerical simulations and apply to theoretical
studies of GRBs/FRBs with a more general field geometry.

numerical characteristics of an investigated system - both in stationary and
non-stationary modes. In some cases, such characteristics can be calculated,
but this is possible for a limited number of real models. However, in most
cases, it is possible to calculate or estimate the stationary values of the
characteristics of the studied models. We can use linear Markov processes to
model how the overwhelming majority of queuing systems (QS), reliability
systems, and queuing networks (QNS) operate; the processes are regenerative in
many cases. In the case when the regeneration period of the Markov process has
a finite average value, this process is ergodic. An adjunction method can be
used to obtain strict upper bounds for the convergence rate of the Markov
process (MP) distribution to a stationary distribution (naturally, in cases
where the MP under consideration is ergodic). This method can be applied to
analyze queuing systems, queuing networks, and reliability systems. The purpose
of this paper is to show how to use the adjunction method to obtain strict
upper bounds for the MP distribution convergence rate as the regenerating
Markov process converges to a stationary distribution if the Markov process is
ergodic. This method can be applied to QS, QNS, and reliability systems. The

achieving this requires a global integration of data across studies, which

mechanisms of infection. But while vaccines offer a measure of protection
against this specific outbreak, a new era of pandemics has been predicted. In
addition to this, COVID-19 has drawn attention to post-viral syndromes and the
healthcare burden they entail. It seems integral that knowledge of viral
mechanisms is increased through as wide a research field as possible. To this
end we propose that quantum biology might offer essential new insights into the
problem, especially with regards to the important first step of virus-host
invasion. Research in quantum biology often centres around energy or charge
transfer. While this is predominantly in the context of photosynthesis there
has also been some suggestion that cellular receptors such as olfactory or
neural receptors might employ vibration assisted electron tunnelling to augment
the lock-and-key mechanism. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme
function. Enzymes are implicated in the invasion of host cells by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Receptors such as olfactory receptors also appear to be
disrupted by COVID-19. Building on these observations we investigate the
evidence that quantum tunnelling might be important in the context of infection
with SARS-CoV-2. We illustrate this with a simple model relating the vibronic
mode of, for example, a viral spike protein to the likelihood of charge
transfer in an idealised receptor. Our results show a distinct parameter regime
in which the vibronic mode of the spike protein enhances electron transfer.
With this in mind, novel therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission could
potentially be identified by their vibrational spectra.

can be actually retrieved from so-called hashtag-graphs by applying common
community detection algorithms. Therefore, this paper outlines a novel approach
on how to integrate topic structures of hashtag graphs into the estimation of
topic models by connecting graph-based community detection and semi-supervised
NMF.
  By applying this approach on recently streamed Twitter data it will be seen
that this procedure actually leads to more intuitive and humanly interpretable
topics.

spin-orbit coupling and contrary Zeeman energy splitting for different layer,
which has been suggested recently to realize two-dimensional
time-reversal-invariant topological superfluid. We find that this model shows
two kinds of topologically nontrivial phases: gapless phases with nodal lines
in pairs protected by chiral symmetry and a gapped phase, both of which support
time-reversal-invariant Majorana Fermi arc (MFA) on the $yz$ and $xz$ side
surface. These MFA abide by time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries and are
topologically protected by the winding numbers in mirror subspaces and $Z_2$
numbers of two-dimensional DIII class topological superfluid, different from
MFA in the time-reversal broken Weyl superfluid protected by nonzero Chern
number. This important observation means that MFA in our model represents a new
type of topological state not explored previously. The Zeeman field
configuration in our model is relevant to antiferromagnetic topological
insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, thus our work stimulates the further studies on
superconducting effects in the realistic antiferromagnetic topological
insulator.

motion are therefore analyzed. The study is carried out from a kinematic point

analyzing its response in terms of angular velocity and of modification of
apparent weight. Subsequently, the force diagram necessary to generate the
accelerated motion is analyzed. The magnitude of the external force to be

  Cherenkov Radiators",,,,,"physics.ins-det astro-ph.IM hep-ex nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In both particle physics and cosmic ray muon applications, a high-resolution
muon momentum measurement capability plays a significant role not only in
providing valuable information on the properties of subatomic particles but
also in improving the utilizability of muons. Currently, muon momentum is
estimated by reconstructing the muon path using a strong magnetic field and
muon trackers. Alternatively, time-of-flight or multiple Coulomb scattering
techniques are less frequently applied, especially when there is a need to
avoid using a magnetic field. However, the measurement resolution is much lower
than that of magnetic spectrometers, approximately 20% in the muon momentum
range of 0.5 to 4.5 GeV/c whereas it is nearly 10% or less when using magnets
and trackers. Here, we propose a different paradigm to estimate muon momentum
that utilizes multi-layer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators. Using the fact
that the gas refractive index varies with pressure and temperature, we can
optimize the muon Cherenkov threshold momentum for which a muon signal will be
detected. By analyzing the optical signals from Cherenkov radiation, we show
that the actual muon momentum can be estimated with a minimum resolution of
+-0.05 GeV/c for a large number of radiators over the range of 0.1 to 10.0
GeV/c. The results also show that our spectrometer correctly classifies the
muon momentum (~87% classification rate) in the momentum range of 0.1 to 10.0
GeV/c. We anticipate our new spectrometer will to provide an alternative
substitute for the bulky magnets without degrading measurement resolution.
Furthermore, we expect it will significantly improve the quality of imaging or
reduce the scanning time in cosmic muon applications by being incorporated with
existing instruments.

order based on a score function and an accuracy function, we show that such an
operator is a strong negation on IFVs. Moreover, we observe that the space of
IFVs is a complete lattice and a Kleene algebra with the new operator. We also
demonstrate that the topological space of IFVs with the order topology induced
by the above two linear orders is not separable and metrizable but compact and
connected. From some new perspectives,our results partially answer three open
problems posed by Atanassov [Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets: Theory and
Applications, Springer, 1999] and [On Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets Theory,
Springer, 2012]. Furthermore, we construct an isomorphism between the spaces of
IFVs and q-rung orthopedic fuzzy values (q-ROFVs) under the corresponding
linear orders. To this end, we introduce the concept of admissible similarity
measures with particular orders for IFSs, extending the existing definition of
the similarity measure for IFSs, and construct an admissible similarity measure
with a linear order based on a score function and an accuracy function, which
is effectively applied to a pattern recognition problem about the

  Educational Experimentation",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Randomised control trials are currently the definitive gold standard approach
for formal educational experiments. Although conclusions from these experiments
are highly credible, their relatively slow experimentation rate, high expense
and rigid framework can be seen to limit scope on: 1. $\textit{metrics}$:
automation of the consistent rigorous computation of hundreds of metrics for
every experiment; 2. $\textit{concurrency}$: fast automated releases of
hundreds of concurrent experiments daily; and 3. $\textit{safeguards}$: safety
net tests and ramping up/rolling back treatments quickly to minimise negative
impact. This paper defines a framework for categorising different experimental
processes, and places a particular emphasis on technology readiness.
  On the basis of our analysis, our thesis is that the next generation of
education technology successes will be heralded by recognising the context of
experiments and collectively embracing the full set of processes that are at
hand: from rapid ideation and prototyping produced in small scale experiments
on the one hand, to influencing recommendations of best teaching practices with
large-scale and technology-enabled online A/B testing on the other. A key
benefit of the latter is that the running costs tend towards zero (leading to
`free experimentation'). This offers low-risk opportunities to explore and
drive value though well-planned lasting campaigns that iterate quickly at a
large scale. Importantly, because these experimental platforms are so
adaptable, the cumulative effect of the experimental campaign delivers
compounding value exponentially over time even if each individual experiment
delivers a small effect.

body dynamics that preserves the momenta of the continuous dynamics, such as
linear and angular momenta, and exhibits near-conservation of total energy over
exponentially long times. In order to achieve these properties, we parametrize
the space of rotations using exponential local coordinates represented by a
rescaled form of the Rodrigues rotation vector and we systematically derive the
time integrator from a discrete Lagrangian function that yields discrete
Euler-Lagrange equations amenable to explicit, closed-form solutions. By
restricting attention to spherical bodies and Lagrangian functions with a
quadratic kinetic energy and potential energies that solely depend on positions
and attitudes, we show that the discrete Lagrangian map exhibits the same
mathematical structure, up to terms of second order, of explicit Newmark or
velocity Verlet algorithms, both known to be variational time integrators.
These preserving properties, together with linear convergence of trajectories
and quadratic convergence of total energy, are born out by two examples, namely
the dynamics on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ of a three-dimensional pendulum, and the
nonlinear dynamics on $\mathrm{SE}(3)^n$ that results from the impact of a
particle-binder torus against a rigid wall.
