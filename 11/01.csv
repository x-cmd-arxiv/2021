  biomedical image segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is both a widely used metric and loss
function for biomedical image segmentation due to its robustness to class
imbalance. However, it is well known that the DSC loss is poorly calibrated,
resulting in overconfident predictions that cannot be usefully interpreted in
biomedical and clinical practice. Performance is often the only metric used to
evaluate segmentations produced by deep neural networks, and calibration is
often neglected. However, calibration is important for translation into
biomedical and clinical practice, providing crucial contextual information to
model predictions for interpretation by scientists and clinicians. In this
study, we provide a simple yet effective extension of the DSC loss, named the
DSC++ loss, that selectively modulates the penalty associated with
overconfident, incorrect predictions. As a standalone loss function, the DSC++
loss achieves significantly improved calibration over the conventional DSC loss
across six well-validated open-source biomedical imaging datasets, including
both 2D binary and 3D multi-class segmentation tasks. Similarly, we observe
significantly improved calibration when integrating the DSC++ loss into four
DSC-based loss functions. Finally, we use softmax thresholding to illustrate
that well calibrated outputs enable tailoring of recall-precision bias, which
is an important post-processing technique to adapt the model predictions to
suit the biomedical or clinical task. The DSC++ loss overcomes the major
limitation of the DSC loss, providing a suitable loss function for training
deep learning segmentation models for use in biomedical and clinical practice.

feature representations, which may lead to subpar performances on various
downstream tasks. This is particularly true for under-represented classes,
where a lack of diversity in the data exacerbates the tendency. This limitation
has been addressed mostly in classification tasks, but there is little study on
additional challenges that may appear in more complex dense prediction problems
including semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic and
stochastic training scheme for semantic segmentation, which facilitates the
learning of debiased and disentangled representations. For each class, we first
extract class-specific information from the highly entangled feature map. Then,
information related to a randomly sampled class is suppressed by a feature
selection process in the feature space. By randomly eliminating certain class
information in each training iteration, we effectively reduce feature
dependencies among classes, and the model is able to learn more debiased and
disentangled feature representations. Models trained with our approach
demonstrate strong results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks, with
especially notable performance gains on under-represented classes.

networks on automated image segmentation tasks. Due to considerable
heterogeneity in shapes, colours and textures, demarcating object boundaries is
particularly difficult in biomedical images, resulting in significant inter and

penalty term, apply a global transformation to the ground truth, redefining the
loss function with respect to uncertainty. However, global operations are
computationally expensive, and neither approach accurately reflects the
uncertainty underlying manual annotation. In this paper, we propose the
Boundary Uncertainty, which uses morphological operations to restrict soft
labelling to object boundaries, providing an appropriate representation of
uncertainty in ground truth labels, and may be adapted to enable robust model
training where systematic manual segmentation errors are present. We
incorporate Boundary Uncertainty with the Dice loss, achieving consistently
improved performance across three well-validated biomedical imaging datasets

not only more accurately reflects the segmentation process, but it is also
efficient, robust to segmentation errors and exhibits better generalisation.

unveil the fascinating GR further, we exemplify the idea by studying an exactly

the GR at the transition is still finite albeit with an increasing value,
signifying a proximate self-dual relation. By contrast, the GR at the
transition between the gapped ferromagnetic phase and the gapless Luttinger
liquid diverges and changes its sign when crossing the first-order transition.
This implies that the GR could also probe the first-order transition between
the gapped and gapless phases.

the condensation in the one-dimensional fibre is of special interest since such
a condensation cannot occur in the thermodynamic limit due to the linear
dispersion relation of photons. The finite-size effect must play a key role in
this system and needs a detailed description. However, the previous theoretical
analysis of finite-size effect is often not accurate enough and only gives the
leading-order contribution due to a divergence difficulty. In this paper, by
using an analytical continuation method to overcome the divergence difficulty,
we give an analytical treatment for the finite-size effect in BEC. The
analytical expressions of the critical temperature or critical particle number
with higher order correction and the chemical potential below the transition
point are presented. Our result shows that in a recent experiment, the
deviation between experiment and theory is overestimated, most of which is
caused by the inaccurate theoretical treatment of the finite-size effect. By
taking into account the next-to-leading correction, we find that the actual

with the help of hydrodynamical simulations. We quantify the effect of
accretion and viewing angle on metallicity estimates derived from absorption
lines. Model parameters are chosen to provide strong lower limits on cloud
contamination by ambient gas. Consistent with previous results, a cloud
traveling through a stratified halo is contaminated by ambient material to the
point that <10% of its mass in neutral hydrogen consists of original cloud
material. Contamination progresses nearly linearly with time, and it increases
from head to tail. Therefore, metallicity estimates will depend on the
evolutionary state of the cloud, and on position. While metallicities change
with time by more than a factor of 10, well beyond observational uncertainties,
most lines-of-sight range only within those uncertainties at any given time
over all positions. Metallicity estimates vary with the cloud's inclination
angle within observational uncertainties. The cloud survives the infall through
the halo because ambient gas continuously condenses and cools in the cloud's
wake and thus appears in the neutral phase. Therefore, the cloud observed at
any fixed time is not a well-defined structure across time, since material gets
constantly replaced. The thermal phases of the cloud are largely determined by
the ambient pressure. Internal cloud dynamics evolve from drag gradients caused
by shear instabilities, to complex patterns due to ram-pressure shielding,
leading to a peloton effect, in which initially lagging gas can catch up to and
even overtake the head of the cloud.

ubiquitous nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation with the cubic self-focusing,
creates only unstable 2D and 3D solitons, because the same equation gives rise
to the critical and supercritical collapse in the 2D and 3D cases,
respectively. This article offers, first, a review of relevant settings which,
nevertheless, make it possible to create stable 2D and 3D solitons, including
ones with embedded vorticity. The main stabilization schemes considered here
are: (i) competing (e.g., cubic-quintic) and saturable nonlinearities; (2)
linear and nonlinear trapping potentials; (3) the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to
the BEC dynamics, leading to the formation of robust quantum droplets; (4)
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effects in binary BEC; (5) emulation of SOC in
nonlinear optical waveguides, including PT-symmetric ones. Further, a detailed
summary is presented for results which demonstrate the creation of stable 2D
and 3D solitons by schemes based on the usual linear trapping potentials or
effective nonlinear ones, which may be induced by means of spatial modulation
of the local nonlinearity strength. The latter setting is especially promising,
making it possible to use self-defocusing media, with the local nonlinearity
strength growing fast enough from the center to periphery, for the creation of
a great variety of stable multidimensional modes. In addition to fundamental
ones and vortex rings, the 3D modes may be hopfions, i.e., twisted vortex rings

solitons are obtained, in such settings, not only in a numerical form, but also
by means of analytical methods, such as the variational and Thomas-Fermi

species and the driving forces. Our 1D model, which was derived for both ideal
and non-ideal solvents, shows that the ionic current depends on the ideality of
the solvent, though both scenarios demonstrated good agreement with
experimental data. We employed the model to understand the impact of solution
bulk ionic strength and pH on the drift of ionic species with same reservoirs
solution properties. Our modeling results unveiled the significant impact of
bulk solution properties on the drift of ions which is in agreement with the
experiments. Moreover, we have shown that the diffusion gradient along the
nanochannel contributes significantly into driving ionic species if we even
apply a small ionic concentration gradient to both reservoirs. Our modeling
results may pave the way for finding novel applications for drift of ions
toward a diffusion gradient.

Gravity (EG) by stellar orbits, we discuss the Schwarzschild orbital precession
of S2 star assuming the congruence with predictions of General Relativity (GR).
At the moment, the S2 star trajectory is remarkably fitted with the first
post-Newtonian (pN) approximation of GR. In particular, both Keck and VLT
(GRAVITY) teams declared that the gravitational redshift near its pericenter
passage for the S2 star orbit corresponds to theoretical estimates found with
the first pN approximation. In 2020, the GRAVITY Collaboration detected the
orbital precession of the S2 star around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at
the Galactic Center (GC) and showed that it is close to the GR prediction.
Based on this observational fact, we evaluated parameters of the EG theories
with the Schwarzschild precession of the S2 star. Using the mentioned method,
we estimate the orbital precession angles for some EG models including
power-law f(R), general Yukawa-like corrections, scalar-tensor gravity (STG),
and non-local gravity (NLG) theories formulated in both metric and Palatini
formalism. In this consideration we assume that a gravitational field is
spherically symmetric, therefore, alternative theories of gravity could be
described only with a few parameters. Specifically, considering the orbital
precession, we estimate the range of parameters of these EG models for which
the orbital precession is like in GR. We then compare these results with our
previous results, which were obtained by fitting the simulated orbits of S2
star to its observed astrometric positions. In case of power-law f(R), generic
Yukawa-like correction, STG and NLG theories, we were able to obtain a prograde
orbital precession, like in GR. According to these results, the method is a
useful tool to evaluate parameters of the gravitational potential at the GC.

Multiple identical components are scheduled to run concurrently in order to

Furthermore such resource-intensive fault tolerant strategies bring extra
monetary overhead to the cloud service provider and eventually to the cloud
users. In order to address these issues, a novel fault tolerant strategy based
on the significance level of each component is developed. The communication
topology among the application components, their historical performance,
failure rate, failure impact on other components, dependencies among them,
etc., are used to rank those application components to further decide on the
importance of one component over others. Based on the rank, a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) model is presented to determine the number of replicas that
varies from one component to another. A rigorous performance evaluation is
carried out using some of the most common practically useful metrics such as,
recovery time upon a fault, average number of components needed, number of
parallel components successfully executed, etc., to quote a few, with similar
component ranking and fault tolerant strategies. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm reduces the required number of virtual and physical
machines by approximately 10% and 4.2%, respectively, compared to other similar

The maps were constructed using a de-reddened H$\alpha$ map as a template for

know the fraction of dust surface density that attenuates the H$\alpha$

comparing the dust opacity obtained through the infrared emission spectrum and
the Balmer decrement method. In star-forming regions, the median $f_\text{d}$

This paper applies the double-averaging methodology to refine the continuum

averaging volume and inaccurate treatment of the porous/fluid interface. The
averaging operator is recast as a general space-time filter allowing for the
analysis of commutation errors in a classic large eddy simulation (LES)
formalism. An explicit filtering framework has been implemented to carry out an
a posteriori evaluation of the unclosed terms appearing in the double-averaged
Navier-Stokes (DANS) equations, also considering a space-varying filter width.
Two resolved simulations have been performed. First, the flow around a single,
stationary particle has been used to validate derived equations and the
filtering procedure. Second, an LES of the turbulent flow in a channel partly
occupied with a porous medium has been realized and filtered. The commutation
error at the porous-fluid interface has been evaluated and compared to the
prediction of two models. The significance of the commutation error terms is
also discussed and assessed. Finally, the solver for DANS equations has been
developed and used to simulate both of the studied geometries. The magnitude of
the error associated with neglecting the commutation errors has been
investigated, and an LES simulation combined with a porous drag model was
performed. Very encouraging results have been obtained indicating that the
inaccuracy of the drag closure overshadows the error related to the commutation
of operators.

can be used in thin films of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) if a metallic capping
layer (Au, Pt) is deposited on top of the film. Magnetization precession is
triggered by heating of the metallic layer with femtosecond laser pulses. The
heating modifies the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the YIG film and shifts
the quasi-equilibrium orientation of magnetization, which results in
precessional magnetization dynamics. The laser-induced magnetization precession
corresponds to a uniform (Kittel) magnon mode, with the precession frequency
determined by the magnetic anisotropy of the material as well as the external
magnetic field, and the damping time set by a Gilbert damping parameter. The
AO-FMR method thus enables measuring local magnetic properties, with spatial

advances toward resilient, decentralized navigation algorithms. We previously
introduced the NeuroSwarms controller, in which agent-based interactions were
modeled by analogy to neuronal network interactions, including attractor
dynamics and phase synchrony, that have been theorized to operate within
hippocampal place-cell circuits in navigating rodents. This complexity
precludes linear analyses of stability, controllability, and performance
typically used to study conventional swarm models. Further, tuning dynamical
controllers by hand or grid search is often inadequate due to the complexity of
objectives, dimensionality of model parameters, and computational costs of
simulation-based sampling. Here, we present a framework for tuning dynamical
controller models of autonomous multi-agent systems based on Bayesian
Optimization (BayesOpt). Our approach utilizes a task-dependent objective
function to train Gaussian Processes (GPs) as surrogate models to achieve
adaptive and efficient exploration of a dynamical controller model's parameter
space. We demonstrate this approach by studying an objective function selecting
for NeuroSwarms behaviors that cooperatively localize and capture spatially
distributed rewards under time pressure. We generalized task performance across
environments by combining scores for simulations in distinct geometries. To
validate search performance, we compared high-dimensional clustering for high-
vs. low-likelihood parameter points by visualizing sample trajectories in
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embeddings. Our findings
show that adaptive, sample-efficient evaluation of the self-organizing
behavioral capacities of complex systems, including dynamical swarm

popularity in protecting critical cyber infrastructure from cyber threats,

issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the

understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems' unexpected or
seemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control
over interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many

to address this question. While doing that, this chapter first discusses the
black-box problems of AI technologies for Cybersecurity applications in smart
city-based solutions. Later, considering the new technological paradigm,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), this chapter discusses the
transition from black-box to white-box. This chapter also discusses the

has been to determine the optimal achievable tradeoff curve between time and
space. State-of-the-art hash tables offer the following guarantee: If
keys/values are Theta(log n) bits each, then it is possible to achieve
constant-time insertions/deletions/queries while wasting only O(loglog n) bits
of space per key when compared to the information-theoretic optimum. Even prior
to this bound being achieved, the target of O(loglog n) wasted bits per key was
known to be a natural end goal, and was proven to be optimal for a number of
closely related problems (e.g., stable hashing, dynamic retrieval, and
dynamically-resized filters).
  This paper shows that O(loglog n) wasted bits per key is not the end of the
line for hashing. In fact, for any k \in [log* n], it is possible to achieve
O(k)-time insertions/deletions, O(1)-time queries, and O(\log^{(k)} n) wasted
bits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that, each time we
increase insertion/deletion time by an \emph{additive constant}, we reduce the
wasted bits per key \emph{exponentially}. We further show that this tradeoff
curve is the best achievable by any of a large class of hash tables, including
any hash table designed using the current framework for making constant-time
hash tables succinct.

are situated on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide connectivity to
ground assets such as vehicles located on city streets. The UAVs are assumed to
be randomly deployed at a fixed height according to a two-dimensional point
process. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies are used to avail of large
available bandwidths and spatial isolation due to beamforming. In urban
environments, mmWave signals are prone to blocking of the line-of-sight (LoS)
by buildings. While reflections are possible, the desire for consistent
connectivity places a strong preference on the existence of an unblocked LoS
path. As such, the key performance metric considered in this paper is the
connectivity probability, which is the probability of an unblocked LoS path to
at least one UAV within some maximum transmission distance. By leveraging tools
from stochastic geometry, the connectivity probability is characterized as a
function of the city type (e.g., urban, dense urban, suburban), density of UAVs
(average number of UAVs per square km), and height of the UAVs. The city
streets are modeled as a Manhattan Poisson Line Process (MPLP) and the building
heights are randomly distributed. The analysis first finds the connectivity
probability conditioned on a particular network realization (location of the
UAVs) and then removes the conditioning to uncover the distribution of the
connectivity; i.e., the fraction of network realizations that will fail to meet
an outage threshold. While related work has applied an MPLP to networks with a
single UAV, the contributions of this paper are that it (1) considers networks
of multiple UAVs, (2) characterizes the performance by a connectivity
distribution, and (3) identifies the optimal altitude for the UAVs.

representations of nodes that preserve useful information in graphs. A
remarkable property of graph is that a latent hierarchical grouping of nodes
exists in a global perspective, where each node manifests its membership to a
specific group based on the context composed by its neighboring nodes. Most
prior works ignore such latent groups and nodes' membership to different
groups, not to mention the hierarchy, when modeling the neighborhood structure.
Thus, they fall short of delivering a comprehensive understanding of the nodes
under different contexts in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical attentive membership model for graph embedding, where the latent
memberships for each node are dynamically discovered based on its neighboring
context. Both group-level and individual-level attentions are performed when
aggregating neighboring states to generate node embeddings. We introduce
structural constraints to explicitly regularize the inferred memberships of
each node, such that a well-defined hierarchical grouping structure is
captured. The proposed model outperformed a set of state-of-the-art graph

topological orders to the thermalization of many-body localized system. We
consider the one-dimensional fermion chain system with open (or periodic)
boundary condition, whose boundaries are characterized by Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) intercation. Just like in the SYK model and the tendor models, there are
many-body quantum chaos in out-of-time-ordered correlation when the system is
being thermalized by the interactions (usually nonuniform and being randomly
distributed), and satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH).
While the continuous or discrete symmetries usually protect the related
topological orders against the thermalization, which may lead to the
localization of quantum states and generate large degeneracy. We discuss these
effects in terms of the fermionic or spin languages. In many-body localized
phase, a large number of degenerate ETH-violated states can be found in both
the frustration-free AKLT model or the integrable biquadratic (Wishart) SYK
model. The quantum scars appear when such degenerate states are embeded into an
ETH-satisfying spectrum of the Hilbert space enlarged by a much larger number
of bosonic flavors (e.g., SU(M) multiplets degeneracy). Usually, the emergence
of quantum chaos require large limits of boson flavor M and the number of
coupled (undegenerate) states (N; which related to Z N symmetry). Further, the
boson (or excitations) flavor number M can often to related to the fermion
number N through the duality transformations, in which case the Z M symmetry is
possible to generted by SU(M) model and leads to asymptotic degeneracy in

  Representations","PhD thesis, 166 pages",,,,"cs.CG math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis focuses on two concepts which are widely studied in the field of
computational geometry. Namely, visibility and unit disk graphs. In the field
of visibility, we have studied the conflict-free chromatic guarding of
polygons, for which we have described a polynomial-time algorithm that uses
$O(n \log^2 n)$ colors to guard a polygon in a conflict-free setting, and
proper coloring of polygon visibility graphs, for which we have described an
algorithm that returns a proper 4-coloring for a simple polygon. Besides, we
have shown that the 5-colorability problem is NP-complete on visibility graphs
of simple polygons, and 4-colorability is NP-complete on visibility graphs of
polygons with holes.
  Then, we move further with the notion of visibility, and define a graph class
which considers the real-world limitations for the applications of visibility
graphs. That is, no physical object has infinite range, and two objects might
not be mutually visible from a certain distance although there are no obstacles
in-between. To model this property, we introduce unit disk visibility graphs,
and show that the 3-colorability problem is NP-complete for unit disk
visibility graphs of a set of line segments, and a polygon with holes.
  After bridging the gap between the visibility and the unit disk graphs, we
then present our results on the recognition of unit disk graphs in a restricted
setting -- axes-parallel unit disk graphs. We show that the recognition of unit
disk graphs is NP-complete when the disks are centered on pre-given parallel
lines. If, on the other hand, the lines are not parallel to one another, the
recognition problem is NP-hard even though the pre-given lines are
axes-parallel (i.e. any pair is either parallel or perpendicular).

  Linguistic Units",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Language models (LMs) for text data have been studied extensively for their
usefulness in language generation and other downstream tasks. However, language
modelling purely in the speech domain is still a relatively unexplored topic,
with traditional speech LMs often depending on auxiliary text LMs for learning
distributional aspects of the language. For the English language, these LMs
treat words as atomic units, which presents inherent challenges to language
modelling in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM-based
generative speech LM that is inspired by the CBOW model and built on linguistic
units including syllables and phonemes. This offers better acoustic consistency
across utterances in the dataset, as opposed to single melspectrogram frames,
or whole words. With a limited dataset, orders of magnitude smaller than that
required by contemporary generative models, our model closely approximates
babbling speech. We show the effect of training with auxiliary text LMs,
multitask learning objectives, and auxiliary articulatory features. Through our
experiments, we also highlight some well known, but poorly documented
challenges in training generative speech LMs, including the mismatch between
the supervised learning objective with which these models are trained such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the true objective, which is speech quality. Our
experiments provide an early indication that while validation loss and Mel
Cepstral Distortion (MCD) are not strongly correlated with generated speech
quality, traditional text language modelling metrics like perplexity and
next-token-prediction accuracy might be.

within the individual lamellae. This re-structuring and resultant chemical
pressure raises the Curie temperature and, depending on the Cu concentration,

the loss of polarization through the ferrielectric-paraelectric transition is
driven by the movement of Cu ions within the lattice. Here we uncover the
microscopic origins underpinning the phase transitions in pure CIPS and
CIPS-IPS (Cu0.4In1.2P2S6) by performing a temperature-dependent Raman and XRD
study. We measured the frequencies and linewidths of various cation and anion
phonon modes and compared them to the extracted atomic positions from the
refinement of XRD data. Our analysis shows that in addition to the Cu cation
movement, the anion octahedral cages experience significant strains as they
deform to accommodate the redistribution of Cu ions upon heating. This results
in several discontinuities in peak frequencies and linewidths close to 315 K in
CIPS. In the CIPS-IPS heterostructure, this process begins around 315 K and
ends around 330 K.

applications by modifying the underlying mesostructure. However, most existing
lattice patterns take symmetry as a starting point. We show that asymmetric
lattice patterns can be more likely to have certain mechanical properties than
symmetric lattice patterns. To directly compare the effects of asymmetric
versus symmetric lattice arrangements, a constrained design space is defined. A
generative design process is used to generate both symmetric and asymmetric
lattice patterns within the design space. Asymmetric lattice patterns are shown
to have distinct metamaterial property spaces from symmetric lattice patterns.
Key design features are identified that are present predominantly in asymmetric
lattice patterns. We show that asymmetric lattice patterns with two of these
features (arrows and spider nodes) are more likely to induce a broader range of
Poisson's ratios and larger shear stiffness values, respectively, compared to
lattice patterns without these features. In addition, we show that symmetry can
play a role in hampering the impact of multiple features when present. This
work provides insights into the benefits of using asymmetric lattice patterns

which is both anisotropically ordered and maximally dense (crystal-like). In
the presence of impurities the study showed that the crystal type phase
disappears. Here we investigate extended interacting self-avoiding trails on

also displays two collapsed phases, one of which is maximally dense. However,
this maximally dense phase is not ordered anisotropically. The trails are
simulated using the flatPERM algorithm and the inhomogeneity is realised as a
random fraction of the lattice that is unavailable to the trails. We calculate
several thermodynamic and metric quantities to map out the phase diagram and
look at how the amount of disorder affects the properties of each phase but
especially the maximally dense phase. Our results indicate that while the
maximally dense phase in the trail model is affected less than in the walk

easily or rapidly scrutinize the CDSS recommendation when facing a difficult

frequent. Prior research has explored supporting such assessments by explaining
DST data inputs and algorithmic mechanisms. This paper explores a different
approach: Providing precisely relevant, scientific evidence from biomedical
literature. We present a proof-of-concept system, Clinical Evidence Engine, to
demonstrate the technical and design feasibility of this approach across three
domains (cardiovascular diseases, autism, cancer). Leveraging Clinical BioBERT,
the system can effectively identify clinical trial reports based on lengthy
clinical questions (e.g., ""risks of catheter infection among adult patients in
intensive care unit who require arterial catheters, if treated with povidone
iodine-alcohol""). This capability enables the system to identify clinical
trials relevant to diagnostic/treatment hypotheses -- a clinician's or a
CDSS's. Further, Clinical Evidence Engine can identify key parts of a clinical
trial abstract, including patient population (e.g., adult patients in intensive
care unit who require arterial catheters), intervention (povidone
iodine-alcohol), and outcome (risks of catheter infection). This capability
opens up the possibility of enabling clinicians to 1) rapidly determine the
match between a clinical trial and a clinical question, and 2) understand the
result and contexts of the trial without extensive reading. We demonstrate this
potential by illustrating two example use scenarios of the system. We discuss
the idea of designing DST explanations not as specific to a DST or an
algorithm, but as a domain-agnostic decision support infrastructure.

different network traffic values but also have well-defined geometry that falls

in conflux with edge computing is a promising area with novel applications over

based on their own data under the coordination of a central server by sharing
just the model updates, training data is maintained private. However, without
the central availability of data, computing nodes need to communicate the model
updates often to attain convergence. Hence, the local computation time to
create local model updates along with the time taken for transmitting them to

unreliable network connections may obstruct an efficient communication of these
updates. To address these, in this paper, we propose a delay-efficient FL

strong nonlinearity due to exciton blockade, suppressed exciton energy shift,

the neural network-based kernel is trained to be appropriate for the

we can gather knowledge on BO from multiple training tasks, and use the

DiscoGraph by constraining post-collaboration feature maps in the student model

projection of the dynamical system on a low dimensional space that is both
problem-dependent and parameter-specific. The ROM exploits compressed tensor
formats to find a low rank representation for a sample of high-fidelity
snapshots of the system state. This tensorial representation provides ROM with
an orthogonal basis in a universal space of all snapshots and encodes
information about the state variation in parameter domain. During the online
phase and for any incoming parameter, this information is used to find a
reduced basis that spans a parameter-specific subspace in the universal space.
The computational cost of the online phase then depends only on tensor
compression ranks, but not on space or time resolution of high-fidelity
computations. Moreover, certain compressed tensor formats enable to avoid the
adverse effect of parameter space dimension on the online costs (known as the
curse of dimension). The analysis of the approach includes an estimate for the
representation power of the acquired ROM basis. We illustrate the performance
and prediction properties of the ROM with several numerical experiments, where
tensorial ROM's complexity and accuracy is compared to those of conventional
POD-ROM.

perception and computer vision, which seeks to estimate the best rigid
transformation aligning two point clouds from the putative correspondences.
However, due to the limited robustness of 3D keypoint matching approaches,
outliers, probably in large numbers, are prone to exist among the
correspondences, which makes robust registration methods imperative.
Unfortunately, existing robust methods have their own limitations (e.g. high
computational cost or limited robustness) when facing high or extreme outlier
ratios, probably unsuitable for practical use. In this paper, we present a
novel, fast, deterministic and guaranteed robust solver, named TriVoC
(Triple-layered Voting with Consensus maximization), for the robust
registration problem. We decompose the selecting of the minimal 3-point sets
into 3 consecutive layers, and in each layer we design an efficient voting and
correspondence sorting framework on the basis of the pairwise equal-length
constraint. In this manner, the 3-point sets can be selected independently from
the reduced correspondence sets according to the sorted sequence, which can
significantly lower the computational cost and meanwhile provide a strong
guarantee to achieve the largest consensus set (as the final inlier set) as
long as a probabilistic termination condition is fulfilled. Varied experiments
show that our solver TriVoC is robust against up to 99% outliers, highly
accurate, time-efficient even with extreme outlier ratios, and also practical
for real-world applications, showing performance superior to other
state-of-the-art competitors.

Though encouraging, a critical aspect that limits face-detection performance

metal-oxygen (M-O) bond forms large energy barrier inhibiting ion diffusion.
Therefore, seeking efficient and facile approaches to accelerate oxygen

charge transfer and cooperative bonding) between noble metal (Pt, Ag) and
perovskites oxide (SrCoO3-delta) is employed to weaken (M-O) bond and decrease
the energy barrier of oxygen migration. Noble metal layers serving as oxygen
pumps can continuously extract oxygen from oxide films to atmosphere. The
temperature of topotactic phase transition from perovskite (SrCoO3) to
brownmillerite (SrCoO2.5) is remarkably lowered from 200 K to room temperature.
Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to SrFeO3 for similar topotactic
phase reduction by moderate thermal activation. Our finding paves a promising

Non-adaptive methods are important, as they correspond to sketching algorithms,

close the gap between non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, showing that even

denoising. This regularization is formulated using a deep image prior learned
by the network, rather than a traditional predefined prior. Specifically, we
treat the output of the network as a ``prior'' that we denoise again after
``re-noising''. The comparison between the again denoised image and its prior
can be interpreted as a self-verification of the network's denoising ability.
We demonstrate that self-verification encourages the network to capture
low-level image statistics needed to restore the image. Based on this
self-verification regularization, we further show that the network can learn to
denoise even if it has not seen any clean images. This learning strategy is
self-supervised, and we refer to it as Self-Verification Image Denoising
(SVID). SVID can be seen as a mixture of learning-based methods and traditional
model-based denoising methods, in which regularization is adaptively formulated
using the output of the network. We show the application of SVID to various
denoising tasks using only observed corrupted data. It can achieve the
denoising performance close to supervised CNNs.

has achieved promising results since these pre-trained models embed generic

of the PrLM on a small domain-specific corpus distort the learned generic
knowledge, and it is also expensive to deployment a whole fine-tuned PrLM for
each domain. This paper explores an adapter-based fine-tuning approach for
unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, several trainable adapter modules
are inserted in a PrLM, and the embedded generic knowledge is preserved by
fixing the parameters of the original PrLM at fine-tuning. A domain-fusion
scheme is introduced to train these adapters using a mix-domain corpus to
better capture transferable features. Elaborated experiments on two benchmark
datasets are carried out, and the results demonstrate that our approach is
effective with different tasks, dataset sizes, and domain similarities.

  In this work, we develop an extract-and-refine architecture to explain the
relative comparisons among a set of ranked items from a recommender system. For
each recommended item, we first extract one sentence from its associated

avoids generation of generic content. Extensive offline evaluations on two

performance of small models by transferring the dark knowledge from the teacher
detector. However, most of the existing distillation-based detection methods
mainly imitating features near bounding boxes, which suffer from two
limitations. First, they ignore the beneficial features outside the bounding
boxes. Second, these methods imitate some features which are mistakenly
regarded as the background by the teacher detector. To address the above
issues, we propose a novel Feature-Richness Score (FRS) method to choose
important features that improve generalized detectability during distilling.
The proposed method effectively retrieves the important features outside the
bounding boxes and removes the detrimental features within the bounding boxes.
Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve excellent performance on
both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. For example, RetinaNet with
ResNet-50 achieves 39.7% in mAP on the COCO2017 dataset, which even surpasses
the ResNet-101 based teacher detector 38.9% by 0.8%. Our implementation is

matrices of the graph and the dual graph. In the continuous theory, a scalar
curvature appears as an anomaly in the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identity associated

$\gamma$~Cas in the neutral hydrogen (HI) images at a systemic velocity of

  non-linear layer inside it, towards an efficient plain model",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although residual connection enables training very deep neural networks, it
is not friendly for online inference due to its multi-branch topology. This
encourages many researchers to work on designing DNNs without residual
connections at inference. For example, RepVGG re-parameterizes multi-branch
topology to a VGG-like (single-branch) model when deploying, showing great
performance when the network is relatively shallow. However, RepVGG can not
transform ResNet to VGG equivalently because re-parameterizing methods can only
be applied to linear blocks and the non-linear layers (ReLU) have to be put
outside of the residual connection which results in limited representation
ability, especially for deeper networks. In this paper, we aim to remedy this
problem and propose to remove the residual connection in a vanilla ResNet
equivalently by a reserving and merging (RM) operation on ResBlock.
Specifically, the RM operation allows input feature maps to pass through the
block while reserving their information and merges all the information at the
end of each block, which can remove residual connections without changing the
original output. As a plug-in method, RM Operation basically has three
advantages: 1) its implementation makes it naturally friendly for high ratio
network pruning. 2) it helps break the depth limitation of RepVGG. 3) it leads
to better accuracy-speed trade-off network (RMNet) compared to ResNet and
RepVGG. We believe the ideology of RM Operation can inspire many insights on
model design for the community in the future. Code is available at:

hardware imperfections that lead to quantum errors. Mitigating such unavoidable
errors is crucial to explore the power of quantum hardware better. In this
paper, we propose a unified framework that can mitigate quantum gate and
measurement errors in computing quantum expectation values utilizing the
truncated Neumann series. The essential idea is to cancel the effect of quantum
error by approximating its inverse via linearly combining quantum errors of
different orders produced by sequential applications of the quantum devices
with carefully chosen coefficients. Remarkably, the estimation error decays
exponentially in the truncated order, and the incurred error mitigation
overhead is independent of the system size, as long as the noise resistance of
the quantum device is moderate. We numerically test this framework for
different quantum errors and find that the computation accuracy is
substantially improved. Our framework possesses several vital advantages: it
mitigates quantum gate and measurement errors in a unified manner, it neither
assumes any error structure nor requires the tomography procedure to completely
characterize the quantum errors, and most importantly, it is scalable. These
advantages empower our quantum error mitigation framework to be efficient and
practical and extend the ability of near-term quantum devices to deliver
quantum applications.

flux density along this stream determines a unique, perfect magnetohydrodynamic
jet solution that satisfies, conservation of energy, angular momentum and mass
(a monotonic conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux along the jet).
The solution is protonic and magnetically dominated. The bilateral jet
transports $\approx 1.2\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}$ and $\approx
1.1\times10^{42}$ erg/sec, placing strong constraints on the central engine. A
Keplerian disk source that also produces the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
annulus of emission can supply the energy and mass if the vertical magnetic
field at the equator is $\sim 1-3.5$ G (depending on location). A Parker spiral
magnetic field, characteristic of a wind or jet, is consistent with the
observed EHT polarization pattern. Even though there is no image of the jet
connecting with the annulus, it is argued that these circumstances are not
coincidental and the polarized portion of the EHT emission is mainly jet
emission in the top layers of the disk that is diluted by emission from an
underlying turbulent disk. This is a contributing factor to the relatively low
polarization levels that were detected.

supplemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to
unravel temperature-driven magnetization reversal (MR) in inverse spinel
Co$_2$VO$_4$. All measurements show a second-order magnetic phase transition at
$T_{\rm C} = 168$\,K to a collinear ferrimagnetic phase. The DFT results
suggest the moments in the ferrimagnetic phase are delocalized and undergo
gradual localization as the temperature is lowered below $T_{\rm C}$. The
delocalized-localized crossover gives rise to a maximum magnetization at
$T_{\rm NC} = 138$\,K and the continuous decrease in magnetization produces
sign-change at $T_{\rm MR} \sim 65$\,K. Muon spectroscopy results support the
DFT, as a strong $T_1$-relaxation is observed around $T_{\rm NC}$, indicating
highly delocalized spin-carriers gradually tend to localization upon cooling.
The magnetization reversal determined at zero field is found to be highly
sensitive to the applied magnetic field, such that above $B\sim 0.25$\,T
instead of a reversal a broad minimum in the magnetization is apparent at
$T_{\rm MR}$. Analysis of the neutron diffraction measurements shows two
antiparallel magnetic sub-lattice-structure, each belonging to magnetic ions on
two distinct crystal lattice sites. The relative balance of these two
structural components in essence determines the magnetization. Indeed, the
order parameter of the magnetic phase on one site develops moderately more than
that on the other site. Unusual tipping of the magnetic balance, caused by such
site-specific magnetic fluctuation, gives rise to a spontaneous flipping of the
magnetization as the temperature is lowered.

the past few years. There has been a lot of progress from simple machine
learning algorithms to transformer-based architectures. However, existing
literature has analyzed different approaches on different data sets thus making
it difficult to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms. In this
work, we revisit long document classification using standard machine learning
approaches. We benchmark approaches ranging from simple Naive Bayes to complex
BERT on six standard text classification datasets. We present an exhaustive
comparison of different algorithms on a range of long document datasets. We
re-iterate that long document classification is a simpler task and even basic
algorithms perform competitively with BERT-based approaches on most of the
datasets. The BERT-based models perform consistently well on all the datasets
and can be blindly used for the document classification task when the
computations cost is not a concern. In the shallow model's category, we suggest
the usage of raw BiLSTM + Max architecture which performs decently across all
the datasets. Even simpler Glove + Attention bag of words model can be utilized
for simpler use cases. The importance of using sophisticated models is clearly
visible in the IMDB sentiment dataset which is a comparatively harder task.

configurations have contributed to several attacks including the FREAK, Logjam,
and POODLE attacks. In this work, we empirically evaluate the TLS security
posture of popular websites and endeavor to understand the configuration
decisions that operators make. We correlate several sources of influence on
sites' security postures, including software defaults, cloud providers, and
online recommendations. We find a fragmented web ecosystem: while most websites
have secure configurations, this is largely due to major cloud providers that
offer secure defaults. Individually configured servers are more often insecure
than not. This may be in part because common resources available to individual
operators -- server software defaults and online configuration guides -- are
frequently insecure. Our findings highlight the importance of considering SaaS
services separately from individually-configured sites in measurement studies,
and the need for server software to ship with secure defaults.

production, processing and analysis. Scholars have proposed various methods to
analyze different aspects of time structures, such as beat, downbeat, tempo and
meter. Many state-of-the-art (SOFA) methods, however, are computationally
expensive. This makes them inapplicable in real-world industrial settings where
the scale of the music collections can be millions. This paper proposes a new
state space and a semi-Markov model for music time structure analysis. The
proposed approach turns the commonly used 2D state spaces into a 1D model
through a jump-back reward strategy. It reduces the state spaces size
drastically. We then utilize the proposed method for causal, joint beat,
downbeat, tempo, and meter tracking, and compare it against several previous
methods. The proposed method delivers similar performance with the SOFA joint
causal models with a much smaller state space and a more than 30 times speedup.

bottlenecks is the large communication cost between the central server and the

successful in reducing communication costs with stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), there are much fewer attempts in building communication-efficient
adaptive gradient methods with provable guarantees, which are widely used in
training large-scale machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a new
communication-compressed AMSGrad for distributed nonconvex optimization
problem, which is provably efficient. Our proposed distributed learning
framework features an effective gradient compression strategy and a worker-side
model update design. We prove that the proposed communication-efficient
distributed adaptive gradient method converges to the first-order stationary
point with the same iteration complexity as uncompressed vanilla AMSGrad in the
stochastic nonconvex optimization setting. Experiments on various benchmarks
back up our theory.

In particular, this happens for stationary black holes because their horizons

This implies that there exists a channel, via which classical or quantum

astrophysical black holes have at least some rotation, our results apply to all

architecture with outstanding features of orchestration by decoupling the
control plane and the data plane in each network element. Even though it brings
several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the
single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down
all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can
access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation
owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the
Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network
topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even
worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller.
Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN's Northbound.
Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during
data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations,
we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized
authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to
assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With
strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for
each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing
over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the
feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to
evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical
use cases.

erupt consecutively within a short interval, and then lead to a single flare
and a single CME. However, it is still subtle for the links between multiple
eruptions and the associated single flare or/and single CME. In this Letter, we
report the compound eruptions of twin close flux ropes (FR1 and FR2) within a
few minutes that resulted in a flare with a single soft X-ray peak and a CME
with two cores. The successive groups of expanding loops and double peaks of
intensity flux in AIA cool wavelengths indicate two episodes of internal
magnetic reconnections during the compound eruptions. Following the eruption of
FR2, the erupting FR1 was accelerated, and then the expanding loops overlying
FR2 were deflected. Moreover, the eruption of FR2 likely involved the external
magnetic reconnection between the bottom of the overlying stretching field
lines and the rebounding loops that were previously pushed by the eruption of

  Work And Social Computing",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Instagram infographics are a digital activism tool that have redefined action
frames for technology-facilitated social movements. From the 1960s through the
1980s, United States ethnic movements practiced collective action:
ideologically unified, resource-intensive traditional activism. Today,
technologically enabled movements have been categorized as practicing
connective action: individualized, low-resource online activism. Yet, we argue
that Instagram infographics are both connective and collective. This paper
juxtaposes the insights of past and present U.S. ethnic movement activists and
analyzes Black Lives Matter Instagram data over the course of 7 years
(2014-2020). We find that Instagram infographic activism bridges connective and
collective action in three ways: (1) Scope for Education: Visually enticing and
digestible infographics reduce the friction of information dissemination,
facilitating collective movement education while preserving customizability.
(2) Reconciliation for Credibility: Activists use connective features to combat
infographic misinformation and resolve internal differences, creating a trusted
collective movement front. (3) High-Resource Efforts for Transformative Change:
Instagram infographic activism has been paired with boots on the ground and
action-oriented content, curating a connective-to-collective pipeline that
expends movement resources. Our work unveils the vitality of evaluating digital
activism action frames at the movement integration level, exemplifies the
powerful coexistence of connective and collective action, and offers meaningful
design implications for activists seeking to leverage this novel tool.

offloading scheme for edge computing-enabled vehicular networks, which splits
the task into multiple subtasks and offloads them to different roadside units

cooperative offloading models for the offline and online scenarios in edge

the total energy minimization with respect to the task splitting ratio,
computation resource, and communication resource. In the offline scenario, we
equivalently transform the original problem to a convex problem and obtain
optimal solutions for multi-vehicle case and single-vehicle case, respectively.
Furthermore, we show that the method proposed for the offline scenario can also
be applied to solve the optimization problem in the online scenario. Finally,
through numerical results, by analyzing the impact of network parameters on the
total energy consumption, we verify that our proposed solution consumes lower

Here we use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model developed by Henriques et
al. to explore the formation and evolution of massive galaxies (MGs,
stellar-mass $M_{*}> 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$). Different from previous works, we
focus on the ones just formed (e.g. just reach $\simeq 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$).
We find that most of the MGs are formed around $z=0.6$, with the earliest
formation at $z>4$. Interestingly, although most of the MGs in the local
Universe are passive, we find that only $13\%$ of the MGs are quenched at the
formation time. Most of the quenched MGs at formation already hosts a very
massive supermassive black hole (SMBH) which could power the very effective AGN
feedback. For the star-forming MGs, the ones with more massive SMBH prefer to
quench in shorter timescales; in particular, those with $M_{\textrm{SMBH}} >
10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ have a quenching timescale of $\sim 0.5$ Gyr and the
characteristic $M_{\textrm{SMBH}}$ depends on the chosen stellar mass threshold
in the definition of MGs as a result of their co-evolution. We also find that
the ""in-situ"" star formation dominates the stellar mass growth of MGs until
they are formed. Over the whole redshift range, we find the quiescent MGs
prefer to stay in more massive dark matter halos, and have more massive SMBH
and less cold gas masses. Our results provide a new angle on the whole life of
the growth of MGs in the Universe.

signatures of anharmonicity and thermal disorder already around room

applications in photovoltaics and beyond. Whether these vibrational properties
are advantageous or detrimental to their optoelectronic properties remains,
however, an important open question. Here, this issue is addressed by
investigation of the {finite-temperature optoelectronic properties} in the
prototypical cubic CsPbBr$_3$, using first-principles molecular dynamics based
on density-functional theory. It is shown that the dynamic flexibility
associated with halide perovskites enables the so-called transversality, which
manifests as a preference for large halide displacements perpendicular to the
Pb-Br-Pb bonding axis. We find that transversality is concurrent with
vibrational anharmonicity and leads to a rapid rise in the joint density of
states, which is favorable for photovoltaics since this implies sharp optical
absorption profiles. These findings are contrasted to the case of PbTe, a
material that shares several key properties with CsPbBr$_3$ but cannot exhibit
any transversality and, hence, is found to exhibit much wider band-edge
distributions. We conclude that the dynamic structural flexibility in halide
perovskites and their unusual vibrational characteristics might not just be a
mere coincidence, but play active roles in establishing their favorable

Compressible Navier-Stoke equations are solved with a flamelet combustion model

models, with and without heat loss effects, are compared to elucidate the
non-adiabatic wall effects on the thermoacoustic instability. The azimuthal
modes are captured well by both models with only marginal differences in the
computed frequencies and amplitudes. By comparing with the experimental
measurements, the frequencies given by the LES are approximately 10\% higher
and the amplitudes are well predicted. Further analysis of the experimental and
LES data shows a similar dominant anti-clockwise spinning mode, under which a
good agreement is observed for the phase-averaged heat release rate
fluctuations. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is applied to shed more light on
this spinning mode. The LES and experimental DMD modes reconstructed for their
azimuthal mode frequencies agree very well for the heat release fluctuations.
The DMD mode structure for the acoustic pressure from the LES shows a
considerable non-zero profile at the combustor outlet, which could be essential
for azimuthal modes to establish in this annular combustor. Finally, a
low-order modelling study was conducted using an acoustic network combined with
the flame transfer function extracted from LES. The results show that the
dominant mode is associated with the plenum showing a first longitudinal and
azimuthal mixed mode structure. By tuning the plenum length to match the
effective volume, the predicted frequency becomes very close to the measured

the query graph by treating each SPARQL clause as a subgraph consisting of
vertices and edges and define a unified graph grammar called AQG to describe
the structure of query graphs. Based on these concepts, we propose a novel
end-to-end model that performs hierarchical autoregressive decoding to generate
query graphs. The high-level decoding generates an AQG as a constraint to prune
the search space and reduce the locally ambiguous query graph. The bottom-level
decoding accomplishes the query graph construction by selecting appropriate
instances from the preprepared candidates to fill the slots in the AQG. The
experimental results show that our method greatly improves the SOTA performance
on complex KGQA benchmarks. Equipped with pre-trained models, the performance
of our method is further improved, achieving SOTA for all three datasets used.

recent years, thanks to its advantages in avoiding expensive relevance labeling
as required in offline supervised ranking model learning. Such a solution
explores the unknowns (e.g., intentionally present selected results on top
positions) to improve its relevance estimation. This however triggers concerns
on its ranking fairness: different groups of items might receive differential
treatments during the course of OL2R. But existing fair ranking solutions
usually require the knowledge of result relevance or a performing ranker
beforehand, which contradicts with the setting of OL2R and thus cannot be
directly applied to guarantee fairness.
  In this work, we propose a general framework to achieve fairness defined by
group exposure in OL2R. The key idea is to calibrate exploration and
exploitation for fairness control, relevance learning and online ranking
quality. In particular, when the model is exploring a set of results for
relevance feedback, we confine the exploration within a subset of random
permutations, where fairness across groups is maintained while the feedback is
still unbiased. Theoretically we prove such a strategy introduces minimum
distortion in OL2R's regret to obtain fairness. Extensive empirical analysis is
performed on two public learning to rank benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to existing fair OL2R
solutions.

Recently, Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven to be an effective tool to
improve the performance of recommendation systems. However, a huge challenge in

encodes items by capturing high-level neighbor information to generate items'

encode users to generate users' representation vectors, and then perform inner

vectors to get probabilities of users interaction with items. Numerical

recognized as an effective approach to alleviate traffic congestion and improve
traffic safety, especially for on-ramp bottlenecks. However, in the mixed
traffic, the uncertainty of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) makes the on-ramp
merging control for CAVs more challenging. This paper proposes a decentralized
optimal control method to address the merging control problem of CAVs at
highway on-ramps in the mixed traffic. We first formulate the optimal merging
control problem, which includes the constraints of safety and vehicle dynamics,
with the objectives of minimizing travel time and energy consumption. Then, a
control framework, combining control barrier functions (CBFs) and control
Lyapunov functions (CLFs) is proposed. CBFs render the system subject to
safety-critical constraints, while CLFs stabilize the system to the objectives.
In addition, to enable effective control of CAVs in the mixed traffic, a
recursive merging control framework is proposed, where HDVs are regarded as
disturbances, and CAVs collect surrounding vehicles' states repeatedly and
update their trajectories recursively to satisfy strict merging requirements.
Finally, the merging problem is reformulated as a quadratic programming
problem, which allows for real-time application. Simulation results show that
the proposed on-ramp merging control method is robust in resisting disturbance
from the HDV with traffic efficiency and energy economy improvement.

the pedestal normalized density gradient triggering the first PBI has a

40$ and seems to increase with the loss power and the chord-averaged density.
In addition, the frequency of PBI is likely to be inversely proportional to the
chord-averaged density and the loss power. These results suggest that PBIs and
the density gradient prompt increase prior to PBIs can be considered as the
precursor for controlling I-H transition.

paper, we make the first attempt to reconstruct 3D interacting hands from
monocular single RGB images. Our method can generate 3D hand meshes with both
precise 3D poses and minimal collisions. This is made possible via a two-stage
framework. Specifically, the first stage adopts a convolutional neural network
to generate coarse predictions that tolerate collisions but encourage
pose-accurate hand meshes. The second stage progressively ameliorates the
collisions through a series of factorized refinements while retaining the
preciseness of 3D poses. We carefully investigate potential implementations for
the factorized refinement, considering the trade-off between efficiency and
accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on large-scale

train control policies in simulation and then deploy them on a real robot.
Popular techniques to improve the sim2real transfer build on domain
randomization (DR) -- training the policy on a diverse set of randomly
generated domains with the hope of better generalization to the real world. Due
to the large number of hyper-parameters in both the policy learning and DR
algorithms, one often ends up with a large number of trained policies, where
choosing the best policy among them demands costly evaluation on the real
robot. In this work we ask - can we rank the policies without running them in
the real world? Our main idea is that a predefined set of real world data can
be used to evaluate all policies, using out-of-distribution detection (OOD)
techniques. In a sense, this approach can be seen as a `unit test' to evaluate
policies before any real world execution. However, we find that by itself, the
OOD score can be inaccurate and very sensitive to the particular OOD method.
Our main contribution is a simple-yet-effective policy score that combines OOD
with an evaluation in simulation. We show that our score - VSDR - can
significantly improve the accuracy of policy ranking without requiring
additional real world data. We evaluate the effectiveness of VSDR on sim2real
transfer in a robotic grasping task with image inputs. We extensively evaluate
different DR parameters and OOD methods, and show that VSDR improves policy
selection across the board. More importantly, our method achieves significantly
better ranking, and uses significantly less data compared to baselines. Project

In this paper, we demonstrate ultra-secure image encryption by tightly focusing

necessary to detect large numbers of sources at the earliest epochs. Given the
large areas needed to detect such quantities, using traditional redshift

considerable interest. Improving the efficiency of a payment system is
important since it has a substantial impact on revenues for businesses. A
gateway is an integral component of a payment system through which every
transaction is routed. In an online payment system, payment processors
integrate with these gateways by means of various configurations such as
pricing, methods, risk checks, etc. These configurations are called terminals.
Each gateway can have multiple terminals associated with it. Routing a payment
transaction through the best terminal is crucial to increase the probability of
a payment transaction being successful. Machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to accurately predict the best
terminals based on their previous performance and various payment-related
attributes. We have devised a pipeline consisting of static and dynamic
modules. The static module does the initial filtering of the terminals using
static rules and a logistic regression model that predicts gateway downtimes.
Subsequently, the dynamic module computes a lot of novel features based on
success rate, payment attributes, time lag, etc. to model the terminal
behaviour accurately. These features are updated using an adaptive time decay
rate algorithm in real-time using a feedback loop and passed to a random forest
classifier to predict the success probabilities for every terminal. This
pipeline is currently in production at Razorpay routing millions of
transactions through it in real-time and has given a 4-6\% improvement in
success rate across all payment methods (credit card, debit card, UPI, net
banking). This has made our payment system more resilient to performance drops,
which has improved the user experience, instilled more trust in the merchants,
and boosted the revenue of the business.

prominent applications in refocusing of classical waves or spins and
fundamental researches such as quantum information scrambling. In quantum
metrology, nonlinear interferometry based on time reversal protocols supports
entanglement-enhanced measurements without requiring low-noise detection.
Despite the broad interest in time reversal, it remains challenging to reverse
the quantum dynamics of an interacting many-body system as is typically
realized by an (effective) sign-flip of the system's Hamiltonian. Here, we
present an approach that is broadly applicable to cyclic systems for
implementing nonlinear interferometry without invoking time reversal. Inspired
by the observation that the time-reversed dynamics drives a system back to its
starting point, we propose to accomplish the same by slaving the system to
travel along a 'closed-loop' instead of explicitly tracing back its antecedent
path. Utilizing the quasi-periodic spin mixing dynamics in a three-mode
$^{87}$Rb atom spinor condensate, we implement such a 'closed-loop' nonlinear
interferometer and achieve a metrological gain of $3.87_{-0.95}^{+0.91}$
decibels over the classical limit for a total of 26500 atoms. Our approach
unlocks the high potential of nonlinear interferometry by allowing the dynamics
to penetrate into deep nonlinear regime, which gives rise to highly entangled
non-Gaussian state. The idea of bypassing time reversal may open up new
opportunities in the experimental investigation of researches that are
typically studied by using time reversal protocols.

take into account a more complicated problem: finding curvature-penalized

relying on the strategy of orientation-lifting, by which a planar curve can be
mapped to an high-dimensional orientation-dependent space. The convexity shape
prior serves as a constraint for the construction of local geodesic metrics
encoding a particular curvature constraint. Then the geodesic distances and the
corresponding closed geodesic paths in the orientation-lifted space can be
efficiently computed through state-of-the-art Hamiltonian fast marching method.
In addition, we apply the proposed geodesic models to the active contours,
leading to efficient interactive image segmentation algorithms that preserve
the advantages of convexity shape prior and curvature penalization.

Consequently, actual cutting forces are predicted using orthogonal cutting data

a novel quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimisation in the
restricted circuit depth context of near-term quantum computing. The MAOA first
produces a quantum state in which the optimal solutions to a problem are
amplified to the maximum extent possible subject to a given restricted circuit
depth. Subsequent repeated preparation and measurement of this maximally
amplified state produces solutions of the highest quality as efficiently as
possible. The MAOA performs considerably better than other near-term quantum
algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA), as
it amplifies optimal solutions significantly more and does so without the
computationally demanding variational procedure required by these other
algorithms. Additionally, a restricted circuit depth modification of the
existing Grover adaptive search is introduced. This modified algorithm is
referred to as the restricted Grover adaptive search (RGAS), and provides a
useful comparison to the MAOA. The MAOA and RGAS are simulated on a practical
vehicle routing problem, a computationally demanding portfolio optimisation
problem, and an arbitrarily large problem with normally distributed solution
qualities. In all cases, the MAOA and RGAS are shown to provide substantial
speedup over classical random sampling in finding optimal solutions, while the
MAOA consistently outperforms the RGAS. The speedup provided by the MAOA is
quantified by demonstrating numerical convergence to a theoretically derived
upper bound.

change will affect heavy precipitation patterns. Dividing the globe into
homogeneous sub-regions should improve the modelling of heavy precipitation by
inferring common regional distributional parameters. In addition, in the
detection and attribution (D&A) field, biases due to model errors in global
climate models (GCMs) should be considered to attribute the anthropogenic
forcing effect. Within this D&A context, we propose an efficient clustering
algorithm that, compared to classical regional frequency analysis (RFA)
techniques, is covariate-free and accounts for dependence. It is based on a new
non-parametric dissimilarity that combines both the RFA constraint and the
pairwise dependence. We derive asymptotic properties of our dissimilarity
estimator, and we interpret it for generalised extreme value distributed pairs.
  As a D&A application, we cluster annual daily precipitation maxima of 16 GCMs
from the coupled model intercomparison project. We combine the climatologically
consistent subregions identified for all GCMs. This improves the spatial
clusters coherence and outperforms methods either based on margins or on
dependence. Finally, by comparing the natural forcings partition with the one
with all forcings, we assess the impact of anthropogenic forcing on
precipitation extreme patterns.

flexible probes for phase boundaries of quantum matter. A major hurdle to a
more widespread application of fidelity and other quantum information measures
to strongly correlated quantum materials is the inaccessibility of the fidelity
susceptibility to most state-of-the-art numerical methods. This is particularly
apparent away from equilibrium where, at present, no general critical theory is
available and many standard techniques fail. Motivated by the usefulness of
quantum information based measures we show that a widely accessible quantity,
the single-particle affinity, is able to serve as a versatile instrument to
identify phase transitions beyond Landau's paradigm. We demonstrate that it not
only is able to signal previously identified non-equilibrium phase transitions
but also has the potential to detect hitherto unknown phases in models of
quantum matter far from equilibrium.

galaxies in the dense cores by conducting deep 1.1mm observations with Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect interstellar dust
continuum emissions from 12 member galaxies and estimate their molecular gas
masses. Comparing these gas masses with our previous measurements from CO(3-2)

stellar mass ratios of the galaxies in the dense cores tend to be higher (at M*
~ 10^{10} M_sun) where we see the enhanced star-forming activities), suggesting
that such large gas masses can sustain their high star-forming activities.
However, if we compare the gas properties of these protocluster galaxies with
the gas scaling relations constructed for field galaxies at similar cosmic
epoch, we find no significant environmental difference at the same stellar mass
and star formation rate. Although both gas mass ratios and star-forming
activities are enhanced in the majority of member galaxies, they appear to
follow the same scaling relation as field galaxies. Our results are consistent
with the scenario that the cold gas is efficiently supplied to protocluster
cores and to galaxies therein along surrounding filamentary structures, which
leads to the high gas mass fractions and thus the elevated star-formation
activities, but without changing the star formation law.

metallic and s-wave superconducting reservoirs (N-QD-S) are provided within the
Coulomb blockade regime. Using non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function
formalism, initially, various model parameter dependence of thermoelectric
transport properties are analysed within the linear response regime. It is
observed that the single-particle tunnelling close to the superconducting gap
edge can generate a relatively large thermopower and figure of merit. Moreover,
the Andreev tunnelling plays a significant role in the suppression of
thermopower and figure of merit within the gap region. Further, within the
non-linear regime, we discuss two different situations, i.e., the finite
voltage biasing between isothermal reservoirs and the finite thermal gradient
in the context of thermoelectric heat engine. In the former case, it is shown
that the sub-gap Andreev heat current can become finite beyond the linear
response regime and play a vital role in asymmetric heat dissipation and
thermal rectification effect for low voltage biasing. The rectification of heat
current is enhanced for strong on-dot Coulomb interaction and at low background
thermal energy. In the latter case, we study the variation of thermovoltage,
thermopower, maximum power output, and corresponding efficiency with the
applied thermal gradient. These results illustrate that hybrid
superconductor-quantum dot nanostructures are promising candidatess for

alternately perform spatial feature aggregation and temporal feature

  Theories in Biomolecular Solvation",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a fast iterative method for local steric
Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) theories, in which the electrostatic potential is
governed by the Poisson's equation and ionic concentrations satisfy equilibrium
conditions. To present the method, we focus on a local steric PB theory derived
from a lattice-gas model, as an example. The advantages of the proposed method
in efficiency are achieved by treating ionic concentrations as scalar implicit
functions of the electrostatic potential, though such functions are only
numerically achievable. The existence, uniqueness, boundness, and smoothness of
such functions are rigorously established. A Newton iteration method with
truncation is proposed to solve a nonlinear system discretized from the
generalized PB equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the
discretized nonlinear system are established by showing that it is a unique
minimizer of a constructed convex energy. Thanks to the boundness of ionic
concentrations, truncation bounds for the potential are obtained by using the
extremum principle. The truncation step in iterations is shown to be energy and
error decreasing. To further speed-up computations, we propose a novel
precomputing-interpolation strategy, which is applicable to other local steric
PB theories and makes the proposed methods for solving steric PB theories as
efficient as for solving the classical PB theory. Analysis on the Newton
iteration method with truncation shows local quadratic convergence for the
proposed numerical methods. Applications to realistic biomolecular solvation
systems reveal that counterions with steric hindrance stratify in an order
prescribed by the parameter of ionic valence-to-volume ratio. Finally, we
remark that the proposed iterative methods for local steric PB theories can be
readily incorporated in well-known classical PB solvers.

the joint modeling of economic and climate systems, where all model state
variables evolve over time deterministically. We reformulate and solve the DICE
model as an optimal control dynamic programming problem with six state
variables (related to the carbon concentration, temperature, and economic
capital) evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls
(carbon emission mitigation rate and consumption). We then extend the model by
adding a discrete stochastic shock variable to model the economy in the
stressed and normal regimes as a jump process caused by events such as the
COVID-19 pandemic. These shocks reduce the world gross output leading to a
reduction in both the world net output and carbon emission. The extended model
is solved under several scenarios as an optimal stochastic control problem,
assuming that the shock events occur randomly on average once every 100 years
and last for 5 years. The results show that, if the world gross output recovers
in full after each event, the impact of the COVID-19 events on the temperature
and carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative
10\% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes
noticeable, although still extremely small (long-term temperature drops by
$0.1^\circ \mathrm{C}$), in a presence of persistent shocks of a 5\% output
drop propagating to the subsequent time periods through the recursively reduced
productivity. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied in a presence
of stochastic shocks (i.e. when this policy is suboptimal), then the drop in
temperature is larger (approximately $0.25^\circ \mathrm{C}$), that is, the
lower economic activities owing to shocks imply that more ambitious mitigation
targets are now feasible at lower costs.

thought to develop computer-assisted language training (CAPT) systems, showing
competitive performance to conventional pronunciation-scoring based methods.
However, current E2E neural methods for CAPT are faced with at least two
pivotal challenges. On one hand, most of the E2E methods operate in an
autoregressive manner with left-to-right beam search to dictate the
pronunciations of an L2 learners. This however leads to very slow inference
speed, which inevitably hinders their practical use. On the other hand, E2E
neural methods are normally data greedy and meanwhile an insufficient amount of
nonnative training data would often reduce their efficacy on mispronunciation

that leverages non-autoregressive (NAR) E2E neural modeling to dramatically
speed up the inference time while maintaining performance in line with the
conventional E2E neural methods. In addition, we design and develop a
pronunciation modeling network stacked on top of the NAR E2E models of our
method to further boost the effectiveness of MD&D. Empirical experiments

component, similar as in the model with periodic boundary conditions whose
continuum limit has been found to be described in terms of the non-compact
$SU(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ Euclidean black hole conformal field theory (CFT). Here
we show that the same is true for a range of the staggering parameter. In
addition we find that levels from the discrete part of the spectrum of this CFT
emerge as the anisotropy is varied. The finite size amplitudes of both the
continuous and the discrete levels are related to the corresponding eigenvalues
of a quasi-momentum operator which commutes with the Hamiltonian and the
transfer matrix of the model.

numerical analysis of its effective potential and orbits, it is found that the
orbital eccentricity reduces as the deviation parameter $\kappa$ increases. By
comparing the orbits for the observed stars around Sagittarius A*, we conclude
that the observed orbits with too large radii can not give a stringent

with $\kappa$ when the spin is large enough. Moreover, the spin dependences of
ISCO parameters have similar behavior to that of Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN)

superluminal constraint condition as well. As a result, two new parameter
regions may emerge in case of large $\kappa$, where the particle has two stable

blade undergoing multi-harmonic oscillations in effective angle of attack and
incoming flow velocity by formulating the blade kinematics as a sum of simple
harmonic motions. Each of these functions is a multiple of the main turbine
rotational frequency, associated with an individual amplitude, as suggested by
Greenberg. The results of the adapted model are compared with experimental data
from a scaled-down model of a single-bladed H-type Darrieus wind turbine. The
comparison between the predictions by the Greenberg model and experimentally
obtained phase-averaged radial force evolutions show that the inviscid
Greenberg model predicts well the loads at the start of the upwind portion and
the maximum loads during upwind, but fails during the downwind portion when
flow separation occurs. The proposed application of Greenberg's model to
vertical-axis wind turbine kinematics shows a great potential to diagnose
regions of separated flow and for quantifying the relative influences of
dynamic stall and intrinsic turbine kinematics on the blade loading. Future
research can readily extend this method to any airfoil undergoing an arbitrary
combination of pitching, surging, and heaving, following a kinematic profile
that can be approximated by a Fourier series.

This surface segregation has been known as a factor in the construction of an
ordered phase near the surface. However, the segregation-induced ordering has
not been observed for nanoparticles. Here, platinum@cobalt (Pt@Co) core-shell
nanoparticles were synthesized, and their structural changes after annealing at
600{\deg}C, 700{\deg}C, and 800{\deg}C for 3 hours were observed by a scanning
transmission electron microscope. We discovered an L10-PtCo structure near the
surface at 700{\deg}C, which was unexpected given the initial Pt:Co ratio of
about 4:1. The L10-PtCo structure was considered to form due to surface
segregation of Pt atoms and diffusion insufficient to mix Pt and Co atoms in
the particle overall because the structure did not form at 600{\deg}C and

However, signatures of edge magnetism appears elusive in the experiments,
suggesting another class of solutions. We employ a self-consistent mean field
approximation within a multi-orbital tight-binding model and obtain
particle-hole symmetry broken solutions, where the local filling plays the role
of the order parameter. Unlike the magnetic edge solutions, these are
topologically non-trivial and show zero local magnetization. A small and a

doping is encountered, which may serve as an explanation for the absence of
experimental evidence for magnetic edge states in zigzag graphene nanoribbons.
The electronic interaction may increase the finite \(d\)-orbital occupation,
which leads to a change of the effective Coulomb interaction of the dominant

finite hole doping becomes energetically preferred, compared to the magnetic

the flat categories originate from some base classes. For example, buggies
belong to the class bird. We define the classification task where classes have
characteristics above and the flat classes and the base classes are organized
hierarchically as hierarchical image classification. Intuitively, leveraging
such hierarchical structure will benefit hierarchical image classification,
e.g., two easily confusing classes may belong to entirely different base
classes. In this paper, we improve the performance of classification by fusing
features learned from a hierarchy of labels. Specifically, we train feature
extractors supervised by hierarchical labels and with UDA technology, which
will output multiple features for an input image. The features are subsequently
concatenated to predict the finest-grained class. This study is conducted with
a new dataset named Lego-15. Consisting of synthetic images and real images of
the Lego bricks, the Lego-15 dataset contains 15 classes of bricks. Each class
originates from a coarse-level label and a middle-level label. For example,
class ""85080"" is associated with bricks (coarse) and bricks round (middle). In
this dataset, we demonstrate that our method brings about consistent
improvement over the baseline in UDA in hierarchical image classification.
Extensive ablation and variant studies provide insights into the new dataset

theory, we set up to derive the non-relativistic exchange-contribution, which
is more subtle than the spin-orbit contribution, using Schwinger's method of
functional derivatives. To avoid having to solve the famous Hedin-Baym
equations self-consistently, the phonons are treated as a perturbation to the
electronic structure. A formalism is developed around the idea of imposing
crossing symmetry on the interaction, in order to treat charge and spin on
equal footing. By an iterative scheme, we find that the spin-flip component of
the ${\mathit collective}$ four-point interaction, $\mathcal{V}$, which is used

pressure induces an unexpected metal-insulator transition between 8 and 9 GPa.
Our calculations also find that strong polar displacements persist in both
metallic and insulating oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$ and the size of
polar displacements is comparable to pristine LiNbO$_3$ under the same
pressure. These properties are distinct from widely used perovskite
ferroelectric oxide BaTiO$_3$, whose polarization is quickly suppressed by
hydrostatic pressure and/or oxygen vacancies. The anomalous pressure-driven
metal-insulator transition in oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$ arises from
the change of an oxygen vacancy defect state. Hydrostatic pressure increases
the polar displacements of oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$, which reduces
the band width of the defect state and eventually turns it into an in-gap
state. In the insulating phase, the in-gap state is further pushed away from
the conduction band edge under hydrostatic pressure, which increases the
fundamental gap. Our work shows that for LiNbO$_3$-type strong ferroelectrics,
oxygen vacancies and hydrostatic pressure combined can lead to new phenomena

Sitter black holes with extended horizon topology -- also known as black
strings -- in dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. The solution is
supported by a scalar field with an axionic profile that depends linearly on
the coordinate that spans the string. We compute conserved charges by making
use of the renormalized boundary stress-energy tensor. Then, by adopting the
Noether-Wald formalism, we compute the black string entropy and obtain its area
law. Indeed, the reduced Euclidean Hamiltonian approach shows that these
methods yield a consistent first law of thermodynamics. Additionally, we derive
a Smarr formula using a radial conservation law associated to the scale
invariance of the reduced action and obtain a Cardy formula for the black
string. A first-order phase transition takes place at a critical temperature
between the ground state and the black string, above which the black string is
the thermodynamically favored configuration.

stars in globular clusters. Globular-cluster stars afford a unique view of the
physical processes that shape the surface abundances of stars on and beyond the
Spite plateau, as one can study stars in different evolutionary phases with the
same composition at birth. The main result is the finding of observational
trends in surface abundances of heavy elements (Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ba) that
range from ~0.1 dex (M4 at [Fe/H]=-1.1) to ~0.3 dex (M30 at [Fe/H]=-2.3) with
turn-off and subgiant stars generally showing lower abundances than giant
stars. Any model that tries to resolve the cosmological lithium discrepancy by
means of stellar physics must simultaneously describe these systematic
heavy-element trends between dwarfs and giants. Models of atomic diffusion
moderated by some additional mixing can indeed explain the observed abundance
trends and make quantitative predictions for lithium depletion. The inferred
birth-cloud lithium abundances of Spite-plateau stars are higher by ~0.3 dex
leaving a small (~0.15 dex) nominal offset to the primordial value.

personal identity is widely used iris recognition systems. However, the
existing IPAD algorithms do not generalize well to unseen and cross-domain
scenarios because of capture in unconstrained environments and high visual
correlation amongst bonafide and attack samples. These similarities in
intricate textural and morphological patterns of iris ocular images contribute
further to performance degradation. To alleviate these shortcomings, this paper
proposes DFCANet: Dense Feature Calibration and Attention Guided Network which
calibrates the locally spread iris patterns with the globally located ones.
Uplifting advantages from feature calibration convolution and residual
learning, DFCANet generates domain-specific iris feature representations. Since
some channels in the calibrated feature maps contain more prominent
information, we capitalize discriminative feature learning across the channels
through the channel attention mechanism. In order to intensify the challenge
for our proposed model, we make DFCANet operate over nonsegmented and
non-normalized ocular iris images. Extensive experimentation conducted over
challenging cross-domain and intra-domain scenarios highlights consistent
outperforming results. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DFCANet achieves
significant gains in performance for the benchmark IIITD CLI, IIIT CSD and
NDCLD13 databases respectively. Further, a novel incremental learning-based
methodology has been introduced so as to overcome disentangled iris-data
characteristics and data scarcity. This paper also pursues the challenging
scenario that considers soft-lens under the attack category with evaluation
performed under various cross-domain protocols. The code will be made publicly

to vaccinate, even if the same number of individuals are vaccinated.
Vaccinating individuals with high centrality measures such as betweenness
centrality (BC) and eigenvector centrality (EC) are effective in containing
epidemics. However, in many real-world cases, each individual has distinct
epidemic characteristics such as contagion, recovery, fatality rate, efficacy,
and probability of severe reaction to a vaccine. Moreover, the relative
effectiveness of vaccination strategies depends on the number of available
vaccine shots. Centrality-based strategies cannot take the variability of
epidemic characteristics or the availability of vaccines into account. Here, we
propose a framework for vaccination strategy based on graph neural network
ansatz (GNNA) and microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA). In this framework,
we can formulate an effective vaccination strategy that considers the
properties of each node, and tailor the vaccination strategy according to the
availability of vaccines. Our approach is highly scalable to large networks. We
validate the method in many real-world networks for network dismantling, the
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with homogeneous and heterogeneous
contagion/recovery rates, and the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD)
model. We also extend our method to edge immunization strategy, which
represents non-pharmaceutical containment measures such as travel regulations
and social distancing.

a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor. Massive stars are expected to be
qualitatively different from low-mass stars as their envelopes have significant
support from radiation pressure, which increases both the final separation and
amount of mass ejected through the common-envelope interaction. We perform
adiabatic simulations that include radiation energy through the equation of
state, which results in ejecting 60 per cent more mass (up to two thirds of the
total envelope mass becoming unbound, or more) and yield a 10 per cent larger
final separation compared to simulations that assume an ideal gas. When also
including recombination energy, we find that at least three quarters of the
envelope, and possibly the entire envelope, may be unbound. The final
separation further increases by almost 20 per cent. The additional amount of
ejected material is mainly due to energy injected from helium recombination.
Hydrogen recombination plays a comparatively small role, as it mainly occurs in
gas that has already become unbound. We conclude that the internal energy of
the envelope can be a significant energy source for ejecting the common
envelope, but ultimately radiation transport and convection need to be
included.

Taobao and Amazon. While in recent years a lot of attention has been drawn to
the consumer side including canonical problems like ctr/cvr prediction, the
advertiser side, which directly serves advertisers by providing them with
marketing tools, is now playing a more and more important role. When speaking
of sponsored search, bid keyword recommendation is the fundamental service.
This paper addresses the problem of keyword matching, the primary step of
keyword recommendation. Existing methods for keyword matching merely consider
modeling relevance based on a single type of relation among ads and keywords,
such as query clicks or text similarity, which neglects rich heterogeneous
interactions hidden behind them. To fill this gap, the keyword matching problem
faces several challenges including: 1) how to learn enriched and robust
embeddings from complex interactions among various types of objects; 2) how to
conduct high-quality matching for new ads that usually lack sufficient data.
  To address these challenges, we develop a
heterogeneous-graph-neural-network-based model for keyword matching named
HetMatch, which has been deployed both online and offline at the core sponsored
search platform of Alibaba Group. To extract enriched and robust embeddings
among rich relations, we design a hierarchical structure to fuse and enhance
the relevant neighborhood patterns both on the micro and the macro level.
Moreover, by proposing a multi-view framework, the model is able to involve
more positive samples for cold-start ads. Experimental results on a large-scale
industrial dataset as well as online AB tests exhibit the effectiveness of
HetMatch.

identifying the noise-resistant properties of regions over different strengths.
By importing the region uncertainty quantification and promoting multipeak

further achieve noise-resistant learning. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS

RoI feature extraction of 3D point cloud object detection is more diverse. In
this paper, we first compare and analyze the differences in structure and
performance between the two state-of-the-art models PV-RCNN and Voxel-RCNN.
Then, we find that the performance gap between the two models does not come
from point information, but structural information. The voxel features contain
more structural information because they do quantization instead of
downsampling to point cloud so that they can contain basically the complete
information of the whole point cloud. The stronger structural information in
voxel features makes the detector have higher performance in our experiments

effect in granular column collapse over controlled-roughness bases. Image
processing methods are developed to obtain robust measurements of base
roughness, runout distance and deposit morphology. A geometric roughness
parameter Ra is applied to consider both the size and spatial distribution of
base particles, which enables systematic analysis of the basal effect. The
results indicate that the runout distance can be characterized as a function of
Ra, regardless of the variations in the base particle size and spacing, and the
roughness has a major influence on the frontal region of the granular flow, as
well as the overall profile of the granular deposit. When Ra is increased
beyond a threshold value (Ra > 0.62), flow characteristics show minor changes,
which coinsides with a previous phase diagram for the transition between slip

entangle an atom interferometer with a mesoscopic oscillator. The interaction
results in periodic drops and revivals of the interferometeric visibility,
which under specific assumptions indicate the gravitational generation of
entanglement. Here we study semi-classical models of the atom interferometer
that can reproduce the same effect. We show that the core signature -- periodic
collapses and revivals of the visibility -- can appear if the atom is subject
to a random unitary channel, including the case where the oscillator is fully
classical and situations even without explicit modelling of the oscillator. We
also show that the non-classicality of the oscillator vanishes unless the
system is very close to its ground state, and even when the system is in the
ground state, the non-classicality is limited by the coupling strength. Our
results thus indicate that deducing entanglement from the proposed experiment
is very challenging, since fulfilling and verifying the non-classicality
assumptions is a significant challenge on its own right.

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary motivation of VERTICO is to
understand the physical mechanisms that perturb molecular gas disks, and
therefore star formation and galaxy evolution, in dense environments. This
first paper contains an overview of VERTICO's design and sample selection,
$^{12}$CO($2-1$) observations, and data reduction procedures. We characterize
global $^{12}$CO($2-1$) fluxes and molecular gas masses for the 49 detected
VERTICO galaxies, provide upper limits for the two non-detections, and produce
resolved $^{12}$CO($2-1$) data products (median resolution $= 8^{\prime\prime}
\approx 640~{\rm pc}$). Azimuthally averaged $^{12}$CO($2-1$) radial intensity
profiles are presented along with derived molecular gas radii. We demonstrate
the scientific power of VERTICO by comparing the molecular gas size--mass
scaling relation for our galaxies with a control sample of field galaxies,
highlighting the strong effect that radius definition has on this correlation.
We discuss the drivers of the form and scatter in the size--mass relation and
highlight areas for future work. VERTICO is an ideal resource for studying the
fate of molecular gas in cluster galaxies and the physics of environment-driven
processes that perturb the star formation cycle. Upon public release, the
survey will provide a homogeneous legacy dataset for studying galaxy evolution
in our closest cluster.

picosecond resolution prevent time-resolved observations in mode-locked lasers

using the time-lens technique with a Raman amplifier, we implement an ultrafast

from gain-induced fluctuations for relatively high gain energies, while
Q-switched modulations being the main cause for lower energies. Our findings
based on advanced real-time measurements open up new insights into ultrafast

the remaining ones are young star clusters (11, age $\sim$ 30-200 Myr) and
intermediate-age (5, age $\sim$ 1.7-2.8 Gyr) star clusters, respectively. The
resulting distances show that intermediate-age and some young star clusters
belong to the SMC main body, while the remaining young star clusters are nearly
13.0 kpc far away from those in the SMC, revealing that the shell-like
overdensity is more extended along the line-of-sight than previously thought.
We also found a clear age trend and a blurred metallicity correlation along the
line-of-sight of young clusters, in the sense that the farther a star cluster
from the SMC, the younger, the more metal rich, and the less massive it is.
These young clusters are also affected by a slightly larger interstellar
reddening than the older ones in the shell-like overdensity. These outcomes
suggest that the shell-like overdensity can possibly be another tidally

high-fidelity waveform generation heavily rely on discriminators to improve
their performance. However, GAN methods introduce much uncertainty into the
generation process and often result in mismatches of pitch and intensity, which
is fatal when it comes to sensitive use cases such as singing voice
synthesis(SVS). To address this problem, we propose RefineGAN, a high-fidelity
neural vocoder focused on the robustness, pitch and intensity accuracy, and
high-speed full-band audio generation. We applyed a pitch-guided refine
architecture with a multi-scale spectrogram-based loss function to help
stabilize the training process and maintain the robustness of the neural
vocoder while using the GAN-based training method. Audio generated using this
method shows a better performance in subjective tests when compared with the
ground-truth audio. This result shows that the fidelity is even improved during
the waveform reconstruction by eliminating defects produced by recording
procedures. Moreover, it shows that models trained on a specified type of data
can perform on totally unseen language and unseen speaker identically well.

data in 2020, resulting in the enormous costs of both data storage and
transmission. Fortunately, recent advances in deep generative models have
spearheaded a new class of so-called ""neural compression"" algorithms, which
significantly outperform traditional codecs in terms of compression ratio.
Unfortunately, the application of neural compression garners little commercial
interest due to its limited bandwidth; therefore, developing highly efficient
frameworks is of critical practical importance. In this paper, we discuss
lossless compression using normalizing flows which have demonstrated a great
capacity for achieving high compression ratios. As such, we introduce iFlow, a
new method for achieving efficient lossless compression. We first propose
Modular Scale Transform (MST) and a novel family of numerically invertible flow
transformations based on MST. Then we introduce the Uniform Base Conversion
System (UBCS), a fast uniform-distribution codec incorporated into iFlow,
enabling efficient compression. iFlow achieves state-of-the-art compression
ratios and is $5\times$ quicker than other high-performance schemes.
Furthermore, the techniques presented in this paper can be used to accelerate
coding time for a broad class of flow-based algorithms.

multi-class 3D object detection network which admits both LiDAR and camera
sensor data streams, named Voxel-Pixel Fusion Network (VPFNet). Inside this

takes advantage of the geometric relation of a voxel-pixel pair and fuses the
voxel features and the pixel features with proper mechanisms. Moreover, several

after considering the characteristics of a voxel-pixel pair. Finally, the
proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI benchmark for multi-class 3D object

introducing a prediction-correction scheme for the estimator, in the form of a

development of 3D-aware image synthesis. The cumulative rendering process in
radiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since
gradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object
surfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy
representations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we
directly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training
they will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and
eventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose
Generative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance
fields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training
convergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the
cumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface
points as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF
combines the merits of two representations in a unified framework. In practice,
the training-time transition of start from radiance fields and march to
occupancy representations is achieved in GOF by gradually shrinking the
sampling region in its rendering process from the entire volume to a minimal
neighboring region around the surface. Through comprehensive experiments on
multiple datasets, we demonstrate that GOF can synthesize high-quality images
with 3D consistency and simultaneously learn compact and smooth object
surfaces. Code, models, and demo videos are available at

conditions on the formation of flow states and heat transport in two- and

numerical simulations and steady-state analysis for Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ up to
$4\times10^{10}$ and Prandtl numbers $Pr=0.1,1$ and $10$. We show that a linear
temperature profile imposed at the conductive sidewall leads to a premature
collapse of the single-roll state, whereas a sidewall maintained at a constant
temperature enhances its stability. The collapse is caused by accelerated
growth of the corner rolls with two distinct growth rate regimes determined by
diffusion or convection for small or large $Ra$, respectively. Above the
collapse of the single-roll state, we find the emergence of a double-roll state
in two-dimensional RBC and a double-toroidal state in three-dimensional
cylindrical RBC. These states are most prominent in RBC with conductive
sidewalls. The different states are reflected in the global heat transport, so
that the different thermal conditions at the sidewall lead to significant
differences in the Nusselt number for small to moderate $Ra$. However, for
larger $Ra$, heat transport and flow dynamics become increasingly alike for
different sidewalls and are almost indistinguishable for $Ra>10^9$. This
suggests that the influence of imperfectly insulated sidewalls in RBC
experiments is insignificant at very high $Ra$ - provided that the mean
sidewall temperature is controlled.

This relation can be extended to subleading order provided one allows for large
gauge symmetries with $O(r)$ gauge parameters. The latter, however, violate
standard asymptotic field fall-offs and thus their interpretation has remained
incomplete. We improve on this situation by presenting a relaxation of the
standard asymptotic field behavior that is compatible with $O(r)$ gauge
symmetries at linearized level. We show the extended space admits a symplectic

magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) packets and their spectral properties in
thin films of pure iron. As the packets leave the excitation area and propagate
in space, their spectra evolve non-trivially. Particularly, low or high
frequency components are suppressed at the border of the excitation area
depending on the orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the
magnetocrystolline anisotropy axes of the film. The effect is ascribed to the
ultrafast local heating of the film. Further, the time resolution of the
implemented all-optical technique allows us to extract the chirp of the MSSW
packet in the time domain via wavelet analysis. The chirp is a result of the
group velocity dispersion of the MSSW and, thus, is controlled by the film
magnetic parameters, magnetization and anisotropy, and external field
orientation. The demonstrated tunable modulation of MSSW wave packets with
femtosecond laser pulses may find application in future magnonic-photonic
hybrid devices for wave-based data processing.

the resolvent problem of the associated linear problem well posed on the whole
imaginary axis. In contrast to the cases without translation or rotation, the
resolvent estimates are merely uniform under additional restrictions, and the
existence of time-periodic solutions depends on the ratio of the rotational
velocity of the body motion to the angular velocity associated with the time
period. Provided that this ratio is a rational number, time-periodic solutions
to both the linear and, under suitable smallness conditions, the nonlinear
problem can be established. If this ratio is irrational, a counterexample shows
that in a special case there is no uniform resolvent estimate and solutions to

surfaces are nearly hexagonal in shape, and therefore strongly faceted. This
has some profound consequences for results obtained from the classic ballistic

anisotropies in bend resistances and even a Hall voltage that is strongly
asymmetric in magnetic field. Although some of our observations are
non-intuitive at first sight, we show that they can be understood within a

design an interactive policy that selects a group of items sequentially, based
on some partial observations, to maximize the expected utility. It has been
shown that the utility functions of many real-world applications, including
pooled-based active learning and adaptive influence maximization, satisfy the
property of adaptive submodularity. However, most of existing studies on
adaptive submodular maximization focus on the fully adaptive setting, i.e., one
must wait for the feedback from \emph{all} past selections before making the
next selection. Although this approach can take full advantage of feedback from
the past to make informed decisions, it may take a longer time to complete the
selection process as compared with the non-adaptive solution where all
selections are made in advance before any observations take place. In this
paper, we explore the problem of partial-adaptive submodular maximization where
one is allowed to make multiple selections in a batch simultaneously and
observe their realizations together. Our approach enjoys the benefits of
adaptivity while reducing the time spent on waiting for the observations from
past selections. To the best of our knowledge, no results are known for
partial-adaptive policies for the non-monotone adaptive submodular maximization
problem. We study this problem under both cardinality constraint and knapsack
constraints, and develop effective and efficient solutions for both cases. We
also analyze the batch query complexity, i.e., the number of batches a policy
takes to complete the selection process, of our policy under some additional
assumptions.

of larger, wealthier cities in developed regions. However, planning the layout
of bicycle-sharing stations usually requires expensive data gathering,
surveying travel behavior and trip modelling followed by station layout
optimization. Many smaller cities and towns, especially in developing areas,
may have difficulty financing such projects. Planning a BSS also takes a
considerable amount of time. Yet as the pandemic has shown us, municipalities
will face the need to adapt rapidly to mobility shifts, which include citizens
leaving public transport for bicycles. Laying out a bike sharing system quickly
will become critical in addressing the increase in bike demand. This paper
addresses the problem of cost and time in BSS layout design and proposes a new
solution to streamline and facilitate the process of such planning by using
spatial embedding methods. Based only on publicly available data from

on existing systems in different cities using transfer learning. The result of
the work is a mechanism to support planners in their decision making when

often relies on computing input-output relations via differential algebraic
elimination. Determining identifiability, a natural prerequisite for meaningful
parameter estimation, is often prohibitively expensive for medium to large
systems due to the computationally expensive task of elimination.
  We propose an algorithm that computes a description of the set of
differential-algebraic relations between the input and output variables of a
dynamical system model. The resulting algorithm outperforms general-purpose
software for differential elimination on a set of benchmark models from
literature.
  We use the designed elimination algorithm to build a new randomized algorithm
for assessing structural identifiability of a parameter in a parametric model.
A parameter is said to be identifiable if its value can be uniquely determined
from input-output data assuming the absence of noise and sufficiently exciting
inputs. Our new algorithm allows the identification of models that could not be

Wigner-Moyal equation. Extending the treatment to more complicated models, we
investigate aspects such as spin dynamics (based on the Pauli Hamiltonian),

cases where the field strength is well beyond Schwingers critical field. Both
weakly relativistic theory (gamma factors close to unity) and strongly

separation of electron and positron states. Finally, we study the
Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism, which is a fully quantum relativistic
theory, allowing for field strengths of the order of the Schwinger critical

cover phenomena such as Zitterbewegung and electron-positron pair creation.

as a Take-off, adding some letters to Lawrence Breen as an appendix and outline
of the program, of a systematic reflection on the foundations of
non-commutative (co)homological algebra and its coefficients, and of
homotopical algebra. The text is written in English as it grew out of the
correspondence with R Brown and D Quillen. The title is based on the intuition
that stacks are the unifying concept for a synthesis of homotopical algebra and
non-commutative cohomological algebra. The first episode called ""The modelizing
story"" is a comprehensive reflection about foundational matters in homotopy
theory, and just after the beginning, the reflection diverged from stacks and
rather centers itself around understanding the manifold ways of modeling
homotopy categories. Grothendieck continued the reflection until November of
the same year. In June he writes the first words of the introduction and
retakes it in February of 1984 when the reflection has ended months ago

  Sampling","Neurips 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Contrastive learning approaches have achieved great success in learning
visual representations with few labels of the target classes. That implies a
tantalizing possibility of scaling them up beyond a curated ""seed"" benchmark,
to incorporating more unlabeled images from the internet-scale external sources
to enhance its performance. However, in practice, larger amount of unlabeled
data will require more computing resources due to the bigger model size and
longer training needed. Moreover, open-world unlabeled data usually follows an
implicit long-tail class or attribute distribution, many of which also do not
belong to the target classes. Blindly leveraging all unlabeled data hence can
lead to the data imbalance as well as distraction issues. This motivates us to
seek a principled approach to strategically select unlabeled data from an
external source, in order to learn generalizable, balanced and diverse
representations for relevant classes. In this work, we present an open-world
unlabeled data sampling framework called Model-Aware K-center (MAK), which
follows three simple principles: (1) tailness, which encourages sampling of
examples from tail classes, by sorting the empirical contrastive loss
expectation (ECLE) of samples over random data augmentations; (2) proximity,
which rejects the out-of-distribution outliers that may distract training; and
(3) diversity, which ensures diversity in the set of sampled examples.
Empirically, using ImageNet-100-LT (without labels) as the seed dataset and two
""noisy"" external data sources, we demonstrate that MAK can consistently improve
both the overall representation quality and the class balancedness of the
learned features, as evaluated via linear classifier evaluation on full-shot
and few-shot settings. The code is available at:

is an unresolved problem in modern theoretical physics. In this paper, we
revisit the entanglement entropy via the Euclidean path integral (EPI) of the
quantum state and allow for the branching of semi-classical histories along the
Lorentzian evolution. We posit that there exist at least two histories that
contribute to EPI, where one is an information-losing history while the other
is information-preserving. At early times, the former dominates EPI, while at
late times the latter becomes dominant. By so doing we recover the essence of
the Page curve and thus the unitarity, albeit with the turning point, i.e., the
Page time, much shifted toward the late time. One implication of this modified
Page curve is that the entropy bound may thus be violated. We comment on the
similarity and difference between our approach and that of the replica
wormholes and the island conjecture.

the direct identification of C$_{i}$-related levels difficult. Recent
literature has suggested to assign the so-called M center, often found in
as-irradiated 4H-SiC, to charge state transitions of the C$_{i}$ defect in
different configurations. In this work, we have introduced excess carbon into
low-doped n-type 150 {\mu}m thick 4$H$-SiC epilayers by thermal annealing, with
a pyrolyzed carbon cap on the sample surface acting as a carbon source. Because
the layers exhibited initially low concentrations of carbon vacancies

complete V$_{C}$ annihilation, and formation of defects due to excess carbon,
i.e. carbon interstitials C$_{i}$ and their higher-order complexes. We report
on the occurrence of several new levels upon C injection which are likely
C$_{i}$-related. Their properties are different from those found for the M
center, which points towards a different structural identity of the detected
levels. This suggests the existence of a rich variety of C$_{i}$-related
defects. The study will also help generating new insights into the microscopic

Acoustoelectric interactions permit a wide range of tunability of the phonon

the shock front is not responsible for dissociating molecular gas, and conclude
that the molecular clouds are partly shielded and either entrained briefly in
the outflow, or left undisturbed while the hot wind flows around them.
Elsewhere in the galaxy, shock-excited H$_2$ extends at least $\sim$4 kpc from
the nuclei, tracing molecular gas even warmer than that between the nuclei,
where the two galaxies' interstellar media are colliding. A ridgeline of high
[O III]/H$\beta$ emission along the eastern arm aligns with the south nucleus'
stellar disk minor axis; optical integral field spectroscopy from WiFeS
suggests this highly ionized gas is centered at systemic velocity and likely
photoionized by direct line-of-sight to the south AGN.

Recent debiasing methods achieve good out-of-distribution (OOD)

presented in this paper. Directly determining stability boundaries by searching
the multidimensional space of inverters' droop gains is a computationally
prohibitive task. Instead, we build a certified stability region by utilizing a
generalized Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, which are a measure of proximity to
stability boundary. We establish an upper threshold for the eigenvalues that
determines the stability boundary of the entire system and demonstrate that
this value depends only on the network's R/X ratio but does not depend on the
grid topology. We also provide a conservative upper threshold of the
eigenvalues that are universal for any systems within a reasonable range of R/X
ratios. We then construct approximate certified stability regions representing
convex sets in the multidimensional space of droop gains that could be utilized
for gains optimization. We show how the certified stability region can be
maximized by properly choosing droop gains, and we provide closed-form analytic
expressions for the certified stability regions. The computational complexity
of our method is almost independent of the number of inverters. The proposed

the complex appearance and texture of the body. We propose to address these
issues in a motion-guided frame-upsampling framework that is capable of
producing realistic human motion and appearance. A novel motion model is
trained to inference the non-linear skeletal motion between frames by
leveraging a large-scale motion-capture dataset (AMASS). The high-frame-rate
pose predictions are then used by a neural rendering pipeline to produce the
full-frame output, taking the pose and background consistency into
consideration. Our pipeline only requires low-frame-rate videos and unpaired
human motion data but does not require high-frame-rate videos for training.
Furthermore, we contribute the first evaluation dataset that consists of
high-quality and high-frame-rate videos of human activities for this task.
Compared with state-of-the-art video interpolation techniques, our method
produces in-between frames with better quality and accuracy, which is evident
by state-of-the-art results on pixel-level, distributional metrics and

models which allow to sample from class-conditional distributions. Existing
cGANs are based on a wide range of different discriminator designs and training
objectives. One popular design in earlier works is to include a classifier
during training with the assumption that good classifiers can help eliminate
samples generated with wrong classes. Nevertheless, including classifiers in
cGANs often comes with a side effect of only generating easy-to-classify
samples. Recently, some representative cGANs avoid the shortcoming and reach
state-of-the-art performance without having classifiers. Somehow it remains
unanswered whether the classifiers can be resurrected to design better cGANs.
In this work, we demonstrate that classifiers can be properly leveraged to
improve cGANs. We start by using the decomposition of the joint probability
distribution to connect the goals of cGANs and classification as a unified
framework. The framework, along with a classic energy model to parameterize
distributions, justifies the use of classifiers for cGANs in a principled
manner. It explains several popular cGAN variants, such as ACGAN, ProjGAN, and
ContraGAN, as special cases with different levels of approximations, which
provides a unified view and brings new insights to understanding cGANs.
Experimental results demonstrate that the design inspired by the proposed
framework outperforms state-of-the-art cGANs on multiple benchmark datasets,
especially on the most challenging ImageNet. The code is available at

these techniques require a careful maintenance of anchor points in conjunction
with appropriately selected ""mega-batchsizes"". This leads to a challenging

in order to avoid the use of anchor points and large batchsizes, and still
obtain the optimal rate for this setting. Yet, their method called STORM

modulating amplitude is kept fixed at $10\%$ of the shear velocity except to
demonstrate that varying this parameter changes little. The resulting shear at
the plates are found to be independent of the forcing frequency, and equal to
the non-modulated baseline. For the non-rotating simulations, two clear flow
regions can be seen: a near wall region that follows Stokes' theoretical
solution, and a bulk region that behaves similar to Stokes' solutions but with
an increased effective viscosity. For high driving frequencies, the amplitude
response follows the scaling laws for modulated turbulence of von der Heydt
\emph{et al.} (Physical Review E 67, 046308 (2003)). Cyclonic rotation is not
found to modify the system's behaviour in a substantial way, but anti-cyclonic
rotation significantly changes the system's response to periodic forcing. We
find that the persistent axial inhomogeneities introduced by mild anti-cyclonic
rotation make it impossible to measure the propagation of the modulation
adequately, while stronger anti-cyclonic rotation creates regions where the
modulation travels instantaneously.

as the trailing edge, but this can be avoided by judicious processing. The
cracking seen in CM247LC -- in solid-state, liquation and solidification forms
-- is avoided. A novel sub-solvus heat treatment strategy is proposed which
takes advantage of AM not requiring solutioning; super-solvus heat treatment is
inappropriate since it embrittles the material by deterioration of the texture
and coarsening of grain boundary carbides. The tensile strength of the new

CM247LC up to $\sim$900$\,$$^\circ$C. The oxidation resistance is best when Al

inaccurate predictions. We investigate two Bayesian models for auto-contouring,
DropOut and FlipOut, using a quantitative measure - expected calibration error
(ECE) and a qualitative measure - region-based accuracy-vs-uncertainty (R-AvU)
graphs. It is well understood that a model should have low ECE to be considered
trustworthy. However, in a QA context, a model should also have high
uncertainty in inaccurate regions and low uncertainty in accurate regions. Such
behaviour could direct visual attention of expert users to potentially
inaccurate regions, leading to a speed up in the QA process. Using R-AvU
graphs, we qualitatively compare the behaviour of different models in accurate
and inaccurate regions. Experiments are conducted on the MICCAI2015 Head and
Neck Segmentation Challenge and on the DeepMindTCIA CT dataset using three
models: DropOut-DICE, Dropout-CE (Cross Entropy) and FlipOut-CE. Quantitative
results show that DropOut-DICE has the highest ECE, while Dropout-CE and
FlipOut-CE have the lowest ECE. To better understand the difference between
DropOut-CE and FlipOut-CE, we use the R-AvU graph which shows that FlipOut-CE
has better uncertainty coverage in inaccurate regions than DropOut-CE. Such a
combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics explores a new approach

of 42 H&N OARs. SOARS stratifies 42 OARs into anchor, mid-level, and small &
hard subcategories, with specifically derived neural network architectures for
each category by neural architecture search (NAS) principles. We built SOARS
models using 176 training patients in an internal institution and independently
evaluated on 1327 external patients across six different institutions. It
consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by at least 3-5% in
Dice score for each institutional evaluation (up to 36% relative error
reduction in other metrics). More importantly, extensive multi-user studies
evidently demonstrated that 98% of the SOARS predictions need only very minor
or no revisions for direct clinical acceptance (saving 90% radiation
oncologists workload), and their segmentation and dosimetric accuracy are
within or smaller than the inter-user variation. These findings confirmed the
strong clinical applicability of SOARS for the OAR delineation process in H&N
cancer radiotherapy workflows, with improved efficiency, comprehensiveness, and

pandemic dynamics appeared in the literature, of which many use the susceptible
infected removed (SIR) and susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) models,
or their variants, to simulate and study the spread of the coronavirus. SIR and
SEIR are continuous-time models which are a class of initial value problems
(IVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Discrete-time models such as
regression and machine learning have also been applied to analyze COVID-19
pandemic data (e.g. predicting infection cases), but most of these methods use
simplified models involving a small number of input variables pre-selected
based on a priori knowledge, or use very complicated models (e.g. deep
learning), purely focusing on certain prediction purposes and paying little
attention to the model interpretability. There have been relatively fewer
studies focusing on the investigations of the inherent time-lagged or
time-delayed relationships e.g. between the reproduction number (R number),
infection cases, and deaths, analyzing the pandemic spread from a systems
thinking and dynamic perspective. The present study, for the first time,
proposes using systems engineering and system identification approach to build
transparent, interpretable, parsimonious and simulatable (TIPS) dynamic machine
learning models, establishing links between the R number, the infection cases
and deaths caused by COVID-19. The TIPS models are developed based on the
well-known NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous
inputs) model, which can help better understand the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics.
A case study on the UK COVID-19 data is carried out, and new findings are
detailed. The proposed method and the associated new findings are useful for
better understanding the spread dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

PM diagnosis, early identification of this ailment is essential for patient
health. Objective: In this study, we use artificial intelligence algorithms
recommending the best fit model for early diagnosis and prognosis of MPM.
Methods: We retrospectively retrieved patients clinical data collected by Dicle
University, Turkey, and applied multilayered perceptron (MLP), voted perceptron
(VP), Clojure classifier (CC), kernel logistic regression (KLR), stochastic
gradient decent SGD), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), Hoeffding tree (VFDT), and

evaluated the models, compared and tested using paired T-test (corrected) at
0.05 significance based on their respective classification accuracy, f-measure,
precision, recall, root mean squared error, receivers characteristic curve

and a general fractional total variation regularization term, which contains a
wide class of fractional derivative. Compared to the TG prior, the GFTG prior
can effectively reduce the staircase effect, enhance the texture details of the
images and also provide a complete theoretical analysis in the
infinite-dimensional limit similarly to TG prior. The separability of the state
space in Bayesian inference is essential for developments of probability and
integration theory in infinite-dimensional setting, thus we first introduce the
corresponding general fractional Sobolev space and prove that the space is a
separable Banach space. Thereafter, we give the well-posedness and
finite-dimensional approximation of the posterior measure of the Bayesian
inverse problem based on the GFTG prior, and then the samples are extracted
from the posterior distribution by using the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson

normally consolidated clays, the expression developed by Jaky is considered to
hold good. The extension of Jaky's equation for overconsolidated soils is built
entirely on empirical observation; and there is lack of a theoretical framework
that satisfactorily explains the relationships. In this paper, these
relationships are investigated from the nature of energy dissipation of soil
aggregates. For the same, the cyclic stress-dilatancy relationship proposed by
the author is employed. Then, the stress ratio that maximizes entropy is
derived; and this stress ratio is shown to be reasonably close to the
coefficient earth pressure ratio proposed by Jaky. An exponential relationship
between K0 and OCR is derived; and for a special case, the exponent is shown to
be the sine of the critical state friction angle. Finally, some generalizations

Leibniz & Kant (1768), Maynard Smith (1970), Einstein & Infeld (1961), and
Anfinsen (1973), is sufficient for a better understanding of the
protein-evolution and, consequently, to determine the factors that could
control it. The preliminary results -- without considering epistasis effects
explicitly -- indicate that the protein marginal-stability change upon point
mutations provides the necessary and sufficient information to describe,
through a Boltzmann factor, the evolution of the amide hydrogen-exchange
protection factors. This finding is of paramount importance because it
illustrates the impact of point mutations on both the protein
marginal-stability and the ensemble of folded conformations coexisting with the
native state and, in the presence of metamorphism, on the propensity for the
appearance of new folds and functions.

Many studies use computational modeling to understand how various
mechanochemical factors contribute to membrane shape transformations. Compared
to approximation-based methods (e.g., finite element method), the class of
discrete mesh models offers greater flexibility to simulate complex physics and
shapes in three dimensions; its formulation produces an efficient algorithm
while maintaining coordinate-free geometric descriptions. However, ambiguities
in geometric definitions in the discrete context have led to a lack of
consensus on which discrete mesh model is theoretically and numerically
optimal; a bijective relationship between the terms contributing to both the
energy and forces from the discrete and smooth geometric theories remains to be
established. We address this and present an extensible framework,
$\texttt{Mem3DG}$, for modeling 3D mechanochemical dynamics of membranes based
on Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) on triangulated meshes. The formalism
of DDG resolves the inconsistency and provides a unifying perspective on how to
relate the smooth and discrete energy and forces. To demonstrate,
$\texttt{Mem3DG}$ is used to model a sequence of examples with increasing
mechanochemical complexity: recovering classical shape transformations such as
1) biconcave disk, dumbbell, and unduloid and 2) spherical bud on spherical,
flat-patch membrane; investigating how the coupling of membrane mechanics with
protein mobility jointly affects phase and shape transformation. As
high-resolution 3D imaging of membrane ultrastructure becomes more readily
available, we envision Mem3DG to be applied as an end-to-end tool to simulate
realistic cell geometry under user-specified mechanochemical conditions.

  Natural Disaster",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This study proposes a novel method to assess damages in the built environment
using a deep learning workflow to quantify it. Thanks to an automated crawler,
aerial images from before and after a natural disaster of 50 epicenters
worldwide were obtained from Google Earth, generating a 10,000 aerial image
database with a spatial resolution of 2 m per pixel. The study utilizes the
algorithm Seg-Net to perform semantic segmentation of the built environment
from the satellite images in both instances (prior and post-natural disasters).
For image segmentation, Seg-Net is one of the most popular and general CNN
architectures. The Seg-Net algorithm used reached an accuracy of 92% in the
segmentation. After the segmentation, we compared the disparity between both
cases represented as a percentage of change. Such coefficient of change
represents the damage numerically an urban environment had to quantify the
overall damage in the built environment. Such an index can give the government
an estimate of the number of affected households and perhaps the extent of
housing damage.

systems. Finite element method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing
stress analysis of complex material systems. A way to accelerate stress
analysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress
analysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix
composite material system and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative
to the FEM approach for stress field prediction. We first try to predict stress
field maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers with
varying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between
the spatial arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the
corresponding von Mises stress field. This is achieved by using a convolutional
neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture, using true stress maps
of systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a
encoder-decoder network which in this study takes in the composite material
image as an input and outputs the stress field image which is of the same size
as the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking different
initializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the
prediction accuracy to the small number of training samples. When the number of
fibers in the composite material system is increased for the same volume
fraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required to represent
the geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost.
Thus, the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with
larger number of fibers with varying spatial configurations using information
from the true stress maps of relatively cheaper systems of smaller fiber
number.

Open Differential (3-OOD) mechanism to eliminate slipping of the tracks due to
the changing cross-sections of the pipe. This will be achieved in any
orientation of the robot. Previous pipe climbers use three-wheel/track modules,
each with an individual driving mechanism to achieve stable traversing.
Slipping of tracks is prevalent in such robots when it encounters the pipe
turns. Thus, active control of each module's speed is employed to mitigate the
slip, thereby requiring substantial control effort. The proposed pipe climber
implements the 3-OOD to address this issue by allowing the robot to
mechanically modulate the track speeds as it encounters a turn. The proposed
3-OOD is the first three-output differential to realize the functional
abilities of a traditional two-output differential.
