  for Virtual Reality",,,,,"cs.GT cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Metaverse is regarded as the next-generation Internet paradigm that
allows humans to play, work, and socialize in an alternative virtual world with
immersive experience, for instance, via head-mounted display for Virtual
Reality (VR) rendering. With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and
powerful edge computing technologies, VR users in wireless edge-empowered
Metaverse can immerse in the virtual through the access of VR services offered
by different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and
communication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR
service delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication
and computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an
effective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore,
in this paper, we propose a learning-based Incentive Mechanism framework for VR
services in the Metaverse. First, we propose the quality of perception as the
metric for VR users immersing in the virtual world. Second, for quick trading
of VR services between VR users (i.e., buyers) and VR SPs (i.e., sellers), we
design a double Dutch auction mechanism to determine optimal pricing and
allocation rules in this market. Third, for auction communication reduction, we
design a deep reinforcement learning-based auctioneer to accelerate this
auction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve near-optimal social welfare while reducing at least half of the
auction information exchange cost than baseline methods.

investigate potential avenues to building networks that scale with the number
of users, communication distance, and application demands by simulating
alternative hardware designs and control protocols. Several quantum network
simulators have been recently developed with these goals in mind. However, as
the size of the simulated networks increases, sequential execution becomes time
consuming. Parallel execution presents a suitable method for scalable
simulations of large-scale quantum networks, but the unique attributes of
quantum information create some unexpected challenges. In this work we identify
requirements for parallel simulation of quantum networks and develop the first
parallel discrete event quantum network simulator by modifying the existing
serial SeQUeNCe simulator. Our contributions include the design and development
of a quantum state manager (QSM) that maintains shared quantum information
distributed across multiple processes. We also optimize our parallel code by
minimizing the overhead of the QSM and decreasing the amount of synchronization
among processes. Using these techniques, we observe a speedup of 2 to 25 times
when simulating a 1,024-node linear network with 2 to 128 processes. We also
observe efficiency greater than 0.5 for up to 32 processes in a linear network
topology of the same size and with the same workload. We repeat this evaluation
with a randomized workload on a caveman network. Finally, we also introduce
several methods for partitioning networks by mapping them to different parallel
simulation processes. We released the parallel SeQUeNCe simulator as an
open-source tool alongside the existing sequential version.

grains are condensed in the outflows of carbon stars. SiC dust could be a
significant constituent of interstellar dust since it is generally believed
that carbon stars inject a considerable amount of dust into the interstellar
medium (ISM). The presence of SiC dust in the ISM is also supported by the
identification of presolar SiC grains of stellar origin in primitive
meteorites. However, the 11.3-micron absorption feature of SiC has never been
seen in the ISM and oxidative destruction of SiC is often invoked. In this work
we quantitatively explore the destruction of interstellar SiC dust through
oxidation based on molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory
calculations. We find that the reaction of an oxygen atom with SiC molecules
and clusters is exothermic and could cause CO-loss. Nevertheless, even if this
is extrapolable to bulk SiC dust, the destruction rate of SiC dust through
oxidation could still be considerably smaller than the (currently believed)
injection rate from carbon stars. Therefore, the lack of the 11.3-micron
absorption feature of SiC dust in the ISM remains a mystery. A possible
solution may lie in the currently believed stellar injection rate of SiC (which
may have been overestimated) and/or the size of SiC dust (which may actually be
considerably smaller than submicron in size).

expression values to 500 by using an autoencoder. This encoded representation
is passed to the deep neural network of the second stage for the classification

time block codes (STBCs), aiming at improving the overall VLC system
reliability. Based on this and in order to further enhance the achievable
transmission data rate, we integrate quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) with SM,
since relaxing the orthogonality condition of OSTBC ultimately provides a
higher coding rate. Then, we generalize the developed results to any number of
active light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and any M-ary pulse amplitude modulation
size. Furthermore, we derive a tight and tractable upper bound for the
corresponding bit error rate (BER) by considering a simple two-step decoding
procedure to detect the indices of the transmitting LEDs and then decode the
signal domain symbols. Notably, the obtained results demonstrate that QOSTBC
with SM enhances the achievable BER compared to SM with repetition coding
(RC-SM). Finally, we compare STBC-SM with both multiple active SM (MASM) and
RC-SM in terms of the achievable BER and overall data rate, which further
justifies the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

this configuration a peculiar density profile characterized by two dense,
separate regions is observed, at odds with configurations in which the PEG
chains reside on the surface of the PNIPAM core. The conformation of the PEG

transfer to downstream tasks. To further enhance CLIP's few-shot capability,
CLIP-Adapter proposed to fine-tune a lightweight residual feature adapter and
significantly improves the performance for few-shot classification. However,
such a process still needs extra training and computational resources. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{T}raining-Free CL\textbf{IP}-\textbf{Adapter}
(\textbf{Tip-Adapter}), which not only inherits CLIP's training-free advantage
but also performs comparably or even better than CLIP-Adapter. Tip-Adapter does
not require any back propagation for training the adapter, but creates the
weights by a key-value cache model constructed from the few-shot training set.
In this non-parametric manner, Tip-Adapter acquires well-performed adapter
weights without any training, which is both efficient and effective. Moreover,
the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted by fine-tuning such
properly initialized adapter for only a few epochs with super-fast convergence
speed. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on ImageNet
and other 10 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of proposed Tip-Adapter.

ones. This type of access is crucial in applications such as drug delivery,
environmental detection, and collection of small samples. However, there are
some tasks that are not possible to perform using only one robot including
assembly and manufacturing at small scales, manipulation of micro- and nano-
objects, and robot-based structuring of small-scale materials. The solution to
this problem is to use a group of robots as a system. Thus, we focus on tasks
that can be achieved using a group of small-scale robots. These robots are
typically externally actuated due to their size limitation. Yet, one faces the
challenge of controlling a group of robots using a single global input. We
propose a control algorithm to position individual members of a swarm in
predefined positions. A single control input applies to the system and moves
all robots in the same direction. We also add another control modality by using
different length robots. An electromagnetic coil system applied external force
and steered the millirobots. This millirobot can move in various modes of
motion such as pivot walking and tumbling. We propose two new designs of these
millirobots. In the first design, the magnets are placed at the center of body
to reduce the magnetic attraction force. In the second design, the millirobots
are of identical length with two extra legs acting as the pivot points. This
way we vary pivot separation in design to take advantage of variable speed in
pivot walking mode while keeping the speed constant in tumbling mode. This
paper presents a general algorithm for positional control of n millirobots with
different lengths to move them from given initial positions to final desired
ones. This method is based on choosing a leader that is fully controllable.
Simulations and hardware experiments validate these results.

sweep and tilt angles in the robot's motion is also investigated. We propose
two controllers to regulate the gait of the pivot walker. The first one is a
proportional-geometric controller, which determines the correct pivot point
that the millirobot should use. Then, it regulates the angular velocity
proportionally based on the error between the center of the millirobot and the
reference trajectory. The second controller is based on a gradient descent
optimization technique, which expresses the control action as an optimization
problem. These control algorithms enable the millirobot to generate a stable
gait while tracking the desired trajectory. We conduct a set of different
experiments and simulation runs to establish the effectiveness of proposed
controllers for different sweep and tilt angles in terms of the tracking error.
The two controllers exhibit an appropriate performance, but it is observed that
gradient descent based controller yields faster convergence time, smaller
tracking error, and fewer number of steps. Finally, we perform an extensive
experimentally parametric analysis on the effect of the sweep angle, tilt
angle, and step time on the tracking error. As we expect, the
optimization-based controller outperforms the geometric based controller.

those three challenges by exploiting the noise of quantum circuits. We consider
a variational architecture containing a depolarizing channel after each unitary

closed-form approximation for the free-energy of such circuit and use it as a
cost function for our variational algorithm. By evaluating our method on a
variety of Hamiltonians and system sizes, we find several systems for which the
thermal state can be approximated with a high fidelity. However, we also show
that the ability for our algorithm to learn the thermal state strongly depends

temperatures, we identify a specific range for which the problem becomes more
challenging. We hope that this first study on noise-assisted thermal state

diverge to infinity in stochastic environments under a certain assumption of
stochasticity. While durative actions or action repetition can be employed to
have $\delta$-invariance, previous action repetition methods cannot immediately
react to unexpected situations in stochastic environments. We thus propose a
novel $\delta$-invariant method named Safe Action Repetition (SAR) applicable
to any existing PG algorithm. SAR can handle the stochasticity of environments
by adaptively reacting to changes in states during action repetition. We
empirically show that our method is not only $\delta$-invariant but also robust
to stochasticity, outperforming previous $\delta$-invariant approaches on eight

  - see pdf for full abstract",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequency estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in streaming
algorithms. Given a stream $S$ of elements from some universe $U=\{1 \ldots
n\}$, the goal is to compute, in a single pass, a short sketch of $S$ so that
for any element $i \in U$, one can estimate the number $x_i$ of times $i$
occurs in $S$ based on the sketch alone. Two state of the art solutions to this
problems are the Count-Min and Count-Sketch algorithms. The frequency estimator
$\tilde{x}$ produced by Count-Min, using $O(1/\varepsilon \cdot \log n)$
dimensions, guarantees that $\|\tilde{x}-x\|_{\infty} \le \varepsilon \|x\|_1$
with high probability, and $\tilde{x} \ge x$ holds deterministically. Also,
Count-Min works under the assumption that $x \ge 0$. On the other hand,
Count-Sketch, using $O(1/\varepsilon^2 \cdot \log n)$ dimensions, guarantees
that $\|\tilde{x}-x\|_{\infty} \le \varepsilon \|x\|_2$ with high probability.
A natural question is whether it is possible to design the best of both worlds
sketching method, with error guarantees depending on the $\ell_2$ norm and
space comparable to Count-Sketch, but (like Count-Min) also has the
no-underestimation property.
  Our main set of results shows that the answer to the above question is
negative. We show this in two incomparable computational models: linear
sketching and streaming algorithms. We also study the complementary problem,
where the sketch is required to not over-estimate, i.e., $\tilde{x} \le x$
should hold always.

find that this new ansatz solves problems identified in the previous unitary
coupled cluster ansatz for density cumulant theory: the theory is now free of
near-zero denominators between occupied and virtual blocks, can correctly
describe the dissociation of H$_2$, and is rigorously size-extensive. In
addition, the new ansatz has fewer terms than the previous unitary ansatz, and
the optimal orbitals delivered by the exact theory are the natural orbitals.
Numerical studies on systems amenable to full configuration interaction show
that the amplitudes from the previous ODC-12 method approximate the exact
amplitudes predicted by this ansatz. Studies on equilibrium properties of
diatomic molecules show that even with the new ansatz, it is necessary to
include triples to improve the accuracy of the method compared to orbital
optimized linearized coupled cluster doubles. With a simple iterative triples
correction, O$\lambda$DCT outperforms other orbital-optimized methods truncated
at comparable levels in the amplitudes, as well as CCSD(T). By adding four more
terms to the cumulant parameterization, O$\lambda$DCT outperforms CCSDT while
having the same $\mathcal{O}(V^5 O^3)$ scaling.

well-posedness, but for a smaller range, $s_1 < s \le s_{crit}$, \begin{align*}

$x(0, \xi) = A \xi + \varphi(\xi)$, where $A$ is a constant $SL(d, \mathbb{R})$

  A key observation in the proof is that the equations of evolution for the
vorticities decomposes into a first-order hyperbolic system, for which a
Strichartz estimate holds, and a coupled transport system. This allows one to
set up a bootstrap argument to prove local existence and uniqueness. Continuous
dependence on initial data is proved using an argument inspired by Bona and
Smith, and Kato and Lai, with a modification based on new estimates for Riesz
potentials. The results of this paper should be compared to what is known for
the ideal fluid equations, where, as shown by Bourgain and Li, the requirement

the surface of young stars. These spots manifest as surface thermal
inhomogeneities, which alter the global temperature measured on the stars. To
understand the effects and implications of these starspots, we conducted a
large iSHELL high-resolution infrared spectroscopic survey of T Tauri stars in
Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. From the K band spectra, we
measured stellar temperatures and magnetic field strengths using a magnetic
radiative transfer code. We compared our infrared-derived parameters against
literature optical temperatures and found a) a systematic temperature
difference between optical and infrared observations, and b) a positive
correlation between the magnetic field strengths and the temperature
differences. The discrepant temperature measurements imply significant
differences in the inferred stellar masses from stellar evolutionary models. To
discern which temperature better predicts the mass of the star, we compared our
model-derived masses against dynamical masses measured from ALMA and PdBI for a
sub-sample of our sources. From this comparison we conclude that, in the range
of stellar masses from 0.3 to 1.3 $\rm M_\odot$, neither infrared nor optical
temperatures perfectly reproduce the stellar dynamical masses. But, on average,
infrared temperatures produce more precise and accurate stellar masses than
optical ones.

It is either a posted price mechanism or a two-part tariff mechanism. As a
corollary of our result, we show how to compute an approximately optimal and

support on this reaction carried out in a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge
(DBD) plasma reactor. The discharge was created using a variable AC applied
voltage at room temperature and near atmospheric pressure (550 Torr). Two
catalyst supports were compared: porous silica (\ce{SiO2}) ceramic beads and
smooth, non-porous soda lime glass beads of almost equal diameter ($\sim$1.5
mm) were used. \ce{N2} conversion and the \ce{NH3} synthesis rate was increased
with increasing voltage for both supports, but the energy yield for \ce{NH3}
production increased for the \ce{SiO2} beads and decreased for the glass beads.
All three of these parameters were always higher when using the \ce{SiO2}
beads, which suggests that porosity can be a small advantage for plasma
assisted \ce{NH3} synthesis. Discharge and plasma properties were estimated
from Lissajous plots and using calculations with the BOLSIG+ software. The
effect of different catalyst supports on the physical properties of the
discharge was negligible. High resolution optical emission spectra (OES) were
used to explore the evolution of gas phase active species, \ce{N2+}, atomic N,
electronically excited \ce{N2}, and atomic H (H$_\alpha$, H$_\beta$), in the
plasma in the presence of both supports. The relative concentration of these
species was lower in the case of the porous \ce{SiO2} beads for all applied
voltages, which suggests that surface reactions are more significant than gas
phase reactions for the formation of \ce{NH3} in plasma assisted \ce{NH3}
synthesis.

The Shortest Superstring problem is NP-hard and several constant-factor

algorithm, which repeatedly merges two strings of maximum overlap until a
single string remains. The GREEDY algorithm, being simpler than other
well-performing approximation algorithms for this problem, has attracted
attention since the 1980s and is commonly used in practical applications.
  Tarhio and Ukkonen (TCS 1988) conjectured that GREEDY gives a
2-approximation. In a seminal work, Blum, Jiang, Li, Tromp, and Yannakakis

for $\xi \gg 1$, the dynamics depends both on $\mathcal{O}h$ and $\xi$. While
the model results show some discrepancies for small $\mathcal{O}h$, they are in
very good agreement with the experiments for moderately large $\mathcal{O}h$.
The work thereby offers an elaborate description of the droplet impact dynamics
in a non-wetting scenario.

different words and noise conditions. We explore supervised contrastive

when the adversary chooses the next update after seeing the previous outputs of
the algorithm. We obtain faster dynamic algorithms against an adaptive

vs. adaptive settings. To get these results we exploit techniques from
differential privacy, cryptography, and adaptive data analysis.
  We give a general reduction transforming a dynamic algorithm against an
oblivious adversary to a dynamic algorithm robust against an adaptive
adversary. This reduction maintains several copies of the oblivious algorithm
and uses differential privacy to protect their random bits. Using this
reduction we obtain dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary with
improved update and query times for global minimum cut, all pairs distances,
and all pairs effective resistance.
  We further improve our update and query times by showing how to maintain a
sparsifier over an expander decomposition that can be refreshed fast. This fast
refresh enables it to be robust against what we call a blinking adversary that
can observe the output of the algorithm only following refreshes. We believe
that these techniques will prove useful for additional problems.
  On the flip side, we specify dynamic problems that, assuming a random oracle,
every dynamic algorithm that solves them against an adaptive adversary must be
polynomially slower than a rather straightforward dynamic algorithm that solves
them against an oblivious adversary. We first show a separation result for a
search problem and then show a separation result for an estimation problem. In
the latter case our separation result draws from lower bounds in adaptive data
analysis.

Our detection approach works at both RTL and gate-level, does not require a

reachable states. In the second stage, it performs an approximate analysis to
find the don't care transitions. In the third stage, it performs a state-space
exploration from reachable states that have incoming don't care transitions to
find behavioral discrepancies with respect to what has been observed in the
first stage. We also present a pruning technique based on the reachability of
FSM states. We present a methodology that leverages both RTL and gate-level for
soundness and efficiency. Specifically, we show that don't care transitions
must be detected at the gate-level, i.e., after synthesis has been performed,
for soundness. However, under specific conditions, Trojan detection can be
performed more efficiently at RTL. Evaluation of our approach on a set of
benchmarks from OpenCores and TrustHub and using gate-level representation

shows that our approach is both efficient (up to 10X speedup w.r.t. no pruning)

merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. Interest in AGNs as nurseries for
merging BBH is rising following the detection of gravitational waves from a BBH
system from the purported pair-instability mass gap, most notably, GW190521.
Active galactic nuclei have also been invoked to explain the formation of the
high-mass-ratio system, GW190814. We draw on simulations of BBH systems in AGN
to propose a phenomenological model for the distribution of black hole spins of
merging binaries in AGN disks. The model incorporates distinct features that
make the AGN channel potentially distinguishable from other channels, such as
assembly in the field and in globular clusters. The model parameters can be
mapped heuristically to the age and density of AGN disks. We estimate the
extent to which different populations of mergers in AGNs can be distinguished.
If most merging black holes are assembled in AGNs, future gravitational-wave
observations may provide insights into the dynamics of AGN disks.

deep and complicated feedforward neural networks to model the skeleton sequence
without considering the complexity in recent year. In this paper, a simple yet
effective multi-scale semantics-guided neural network (MS-SGN) is proposed for

semantics of joints (joint type and frame index) into the network to enhance
the feature representation capability of joints. Moreover, a multi-scale
strategy is proposed to be robust to the temporal scale variations. In
addition, we exploit the relationship of joints hierarchically through two
modules, i.e., a joint-level module for modeling the correlations of joints in
the same frame and a frame-level module for modeling the temporal dependencies
of frames. With an order of magnitude smaller model size than most previous
methods, MSSGN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60, NTU120,

management task. However, it is challenging to understand a DRL-based trading
strategy because of the black-box nature of deep neural networks. In this
paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents
for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as
the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing
actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a
linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL
agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are
the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model.
Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and
multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by
calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent
and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods.
Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent
stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021. Our approach empirically reveals that a
DRL agent exhibits a stronger multi-step prediction power than machine learning
methods.

configuration of the central retinal vessel trunk and its branches (CRVT&B)
could be used as a diagnostic marker for glaucoma. Method: We trained a deep
learning network to automatically segment the CRVT&B from the B-scans of the
optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH).
Subsequently, two different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using
the structural configuration of the CRVT&B as extracted from the OCT volumes.
In the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using only 3D CNN and
the 3D structure of the CRVT&B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D
structure of the CRVT&B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images,
and then a 2D CNN was used for diagnosis. The segmentation accuracy was
evaluated using the Dice coefficient, whereas the diagnostic accuracy was
assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves
(AUC). The diagnostic performance of the CRVT&B was also compared with that of
retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Results: Our segmentation network
was able to efficiently segment retinal blood vessels from OCT scans. On a test
set, we achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81\pm0.07. The 3D and 2D diagnostic
networks were able to differentiate glaucoma from non-glaucoma subjects with
accuracies of 82.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for CRVT&B
were 0.89 and 0.90, higher than those obtained with RNFL thickness alone.
Conclusions: Our work demonstrated that the diagnostic power of the CRVT&B is
superior to that of a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e., RNFL thickness.
Our work also suggested that the major retinal blood vessels form a skeleton --
the configuration of which may be representative of major ONH structural
changes as typically observed with the development and progression of glaucoma.

sizable enhancement to the proton structure factor from the time component.
Besides, we find a residue momentum dependence in the quark-nucleon matching

sensitivity compared with conventional contact interaction. We promote this
endeavor by deriving direct limits on sub-GeV spin-dependent boosted dark

streams of material (accretion flows) connecting the envelope to the disk.
However, accretion flows in these early stages of protostellar formation still
remain poorly characterized due to their low intensity and possibly some
extended structures are disregarded as being part of the outflow cavity. We use
ALMA archival data of a young Class 0 protostar, Lupus 3-MMS, to uncover four
extended accretion flow-like structures in C$^{18}$O that follow the edges of
the outflows. We make various types of position-velocity cuts to compare with

then use a dendrogram algorithm to isolate five sub-structures in
position-position-velocity space. Four out of the five sub-structures fit well

influence the lifecycle of coral and coral reefs such as ocean acidification,
deoxygenation and other physical parameters such as flow rate and surface area.
Ocean acidification depends on the amount of dissolved Carbon dioxide (CO2).
This is due to the release of H+ ions upon the reaction of the dissolved CO2
gases with the calcium carbonate compounds in the ocean. Deoxygenation is
another problem that leads to hypoxia which is characterized by a lesser amount
of dissolved oxygen in water than the required amount for the existence of
marine organisms. In this article, we highlight the importance of physical
parameters such as flow rate which influence gas exchange, heat dissipation,

been a de-facto standard training algorithm for various machine learning tasks.
However, there still exists an open question as to why SGDs find highly
generalizable parameters from non-convex target functions, such as the loss
function of neural networks. An ""escape efficiency"" has been an attractive
notion to tackle this question, which measures how SGD efficiently escapes from
sharp minima with potentially low generalization performance. Despite its
importance, the notion has the limitation that it works only when SGD reaches a
stationary distribution after sufficient updates. In this paper, we develop a
new theory to investigate escape efficiency of SGD with Gaussian noise, by
introducing the Large Deviation Theory for dynamical systems. Based on the
theory, we prove that the fast escape form sharp minima, named exponential
escape, occurs in a non-stationary setting, and that it holds not only for
continuous SGD but also for discrete SGD. A key notion for the result is a
quantity called ""steepness,"" which describes the SGD's stochastic behavior

However, the significant performance overhead incurred by dynamic taint
analysis restricts its usage in production systems. Previous efforts on
mitigating the performance penalty fall into two categories, parallelizing
taint tracking from program execution and abstracting the tainting logic to a
higher granularity. Both approaches have only met with limited success.
  In this work, we propose Sdft, an efficient approach that combines the
precision of DBI-based instruction-level taint tracking and the efficiency of
function-level abstract taint propagation. First, we build the library function

GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model that attempts to resolve these
issues by providing real-time predictions of the source of a gravitational wave
detection. The model uses information from Open Public Alerts (OPAs) released
by LIGO-Virgo within minutes of a gravitational wave detection. GWSkyNet was
first introduced in Cabero et al. (2020) as a binary classifier and uses the
OPA skymaps to classify sources as either astrophysical or as glitches. In this
paper, we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi, a new version of GWSkyNet which further
distinguishes sources as binary black hole mergers, mergers involving a neutron
star, or non-astrophysical glitches in the detectors. GWSkyNet-Multi is a
sequence of three one-versus-all classifiers trained using a class-balanced and
physically-motivated source mass distribution. Training on this data set, we
obtain test set accuracies of 94% for BBH-versus-all, 94% for NS-versus-all,

hierarchical classification scheme. Furthermore, we correctly identify 36 of
the 40 gravitational wave detections from the first half of LIGO-Virgo's third
observing run (O3a) and present predictions for O3b sources. We also briefly

increases the training difficulty and results in 3D ambiguities. Second,
non-stationary data distribution makes it difficult to strike a balance between
fitting regular frames and hard samples with severe occlusions or dramatic
changes. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Bilevel Online Adaptation

additional 3D guidance by co-training with similar source examples retrieved
efficiently despite the distribution shift. Furthermore, it can adaptively
adjust the number of optimization steps on individual frames to fully fit hard

between biological and artificial neurons. The output of these pyramidal
neurons first increases to a maximum with input and then decreases. Artificial
neurons with similar characteristics can be designed with oscillating

allowing single neurons to have multiple hyper-planes in their decision
boundary. This enables even single neurons to learn the XOR function. This
paper proposes four new oscillating activation functions inspired by human

Oscillating activation functions are non-saturating for all inputs unlike
popular activation functions, leading to improved gradient flow and faster

monotonic or non-monotonic single-zero activation functions enables neural
networks to train faster and solve classification problems with fewer layers.

our method contains two modules, namely feature palette composition (FPC) and
attention coloring (AC) modules. The FPC module captures representative

following AC module calculates attention maps between content and style images,

Lutz, Satyadev Nandakumar and Subin Pulari","A Weyl Criterion for Finite-State Dimension and Applications",,,,,"cs.IT math.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finite-state dimension, introduced early in this century as a finite-state
version of classical Hausdorff dimension, is a quantitative measure of the
lower asymptotic density of information in an infinite sequence over a finite
alphabet, as perceived by finite automata. Finite-state dimension is a robust
concept that now has equivalent formulations in terms of finite-state gambling,
lossless finite-state data compression, finite-state prediction, entropy rates,
and automatic Kolmogorov complexity. The Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem gave
the first automata-theoretic characterization of normal sequences, which had
been studied in analytic number theory since Borel defined them. This theorem
implies that a sequence (or a real number having this sequence as its base-b
expansion) is normal if and only if it has finite-state dimension 1. One of the
most powerful classical tools for investigating normal numbers is the Weyl
criterion, which characterizes normality in terms of exponential sums. Such
sums are well studied objects with many connections to other aspects of
analytic number theory, and this has made use of Weyl criterion especially
fruitful. This raises the question whether Weyl criterion can be generalized
from finite-state dimension 1 to arbitrary finite-state dimensions, thereby
making it a quantitative tool for studying data compression, prediction, etc.
  This paper does exactly this. We extend the Weyl criterion from a
characterization of sequences with finite-state dimension 1 to a criterion that
characterizes every finite-state dimension. This turns out not to be a routine
generalization of the original Weyl criterion. Even though exponential sums may
diverge for non-normal numbers, finite-state dimension can be characterized in
terms of the dimensions of the subsequence limits of the exponential sums. We
demonstrate the utility of our criterion though examples.

positivity and (ii) explain where in the covariate space positivity is lacking.
The latter could be used to either suggest the limitation of further causal
analysis and/or encourage experimentation where positivity is violated. The
contribution of this paper is first present the problem of automatic positivity
analysis and secondly to propose an algorithm based on a two steps process. The
first step, models the propensity condition on the covariates and then analyze
the latter distribution using multiple hypothesis testing to create positivity
violation labels. The second step uses asymmetrically pruned decision trees for

protostar. In multiple protostellar systems, it is not clear if the delivery
mechanism is preferential or evenly distributed among the components.
  Aims: Gas accretion flows within IRAS16293 is explored out to 6000 AU.
  Methods: ALMA Band 3 observations of low-$J$ transitions of HNC,
cyanopolyynes (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N), and N$_2$H$^+$ are used to probe the cloud
core structure at ~100 AU resolution. Additional Band 3 archival data provide
low-$J$ HCN and SiO lines. These data are compared with the corresponding
higher-$J$ lines from the PILS Band 7 data for excitation analysis. The HNC/HCN
ratio is used as a temperature tracer.
  Results: The low-$J$ transitions of HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, HNC and N$_2$H$^+$
trace extended and elongated structures from 6000 AU down to ~100 AU, without
accompanying dust continuum emission. Two structures are identified: one traces
a flow that is likely accreting toward the most luminous component of the
system IRAS16293 A. Temperatures inferred from the HCN/HNC ratio suggest that
the gas in this flow is cold, between 10 and 30 K. The other structure is part
of an UV-irradiated cavity wall entrained by one of the outflows. The two
outflows driven by IRAS16293 A present different molecular gas distributions.
  Conclusions: Accretion of cold gas is seen from 6000 AU scales onto IRAS16293
A, but not onto source B, indicates that cloud core material accretion is
competitive due to feedback onto a dominant component in an embedded multiple
protostellar system. The preferential delivery of material could explain the
higher luminosity and multiplicity of source A compared to source B. The
results of this work demonstrate that several different molecular species, and
multiple transitions of each species, are needed to confirm and characterize
accretion flows in protostellar cloud cores.

where the system can generate speech with the user's voice with rare enrolled

works: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. On the one hand, speaker
adaptation methods fine-tune a trained multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model
with few enrolled samples. However, they require at least thousands of
fine-tuning steps for high-quality adaptation, making it hard to apply on
devices. On the other hand, speaker encoding methods encode enrollment
utterances into a speaker embedding. The trained TTS model can synthesize the
user's speech conditioned on the corresponding speaker embedding. Nevertheless,
the speaker encoder suffers from the generalization gap between the seen and
unseen speakers.
  In this paper, we propose applying a meta-learning algorithm to the speaker
adaptation method. More specifically, we use Model Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) as the training algorithm of a multi-speaker TTS model, which aims to
find a great meta-initialization to adapt the model to any few-shot speaker
adaptation tasks quickly. Therefore, we can also adapt the meta-trained TTS
model to unseen speakers efficiently. Our experiments compare the proposed
method (Meta-TTS) with two baselines: a speaker adaptation method baseline and
a speaker encoding method baseline. The evaluation results show that Meta-TTS
can synthesize high speaker-similarity speech from few enrollment samples with
fewer adaptation steps than the speaker adaptation baseline and outperforms the
speaker encoding baseline under the same training scheme. When the speaker
encoder of the baseline is pre-trained with extra 8371 speakers of data,
Meta-TTS can still outperform the baseline on LibriTTS dataset and achieve
comparable results on VCTK dataset.

quantum systems, preserving quantum coherence by appropriately manipulating the
reservoir and system-reservoir interactions. In this context, for systems
comprised of different parts, it is common to describe the dynamics of a
subsystem of interest by making an adiabatic elimination of the remaining
components of the system. This procedure often leads to an effective master
equation for the subsystem that is not in the well-known
Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form (here called standard Lindblad
form). Instead, it has a more general structure (here called generalized
Lindblad form), which explicitly reveals the dissipative coupling between the
various components of the subsystem. Moreover, for systems weakly coupled to a
reservoir, the presence of counter-rotating terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian or the nonstationarity of the reservoir state guarantees that the
master equation describing the system of interest will be of the generalized
Lindblad form. In this work, we present a set of dynamical equations for the
first and second moments of the canonical variables for linear systems, bosonic
and fermionic, described by generalized Lindblad master equations. Our method
is efficient and allows one to obtain analytical solutions for the steady

related to the measurement of entanglement. Finally, we prove that the Duan
criterion for entanglement is also applicable to fermionic systems.

essentially transforms single-site dynamics with optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing
time to RNC algorithms for sampling. In particular we obtain RNC samplers, for

capabilities and actuation mechanisms. We propose a novel soft gripper that
looks like a granary with a compliant snap-through bistable mechanism
fabricated by integrated mold technology, achieving sensing and actuation
purely mechanically. In particular, the snap-through bistable structure in the
proposed gripper allows us to reduce the complexity of the mechanism, control,
sensing designs since the grasping and sensing behaviors are completely
passive. The grasping behaviors are automatically motivated once the trigger
position of the gripper touches an object and applies sufficient force. To
grasp objects with various profiles, the proposed granary soft gripper (GSG) is
designed to be capable of enveloping, pinching and caging grasps. The gripper
consists of a chamber palm, a palm cap and three fingers. First, the design of
the gripper is analyzed. Then, after the theoretical model is constructed,
finite element (FE) simulations are conducted to verify the built model.
Finally, a series of grasping experiments is carried out to assess the
snap-through behavior of the proposed gripper on grasping and sensing. The
experimental results illustrate that the proposed gripper can manipulate a
variety of soft and rigid objects and remain stable even though it undertakes
external disturbances.

are generalized binomial coefficients. Generalized Pascal matrices with
non-negative elements form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The paper
gives an idea of groups similar to the generalized Riordan groups, but
associated with matrices, which in the space of generalized Pascal matrices
correspond to the points at infinity; examples of such matrices are the matrix
of $q$-binomial coefficients for $q=-1$ and the Pascal triangle modulo $2$. An
analog of the Lagrange inversion theorem for these groups is given and the
corresponding examples are considered.

well defined by considering a joint unitary evolution of a system $S$ and a
thermal environment $E$. However, due to the diversity of the initial state and
Hamiltonian of the system and environment, it is hard to evaluate the
characterisation of entropy production. In the present work, we propose that
the evolution of $S$ and $E$ can be solved non-perturbatively in the framework
of Gaussian quantum mechanics (GQM). We study the entropy production and
correlation spreading in the interaction between Unruh-DeWitt-like particle
detector and thermal baths, where the particle detector is set to be a harmonic
oscillator and the thermal baths are made of interacting and noninteracting
Gaussian states. We can observe that the entropy production implies quantum
recurrence and shows periodicity. In the case of interacting bath, the
correlation propagates in a periodic system and leads to a revival of the
initial state. Our analysis can be extended to any other models in the
framework of GQM, and it may also shed some light on the AdS/CFT
correspondence.

followed either by arrest or by a sudden fluidisation. Various empirical laws
have been suggested for the creep exponent $\nu$ and fluidisation time $\tau_f$

profile looks like a step-harmonic potential as a consequence of the certain
analytical dependence of the effective mass from the position and
semiconfinement parameter $a$. Both states of the discrete and continuous
spectrum are studied. In the case of the discrete spectrum, wavefunctions of
the oscillator model are expressed through the Bessel polynomials. The discrete
energy spectrum is non-equidistant and finite as a consequence of its
dependence on parameter $a$, too. In the case of the continuous spectrum,
wavefunctions of the oscillator model are expressed through the $_1F_1$
hypergeometric functions. At the limit, when the parameter $a$ goes to
infinity, both wavefunctions, and the energy spectrum of the model under
construction correctly reduce to corresponding results of the usual
non-relativistic harmonic oscillator with a constant effective mass. Namely,
wavefunctions of the discrete spectrum recover wavefunctions in terms of the
Hermite polynomials, and wavefunctions of the continuous spectrum simply
vanish. We also present a new limit relation that reduces Bessel polynomials

bounds on the convergence time of the classical Glauber dynamics. This new
framework has yielded optimal $O(n \log n)$ sampling algorithms on
bounded-degree graphs for a large class of problems throughout the so-called
uniqueness regime, including, for example, the problems of sampling independent
sets, matchings, and Ising-model configurations.
  Our main contribution is to relax the bounded-degree assumption that has so
far been important in establishing and applying spectral independence. Previous
methods for avoiding degree bounds rely on using $L^p$-norms to analyse
contraction on graphs with bounded connective constant (Sinclair, Srivastava,
Yin; FOCS'13). The non-linearity of $L^p$-norms is an obstacle to applying
these results to bound spectral independence. Our solution is to capture the
$L^p$-analysis recursively by amortising over the subtrees of the recurrence
used to analyse contraction. Our method generalises previous analyses that
applied only to bounded-degree graphs.
  As a main application of our techniques, we consider the random graph
$G(n,d/n)$, where the previously known algorithms run in time $n^{O(\log d)}$
or applied only to large $d$. We refine these algorithmic bounds significantly,
and develop fast $n^{1+o(1)}$ algorithms based on Glauber dynamics that apply
to all $d$, throughout the uniqueness regime.

approaches to dimension reduction (DR) have gained significant attention.
High-performance DR algorithms are required to make data analysis feasible for
big and fast data sets. However, many traditional DR techniques are challenged
by truly large data sets. In particular multidimensional scaling (MDS) does not
scale well. MDS is a popular group of DR techniques because it can perform DR
on data where the only input is a dissimilarity function. However, common
approaches are at least quadratic in memory and computation and, hence,
prohibitive for large-scale data.
  We propose an out-of-sample embedding (OSE) solution to extend the MDS
algorithm for large-scale data utilising the embedding of only a subset of the
given data. We present two OSE techniques: the first based on an optimisation
approach and the second based on a neural network model. With a minor trade-off
in the approximation, the out-of-sample techniques can process large-scale data
with reasonable computation and memory requirements. While both methods perform
well, the neural network model outperforms the optimisation approach of the OSE
solution in terms of efficiency. OSE has the dual benefit that it allows fast
DR on streaming datasets as well as static databases.

few-shot learning, making it possible to obtain a classifier with a fair
performance using only a few training samples. Here we introduce the concept of
\emph{meta-worker}, a machine annotator trained by meta learning for types of
tasks (i.e., image classification) that are well-fit for AI. Unlike regular
crowd workers, meta-workers can be reliable, stable, and more importantly,
tireless and free. We first cluster unlabeled data and ask crowd workers to
repeatedly annotate the instances nearby the cluster centers; we then leverage
the annotated data and meta-training datasets to build a cluster of
meta-workers using different meta learning algorithms. Subsequently,
meta-workers are asked to annotate the remaining crowdsourced tasks. The
Jensen-Shannon divergence is used to measure the disagreement among the
annotations provided by the meta-workers, which determines whether or not crowd
workers should be invited for further annotation of the same task. Finally, we
model meta-workers' preferences and compute the consensus annotation by
weighted majority voting. Our empirical study confirms that, by combining
machine and human intelligence, we can accomplish a crowdsourcing project with
a lower budget than state-of-the-art task assignment methods, while achieving a

complexity of 4D LF data. To cope with such high-dimensional LF data, most of
the existing LFSR methods resorted to decomposing it into lower dimensions and
subsequently performing optimization on the decomposed sub-spaces. However,
these methods are inherently limited as they neglected the characteristics of
the decomposition operations and only utilized a limited set of LF sub-spaces
ending up failing to sufficiently extract spatio-angular features and leading
to a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we
comprehensively discover the potentials of LF decomposition and propose a novel
concept of decomposition kernels. In particular, we systematically unify the
decomposition operations of various sub-spaces into a series of such
decomposition kernels, which are incorporated into our proposed Decomposition
Kernel Network (DKNet) for comprehensive spatio-angular feature extraction. The
proposed DKNet is experimentally verified to achieve considerable improvements
compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To further improve DKNet in
producing more visually pleasing LFSR results, based on the VGG network, we
propose a LFVGG loss to guide the Texture-Enhanced DKNet (TE-DKNet) to generate
rich authentic textures and enhance LF images' visual quality significantly. We
also propose an indirect evaluation metric by taking advantage of LF material
recognition to objectively assess the perceptual enhancement brought by the
LFVGG loss.

many data mining and analysis projects requiring integrating and processing
massive data collections. It is becoming increasingly important in real-world
applications to develop ER solutions that produce prompt responses for entity
queries on large-scale databases. Some of these applications demand entity
query matching against large-scale reference databases within a short time. We
define this as the query matching problem in ER in this work. Indexing or
blocking techniques reduce the search space and execution time in the ER
process. However, approximate indexing techniques that scale to very
large-scale datasets remain open to research. In this paper, we investigate the
query matching problem in ER to propose an indexing method suitable for
approximate and efficient query matching.
  We first use spatial mappings to embed records in a multidimensional
Euclidean space that preserves the domain-specific similarity. Among the
various mapping techniques, we choose multidimensional scaling. Then using a
Kd-tree and the nearest neighbour search, the method returns a block of records
that includes potential matches for a query. Our method can process queries
against a large-scale dataset using only a fraction of the data $L$ (given the
dataset size is $N$), with a $O(L^2)$ complexity where $L \ll N$. The
experiments conducted on several datasets showed the effectiveness of the

pulsed field in different temporal modes into an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, in which the fiber lengths in two arms are different. The
results show that the mode mismatch of two interfering fields, reflected by the
visibility and pattern of interference, is not only dependent upon the amount
of unbalanced dispersion but also related to the order number of temporal mode.
In particular, the two interfering fields may become orthogonal under a modest
amount of unbalanced dispersion when the mode number of the fields is $k\geq2$.

Background (CMB) experiments since they are one of the main contaminants to the
recovery of CMB signal at small scales. Improving its multifrequency detection
would allow to take into account valuable information otherwise neglected when
extracting PS using a channel-by-channel approach. We develop a method based on
Neural Networks (NNs) to detect PS in multifrequency realistic simulations and
compare its performance against one of the most popular methods, the matrix
filters. The frequencies used are 143, 217 and 353 GHz and we impose a Galactic
cut of 30 degrees. We produce simulations by adding contaminating signals to
the PS maps as the CMB, the Cosmic Infrared Background, the Galactic thermal
emission, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the instrumental noise.
These simulations are used to train two NNs called Flat and Spectral
MultiPoSeIDoN. The first one considers PS with a flat spectrum and the second
one is more realistic because it takes into account the spectral behavior of
the PS. Using a detection limit of 60 mJy, Flat MultiPoSeIDoN reachs the 90% of
completeness level at 58 mJy and at 79, 71 and 60 for the spectral case at 143,
217 and 353 GHz respectively, while the matrix filters reach it at 84, 79 and
123 mJy. Using safer 4{\sigma} detection limit does not help to improve these
results. In all cases, MultiPoSeIDoN obtain a much lower number of spurious
sources than the filter. The NNs recover the flux density of the detections
with a relative error of 10% above 100 mJy, while the filter above 150 mJy.
Based on the results, NNs are the perfect candidates to substitute filters to
detect multifrequency PS in future CMB experiments. Moreover, we have shown
that a multifrequency approach can detect sources with higher accuracy than
single-frequency approaches also based on NNs.

labels of training and testing set are identical. However, the assumption is
often violated, causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this
issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones
using label attributes. However, the attributes are isolated from the features
of multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap, we introduce an approach
called LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing).
LAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec
model and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common
subspace. Next, it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix
to guide the feature extraction network of different modalities. At the same
time, LAEH uses the attribute similarity as the supplement of label similarity
to rectify the label embedding and common subspace. Experiments show that LAEH
outperforms related representative zero-shot and cross-modal hashing methods.

meta-learning based cross-modal hashing method (MetaCMH) to handle long-tailed

learns direct features from data in different modalities, and then introduces
an associative memory module to learn the memory features of samples of the
tail classes. It then combines the direct and memory features to obtain meta
features for each sample. For samples of the head classes of the long tail
distribution, the weight of the direct features is larger, because there are
enough training data to learn them well; while for rare classes, the weight of
the memory features is larger. Finally, MetaCMH uses a likelihood loss function
to preserve the similarity in different modalities and learns hash functions in
an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on long-tailed datasets show that MetaCMH
performs significantly better than state-of-the-art methods, especially on the

e^{-f(\theta)}$ constrained to a convex body $K$, the problem of outputting
samples from a distribution $\nu$ which is $\varepsilon$-close in
infinity-distance $\sup_{\theta \in K} |\log \frac{\nu(\theta)}{\pi(\theta)}|$
to $\pi$ arises in differentially private optimization. While sampling within
total-variation distance $\varepsilon$ of $\pi$ can be done by algorithms whose
runtime depends polylogarithmically on $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, prior
algorithms for sampling in $\varepsilon$ infinity distance have runtime bounds
that depend polynomially on $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$. We bridge this gap by
presenting an algorithm that outputs a point $\varepsilon$-close to $\pi$ in
infinity distance that requires at most $\mathrm{poly}(\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, d)$ calls to a membership oracle for $K$ and evaluation
oracle for $f$, when $f$ is Lipschitz. Our approach departs from prior works
that construct Markov chains on a $\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}$-discretization of
$K$ to achieve a sample with $\varepsilon$ infinity-distance error, and present
a method to directly convert continuous samples from $K$ with total-variation
bounds to samples with infinity bounds. This approach also allows us to obtain
an improvement on the dimension $d$ in the running time for the problem of
sampling from a log-concave distribution on polytopes $K$ with infinity
distance $\varepsilon$, by plugging in TV-distance running time bounds for the
Dikin Walk Markov chain.

glioma, could significantly benefit by accessing the spatial distribution of
tumor cell concentration. Existing diagnostic modalities, e.g. magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), contrast sufficiently well areas of high cell density.
In gliomas, however, they do not portray areas of low cell concentration, which
can often serve as a source for the secondary appearance of the tumor after
treatment. To estimate tumor cell densities beyond the visible boundaries of
the lesion, numerical simulations of tumor growth could complement imaging
information by providing estimates of full spatial distributions of tumor
cells. Over recent years a corpus of literature on medical image-based tumor
modeling was published. It includes different mathematical formalisms
describing the forward tumor growth model. Alongside, various parametric
inference schemes were developed to perform an efficient tumor model
personalization, i.e. solving the inverse problem. However, the unifying
drawback of all existing approaches is the time complexity of the model
personalization which prohibits a potential integration of the modeling into
clinical settings. In this work, we introduce a deep learning based methodology
for inferring the patient-specific spatial distribution of brain tumors from
T1Gd and FLAIR MRI medical scans. Coined as Learn-Morph-Infer the method
achieves real-time performance in the order of minutes on widely available
hardware and the compute time is stable across tumor models of different
complexity, such as reaction-diffusion and reaction-advection-diffusion models.
We believe the proposed inverse solution approach not only bridges the way for
clinical translation of brain tumor personalization but can also be adopted to
other scientific and engineering domains.

continuation. However, this prompt-based conditioning cannot guarantee that the
conditioning sequence would develop or even simply repeat itself in the
generated continuation. In this paper, we propose an alternative conditioning
approach, called theme-based conditioning, that explicitly trains the
Transformer to treat the conditioning sequence as a thematic material that has
to manifest itself multiple times in its generation result. This is achieved
with two main technical contributions. First, we propose a deep learning-based
approach that uses contrastive representation learning and clustering to
automatically retrieve thematic materials from music pieces in the training
data. Second, we propose a novel gated parallel attention module to be used in
a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder/decoder architecture to more
effectively account for a given conditioning thematic material in the

subjective evaluations of variants of the proposed Theme Transformer and the
conventional prompt-based baseline, showing that our best model can generate,

increase this value in the successive iteration. Thus, each iteration refines a
graph that was recovered by previous iterations having smaller conditioning
sets -- a higher statistical power -- which contributes to stability. We
demonstrate empirically that ICD requires significantly fewer CI tests and
learns more accurate causal graphs compared to FCI, FCI+, and RFCI algorithms

we tune a depth prediction CNN with the help of a visual SLAM algorithm even if

algorithm that uses the online adapted depth to improve map quality. Once the
potential noisy map points are removed, we perform global photometric bundle
adjustment (BA) to improve the overall SLAM performance. Experimental results
on both benchmark datasets and a real robot in our own experimental
environments show that our proposed method improves the overall SLAM accuracy.

droplets are modelled as heavy particles which grow in size, the ambient flow
is modelled as a two-dimensional Taylor-Green (TG) flow consisting of an array
of vortices delineated by separatrices, and thermal noise are modelled as
uncorrelated Gaussian white noise. In general, heavy inertial particles are
centrifuged out of regions of high vorticity and into regions of high strain.
In cellular flows, we find, in agreement with earlier results, that droplets
with Stokes numbers smaller than a critical value, $St < St_{\rm{cr}}$, remain
trapped in the vortices in which they are initialised, while larger droplets
move ballistically away from their initial positions by crossing separatrices.
We independently vary the P\'eclet number $Pe$ characterising the amplitude of
thermal noise and the condensation rate $\Pi$ to study their effects on the
critical Stokes number for droplet trapping, as well as on the final states of
motion of the droplets. We find that the imposition of thermal noise, or of a
finite condensation rate, allows droplets of $St < St_{\rm{cr}}$ to leave their
initial vortices. We find that the effects of thermal noise become negligible
for growing droplets, and that growing droplets achieve ballistic motion when
their Stokes numbers become $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We also find an intermediate
regime prior to attaining the ballistic state, in which droplets move
diffusively away from their initial vortices in the presence of thermal noise.

generates molecular graphs jointly with 3D pose in a discretised molecular

scientific community. Following this interest, in this article, we explore the
relations that exist between the non-Markovian SEIS
(Susceptible--Exposed--Infectious--Susceptible) and the classical Markov SIS,
as basic re-occurring virus spreading models in complex networks. We
investigate the similarities and seek for equivalences both for the
discrete-time and the continuous-time forms. First, we formally introduce the
continuous-time non-Markovian SEIS model, and derive the epidemic threshold in
a strict mathematical procedure. Then we present the main result of the paper
that, providing certain relations between process parameters hold, the
stationary-state solutions of the status probabilities in the non-Markovian
SEIS may be found from the stationary state probabilities of the Markov SIS
model. This result has a two-fold significance. First, it simplifies the
computational complexity of the non-Markovian model in practical applications,
where only the stationary distribution of the state probabilities is required.
Next, it defines the epidemic threshold of the non-Markovian SEIS model,
without the necessity of a thrall mathematical analysis. We present this result
both in analytical form, and confirm the result trough numerical simulations.
Furthermore, as of secondary importance, in an analytical procedure we show
that each Markov SIS may be represented as non-Markovian SEIS model.

calculate the configuration entropy (CE) of various magnitudes of an inverse

efficiency. FinRL-Podracer is a cloud solution that features high performance
and high scalability and promises continuous training, continuous integration,
and continuous delivery of DRL-driven trading strategies, facilitating a rapid

a DRL algorithm onto a GPU cloud via multi-level mapping. Then, we carry out
the training of DRL components with high-performance optimizations on GPUs.

dependency between pairwise and multi-way links in inferring potential
unobserved hyperlinks. The major advantage of the proposed embedding procedure
is that it incorporates both the pairwise relationships and subgroup-wise

proposed method introduces a hierarchical dependency among links to infer
potential hyperlinks, and leads to better link prediction. In theory we
establish the estimation consistency for the proposed embedding approach, and

Subcommittee. We also invited students and teachers of high and elementary
schools from Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia. They attended the school and
participated in AIoT workshop, gaining experience in applications of AIoT-FML
learning tools. According to the short report and feedback from the involved
students and teachers, we find out that most participants have quickly
understood the principles of CI, FL, NN, and EC. In addition, one of the
teachers sent the following remark to the organizers: ""This is a great event to
introduce students to computational intelligence at a young age, stimulate them
to be involved in rapidly evolving fields, and foster participation in future
research adventures.""
