$z\to\infty$ to the degenerate Beltrami equations

for existence and representation of regular discrete open solutions for the
Dirichlet problem with continuous data to degenerate Beltrami equations in
arbitrary simply connected bounded domains $D$ in $\mathbb C$.
  Moreover, we obtain similar criteria for the existence of multi-valued
solutions $f$ in the spirit of the theory of multi-valued analytic functions in
arbitrary bounded domains $D$ in $\mathbb C$ with no boundary component

that the real parts $u$ of such solutions $f$ are the so-called $A-$harmonic

approach that leverages domain-specific knowledge of classification tasks to
boost the model's performance. The rationale behind our approach is that some
existing prior medical knowledge can be incorporated into data-driven deep
learning to facilitate model learning. We design a deep learning-based
one-class classification pipeline for imbalanced image classification, and
demonstrate in three use cases how we take advantage of medical knowledge of
each specific classification task by generating additional middle classes to
achieve higher classification performances. We evaluate our approach on three
different clinical image classification tasks (a total of 8459 images) and show
superior model performance when compared to six state-of-the-art methods. All

collaboration by limiting individual liberty, always give rise to controversies
over governance legitimacy. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods
are appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that
supply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies,
the inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which
has become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing
a global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies
have been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an
analytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this
paper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an
example to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby
legitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental
results in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to
demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual
liberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies
are learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which
change in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the
losses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the
overall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels
yield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus
provides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional
collaboration. Therefore, our method shows the capability of MARL in
computationally modeling and supporting the theory of calculus of consent,

representation also allows us to compress scale-wise MP-POVs by exploiting
cross-scale and same-scale correlations extensively and flexibly. The overall
compression efficiency highly depends on the accuracy of estimated occupancy

problem of recovering a high-resolution (HR) facial image from its
corresponding low-resolution (LR) counterpart, a task commonly referred to as
face hallucination. Despite the impressive performance achieved by
position-patch and deep learning-based methods, most of these techniques are
still unable to recover identity-specific features of faces. The former group
of algorithms often produces blurry and oversmoothed outputs particularly in
the presence of higher levels of degradation, whereas the latter generates
faces which sometimes by no means resemble the individuals in the input images.
In this paper, a novel face super-resolution approach will be introduced, in
which the hallucinated face is forced to lie in a subspace spanned by the
available training faces. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of existing
face hallucination techniques and thanks to this face subspace prior, the
reconstruction is performed in favor of recovering person-specific facial
features, rather than merely increasing image quantitative scores. Furthermore,
inspired by recent advances in the area of 3D face reconstruction, an efficient
3D dictionary alignment scheme is also presented, through which the algorithm
becomes capable of dealing with low-resolution faces taken in uncontrolled
conditions. In extensive experiments carried out on several well-known face
datasets, the proposed algorithm shows remarkable performance by generating
detailed and close to ground truth results which outperform the
state-of-the-art face hallucination algorithms by significant margins both in
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

circumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization
(staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based
fracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are
convex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number
of iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust
monolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver
adopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive
under-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to
overcome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the
loading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the
solver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix.
The efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive
mesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of
isogeometric analysis. The numerical examples presented in the manuscript
demonstrates the efficacy of the solver. All the codes and data-sets

of measured radii is $\sim 5-7$ kpc. For continuing star formation, we find
that the metallicity distribution of second generation stars is similar to that

the persistent tendency of phase space trajectories representing the

degeneration of the generalization ability of GNNs on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)

developed based on the I.I.D hypothesis. In such a setting, GNNs tend to
exploit subtle statistical correlations existing in the training set for

stable GNNs. To this end, we propose a general causal representation framework,

to help the model get rid of spurious correlations. Particularly, we exploit a
graph pooling layer to extract subgraph-based representations as high-level

makes the following question interesting: How does ViT perform when individual
input image patches are perturbed with natural corruptions or adversarial
perturbations, compared to CNNs? In this work, we study the robustness of ViT
to patch-wise perturbations. Surprisingly, we find that ViTs are more robust to
naturally corrupted patches than CNNs, whereas they are more vulnerable to
adversarial patches. Furthermore, we discover that the attention mechanism
greatly affects the robustness of vision transformers. Specifically, the
attention module can help improve the robustness of ViT by effectively ignoring
natural corrupted patches. However, when ViTs are attacked by an adversary, the
attention mechanism can be easily fooled to focus more on the adversarially
perturbed patches and cause a mistake. Based on our analysis, we propose a

is assumed that only the vehicle position and orientation can be measured,
being the former affected by bounded noises. Then, under some fair standard
assumptions concerning the maximum velocities and acceleration rates of the
vehicle, the estimator is able to reconstruct not only the velocities, but also
the lumped generalised disturbances, that cluster external disturbances,
non-linearities, and unmodelled dynamics. The observer is easily tunable by the
user, with a set of four scalars, two of them related to the velocity of
convergence of the estimator, and the other two parameters to set the desired
trade-off between noise sensitivity and disturbance rejection. Several
simulations with a well-known test-bed craft are provided to show how the

endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence steroid-mediated physiology in humans

disrupting diverse responses involved in reproduction, development and
differentiation. Here I discuss that due to evolution of the progesterone
receptor (PR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) after ray-finned fish and
terrestrial vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor, each receptor evolved
to respond to different steroids in ray-finned fish and terrestrial
vertebrates. In elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish, ancestral to ray-finned
fish and terrestrial vertebrates, both progesterone and
17,20dihydroxyprogesterone activate the PR. During the evolution of ray-finned
fish and terrestrial vertebrates, the PR in terrestrial vertebrates continued
responding to progesterone and evolved to weakly respond to
17,20dihydroxyprogesterone. In contrast, the physiological progestin for the PR
in zebrafish and other ray-finned fish is 17,20dihydroxyprogesterone, and
ray-finned fish PR responds weakly to progesterone. The MR in fish and
terrestrial vertebrates also diverged to have different responses to
progesterone.

New techniques are devised in order to derive the colour structure stemming
from three-Reggeon exchange diagrams in terms of commutators of channel

scattered particles in any colour representation. We also elucidate the
separation between contributions to the Regge cut and Regge pole in the real

to multiple-Reggeon exchange diagrams can be factorised as a Regge pole along
with the single-Reggeon exchange, and when this is done, the singular part of
the gluon Regge trajectory is directly determined by the cusp anomalous
dimension. We explicitly compute the Regge cut component of the amplitude

perspective, the new results provide important information on soft
singularities in general kinematics beyond the planar limit: by comparing the

Training is resource-intensive, consuming significant compute, memory, and

footprint without impacting quality, but their focus on a subset of the
bottlenecks (typically only the network) limits their ability to improve
overall cluster utilization. In this work, we exploit the unique
characteristics of deep learning workloads to propose Structured Partial
Backpropagation(SPB), a technique that systematically controls the amount of
backpropagation at individual workers in distributed training. This
simultaneously reduces network bandwidth, compute utilization, and memory
footprint while preserving model quality. To efficiently leverage the benefits
of SPB at cluster level, we introduce JigSaw, a SPB aware scheduler, which does
scheduling at the iteration level for Deep Learning Training(DLT) jobs. We find
that JigSaw can improve large scale cluster efficiency by as high as 28\%.

configurations of the magnetic field inside these stars, we have performed
3D-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of initially random
magnetic fields in stably stratified and barotropic stars with an ideal-gas
equation of state using the {\sc Pencil Code}, a high-order finite-difference
code for compressible hydrodynamic flows in the presence of magnetic fields. In
barotropic (isentropic) stars, we confirm previous results in the sense that
all initial magnetic fields we tried decay away, unable to reach a stable
equilibrium. In the case of stably stratified stars (with radially increasing
specific entropy), initially random magnetic fields appear to always evolve to
a stable equilibrium. However, the nature of this equilibrium depends on the
dissipation mechanisms considered. If magnetic diffusivity (or
hyperdiffusivity) is included, the final state is more axially symmetric and
dominated by large wavelengths than the initial state, whereas this is not the
case if only viscosity (or hyperviscosity) is present. In real stars, the main
mechanism allowing them to relax to an equilibrium is likely to be phase
mixing, which we argue is more closely mimicked by viscosity. Therefore, we
conclude that, depending on its formation mechanism, the equilibrium magnetic
field in these stars could in principle be very asymmetric.

shows that individuals often do not lie even when lying maximizes their
utility. In this work, we attempt to incorporate these findings into the theory
of mechanism design. We consider players that have a preference for
truth-telling and will only lie if their benefit from lying is sufficiently
larger than the loss of the others. To accommodate such players, we introduce
$\alpha$-moral mechanisms, in which the gain of a player from misreporting his
true value, comparing to truth-telling, is at most $\alpha$ times the loss that
the others incur due to misreporting.
  We develop a theory of moral mechanisms in the canonical setting of
single-item auctions. We identify similarities and disparities to the standard
theory of truthful mechanisms. In particular, we show that the allocation
function does not uniquely determine the payments and is unlikely to admit a
simple characterization. In contrast, recall that monotonicity characterizes
the allocation function of truthful mechanisms.
  Our main technical effort is invested in determining whether the auctioneer
can exploit the preference for truth-telling of the players to extract more
revenue comparing to truthful mechanisms. We show that the auctioneer can
extract more revenue when the values of the players are correlated, even when
there are only two players. However, we show that truthful mechanisms are
revenue-maximizing even among moral ones when the values of the players are
independently drawn from certain identical distributions. As a by product we
get an alternative proof to Myerson's characterization in the settings that we
consider. We flesh out this approach by providing an alternative proof to
Myerson's characterization that does not involve moral mechanisms whenever the
values are independently drawn from regular distributions.

highest-degree homogeneous parts of Grothendieck polynomials, which we call
Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials. In addition to the regularity formula, we
obtain formulas for the degrees of all Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials and for
their leading terms, as well as a complete description of when two
Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials agree up to scalar multiple. The degree of the
Grothendieck polynomial is a new permutation statistic which we call the
Rajchgot index; we develop the properties of Rajchgot index and relate it to
major index and to weak order.

is the high-resolution estimation of multipath channel delays. The resolution
of traditional delay estimation algorithms is inversely proportional to the
bandwidth of the training signals used for channel probing. Considering that
typical training signals have limited bandwidth, delay estimation using these
algorithms often leads to poor localization performance. To mitigate these
constraints, we exploit the multiband and carrier frequency switching
capabilities of wireless transceivers and propose to acquire channel state
information (CSI) in multiple bands spread over a large frequency aperture. The
data model of the acquired measurements has a multiple shift-invariance
structure, and we use this property to develop a high-resolution delay
estimation algorithm. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for the data model
and perform numerical simulations of the algorithm using system parameters of
the emerging IEEE 802.11be standard. Simulations show that the algorithm is
asymptotically efficient and converges to the CRB. To validate modeling
assumptions, we test the algorithm using channel measurements acquired in real
indoor scenarios. From these results, it is seen that delays (ranges) estimated
from multiband CSI with a total bandwidth of 320 MHz show an average RMSE of
less than 0.3 ns (10 cm) in 90% of the cases.

NGC 1851 is one of several globular clusters for which multiple
stellar populations of the subgiant branch have been clearly identified and a
difference in metallicity detected. A crucial piece of information on the
formation history of this cluster can be provided by the sum of A(C+N+O)
abundances. However, these values have lacked a general consensus thus far. The
separation of the subgiant branch can be based on age and/or A(C+N+O) abundance
differences. Aims. Our main aim was to determine carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
abundances for evolved giants in the globular cluster NGC1851 in order to check
whether or not the double populations of stars are coeval. Methods.
High-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO
VLT telescope, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method.
Results. We provide abundances of up to 29 chemical elements for a sample of 45
giants in NGC 1851. The investigated stars can be separated into two
populations with a difference of 0.07 dex in the mean metallicity, 0.3 dex in
the mean C/N, and 0.35 dex in the mean s-process dominated element-to-iron
abundance ratios [s/Fe]. No significant difference was determined in the mean
values of A(C+N+O) as well as in abundance to iron ratios of carbon, alpha- and
iron-peak-elements, and of europium. Conclusions. As the averaged A(C+N+O)
values between the two populations do not differ, additional evidence is given
that NGC 1851 is composed of two clusters, the metal-rich cluster being by
about 0.6 Gyr older than the metal-poor one. A global overview of NGC 1851
properties and the detailed abundances of chemical elements favour its
formation in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that was accreted by the Milky Way.

zero-shot learning approach is used with RWFN that can exploit similarities

the dispersity of nanoparticle size more strongly influences the optical
properties of supraballs than packing fraction, as evidenced by production of a
larger range of colors when size dispersity is varied versus packing fraction.

Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm inspired by infection dynamics to
connect all the deployed APs to the existing BNs economically. To support the

which further improves the network performance in terms of average hop count,
traffic distribution, and backhaul length. Finally, we use real datasets from a

compressive viscosity is enhanced in hot (T>6 MK) flaring coronal loops. We
model the excitation and dissipation of slow magnetosonic waves in hot coronal

(compared to background corona) guided by EUV observations using 3D MHD
visco-resistive model. The effects of compressive viscosity tensor component
along the magnetic field are included with classical and enhanced viscosity

are excited by a velocity pulse at the footpoint of the loop at coronal lower

analysis. However, most of the existing graph neural networks (GNNs) heavily
rely on labeling information, which is normally expensive to obtain in the real
world. Although some existing works aim to effectively learn graph
representations in an unsupervised manner, they suffer from certain
limitations, such as the heavy reliance on monotone contrastiveness and limited
scalability. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we introduce a novel
self-supervised graph representation learning algorithm via Graph Contrastive
Adjusted Zooming, namely G-Zoom, to learn node representations by leveraging
the proposed adjusted zooming scheme. Specifically, this mechanism enables
G-Zoom to explore and extract self-supervision signals from a graph from
multiple scales: micro (i.e., node-level), meso (i.e., neighborhood-level), and
macro (i.e., subgraph-level). Firstly, we generate two augmented views of the
input graph via two different graph augmentations. Then, we establish three
different contrastiveness on the above three scales progressively, from node,
neighboring, to subgraph level, where we maximize the agreement between graph
representations across scales. While we can extract valuable clues from a given
graph on the micro and macro perspectives, the neighboring-level
contrastiveness offers G-Zoom the capability of a customizable option based on
our adjusted zooming scheme to manually choose an optimal viewpoint that lies
between the micro and macro perspectives to better understand the graph data.
Additionally, to make our model scalable to large graphs, we employ a parallel
graph diffusion approach to decouple model training from the graph size. We
have conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods

usually done through the well known procedure of canonical quantization.
However, on non-Cartesian domains, or on bounded Cartesian domains, this
procedure can be plagued with theoretical inconsistencies. An alternative
approach is {\it affine quantization} (AQ) Fantoni and Klauder
(arXiv:2109.13447,Phys. Rev. D {\bf 103}, 076013 (2021)), resulting in
different conjugate variables that lead to a more consistent quantization
formalism. To highlight these issues, we examine a deceptively simple, but
important, problem: that of the harmonic oscillator potential on the
semibounded domain: ${\cal D} = (-b,\infty)$. The AQ version of this
corresponds to the (rescaled) system, ${\cal H} = \frac{1}{2}\Big(-\partial_x^2
+ \frac{3}{4(x+b)^2} + x^2\Big)$. We solve this system numerically for $b > 0$.
The case $b = 0$ corresponds to an {\it exactly solvable} potential, for which
the eigenenergies can be determined exactly (through non-wavefunction dependent
methods), confirming the results of Gouba ( arXiv:2005.08696 ,J. High Energy
Phys., Gravitation Cosmol. {\bf 7}, 352-365 (2021)). We investigate the limit
$b \rightarrow \infty$, confirming that the full harmonic oscillator problem is
recovered. The adopted computational methods are in keeping with the underlying
theoretical framework of AQ. Specifically, one method is an affine map
invariant variational procedure, made possible through a moment problem
quantization reformulation. The other method focuses on boundedness (i.e.
$L^2$) as an explicit quantization criteria. Both methods lead to converging
bounds to the discrete state energies; and thus confirming the accuracy of our
results, particularly as applied to a singular potential problem.

partial scans can be challenging. The aim of this work is to learn to complete
these partial point clouds, giving us a full understanding of the object's

the help of complete, ground-truth annotations of the target objects, which are
available only for simulated datasets. However, such ground truth is
unavailable for real-world LiDAR data. In this work, we present a
self-supervised point cloud completion algorithm, PointPnCNet, which is trained
only on partial scans without assuming access to complete, ground-truth

the input data and train the network to complete the missing region. As it is
difficult to determine which regions were occluded in the initial cloud and
which were synthetically removed, our network learns to complete the full
cloud, including the missing regions in the initial partial cloud. We show that
our method outperforms previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods on
both the synthetic dataset, ShapeNet, and real-world LiDAR dataset, Semantic

wide variety of mean holding cost metrics in the M/G/1 queue. Perhaps most
famously, Gittins minimizes mean response time in the M/G/1 when jobs' service
times are unknown to the scheduler. Gittins also minimizes weighted versions of
mean response time. For example, the well-known ""$c\mu$ rule"", which minimizes
class-weighted mean response time in the multiclass M/M/1, is a special case of
Gittins.
  However, despite the extensive literature on Gittins in the M/G/1, it
contains no fully general proof of Gittins's optimality. This is because
Gittins was originally developed for the multi-armed bandit problem.
Translating arguments from the multi-armed bandit to the M/G/1 is technically
demanding, so it has only been done rigorously in some special cases. The
extent of Gittins's optimality in the M/G/1 is thus not entirely clear.
  In this work we provide the first fully general proof of Gittins's optimality
in the M/G/1. The optimality result we obtain is even more general than was
previously known. For example, we show that Gittins minimizes mean slowdown in
the M/G/1 with unknown or partially known service times, and we show that
Gittins's optimality holds under batch arrivals. Our proof uses a novel
approach that works directly with the M/G/1, avoiding the difficulties of
translating from the multi-armed bandit problem.

of consecutive Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) magnetogram images to produce a flaring probability. The
probability of flaring is added to a feature vector derived from the
magnetograms to train an extremely randomized trees (ERT) model in the second
stage to produce a binary deterministic prediction (flare/no flare) in a
12-hour forecast window. To tune the hyperparameters of the architecture a new
evaluation metric is introduced, the ""scaled True Skill Statistic"". It
specifically addresses the large discrepancy between the true positive rate and
the false positive rate in the highly unbalanced solar flare event training
datasets. Through hyperparameter tuning to maximize this new metric, our
two-stage architecture drastically reduces false positives by $\approx$ $48\%$
without significantly affecting the true positives (reduction by $\approx$
$12\%$), when compared with predictions from the first stage CNN alone. This,
in turn, improves various traditional binary classification metrics sensitive

end result is a more robust 12-hour flare prediction system that could be

loss of efficiency and reliability. We first present the direct FIFO mechanism,
which offers lower-earning trips to drivers further down the queue. The option
to skip the rest of the line incentivizes drivers to accept all dispatches, but
the mechanism would be considered unfair since drivers closer to the head of

distribution $\rho^*$ by minimizing the kernel discrepancy, also known as the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). By employing the general \emph{energetic
variational inference} framework (Wang et al., 2021), we convert the problem of
minimizing MMD to solving a dynamic ODE system of the particles. We adopt the
implicit Euler numerical scheme to solve the ODE systems. This leads to a
proximal minimization problem in each iteration of updating the particles,
which can be solved by optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS. The proposed
method is named EVI-MMD. To overcome the long-existing issue of bandwidth
selection of the Gaussian kernel, we propose a novel way to specify the
bandwidth dynamically. Through comprehensive numerical studies, we have shown
the proposed adaptive bandwidth significantly improves the EVI-MMD. We use the
EVI-MMD algorithm to solve two types of sampling problems. In the first type,
the target distribution is given by a fully specified density function. The
second type is a ""two-sample problem"", where only training data are available.
The EVI-MMD method is used as a generative learning model to generate new
samples that follow the same distribution as the training data. With the
recommended settings of the tuning parameters, we show that the proposed
EVI-MMD method outperforms some existing methods for both types of problems.

Probability-estimation models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g. whether it

ground-truth probabilities of the events of interest are typically unknown. The
problem is therefore analogous to binary classification, with the difference
that the objective is to estimate probabilities rather than predicting the
specific outcome. This work investigates probability estimation from
high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. There exist several methods
to improve the probabilities generated by these models but they mostly focus on
model (epistemic) uncertainty. For problems with inherent uncertainty, it is
challenging to evaluate performance without access to ground-truth
probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to study and
compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the
synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks, all

of the phenomena evinced in our experiments. Finally, we propose a new method

  Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac399d",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Two forms of ohmic heating of astrophysical secondaries have received
particular attention: unipolar-generator heating with currents running between
the primary and secondary; and magnetic induction heating due to the primary's
time-varying field. Neither appears to cause significant dissipation in the
contemporary solar system. But these discussions have overlooked heating
derived from the spatial variation of the primary's field across the interior
of the secondary. This leads to Lorentz force-driven currents around paths
entirely internal to the secondary, with resulting ohmic heating. We examine
three ways to drive such currents, by the cross product of: (1) the secondary's
azimuthal orbital velocity with the non-axially symmetric field of the primary;
(2) the radial velocity (due to non-zero eccentricity) of the secondary with
the primary's field; or (3) the out-of-plane velocity (due to non-zero
inclination) with the primary's field. The first of these operates even for a
spin-locked secondary whose orbit has zero eccentricity, in strong contrast to
tidal dissipation. We show that Jupiter's moon Io today could dissipate about
600 GW (more than likely current radiogenic heating) in the outer hundred
meters of its metallic core by this mechanism. Had Io ever been at 3 jovian
radii instead of its current 5.9, it could have been dissipating 15,000 GW.
Ohmic dissipation provides a mechanism that could operate in any solar system
to drive inward migration of secondaries that then necessarily comes to a halt
upon reaching a sufficiently close distance to the primary.

generating a binary mask for referent described in given language expressions.
Prior arts adopt a bimodal solution, taking images and languages as two
modalities within an encoder-fusion-decoder pipeline. However, this pipeline is
sub-optimal for the target task for two reasons. First, they only fuse
high-level features produced by uni-modal encoders separately, which hinders
sufficient cross-modal learning. Second, the uni-modal encoders are pre-trained
independently, which brings inconsistency between pre-trained uni-modal tasks
and the target multi-modal task. Besides, this pipeline often ignores or makes
little use of intuitively beneficial instance-level features. To relieve these

uni-modal feature extractors and their fusion model into a deep modality
interaction encoder, facilitating sufficient feature interaction across
different modalities. Meanwhile, MaIL directly avoids the second limitation

embeddings"", are becoming a basic building block for more and more natural
language processing algorithms. There are different ways and tools for
constructing word embeddings. Most of the approaches rely on raw texts, the
construction items being the word occurrences and/or letter n-grams. More
elaborated research is using additional linguistic features extracted after
text preprocessing. Morphology is clearly served by vector representations
constructed from raw texts and letter n-grams. Syntax and semantics studies may
profit more from the vector representations constructed with additional
features such as lemma, part-of-speech, syntactic or semantic dependants
associated with each word. One of the key objectives of the ReTeRom project is
the development of advanced technologies for Romanian natural language
processing, including morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of text.
As such, we plan to develop an open-access large library of ready-to-use word
embeddings sets, each set being characterized by different parameters: used
features (wordforms, letter n-grams, lemmas, POSes etc.), vector lengths,
window/context size and frequency thresholds. To this end, the previously
created sets of word embeddings (based on word occurrences) on the CoRoLa
corpus (P\u{a}i\c{s} and Tufi\c{s}, 2018) are and will be further augmented
with new representations learned from the same corpus by using specific
features such as lemmas and parts of speech. Furthermore, in order to better
understand and explore the vectors, graphical representations will be available
by customized interfaces.

  of functionally graded material","40 pages, 28 figures",,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Differential equations are indispensable to engineering and hence to
innovation. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have
emerged as a novel method for solving differential equations. PINN method has
the advantage of being meshless, scalable, and can potentially be intelligent
in terms of transferring the knowledge learned from solving one differential
equation to the other. The exploration in this field has majorly been limited
to solving linear-elasticity problems, crack propagation problems. This study
uses PINNs to solve coupled thermo-mechanics problems of materials with
functionally graded properties. An in-depth analysis of the PINN framework has
been carried out by understanding the training datasets, model architecture,
and loss functions. The efficacy of the PINN models in solving thermo-mechanics
differential equations has been measured by comparing the obtained solutions
either with analytical solutions or finite element method-based solutions.
While R2 score of more than 99% has been achieved in predicting primary
variables such as displacement and temperature fields, achieving the same for
secondary variables such as stress turns out to be more challenging. This study
is the first to implement the PINN framework for solving coupled
thermo-mechanics problems on composite materials. This study is expected to
enhance the understanding of the novel PINN framework and will be seminal for
further research on PINNs.

  Adversarial Transferability","11 pages, 6 figures, accepted by CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The black-box adversarial attack has attracted impressive attention for its
practical use in the field of deep learning security. Meanwhile, it is very
challenging as there is no access to the network architecture or internal
weights of the target model. Based on the hypothesis that if an example remains
adversarial for multiple models, then it is more likely to transfer the attack
capability to other models, the ensemble-based adversarial attack methods are
efficient and widely used for black-box attacks. However, ways of ensemble
attack are rather less investigated, and existing ensemble attacks simply fuse
the outputs of all the models evenly. In this work, we treat the iterative
ensemble attack as a stochastic gradient descent optimization process, in which
the variance of the gradients on different models may lead to poor local
optima. To this end, we propose a novel attack method called the stochastic
variance reduced ensemble (SVRE) attack, which could reduce the gradient
variance of the ensemble models and take full advantage of the ensemble attack.
Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the
proposed method could boost the adversarial transferability and outperforms
existing ensemble attacks significantly. Code is available at

different users with privacy protection. The server in a federated learning
(FL) environment can fulfill any linear computation on private inputs of users
through the secure linear aggregation. At present, based on pseudo-random
number generator and one-time padding technique, one can efficiently compute
the sum of user inputs in FL, but linear calculations of user inputs are not
well supported. Based on decentralized threshold additive homomorphic
encryption (DTAHE) schemes, this paper provides a secure linear aggregation
protocol, which allows the server to multiply the user inputs by any
coefficients and to sum them together, so that the server can build a full
connected layer or a convolution layer on top of user inputs. The protocol
adopts the framework of Bonawitz et al. to provide fault tolerance for user
dropping out, and exploits a blockchain smart contract to encourage the server
honest. The paper gives a security model, security proofs and a concrete
lattice based DTAHE scheme for the protocol. It evaluates the communication and
computation costs of known DTAHE construction methods. The evaluation shows
that an elliptic curve based DTAHE is friendly to users and the lattice based
version leads to a light computation on the server.

steeply declines over just one epoch in the training stage. Prior work has
attributed this loss in robustness to a sharp decrease in $\textit{local
linearity}$ of the neural network with respect to the input space, and has
demonstrated that introducing a local linearity measure as a regularization
term prevents catastrophic overfitting. Using a simple neural network
architecture, we experimentally demonstrate that maintaining high local
linearity might be $\textit{sufficient}$ to prevent catastrophic overfitting
but is not $\textit{necessary.}$ Further, inspired by Parseval networks, we
introduce a regularization term to AT with FGSM to make the weight matrices of

us to constrain its training and testing distributions along task-relevant

example in TraVLR redundantly encodes the scene in two modalities, allowing
either to be dropped or added during training or testing without losing

modality, they all fail at cross-modal transfer and have limited success
accommodating the addition or deletion of one modality. We release TraVLR as an
open challenge for the research community.

quantized number of modalities that are accessible to a quantum system, and the
continuum of contexts that are required to define these modalities. The strong

state-of-the-art performance in the past few years, even when wearing
protective medical face masks became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the outstanding performance of these models, the machine learning
research community has shown increasing interest in challenging their
robustness. Initially, researchers presented adversarial attacks in the digital
domain, and later the attacks were transferred to the physical domain. However,
in many cases, attacks in the physical domain are conspicuous, and thus may
raise suspicion in real-world environments (e.g., airports). In this paper, we
propose Adversarial Mask, a physical universal adversarial perturbation (UAP)

a carefully crafted pattern. In our experiments, we examined the
transferability of our adversarial mask to a wide range of FR model
architectures and datasets. In addition, we validated our adversarial mask's
effectiveness in real-world experiments (CCTV use case) by printing the
adversarial pattern on a fabric face mask. In these experiments, the FR system
was only able to identify 3.34% of the participants wearing the mask (compared
to a minimum of 83.34% with other evaluated masks). A demo of our experiments

for prediction while keeping the training data local on each client. However,
existing collaborative learning methods require fully-labeled data for
training, which is inconvenient or sometimes infeasible to obtain due to the
high labeling cost and the requirement of expertise. The lack of labels makes
collaborative learning impractical in many realistic settings. Self-supervised
learning can address this challenge by learning from unlabeled data.
Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can effectively
learn visual representations from unlabeled image data. However, the
distributed data collected on clients are usually not independent and
identically distributed (non-IID) among clients, and each client may only have
few classes of data, which degrades the performance of CL and learned
representations. To tackle this problem, we propose a collaborative contrastive
learning framework consisting of two approaches: feature fusion and
neighborhood matching, by which a unified feature space among clients is
learned for better data representations. Feature fusion provides remote
features as accurate contrastive information to each client for better local
learning. Neighborhood matching further aligns each client's local features to
the remote features such that well-clustered features among clients can be
learned. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. It outperforms other methods by 11% on IID data and matches the
performance of centralized learning.

study of intersystem interactions, and the properties of its k-cores are
investigated. The notion of p-cores is introduced, with help of which the
components of MLN that are directly involved in the implementation of

decrease their dimensionality and better understand the processes that take
place in complex network systems and intersystem interactions of different
types. Using the introduced local and global structural characteristics of
elements, effective scenarios of targeted attacks on monoflow partially

is focused on the transition points of MLN through which intersystem
interactions are actually realized. It is shown that these scenarios can also
be used to solve the inverse problem, namely, which elements of MLN should be

effect in wideband channels results in frequency-dependent non-uniform shift of
signal frequencies across the band. In this paper, we develop an OTFS-like

handling wideband time-varying channels. We derive the ODSS transmission and
reception schemes from first principles. In the process, we introduce the
notion of $\omega$-convolution in the delay-scale space that parallels the
twisted convolution used in the time-frequency space. The preprocessing 2D

improves the bit error rate performance compared to OTFS and Orthogonal

investigated by means of the exact-diagonalization method. The algebraic decay
rate $\sigma$ of the long-range interaction is related to the effective
dimensionality $D(\sigma)$, which governs the criticality of the
transverse-field-driven phase transition at $H=H_c$. According to the large-$N$
analysis, the phase boundary $H_c(\eta)$ exhibits a reentrant behavior within
$2<D < 3.065\dots $, as the $XY$-anisotropy $\eta$ changes. On the one hand, as
for the $D=(2+1)$ and $(1+1)$ short-range $XY$ magnets, the singularities have
been determined as $H_c(\eta) -H_c(0) \sim |\eta|$ and $ 0 $, respectively, and
the transient behavior around $D \approx 2.5$ remains unclear. As a preliminary
survey, setting $(\sigma,\eta)=(1 ,0.5)$, we investigate the phase transition

rather sensitively. Thereby, under the setting $ \sigma=4/3$ ($D=2.5$), we cast
the fidelity data into the crossover-scaling formula with the properly scaled

learning based approaches are being adopted and more recently deep learning
based tools have become popular. Here, we propose an approach of spectrum
sensing which is based on long short term memory (LSTM) which is a critical
element of deep learning networks (DLN). Use of LSTM facilitates implicit
feature learning from spectrum data. The DLN is trained using several features
and the performance of the proposed sensing technique is validated with the
help of an empirical testbed setup using Adalm Pluto. The testbed is trained to
acquire the primary signal of a real world radio broadcast taking place using
FM. Experimental data show that even at low signal to noise ratio, our approach
performs well in terms of detection and classification accuracies, as compared
to current spectrum sensing methods.

  Mechanism","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There has been a rapid advance of custom hardware (HW) for accelerating the
inference speed of deep neural networks (DNNs). Previously, the softmax layer
was not a main concern of DNN accelerating HW, because its portion is
relatively small in multi-layer perceptron or convolutional neural networks.
However, as the attention mechanisms are widely used in various modern DNNs, a
cost-efficient implementation of softmax layer is becoming very important. In
this paper, we propose two methods to approximate softmax computation, which
are based on the usage of LookUp Tables (LUTs). The required size of LUT is
quite small (about 700 Bytes) because ranges of numerators and denominators of
softmax are stable if normalization is applied to the input. We have validated
the proposed technique over different AI tasks (object detection, machine
translation, sentiment analysis, and semantic equivalence) and DNN models
(DETR, Transformer, BERT) by a variety of benchmarks (COCO17, WMT14, WMT17,

annotations to achieve outstanding performance in medical image segmentation.
One-shot segmentation and weakly-supervised learning are promising research
directions that lower labeling effort by learning a new class from only one
annotated image and utilizing coarse labels instead, respectively. Previous
works usually fail to leverage the anatomical structure and suffer from class
imbalance and low contrast problems. Hence, we present an innovative framework
for 3D medical image segmentation with one-shot and weakly-supervised settings.
Firstly a propagation-reconstruction network is proposed to project scribbles
from annotated volume to unlabeled 3D images based on the assumption that
anatomical patterns in different human bodies are similar. Then a dual-level
feature denoising module is designed to refine the scribbles based on
anatomical- and pixel-level features. After expanding the scribbles to pseudo
masks, we could train a segmentation model for the new class with the noisy
label training strategy. Experiments on one abdomen and one head-and-neck CT

carrier densities $r \approx 1$ in a wide temperature range, at low doping the
temperature dependence of $r$ is very strong with values as high as 4 below

the carrier scattering rates due to acoustic phonons. At higher temperatures
$r$ can instead become as low as $0.5$ due to the contribution of both holes

independent of language. Six emotions were categorized for this study, such as
- happy, angry, neutral, sad, disgust, and fear. We employed three Emotional
Speech Sets (ESS), of which the first two were developed by native Bengali
speakers in Bangla and English languages separately. The third was a subset of
the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), which was developed by native English
speakers from Canada. We carefully selected language-independent prosodic

the performance of the three speech sets individually, followed by the second
experiment, where different ESS pairs were integrated to analyze the impact on
SER. Finally, we measured the recognition rate by training and testing the
model with different speech sets in the third experiment. Although this study
reveals that SER in Bangla and English languages is mostly
language-independent, some disparities were observed while recognizing
emotional states like disgust and fear in these two languages. Moreover, our
investigations revealed that non-native speakers convey emotions through

Centaurs showed that their orbits tend to be polar with respect to the solar
system's invariable plane over a large semi-major axis range in trans-neptunian
space. Here, we lay the analytical foundation of the study of the inclination
pathways of planet-crossing asteroids that explains these findings. We show
that the Tisserand relation partitions the inclination-semi-major axis
parameter space of the three-body problem into distinct regions depending on
the asteroid's Tisserand parameter T or equivalently its orbital inclination
I_infinity far from the planet. The Tisserand relation shows that asteroids
with I_infinity > 110 deg. (T < -1) cannot be injected inside the planet's
orbit. Injection onto retrograde orbits and high-inclination prograde orbits
occurs inside the inclination corridor 45 deg. < I_infinity < 110 deg. (-1< T <
2). Inclination dispersion across the inclination pathway for moderate and high
inclinations is explained by the secular perturbations from the planet and is
smallest for polar orbits. When a planet-crossing asteroid temporarily leaves
the inclination pathway, its long term evolution still depends on its Tisserand
parameter as evidenced by its eccentricity dispersion. Simulations of asteroid
orbits using the equations of motion with Neptune as the perturbing planet
confirm these results for moderate to high inclinations, forward and backward
in time because the Tisserand relation is time independent. The Tisserand
inclination pathways will provide important constraints on comet delivery from
the outer solar system as well as on the possible presence of unknown planets
in trans-neptunian space.

the effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy

last decades they have been observed at accelerator experiments in the sector
with two heavy quarks, at or above the quarkonium strong decay threshold and
called X Y Z states. These states offer a unique possibility for investigating
the dynamical properties of strongly correlated systems in QCD. I will show how
an alliance of nonrelativistic effective field theories and lattice can allow
us to address these states in QCD. In particular I will explain what are the
opportunities and challenges of lattice QCD in this respect and which new tools

necessary for clinical diagnosis, iodine radiation in the imaging process
induces irreversible injury, thereby driving researchers to study sparse-view
CT reconstruction, that is, recovering a high-quality CT image from a sparse
set of sinogram views. Iterative models are proposed to alleviate the appeared
artifacts in sparse-view CT images, but the computation cost is too expensive.
Then deep-learning-based methods have gained prevalence due to the excellent
performances and lower computation. However, these methods ignore the mismatch
between the CNN's \textbf{local} feature extraction capability and the
sinogram's \textbf{global} characteristics. To overcome the problem, we propose
\textbf{Du}al-\textbf{Do}main \textbf{Trans}former (\textbf{DuDoTrans}) to
simultaneously restore informative sinograms via the long-range dependency
modeling capability of Transformer and reconstruct CT image with both the
enhanced and raw sinograms. With such a novel design, reconstruction
performance on the NIH-AAPM dataset and COVID-19 dataset experimentally
confirms the effectiveness and generalizability of DuDoTrans with fewer
involved parameters. Extensive experiments also demonstrate its robustness with
different noise-level scenarios for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The code and

technology for boosting the coverage and for enhancing the spectral efficiency
of wireless systems, as well as for taming the wireless environment. The
potential benefits of RISs are currently being analyzed and various approaches
are being proposed to address some challenges for their integration in wireless
networks. Currently available studies to quantify the potential gains of
deploying RISs in wireless networks are limited to simple network topologies,
while no system-level assessments have been reported to date. Network-level,
e.g., on the scale of hundreds of square meters, simulations are, however, the
first step to quantify the actual value of emerging technologies and the
steppingstone before considering large scale system-level experimental
evaluations and network deployments. Towards this direction, this article
reports the first system-level simulation results and analysis of an RIS
deployment in a typical urban city that is served by a fifth-generation
cellular network. The obtained system-level simulation results unveil that the
benefits of RISs vary depending on the operating frequency and the size of the
surfaces. Specifically, we investigate the performance improvement that RISs
can provide, in terms of outdoor and indoor coverage and ergodic rate, when
deployed in mid (C-band) and high (millimeter-wave) frequency bands. For
example, the obtained results unveil that the deployment of RISs enhances the
coverage of cell-edge users from 77% to 95% in the C-band and from 46% to 95%
in the millimeter-wave band.

environmentally friendly and high-performance sorbents. Aprotic heterocyclic

technologies. In the present work, we investigate RTILs in which both the
weakly coordinating cation and AHA bind CO2. The ammonium-, phosphonium- and
sulfonium-based 2-cyanopyrrolidines were investigated using the
state-of-the-art method to describe the thermochemistry of the CO2 fixation
reactions. The infrared spectra, electronic and structural properties were
simulated at the hybrid density functional level of theory to characterize the
reactants and products of the chemisorption reactions. We conclude that the
proposed CO2 capturing mechanism is thermodynamically allowed and discuss the
difference between different families of RTILs. Quite unusually, the
intramolecular electrostatic attraction plays an essential role in stabilizing
the zwitterionic products of the CO2 chemisorption. The difference of
chemisorption performance between the families of RTILs is linked to sterical
hindrances and nucleophilicities of the {\alpha}- and \b{eta}-carbon atoms of
the aprotic cations. Our results are supported by the previous experimental CO2

active research topic that attracts extensive attention over the last two
decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) based detectors, especially
deep learning-based ones, have demonstrated impressive capability on clone
detection. It seems that this longstanding problem has already been tamed owing
to the advances in ML techniques. In this work, we would like to challenge the
robustness of the recent ML-based clone detectors through code
semantic-preserving transformations. We first utilize fifteen simple code
transformation operators combined with commonly-used heuristics (i.e., Random
Search, Genetic Algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to perform equivalent
program transformation. Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning-based sequence generation (DRLSG) strategy to effectively guide the
search process of generating clones that could escape from the detection. We
then evaluate the ML-based detectors with the pairs of original and generated
clones. We realize our method in a framework named CloneGen. CloneGen In
evaluation, we challenge the two state-of-the-art ML-based detectors and four
traditional detectors with the code clones after semantic-preserving
transformations via the aid of CloneGen. Surprisingly, our experiments show
that, despite the notable successes achieved by existing clone detectors, the
ML models inside these detectors still cannot distinguish numerous clones
produced by the code transformations in CloneGen. In addition, adversarial
training of ML-based clone detectors using clones generated by CloneGen can
improve their robustness and accuracy. CloneGen Meanwhile, compared with the
commonly-used heuristics, the DRLSG strategy has shown the best effectiveness
in generating code clones to decrease the detection accuracy of the ML-based

the learned representation to sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks, such as

recent self-supervised learning methods have extended image-level single
embedding to pixel-level dense embeddings. Unlike image-level representation
learning, due to the spatial deformation of augmentation, it is difficult to
sample pixel-level positive pairs. Previous studies have sampled pixel-level
positive pairs using the winner-takes-all among similarity or thresholding
warped distance between dense embeddings. However, these naive methods can be
struggled by background clutter and outliers problems. In this paper, we
introduce Hough Contrastive Learning (HoughCL), a Hough space based method that
enforces geometric consistency between two dense features. HoughCL achieves
robustness against background clutter and outliers. Furthermore, compared to

structure has been experimentally synthesized at megabar pressures with a
maximum $T_c$ of 215 K, comparable to that of a rare earth hydride LaH$_{10}$.
Here, based on first-principles calculations, we find that CaH$_6$ exhibits a
huge peak in the Eliashberg spectral function ${\alpha}^{2}F$ around the
low-frequency region of H-derived phonon modes, in contrast to LaH$_{10}$
having a widely spreading spectrum of ${\alpha}^{2}F$ over the whole
frequencies of H-derived phonon modes. It is revealed that the huge peak of
${\alpha}^{2}F$ in CaH$_6$ is associated with an effective electron-phonon
coupling (EPC) between low-frequency optical phonons and hybridized H 1$s$ and
Ca 3$d$ states near the Fermi energy. As pressure increases, the strengthened
H$-$H covalent bonding not only induces a hardening of optical phonon modes but
also reduces the electron-phonon matrix elements related to the low-frequency
optical modes, thereby leading to a lowering of the EPC constant. It is thus
demonstrated that H-derived low-frequency phonon modes play an important role
in the pressure-induced variation of $T_c$ in CaH$_6$. Furthermore, unlike the
presence of two distinct superconducting gaps in LaH$_{10}$, CaH$_6$ is found
to exhibit a single isotropic superconducting gap.

obtain high-resolution (HR) output from low-resolution (LR) input, during which
extra high-frequency information is supposed to be added to improve the
perceptual quality. Existing SISR works mainly operate in the spatial domain by
minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. Despite the high peak
signal-to-noise ratios(PSNR) results, it is difficult to determine whether the
model correctly adds desired high-frequency details. Some residual-based
structures are proposed to guide the model to focus on high-frequency features
implicitly. However, how to verify the fidelity of those artificial details
remains a problem since the interpretation from spatial-domain metrics is
limited. In this paper, we propose FreqNet, an intuitive pipeline from the
frequency domain perspective, to solve this problem. Inspired by existing
frequency-domain works, we convert images into discrete cosine transform (DCT)
blocks, then reform them to obtain the DCT feature maps, which serve as the
input and target of our model. A specialized pipeline is designed, and we
further propose a frequency loss function to fit the nature of our
frequency-domain task. Our SISR method in the frequency domain can learn the
high-frequency information explicitly, provide fidelity and good perceptual
quality for the SR images. We further observe that our model can be merged with
other spatial super-resolution models to enhance the quality of their original
SR output.

specifications more precisely than the previous work. The control logic is then
demonstrated through simulations with offensive motion in real games. It is
confirmed that the present logic generates valid defensive movements without
specification to these specific scenes. We further exemplify that the logic
generates proper motion under ice hockey's man-to-man and zone defense

be diagonal here) is assumed to get random additional contributions for each of
its component which are taken to be Gaussian distributed with certain width
characterized by the strength of density fluctuations $\epsilon$. Using sample
values of $\epsilon$, (and the pulsar deformation parameter $\eta$) we
numerically calculate detailed pulse modifications by solving Euler's equations
for the rotational dynamics of the pulsar. We also give analytical estimates
which can be used for arbitrary values of $\epsilon$ and $\eta$. We show that
there are very specific patterns in the perturbed pulses which are observable
in terms of modulations of pulses over large time periods. In view of the fact
that density fluctuations fade away eventually leading to a uniform phase in
the interior of pulsar, the off-diagonal components of MI tensor also vanish
eventually. Thus, the modification of pulses due to induced wobbling (from the
off-diagonal MI components) will also die away eventually. This allows one to
distinguish these transient pulse modulations from the effects of any wobbling

the graph that connects a given set of vertices. It is a classic NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problem and has many real-world applications (e.g.,
VLSI chip design, transportation network planning and wireless sensor
networks). Many exact and approximate algorithms have been developed for STP,
but they suffer from high computational complexity and weak worst-case solution
guarantees, respectively. Heuristic algorithms are also developed. However,
each of them requires application domain knowledge to design and is only
suitable for specific scenarios. Motivated by the recently reported observation
that instances of the same NP-hard combinatorial problem may maintain the same
or similar combinatorial structure but mainly differ in their data, we
investigate the feasibility and benefits of applying machine learning
techniques to solving STP. To this end, we design a novel model Vulcan based on
novel graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. The core of Vulcan
is a novel, compact graph embedding that transforms highdimensional graph
structure data (i.e., path-changed information) into a low-dimensional vector
representation. Given an STP instance, Vulcan uses this embedding to encode its
pathrelated information and sends the encoded graph to a deep reinforcement
learning component based on a double deep Q network (DDQN) to find solutions.
In addition to STP, Vulcan can also find solutions to a wide range of NP-hard
problems (e.g., SAT, MVC and X3C) by reducing them to STP. We implement a
prototype of Vulcan and demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency with extensive
experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets.

high dimension, when resorting to Monte Carlo simulation is necessary. Such
stochastic computations typically suffer from high variance, in particular in a
low noise regime, because the expectation is dominated by rare trajectories for
which the observable reaches large values. Although importance sampling, or
tilting of trajectories, is now a standard technique for reducing the variance
of such estimators, quantitative criteria for proving that a given control
reduces variance are scarce, and often do not apply to practical situations.
The goal of this work is to provide a quantitative criterion for assessing
whether a given bias reduces variance, and at which order. We rely for this on
a recently introduced notion of stochastic solution for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equations. Based on this tool, we introduce the notion of k-stochastic
viscosity approximation (SVA) of a HJB equation. We next prove that such
approximate solutions are associated with estimators having a relative variance
of order k-1 at log-scale. In particular, a sampling scheme built from a 1-SVA
has bounded variance as noise goes to zero. Finally, in order to show that our
definition is relevant, we provide examples of stochastic viscosity
approximations of order one and two, with a numerical illustration confirming
our theoretical findings.

the diversity of image style may be majorly attributed to the vendor factor.
However, the collection of mammograms from vendors as many as possible is very
expensive and sometimes impractical for laboratory-scale studies. Accordingly,
to further augment the generalization capability of deep learning model to
various vendors with limited resources, a new contrastive learning scheme is
developed. Specifically, the backbone network is firstly trained with a
multi-style and multi-view unsupervised self-learning scheme for the embedding
of invariant features to various vendor-styles. Afterward, the backbone network
is then recalibrated to the downstream task of lesion detection with the
specific supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated with mammograms
from four vendors and one unseen public dataset. The experimental results
suggest that our approach can effectively improve detection performance on both
seen and unseen domains, and outperforms many state-of-the-art (SOTA)
generalization methods.

the antagonist to overcome. Nevertheless, this idea might only see the half
picture. Up until very recently, increasing researchers argue that a brain is
born to forget, i.e., forgetting is a natural and active process for abstract,

active forgetting mechanism with artificial neural networks. The active
forgetting mechanism (AFM) is introduced to a neural network via a
""plug-and-play"" forgetting layer (P\&PF), consisting of groups of inhibitory
neurons with Internal Regulation Strategy (IRS) to adjust the extinction rate

(ERS) to adjust the extinction rate of excitatory neurons via inhibition

benefits: self-adaptive structure, strong generalization, long-term learning

light on the importance of forgetting in the learning process and offers new
perspectives to understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks.

robustly, is computationally efficient, has low data storage requirements, and
is easy to implement making it appealing for many real-time applications.

Galactic globular cluster (GGC) 47 Tuc (NGC 104), with a primary objective of
investigating possible differences between the abundances of Zr in the first
generation (1P) and second generation (2P) stars. For the abundance analysis,
we used archival UVES/GIRAFFE spectra obtained during three different observing
programmes. Abundances were determined from two Na I and three Zr I lines,
using 1D hydrostatic ATLAS model atmospheres. The target stars for the
abundance analysis were limited to those with 4200 $\leq$ $T_{\rm eff}$ $\leq$
4800 K. This is the largest sample of GGC stars in which Na and Zr abundances
have been studied so far. While our mean [Na/Fe] and [Zr/Fe] ratios agree well
with those determined in the earlier studies, we find a weak but statistically
significant correlation in the ${\rm [Zr/Fe]} - {\rm [Na/Fe]}$ plane. A
comparison of the mean [Zr/Fe] abundance ratios in the 1P and 2P stars suggests
a small but statistically significant Zr over-abundance in the 2P stars,
$\Delta {\rm [Zr/Fe]}_{\rm 2P-1P}\approx+0.06$ dex. Also, our analysis shows
that stars enriched in both Zr and Na are more centrally concentrated. However,
we find no correlation between their distance from the cluster centre and their
full spatial velocity. While there may be some influence of CN line blends on
the determined Zr abundances, it seems very unlikely that the detected Zr-Na
correlation, for the slightly higher Zr abundances in the 2P stars, would be
caused by the CN blending alone. The obtained results indicate that, in 47 Tuc,
some amount of Zr should have been synthesised by the same polluters that
enriched 2P stars with the light elements. Unfortunately, our data alone do not
allow us to distinguish which of the two scenarios, or whether or not a
combination of both, could have operated in this GGC.

Then it is of great interest to recognize the relationship between multiple

characterizes the phenomenon that one text corpus would influence the topics to
be discussed in the other text corpus in the future. To discover the lead-lag
relationship, we propose a jointly dynamic topic model and also develop an
embedding extension to address the modeling problem of large-scale text corpus.
With the recognized lead-lag relationship, the similarities of the two text
corpora can be figured out and the quality of topic learning in both corpora
can be improved. We numerically investigate the performance of the jointly

especially for models that are complex and hard to understand as in deep

model uncertainty. Here, we propose a deep learning method to estimate the
diffusion tensor and compute the estimation uncertainty. Data-dependent
uncertainty is computed directly by the network and learned via loss
attenuation. Model uncertainty is computed using Monte Carlo dropout. We also
propose a new method for evaluating the quality of predicted uncertainties. We
compare the new method with the standard least-squares tensor estimation and
bootstrap-based uncertainty computation techniques. Our experiments show that
when the number of measurements is small the deep learning method is more
accurate and its uncertainty predictions are better calibrated than the
standard methods. We show that the estimation uncertainties computed by the new
method can highlight the model's biases, detect domain shift, and reflect the
strength of noise in the measurements. Our study shows the importance and
practical value of modeling prediction uncertainties in deep learning-based
diffusion MRI analysis.

this study. Here, the severe environment indicates the temperature-varying air
near the volcano. The controller overcomes the intensively changing temperature
above the crater of the volcano which biases the nominal dynamics (25 Celcius).
The target Volcano is picked as Satsuma-iojima located in a tiny insular South
to the mainland of Japan. The temperature distribution is contributed from
previous research by Geological Survey of Japan. To guarantee that the control
signal is under the input saturation, a path planning method is developed.
Picking the eigenvalue for a system with a moving reference is a novel topic;
the method to develop a controller with specific requirement is created for the
first time. This method might be referred as a standard way for
designers/engineers in developing controller with a moving target/reference in
further study. In controlling part, a state feedback controller is designed to
stabilize the height of the quadrotor. The eigenvalue of the feedback
controller is picked based on the method developed in Chapter Path Planning.
And a PID controller is designed to control the attitude. The result of these
are verified in a simulator written in MATLAB. At last, a Kalman filter is
applied in height control to combine the measurement noise from IMU and laser
scanner and the system noise caused by the changing temperature. Another reason
for developing a Kalman filter is that IMU readout provides with acceleration.
While the velocity is not achieved by sensor directly. The result of height
control with a Kalman filter is verified in MATLAB Simulink.

opportunity to bring scale and automation to the creation of realistic and

the generation of email and instant messaging-style group communications at

information inside private communications and document attachments, making them
an enticing target for an adversary. We address two key aspects of simulating
this type of system: modelling when and with whom participants communicate, and
generating topical, multi-party text to populate simulated conversation
threads. We present the LogNormMix-Net Temporal Point Process as an approach to
the first of these, building upon the intensity-free modeling approach of
Shchur et al. to create a generative model for unicast and multi-cast

models to generate convincing multi-party conversation threads. A live email
server is simulated by uniting our LogNormMix-Net TPP (to generate the
communication timestamp, sender and recipients) with the language model, which
generates the contents of the multi-party email threads. We evaluate the
generated content with respect to a number of realism-based properties, that
encourage a model to learn to generate content that will engage the attention
of an adversary to achieve a deception outcome.

privacy concerns are modest, perhaps because there still is insufficient

method can flexibly adapt to different terrains and the dynamic extension of
