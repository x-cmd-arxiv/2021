guigna cats, as well as investigations in which small populations are captured
to place radiocollars on them and then release them in the place where they
were captured, which is done with the intention of collecting data on their
positions in a territory and thus make estimates of the mean distances they
usually travel. Under the hypothesis that guignas maintain a sedentary behavior
in a specific area of a given territory, this paper shows one way to simulate a
distribution of points in a territory using random walkers to emulate the
distribution of the data that would be obtained by placing radiocollars in a
population of guignas, with which it is possible to make estimates of the mean
distances that move away from a certain fixed position, and the interactions
they can have with points in the territory that represent a high probability of
lethality, such as farms, packs of dogs, roads, urban areas, etc. It is
necessary to mention that by estimating the possible interactions that a
guignas population may have with possible predators in a territory with the
help of a satellite image, it is possible to evaluate the points of a territory
that represent a potentially lethal risk for the guignas, and thus generate
relocation strategies that help preserve them.

major application is to intracellular diffusion, where the holes could
represent organelles or biochemical substrates. In this paper we use a
combination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green's function methods to
calculate the so-called accumulation time for relaxation to steady state in 2D
domains. The standard measure of the relaxation rate is in terms of the
principal nonzero eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian. However, this global
measure does not account for possible differences in the relaxation rate at
different spatial locations, is independent of the initial conditions, and
relies on the assumption that the eigenvalues have sufficiently large spectral
gaps. As previously established for diffusion-based morphogen gradient
formation, the accumulation time provides a better measure of the relaxation
process.

variety of fields. More recently, data availability has allowed us to study
rank dynamics: how elements of a ranking change in time. Here, we study the
rank distributions and rank dynamics of twelve datasets from different sports
and games. To study rank dynamics, we consider measures we have defined
previously: rank diversity, change probability, rank entropy, and rank
complexity. We also introduce a new measure that we call ``system closure''
that reflects how many elements enter or leave the rankings in time. We use a
random walk model to reproduce the observed rank dynamics, showing that a
simple mechanism can generate similar statistical properties as the ones
observed in the datasets. Our results show that, while rank distributions vary
considerably for different rankings, rank dynamics have similar behaviors,
independently of the nature and competitiveness of the sport or game and its
ranking method. Our results also suggest that our measures of rank dynamics are
general and applicable for complex systems of different natures.

In this work, we show how to perform end-to-end hybrid source separation,
letting the model decide which domain is best suited for each source, and even
combining both. The proposed hybrid version of the Demucs architecture won the
Music Demixing Challenge 2021 organized by Sony. This architecture also comes
with additional improvements, such as compressed residual branches, local
attention or singular value regularization. Overall, a 1.4 dB improvement of
the Signal-To-Distortion (SDR) was observed across all sources as measured on
the MusDB HQ dataset, an improvement confirmed by human subjective evaluation,
with an overall quality rated at 2.83 out of 5 (2.36 for the non hybrid
Demucs), and absence of contamination at 3.04 (against 2.37 for the non hybrid
Demucs and 2.44 for the second ranking model submitted at the competition).

them are relevant for security. However, we have only little information about
the usage and support of security-relevant headers in mobile applications. We
explored the adoption of such headers in mobile app communication by querying
9,714 distinct URLs that were used in 3,376 apps and collected each server's
response information. We discovered that support for secure HTTP header fields
is absent in all major HTTP clients, and it is barely provided with any server
response. Based on these results, we discuss opportunities for improvement
particularly to reduce the likelihood of data leaks and arbitrary code
execution. We advocate more comprehensive use of existing HTTP headers and
timely development of relevant web browser security features in HTTP client
libraries.

computational resources, the recent releases of tabular and surrogate
benchmarks have greatly increased the speed and reproducibility of NAS
research. However, two of the most popular benchmarks do not provide the full
training information for each architecture. As a result, on these benchmarks it
is not possible to run many types of multi-fidelity techniques, such as
learning curve extrapolation, that require evaluating architectures at
arbitrary epochs. In this work, we present a method using singular value
decomposition and noise modeling to create surrogate benchmarks, NAS-Bench-111,
NAS-Bench-311, and NAS-Bench-NLP11, that output the full training information
for each architecture, rather than just the final validation accuracy. We
demonstrate the power of using the full training information by introducing a
learning curve extrapolation framework to modify single-fidelity algorithms,
showing that it leads to improvements over popular single-fidelity algorithms
which claimed to be state-of-the-art upon release. Our code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/automl/nas-bench-x11.

  reinsurance stop it?","33 pages",,,,"q-fin.MF q-fin.PM q-fin.RM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We analyze the potential of reinsurance for reversing the current trend of
decreasing capital guarantees in life insurance products. Providing an insurer
with an opportunity to shift part of the financial risk to a reinsurer, we
solve the insurer's dynamic investment-reinsurance optimization problem under
simultaneous Value-at-Risk and no-short-selling constraints. We introduce the
concept of guarantee-equivalent utility gain and use it to compare life
insurance products with and without reinsurance. Our numerical studies indicate
that the optimally managed reinsurance allows the insurer to offer
significantly higher capital guarantees to clients without any loss in the
insurer's expected utility. The longer the investment horizon and the less
risk-averse the insurer, the more prominent the reinsurance benefit.

Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) to estimate the Hubble parameter
$H(z)$, including its current value, the Hubble constant $H_0$. Each
gravitational-wave (GW) signal provides the luminosity distance to the source
and we estimate the corresponding redshift using two methods: the redshifted
masses and a galaxy catalog. Using the binary black hole (BBH) redshifted
masses, we simultaneously infer the source mass distribution and $H(z)$. The
source mass distribution displays a peak around $34\, {\rm M_\odot}$, followed
by a drop-off. Assuming this mass scale does not evolve with redshift results
in a $H(z)$ measurement, yielding $H_0=68^{+12}_{-7} {\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ ($68\%$ credible interval) when combined with the $H_0$
measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. This represents
an improvement of 17% with respect to the $H_0$ estimate from GWTC-1. The
second method associates each GW event with its probable host galaxy in the
catalog GLADE+, statistically marginalizing over the redshifts of each event's
potential hosts. Assuming a fixed BBH population, we estimate a value of
$H_0=68^{+8}_{-6} {\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with the galaxy catalog method,
an improvement of 42% with respect to our GWTC-1 result and 20% with respect to
recent $H_0$ studies using GWTC-2 events. However, we show that this result is
strongly impacted by assumptions about the BBH source mass distribution; the
only event which is not strongly impacted by such assumptions (and is thus
informative about $H_0$) is the well-localized event GW190814.

  Image Processing. Github repository:
  https://github.com/jaburke166/gaussian_process_edge_trace",,"10.1109/TIP.2021.3128329",,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We introduce a novel edge tracing algorithm using Gaussian process
regression. Our edge-based segmentation algorithm models an edge of interest
using Gaussian process regression and iteratively searches the image for edge
pixels in a recursive Bayesian scheme. This procedure combines local edge
information from the image gradient and global structural information from
posterior curves, sampled from the model's posterior predictive distribution,
to sequentially build and refine an observation set of edge pixels. This
accumulation of pixels converges the distribution to the edge of interest.
Hyperparameters can be tuned by the user at initialisation and optimised given
the refined observation set. This tunable approach does not require any prior
training and is not restricted to any particular type of imaging domain. Due to
the model's uncertainty quantification, the algorithm is robust to artefacts
and occlusions which degrade the quality and continuity of edges in images. Our
approach also has the ability to efficiently trace edges in image sequences by
using previous-image edge traces as a priori information for consecutive
images. Various applications to medical imaging and satellite imaging are used
to validate the technique and comparisons are made with two commonly used edge
tracing algorithms.

  Zlochower, M. E. Zucker, J. Zweizig","GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo During
  the Second Part of the Third Observing Run","82 pages (10 pages author list, 30 pages main text, 22 pages
  appendices, 20 pages bibliography), 16 figures, 14 tables. Data products
  available from https://www.gw-openscience.org/GWTC-3/",,,"LIGO-P2000318","gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) describes signals
detected with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo up to the end of their third
observing run. Updating the previous GWTC-2.1, we present candidate
gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences during the second half of
the third observing run (O3b) between 1 November 2019, 15:00 UTC and 27 March
2020, 17:00 UTC. There are 35 compact binary coalescence candidates identified
by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical
origin $p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$. Of these, 18 were previously reported as
low-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based
upon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with
$p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$ are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from
binary black holes or neutron star-black hole binaries, and we identify none
from binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we
are not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary
components are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component
masses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates
include the first confident observations of neutron star-black hole binaries.
Including the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3
contains 90 candidates found by our analysis with $p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$
across the first three observing runs. These observations of compact binary
coalescences present an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and
neutron stars.

that has been studied in the literature using different methods, including
standard lattice simulations. Among these, the volume-reduced twisted
Eguchi-Kawai model, endowed with one adjoint Majorana fermion, could play an
important role in studying its large-$N$ limit via the Curci-Veneziano
prescription. In this talk, we present our results on the analysis of the scale
of the theory, performed via different methods based on purely gluonic
observables as well as (quenched) fundamental mesons in the chiral limit. These
lattice results will be used as a scale setting for the analysis of the
spectrum of the theory.

fuel for star formation. However, recent large-scale surveys of giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) have detected extended HCN line emission. Such observations often
resolve the HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure (HFS). A precise determination of the
physical conditions of the gas requires treating the HFS line overlap effects.
Here, we study the HCN HFS excitation and line emission using nonlocal
radiative transfer models that include line overlaps and new HFS-resolved
collisional rate coefficients for inelastic collisions of HCN with both para-H2
and ortho-H2 (computed via the scaled-IOS approximation up to Tk=500 K). In
addition, we account for the role of electron collisions in the HFS level
excitation. We find that line overlap and opacity effects frequently produce
anomalous HCN J=1-0 HFS line intensity ratios (inconsistent with the common
assumption of the same Tex for all HFS lines) as well as anomalous HFS line
width ratios. Line overlap and electron collisions also enhance the excitation
of the higher J rotational lines. Electron excitation becomes important for
molecular gas with H2 densities below a few 10^5 cm-3 and electron abundances
above ~10^-5. In particular, electron excitation can produce
low-surface-brightness HCN emission from very extended but low-density gas in
GMCs. The existence of such a widespread HCN emission component may affect the
interpretation of the extragalactic relationship HCN luminosity versus
star-formation rate. Alternatively, extended HCN emission may arise from dense
star-forming cores and become resonantly scattered by large envelopes of lower
density gas. There are two scenarios - namely, electron-assisted (weakly)
collisionally excited versus scattering - that lead to different HCN J=1-0 HFS
intensity ratios, which can be tested on the basis of observations.

to find models of the sensors and fusion center that are optimized in the sense

novelty is as follows. First, the multi-compressors are non-linear and modeled
using second degree polynomials. This may increase the accuracy of the signal
estimation through the optimization in a higher dimensional parameter space
compared to the linear case. Second, the required models are determined by a
method based on a combination of the second degree transform (SDT) with the
maximum block improvement (MBI) method and the generalized rank-constrained

further increase the estimation accuracy of the source signal. Third, the

the rain layer from an input rainy image. For this purpose, an encoder-decoder
network draws wide attention, where the encoder is required to encode a
high-quality rain embedding which determines the performance of the subsequent
decoding stage to reconstruct the rain layer. However, most of existing studies
ignore the significance of rain embedding quality, thus leading to limited
performance with over/under-deraining. In this paper, with our observation of
the high rain layer reconstruction performance by an rain-to-rain autoencoder,
we introduce the idea of ""Rain Embedding Consistency"" by regarding the encoded
embedding by the autoencoder as an ideal rain embedding and aim at enhancing
the deraining performance by improving the consistency between the ideal rain
embedding and the rain embedding derived by the encoder of the deraining
network. To achieve this, a Rain Embedding Loss is applied to directly
supervise the encoding process, with a Rectified Local Contrast Normalization
(RLCN) as the guide that effectively extracts the candidate rain pixels. We
also propose Layered LSTM for recurrent deraining and fine-grained encoder
feature refinement considering different scales. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods particularly on a real-world dataset. Our source code

revisit the theoretical derivation of the dipole in the sources number counts,

We argue that if the spectral index and magnification bias of the sources vary
with redshift, the standard theoretical description of the dipole may be

We then determine the values that this evolution rate should have in order to
remove the tension with the CMB dipole.

attenuate high frequency components in the incoming signal, regardless if they
come from noise or the actual signal. Therefore, low-pass filters must be
carefully tuned in order to avoid significant deterioration of the signal. This
tuning requires prior knowledge about the signal, which is often not available
in applications such as reinforcement learning or learning-based control. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive low-pass filter based
on Gaussian process regression. By considering a constant window of previous
observations, updates and predictions fast enough for real-world filtering
applications can be realized. Moreover, the online optimization of
hyperparameters leads to an adaptation of the low-pass behavior, such that no

element of the interstellar medium, the densest of these filaments hosting the

networks of filaments, also known as hub filament systems, can be found. These
hubs are believed to be preferentially associated to massive star formation. As
of today, there are no metrics that allow the systematic quantification of a

to show that: i. hub filaments represent a small fraction of the global

luminous compact sources that non-hubs; iii. hub-hosting clumps are more
evolved that non-hubs; iv. no discontinuities are observed in the properties of
compact sources as a function of convergence parameter. We propose that the
rapid global collapse of clumps is responsible for (re)organising filament
networks into hubs and, in parallel, enhancing the mass growth of compact

the other modes (including solitary waves, ion acoustic waves) that are

Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The saturon decays via Hawking's thermal rate of

Despite its general applicability, the Fokker-Planck equation governing such

although alternative spectral expansion approaches offer some advantages in the
study of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. This is mainly due to the difficulty
in computing the state-dependent coefficients of the expanded system of
differential equations. Here, we address this issue by deriving analytic
expressions for such coefficients by pairing perturbative solutions of the
Fokker-Planck approach with their counterparts from the spectral expansion. A
tight relationship emerges between several of these coefficients and the
Laplace transform of the inter-spike interval density (i.e., the distribution

the eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck operator and its eigenfunctions at the

+cn$ is equal to $d_{\text{T.V.}}(\text{Poiss}(1+e^{-c}), \text{Poiss}(1))$. We
prove this by developing a technique for comparing the limit profile behavior
of two reversible Markov chains on the same space, that share the same
stationary distribution and eigenbasis. We then compare the limit profile of
star transpositions to the limit profile of random transpositions, as studied
in \cite{Teyssier}, and prove that they have the same limit profile at the
respective cutoff times.

dichalcogenides. We report that such superconductors have unusual optical
properties controlled by the in-plane Zeeman field. First, we find several
optical gaps visible as peaks of the conductivity and the Raman susceptibility.
Moreover, we find that the Ising spin splitting in the spectrum of Bogolubov
quasiparticles enables strong population inversion generated by the
time-dependent Zeeman field. Ultimately this leads to the possibility of the
superconducting laser with magnonic pumping which can be realized in the van
der Waals structures consisting of the Ising superconductor and the
ferromagnetic insulator layers.

are encoded in their excitations. In ordinary magnetic materials, single
spin-flips give rise to collective dipolar magnetic excitations called magnons.
Likewise, multiple spin-flips can give rise to multipolar magnetic excitations
in magnetic materials with spin $\mathbf{S} \boldsymbol{\ge} \mathbf{1}$.
Unfortunately, since most experimental probes are governed by dipolar selection
rules, collective multipolar excitations have generally remained elusive. For
instance, only dipolar magnetic excitations have been observed in isotropic
$\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{=}\mathbf{1}$ Haldane spin systems. Here, we unveil a
hidden quadrupolar constituent of the spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic
$\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{=}\mathbf{1}$ Haldane chain material
Y$_\mathbf{2}$BaNiO$_\mathbf{5}$ using Ni $\mathbf{L_3}$-edge resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering. Our results demonstrate that pure quadrupolar
magnetic excitations can be probed without direct interactions with dipolar
excitations or anisotropic perturbations. Originating from on-site double
spin-flip processes, the quadrupolar magnetic excitations in
Y$_\mathbf{2}$BaNiO$_\mathbf{5}$ show a remarkable dual nature of collective
dispersion. While one component propagates as non-interacting entities, the
other behaves as a bound quadrupolar magnetic wave. This result highlights the
rich and largely unexplored physics of higher-order magnetic excitations.

It uses extended time-stretched pulses combined by binary orthogonal sequences.
Our recent finding of involuntary voice pitch response to auditory stimulation
while voicing motivated this proposal. The involuntary voice pitch response
provides means to investigate voice chain subsystems individually and
objectively. This response analysis requires reliable and precise pitch
extraction. We found that existing pitch extractors failed to correctly analyze
signals used for auditory stimulation by using the proposed method. Therefore,
we propose two reference pitch extractors based on the instantaneous frequency

correctly analyze the test signals. We open-sourced MATLAB codes to measure

lepton scattering from nuclear targets within the framework of the Relativistic
Fermi Gas (RFG) given in several publications are incorrect. For example, the
expressions published by Bell and Llewelyn Smith in 1972 are incorrect
(probably a typographical error). The expressions for Pauli blocking presented
in several subsequent publications including the paper of C.H. Llewelyn Smith
in 1972 and the paper of Paschos and Yu in 2002 have the same error. Another
example is a 1992 paper by Singh and Oset which has a different (probably also
a typographical) error. Other papers such as the papers of Tsai in 1974 and
Bosted and Mamyan in 2012 use the correct expressions. In this short preprint
we review the geometrical derivation of the overall reduction of the QE cross
sections due to Pauli blocking for electron and neutrino scattering for targets
with equal numbers of neutrons and protons and for targets with unequal numbers
of neutrons and protons and derive the correct expressions. However, we note
that the effects of Pauli blocking within the framework of the RFG model are
much larger than in other more realistic models of QE scattering such as
$\psi^\prime$ superscaling or a spectral function approach.

  waves through GWTC-3","v2: minor edits, most to Table 1 and caption; v3: rerun with public
  data; Data release: https://zenodo.org/record/5655785; v4: update Fig 14",,,"LIGO-P2100239","astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on the population properties of 76 compact binary mergers detected
with gravitational waves below a false alarm rate of 1 per year through GWTC-3.
The catalog contains three classes of binary mergers: BBH, BNS, and NSBH
mergers. We infer the BNS merger rate to be between 10 $\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$
and 1700 $\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$ and the NSBH merger rate to be between 7.8
$\rm{Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}}$ and 140 $\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$ , assuming a constant
rate density versus comoving volume and taking the union of 90% credible
intervals for methods used in this work. Accounting for the BBH merger rate to
evolve with redshift, we find the BBH merger rate to be between 17.9
$\rm{Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}}$ and 44 $\rm{Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}}$ at a fiducial
redshift (z=0.2). We obtain a broad neutron star mass distribution extending
from $1.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2} M_\odot$ to $2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3} M_\odot$. We can
confidently identify a rapid decrease in merger rate versus component mass
between neutron star-like masses and black-hole-like masses, but there is no
evidence that the merger rate increases again before 10 $M_\odot$. We also find
the BBH mass distribution has localized over- and under-densities relative to a
power law distribution. While we continue to find the mass distribution of a
binary's more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary
mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above $\sim
60 M_\odot$. The rate of BBH mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a
rate proportional to $(1+z)^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa = 2.9^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ for
$z\lesssim 1$. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin
magnitudes below $\chi_i \simeq 0.25$. We observe evidence of negative aligned
spins in the population, and an increase in spin magnitude for systems with
more unequal mass ratio.

risk-averse decisions. The standard Bayesian optimization (BO) paradigm,
however, optimizes the expected value only. We generalize BO to trade mean and
input-dependent variance of the objective, both of which we assume to be
unknown a priori. In particular, we propose a novel risk-averse heteroscedastic
Bayesian optimization algorithm (RAHBO) that aims to identify a solution with
high return and low noise variance, while learning the noise distribution on
the fly. To this end, we model both expectation and variance as (unknown) RKHS
functions, and propose a novel risk-aware acquisition function. We bound the
regret for our approach and provide a robust rule to report the final decision
point for applications where only a single solution must be identified. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RAHBO on synthetic benchmark functions and
hyperparameter tuning tasks.

emphasizes the need for resulting predictions to be both accurate and fair to
all stakeholders. In this work we present a novel approach to increase a Neural
Network model's fairness during training. We introduce a family of fairness
enhancing regularization components that we use in conjunction with the
traditional binary-cross-entropy based accuracy loss. These loss functions are
based on Bias Parity Score (BPS), a score that helps quantify bias in the
models with a single number. In the current work we investigate the behavior
and effect of these regularization components on bias. We deploy them in the
context of a recidivism prediction task as well as on a census-based adult
income dataset. The results demonstrate that with a good choice of fairness
loss function we can reduce the trained model's bias without deteriorating

implicit graph representations in structural graph theory. Specifically,
constant-cost communication problems correspond to hereditary graph families
that admit constant-size adjacency sketches, or equivalently constant-size
probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), and these graph families are a subset of
families that admit adjacency labeling schemes of size O(log n), which are the
subject of the well-studied implicit graph question (IGQ).
  We initiate the study of the hereditary graph families that admit
constant-size PUGs, with the two (equivalent) goals of (1) understanding
randomized constant-cost communication problems, and (2) understanding a
probabilistic version of the IGQ. For each family $\mathcal F$ studied in this
paper (including the monogenic bipartite families, product graphs, interval and
permutation graphs, families of bounded twin-width, and others), it holds that
the subfamilies $\mathcal H \subseteq \mathcal F$ are either stable (in a sense
relating to model theory), in which case they admit constant-size PUGs, or they
are not stable, in which case they do not.
  The correspondence between communication problems and hereditary graph
families allows for a new method of constructing adjacency labeling schemes. By
this method, we show that the induced subgraphs of any Cartesian products are
positive examples to the IGQ. We prove that this probabilistic construction
cannot be derandomized by using an Equality oracle, i.e. the Equality oracle
cannot simulate the k-Hamming Distance communication protocol. We also obtain
constant-size sketches for deciding $\mathsf{dist}(x, y) \le k$ for vertices
$x$, $y$ in any stable graph family with bounded twin-width. This generalizes
to constant-size sketches for deciding first-order formulas over the same
graphs.

Reynolds numbers based on the base body diameter ($Re_D = 0.76 \times 10^6$,
and $3.05 \times 10^6$). Furthermore, modal analysis is done on schlieren
images to understand the flow dynamics parallel with the unsteady pressure
measurements. The protruding spike of length to base body diameter ratio of
$[l/D]=1$ creates a familiar unsteady flowfield called 'pulsation.' Pressure
loading and fluctuation intensity at two different $Re_D$ cases are calculated.
A maximum drop of 98.24\% is observed in both parameters between the high and
low ReD cases. Based on the analysis, a difference in the pulsation
characteristics are noticed, which arise from two vortical zones, each from a
system of two `$\lambda$' shocks formed during the `collapse' phase ahead of
the base body. The interaction of shedding vortices from the $\lambda$-shocks'
triple-points, along with the rotating stationary waves, contributes to the
asymmetric high-pressure loading and the observation of shock pulsation on the
flat-face cylinder. The vortical interactions form the second dominant spatial
mode with a temporal mode carrying a dimensionless frequency ($f_2D/u_\infty
\approx 0.34$) almost twice that of the fundamental frequency ($f_1D/u_\infty
\approx 0.17$). The observed frequencies are invariant irrespective of the ReD
cases. However, for the high-frequency range, the spectral pressure decay is
observed to follow an inverse and -7/3 law for the low and high $Re_D$ cases,

ejection (CME), reports on stellar CMEs are rare, despite the frequent
detection of stellar 'super flares'. The torus instability of magnetic flux
ropes is believed to be one of the main driving mechanisms of solar CMEs.
Suppression of the torus instability, due to a confining background coronal
magnetic field that decreases sufficiently slowly with height, may contribute
to the lack of stellar CME detection. Here we use the solar magnetic field as a
template to estimate the vertical extent of this 'torus-stable zone' (TSZ)
above a stellar active region. For an idealised potential field model
comprising the fields of a local bipole (mimicking a pair of starspots) and a
global dipole, we show that the upper bound of the TSZ increases with the
bipole size, the dipole strength, and the source surface radius where the
coronal field becomes radial. The boundaries of the TSZ depend on the interplay
between the spots' and the dipole's magnetic fields, which provide the local-
and global-scale confinement, respectively. They range from about half the
bipole size to a significant fraction of the stellar radius. For smaller spots
and an intermediate dipole field, a secondary TSZ arises at a higher altitude,
which may increase the likelihood of 'failed eruptions'. Our results suggest
that the low apparent CME occurrence rate on cool stars is, at least partially,
due to the presence of extended TSZs.

far--reaching implications. Such energy extraction could occur even for
isolated black holes, if hypothetical ultralight bosonic particles exist in
Nature, leading to a new equilibrium state $-$ a black hole with synchronised
bosonic hair $-$ whose lifetime could exceed the age of the Universe. A natural
question is then: for an isolated black hole and at maximal efficiency, how
large is the energy fraction $\epsilon$ that can be extracted from a Kerr black
hole by the superradiant growth of the dominant mode? In other words, how hairy
can the resulting black hole become? A thermodynamical bound for the total
superradiance efficiency, $\epsilon\lesssim 0.29$ (as a fraction of the initial
black hole mass), has long been known, from the area law. However, numerical
simulations exhibiting the growth of the dominant mode only reached about one
third of this value. We show that if the development of superradiant
instabilities is approximately conservative (as suggest by the numerical
evolutions), this efficiency is limited to $\epsilon\lesssim 0.10$, regardless
of the spin of the bosonic field. This is in agreement with the maximum energy
extraction obtained in numerical simulations for a vector field and predicts
the result of similar simulations with a scalar field, yet to be performed.

dynamical symmetric tensor gauge field and arrive at scalar charge gauge
theories in both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism. We compute the
dispersion relation of the modes of this gauge theory, and we point out an
analogy with partially massless gravitons. It is then shown that these
fractonic theories couple to Aristotelian geometry, which is a non-Lorentzian
geometry characterised by the absence of boost symmetries. We generalise
previous results by coupling fracton theories to curved space and time. We
demonstrate that complex scalar theories with dipole symmetry can be coupled to
general Aristotelian geometries as long as the symmetric tensor gauge field
remains a background field. The coupling of the scalar charge gauge theory
requires a Lagrange multiplier that restricts the Aristotelian geometries.

individual galaxies and in the stacked galaxy samples. We did not identify an
individual X-ray source that was undoubtedly associated with a high-redshift
galaxy. We stack the signal from all galaxies and do not find a statistically
significant detection. We split our sample based on stellar mass,
star-formation rate, and lensing magnification and stack these sub-samples. We
obtain a $2.2\sigma$ detection for massive galaxies with an X-ray luminosity of

$(3.0\pm1.3)\times10^5 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ BH accreting at its Eddington rate.

These limits imply that the bulk of BHs at $z\gtrsim6$ either accrete at a few

Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line encodes abundant physical information about the
gaseous medium it interacts with. Nevertheless, the resonant nature of
Ly$\alpha$ complicates the radiative transfer (RT) modeling of the line
profile, making the extraction of physical properties of the surrounding
gaseous medium notoriously difficult. In this paper, we revisit the problem of
deciphering the Ly$\alpha$ emission line with RT modeling. We reveal intrinsic
parameter degeneracies in the widely-used shell model in the optically thick
regime for both static and outflowing cases, which suggest the limitations of
the model. We have also explored the connection between the more physically
realistic multiphase, clumpy model and the shell model. We find that the
parameters of a ``very clumpy'' slab model and the shell model have the
following correspondences: (1) the total column density of the clumpy slab
model is equal to the HI column density of the shell model; (2) the effective
temperature of the clumpy slab model, which incorporates the clump velocity
dispersion, is equal to the effective temperature of the shell model; (3) the
average radial clump outflow velocity is equal to the shell expansion velocity;
(4) large intrinsic line widths are required in the shell model to reproduce
the wings of the clumpy slab models; (5) adding another phase of hot
inter-clump medium will increase peak separation, and the fitted shell
expansion velocity lies between the outflow velocities of two phases of gas.
Our results provide a viable solution to the major discrepancies associated
with Ly$\alpha$ fitting reported in previous literature, and emphasize the
importance of utilizing information from additional observations to break the
intrinsic degeneracies as well as interpreting the model parameters in a more

support an internal mathematical language which closely resembles the usual
formal language of mathematics, but is ""local on the base scheme"": For example,
from the internal perspective, the structure sheaf looks like an ordinary local
ring (instead of a sheaf of rings with local stalks) and vector bundles look
like ordinary free modules (instead of sheaves of modules satisfying a local
triviality condition). The translation of internal statements and proofs is
facilitated by an easy mechanical procedure.
  We investigate how the internal language of the little Zariski topos can be
exploited to give simpler definitions and more conceptual proofs of the basic
notions and observations in algebraic geometry. To this end, we build a
dictionary relating internal and external notions and demonstrate its utility
by giving a simple proof of Grothendieck's generic freeness lemma in full
generality. We also employ this framework to state a general transfer principle
which relates modules with their induced quasicoherent sheaves, to study the
phenomenon that some properties spread from points to open neighborhoods, and
to compare general notions of spectra.
  We employ the big Zariski topos to set up the foundations of a synthetic
account of scheme theory. This account is similar to the synthetic account of
differential geometry, but has a distinct algebraic flavor. Central to the
theory is the notion of synthetic quasicoherence, which has no analogue in
synthetic differential geometry. We also discuss how various common subtoposes
of the big Zariski topos can be described from the internal point of view and
derive explicit descriptions of the geometric theories which are classified by
the fppf and by the surjective topology.

triggered by tidal resonance of a neutron star (NS) during binary inspiral.
They are strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength at the surface of
the NS. By modelling these flares as being the result of multiple colliding
relativistic shells launched during the resonance window, we find that the
prompt non-thermal gamma-ray emission may have luminosity up to a few
$\times10^{48}\text{ erg/s}$, and that a broad-band afterglow could be
produced. We compute the expected rates of detectable RSFs using the BPASS
population synthesis code, with different assumptions about the evolution of
surface magnetic field strengths before merger. We find the rate of detectable
RSFs to be $\sim 0.0001-5$ per year for BHNS mergers and $\sim 0.0005-25$ per
year for NSNS mergers, with the lower bound corresponding to surface-field
decay consistent with magneto-thermal evolution in purely crustal fields, while
the upper bounds are for systems which have longer-lived surface magnetic
fields supported by flux frozen into the superconducting core. If some of the
observed SGRB precursor flares are indeed RSFs, this suggests the presence of a
longer-lived surface field for some fraction of the neutron star population,
and that we could expect RSFs to be the most common detectable EM counterpart
to GW detections of BHNS mergers. The non-detection of a RSF prior to
GRB170817A provides an upper bound on the magnetic fields of the progenitor NSs
of $B_{\rm surf}\sim 10^{13.5} \text{ G}$.

challenging. It goes without saying that although scenario-specific driving
policies for autonomous driving are promising and can improve transportation
safety and efficiency, they are clearly not a universal scalable solution.
Instead, we seek decision-making schemes and driving policies that can
generalize to novel and unseen environments. In this work, we capitalize on the
key idea that human drivers learn abstract representations of their
surroundings that are fairly similar among various driving scenarios and
environments. Through these representations, human drivers are able to quickly
adapt to novel environments and drive in unseen conditions. Formally, through
imposing an information bottleneck, we extract a latent representation that
minimizes the \textit{distance} -- a quantification that we introduce to gauge
the similarity among different driving configurations -- between driving
scenarios. This latent space is then employed as the input to a Q-learning

Indeed, plasmoids formed through magnetic reconnection may play a key role in
$\gamma$-ray, X-ray and near-infrared flares from the black hole at the center
of our galaxy, SgrA*. We report the results of three-dimensional
general-relativistic ideal and resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations
modelling magnetic reconnection in accretion flows around astrophysical black
holes. As an important difference with similar works, our accretion discs have
an initial dipolar magnetic-field configuration with loops of alternating
polarity. We show that current sheets are formed and destroyed rapidly in the
turbulent environment of black-hole accretion. Plasmoids are formed from
current sheets close to the event horizon, in a region of $\sim2-15$
gravitational radii. We further quantify the magnetic dissipation and the
process of energy transfer to the plasmoids, reporting the reconnection rate,
the relative current density with respect to the local magnetic field, and the
size of the plasmoids. We find that plasmoids gain energy through reconnection
and heat up to relativistic temperatures, with the largest ones being
sufficiently energetic to leave the black hole near the polar regions. During
their evolution, plasmoids are stretched and elongated, becoming disrupted when
the shear is sufficiently large, although some plasmoids survive as
well-distinguished structures at distances of $\sim30-40$ gravitational radii
from the black hole. Finally, we find that in some cases the plasmoids acquire

the BPA is its significantly lower computational time, which was measured to be
at least 95% faster than NUTS in analyzing single parameter models. The BPA was
also applied to a multi-parameter Cauchy model using real data of the height

Additionally, the posterior median for the logarithm of the scale parameter

Suppose we have a set of $n$
voters and $m$ candidates that lie in a metric space. The goal is to design a
mechanism to choose a candidate whose average distance to the voters is as
small as possible. However, the mechanism does not get direct access to the
metric space. Instead, it gets each voter's ordinal ranking of the candidates
by distance. Given only this partial information, what is the smallest
worst-case approximation ratio (known as the distortion) that a mechanism can
guarantee?
  A simple example shows that no deterministic mechanism can guarantee
distortion better than $3$, and no randomized mechanism can guarantee
distortion better than $2$. It has been conjectured that both of these lower
bounds are optimal, and recently, Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah proved this
conjecture for deterministic mechanisms. We disprove the conjecture for
randomized mechanisms for $m \geq 3$ by constructing elections for which no
randomized mechanism can guarantee distortion better than $2.0261$ for $m = 3$,
$2.0496$ for $m = 4$, up to $2.1126$ as $m \to \infty$. We obtain our lower
bounds by identifying a class of simple metrics that appear to capture much of
the hardness of the problem, and we show that any randomized mechanism must
have high distortion on one of these metrics. We provide a nearly matching
upper bound for this restricted class of metrics as well. Finally, we
conjecture that these bounds give the optimal distortion for every $m$, and
provide a proof for $m = 3$, thereby resolving that case.

more unique motifs. Finally, we argue that ternary hydride phases, which are

superconductivity at high temperatures and stability at low pressures. Several

and distributed systems, whereby developers write the communications that
should be enacted and then a distributed implementation is automatically
obtained by means of a compiler. Theories of choreographic programming
typically come with strong theoretical guarantees about the compilation
process, most notably: the generated implementations operationally correspond
to their source choreographies and are deadlock-free.
  Currently, the most advanced incarnation of the paradigm is Choral, an
object-oriented choreographic programming language that targets Java. Choral
deviated significantly from known theories of choreographies, and introduced
the possibility of expressing higher-order choreographies (choreographies
parameterised over choreographies) that are fully distributed. As a
consequence, it is unclear if the usual guarantees of choreographies can still
hold in the more general setting of higher-order ones.
  We introduce Chor{\lambda}, the first functional choreographic programming
language: it introduces a new formulation of the standard communication
primitive found in choreographies as a function, and it is based upon the
{\lambda}-calculus. Chor{\lambda} is the first theory that explains the core
ideas of higher-order choreographic programming (as in Choral). Bridging the
gap between practice and theory requires developing a new evaluation strategy
and typing discipline for {\lambda} terms that accounts for the distributed
nature of computation in choreographies. We illustrate the expressivity of
Chor{\lambda} with a series of examples, which include reconstructions of the
key examples from the original presentation of Choral. Our theory supports the
expected properties of choreographic programming and bridges the gap between
the communities of functional and choreographic programming.

Machine Learning (ML) model attempting to infer sensitive information about its

the trained model under attack (MUA) is usually frozen and used to guide the
training of a generator, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to
reconstruct the distribution of the original training data of that model. This
might cause leakage of original training samples, and if successful, the
privacy of dataset subjects will be at risk if the training data contains
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, an in-depth investigation
of the potentials of MI techniques is crucial for the development of
corresponding defense techniques. High-quality reconstruction of training data
based on a single model is challenging. However, existing MI literature does
not explore targeting multiple models jointly, which may provide additional
information and diverse perspectives to the adversary.
  We propose the ensemble inversion technique that estimates the distribution
of original training data by training a generator constrained by an ensemble
(or set) of trained models with shared subjects or entities. This technique
leads to noticeable improvements of the quality of the generated samples with
distinguishable features of the dataset entities compared to MI of a single ML
model. We achieve high quality results without any dataset and show how
utilizing an auxiliary dataset that's similar to the presumed training data
improves the results. The impact of model diversity in the ensemble is
thoroughly investigated and additional constraints are utilized to encourage
sharp predictions and high activations for the reconstructed samples, leading
to more accurate reconstruction of training images.

natural disasters such as hurricanes. They are well-suited for providing
information for damage estimation and localization (DEL); i.e., characterizing
the type and spatial extent of damage following a disaster. Despite recent
advances in sensing and unmanned aerial systems technology, much of
post-disaster aerial imagery is still taken by handheld DSLR cameras from
small, manned, fixed-wing aircraft. However, these handheld cameras lack IMU
information, and images are taken opportunistically post-event by operators. As
such, DEL from such imagery is still a highly manual and time-consuming
process. We propose an approach to both detect damage in aerial images and
localize it in world coordinates, with specific focus on detecting and
localizing flooding. The approach is based on using structure from motion to
relate image coordinates to world coordinates via a projective transformation,
using class activation mapping to detect the extent of damage in an image, and
applying the projective transformation to localize damage in world coordinates.
We evaluate the performance of our approach on post-event data from the 2016
Louisiana floods, and find that our approach achieves a precision of 88%. Given
this high precision using limited data, we argue that this approach is
currently viable for fast and effective DEL from handheld aerial imagery for

approximation techniques for reducing kinetic equations to fluid equations that
are valid beyond thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we study a particular
five-moment variant of QMOM known as HyQMOM and establish that this system is
moment-invertible over a convex region in solution space. We then develop a
high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for solving the resulting fluid
system. The scheme is based on a predictor-corrector approach, where the
prediction is a localized space-time DG scheme. The nonlinear algebraic system
in this prediction is solved using a Picard iteration. The correction is a
straightforward explicit update based on the time-integral of the evolution
equation, where the space-time prediction replaces all instances of the exact
solution. In the absence of limiters, the high-order scheme does not guarantee
that solutions remain in the convex set over which HyQMOM is moment-realizable.
To overcome this, we introduce novel limiters that rigorously guarantee that
the computed solution does not leave the convex set of realizable solutions,
thus guaranteeing the hyperbolicity of the system. We develop
positivity-preserving limiters in both the prediction and correction steps and
an oscillation limiter that damps unphysical oscillations near shocks. We also
develop a novel extension of this scheme to include a BGK collision operator;
the proposed method is shown to be asymptotic-preserving in the high-collision
limit. The HyQMOM and the HyQMOM-BGK solvers are verified on several test
cases, demonstrating high-order accuracy on smooth problems and shock-capturing
capability on problems with shocks. The asymptotic-preserving property of the

Meanwhile, the gene expression data involved in such analysis are in extremely

successfully identifies multiple functional modules of genes that exhibit
different co-expression patterns. The findings reveal new insights about
Glioblastoma's evolving mechanism. The validity of our approach is also
justified by a theoretical analysis, showing that the compressed spectral

strain on health systems worldwide. Effective vaccines have been developed for
the SARS-CoV-2 virus and administered to billions of people; however, the virus
continues to circulate and evolve into new variants for which vaccines may
ultimately be less effective. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social
distancing, wearing face coverings, and contact tracing, remain important
tools, especially at the onset of an outbreak. In this paper, we assess the
effectiveness of contact tracing using a non-Markovian, network-based
mathematical model. To improve the reliability of the novel model, empirically
determined distributions were incorporated for the transition time of model
state pairs, such as from exposed to infected states. The first-order closure
approximation was used to derive an expression for the epidemic threshold,
which is dependent on the number of close contacts. Using survey contact data
collected during the 2020 fall academic semester from a university population,
we determined that even four to five contacts are sufficient to maintain viral
transmission. Additionally, our model reveals that contact tracing can be an
effective outbreak mitigation measure by reducing the epidemic size by more
than three-fold. Increasing the reliability of epidemic models is critical for
accurate public health planning and use as decision support tools. Moving
toward more accurate non-Markovian models built upon empirical data is

maximize the total expected profits from dividends until bankruptcy. The
company's optimal dividend payout is therefore influenced by four factors
simultaneously: Brownian fluctuations in the cash surplus, as well as regime
changes in drift, volatility and bankruptcy levels. In particular, the average
profitability can assume different signs in the two regimes. We find a rich
structure of the optimal strategy, which, depending on the interaction of the
model's parameters, can be either of barrier-type or of liquidation-barrier

undirected graphs subject to batched vertex failures. Precisely, given any
graph G and integer k, we can in fixed-parameter time construct a data
structure that can later be used to answer queries of the form: ``are vertices
s and t connected via a path that avoids vertices $u_1,..., u_k$?'' in time
$2^{2^{O(k)}}$. In the terminology of the literature on data structures, this
gives the first deterministic data structure for connectivity under vertex
failures where for every fixed number of failures, all operations can be
performed in constant time.
  With the aim to understand the power and the limitations of our new
techniques, we prove an algorithmic meta theorem for the recently introduced
separator logic, which extends first-order logic with atoms for connectivity
under vertex failures. We prove that the model-checking problem for separator
logic is fixed-parameter tractable on every class of graphs that exclude a
fixed topological minor. We also show a weak converse. This implies that from
the point of view of parameterized complexity, under standard complexity
assumptions, the frontier of tractability of separator logic is almost exactly
delimited by classes excluding a fixed topological minor.
  The backbone of our proof relies on a decomposition theorem of Cygan et al.
[SICOMP '19], which provides a tree decomposition of a given graph into bags
that are unbreakable. Crucially, unbreakability allows to reduce separator
logic to plain first-order logic within each bag individually. We design our
model-checking algorithm using dynamic programming over the tree decomposition,
where the transition at each bag amounts to running a suitable model-checking
subprocedure for plain first-order logic. This approach is robust enough to
provide also efficient enumeration of queries expressed in separator logic.

transition frequency an avoided crossing may be observed, which is often
regarded as a signature of strong coupling between plasmons and molecules. Such
strong coupling is expected to be realized when $2|U|/{\hbar\Gamma}>1$, where
$U$ and ${\Gamma}$ are the molecule-plasmon coupling and the spectral width of
the optical transition respectively. Because both $U$ and ${\Gamma}$ strongly
increase with decreasing distance between a molecule and a plasmonic structure
it is not obvious that this condition can be satisfied for any molecule-metal
surface distance. In this work we investigate the behavior of $U$ and
${\Gamma}$ for several geometries. Surprisingly, we find that if the only
contributions to ${\Gamma}$ are lifetime broadenings associated with the
radiative and nonradiative relaxation of a single molecular vibronic
transition, including effects on molecular radiative and nonradiative lifetimes
induced by the metal, the criterion $2|U|/{\hbar\Gamma}>1$ is easily satisfied
by many configurations irrespective of the metal-molecule distance. This
implies that the Rabi splitting can be observed in such structures if other
sources of broadening are suppressed. Additionally, when the molecule-metal
surface distance is varied keeping all other molecular and metal parameters
constant, this behavior is mitigated due to the spectral shift associated with
the same molecule-plasmon interaction, making the observation of Rabi splitting
more challenging.

popular algorithms in Federated Learning (FL). Despite its simplicity and
popularity, the convergence rate of FedAvg has thus far been undetermined. Even
under the simplest assumptions (convex, smooth, homogeneous, and bounded
covariance), the best-known upper and lower bounds do not match, and it is not
clear whether the existing analysis captures the capacity of the algorithm. In
this work, we first resolve this question by providing a lower bound for FedAvg
that matches the existing upper bound, which shows the existing FedAvg upper
bound analysis is not improvable. Additionally, we establish a lower bound in a
heterogeneous setting that nearly matches the existing upper bound. While our
lower bounds show the limitations of FedAvg, under an additional assumption of
third-order smoothness, we prove more optimistic state-of-the-art convergence
results in both convex and non-convex settings. Our analysis stems from a
notion we call iterate bias, which is defined by the deviation of the
expectation of the SGD trajectory from the noiseless gradient descent
trajectory with the same initialization. We prove novel sharp bounds on this
quantity, and show intuitively how to analyze this quantity from a Stochastic

sub-optimal, or wrong, even in the absence of additional information. How is
this possible? We present an algorithmic theory of metacognition based on a
well-understood trade-off in reinforcement learning (RL) between value-based RL
and policy-based RL. To the cognitive (neuro)science community, our theory
answers the outstanding question of why information can be used for error
detection but not for action selection. To the machine learning community, our
proposed theory creates a novel interaction between the Actor and Critic in
Actor-Critic agents and notes a novel connection between RL and Bayesian
Optimization. We call our proposed agent the Metacognitive Actor Critic (MAC).
We conclude with showing how to create metacognition in machines by
implementing a deep MAC and showing that it can detect (some of) its own
suboptimal actions without external information or delay.

with a doughnut-shaped optical vortex pump beam and a traveling wave Stokes
laser beam with a constant (top-hat) intensity profile in space. The beams are
sent in a counter-intuitive temporal sequence, in which the Stokes pulse
precedes the pump pulse. The atoms interacting with both the traveling wave and

such as connected vehicles to collaboratively estimate object locations from
multiple perspectives with reliant cooperation. To enable collaborative
localization, four key challenges must be addressed, including modeling complex
relationships between observed objects, fusing observations from an arbitrary
number of collaborating robots, quantifying localization uncertainty, and
addressing latency of robot communications. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal graph learning and
model-based state estimation for a team of robots to collaboratively localize

model that learns spatiotemporal graphs to represent historical motions of the
objects observed by each robot over time and provides uncertainties in object
localization. Moreover, we propose a novel method for integrated learning and
model-based state estimation, which fuses asynchronous observations obtained
from an arbitrary number of robots for collaborative localization. We evaluate
our approach in two collaborative object localization scenarios in simulations

previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on asynchronous

model specification. Asymptotic properties of the distribution estimator are
derived. The numerical performances of the parametric estimator and the
nonparametric estimator are compared in this study. A simulation experiment
demonstrates the obtained asymptotic convergence rates and clarifies the
influence of misspecification in the context of probability distribution
estimation.
  This study assumes that the underlying distribution of the original sample
belongs to one of the Hall class, the Weibull class and the bounded class,
whose types of the limiting distributions are all different: the Frechet,
Gumbel and Weibull. It is proven that the convergence rate of the parametric
fitting estimator depends on both the tail index and the second-order parameter
and gets slow as the tail index tends to zero. The simulation results are
generally consistent with the obtained convergence rates. Finally, we report
two real case studies: the Potomac River peak stream flow (cfs) data and the
Danish Fire Insurance data.

determining the container shape that maximizes the fundamental sloshing
frequency among two classes of shallow containers: symmetric canals with a
given free surface width and cross-sectional area, and radially symmetric
containers with a given rim radius and volume [doi:10.1002/cpa.3160180124].
Here, we extend these results in two ways: (i) we consider surface tension
effects on the fluid free surface, assuming a flat equilibrium free surface
together with a pinned contact line, and (ii) we consider sinusoidal waves
traveling along the canal with wavenumber $\alpha\ge 0$ and spatial period
$2\pi/\alpha$; two-dimensional sloshing corresponds to the case $\alpha = 0$.
Generalizing our recent variational characterization of fluid sloshing with
surface tension to the case of a pinned contact line, we derive the pinned-edge
linear shallow sloshing problem, which is an eigenvalue problem for a
generalized Sturm-Liouville system. In the case without surface tension, we
show that the optimal shallow canal is a rectangular canal for any $\alpha >
0$. In the presence of surface tension, we solve for the maximizing
cross-section explicitly for shallow canals with any given $\alpha\ge 0$ and
shallow radially symmetric containers with $m$ azimuthal nodal lines, $m = 0,
1$. Our results reveal that the squared maximal sloshing frequency increases
considerably as surface tension increases. Interestingly, both the optimal
shallow canal for $\alpha = 0$ and the optimal shallow radially symmetric
container are not convex. As a consequence of our explicit solutions, we
establish convergence of the maximizing cross-sections, as surface tension
vanishes, to the maximizing cross-sections without surface tension.

the successful closed-loop operation of mission-critical industrial
Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications. To meet the ever-increasing demands on
better wireless communications for IIoT, we propose an orthogonal
time-frequency space (OTFS) waveform-based joint communication and radio
sensing (JCAS) scheme -- an energy-efficient solution for not only reliable
communications but also high-accuracy sensing. OTFS has been demonstrated to
have higher reliability and energy efficiency than the currently popular IIoT
communication waveforms. JCAS has also been highly recommended for IIoT, since
it saves cost, power and spectrum compared to having two separate radio
frequency systems. Performing JCAS based on OTFS, however, can be hindered by a
lack of effective OTFS sensing. This paper is dedicated to filling this
technology gap. We first design a series of echo pre-processing methods that
successfully remove the impact of communication data symbols in the
time-frequency domain, where major challenges, like inter-carrier and
inter-symbol interference and noise amplification, are addressed. Then, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) for sensing and optimize a key parameter of the proposed method to
maximize the SINR. Extensive simulations show that the proposed sensing method
approaches the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the estimation
accuracy of target parameters and manifests applicability to wide ranges of key
system parameters. Notably, the complexity of the proposed method is only
dominated by a two-dimensional Fourier transform.

$o(T)$ and unknown to the controller. Under the assumption that a sequence of
stabilizing, but potentially sub-optimal controllers is available for all $t$,
we present an algorithm that achieves the optimal dynamic regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(V_T^{2/5}T^{3/5}\right)$. With piece-wise constant
dynamics, our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{ST})$ where $S$ is the number of switches. The crux
of our algorithm is an adaptive non-stationarity detection strategy, which
builds on an approach recently developed for contextual Multi-armed Bandit
problems. We also argue that non-adaptive forgetting (e.g., restarting or using
sliding window learning with a static window size) may not be regret optimal
for the LQR problem, even when the window size is optimally tuned with the
knowledge of $V_T$. The main technical challenge in the analysis of our
algorithm is to prove that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has a
small bias when the parameter to be estimated is non-stationary. Our analysis
also highlights that the key motif driving the regret is that the LQR problem
is in spirit a bandit problem with linear feedback and locally quadratic cost.
This motif is more universal than the LQR problem itself, and therefore we
believe our results should find wider application.

GeV, the GeV emission is resolved into two sources: one is spatially consistent
with the position of the SNR with a size comparable to that of the radio
emission, and the other is located outside of the western boundary of the SNR
and spatially coincident with the densest region of the surrounding molecular

cosmic rays (CRs) which have escaped the SNR and illuminated the surrounding

explicitly. These solutions exist for constant and non-constant Higgs profile
and, depending on the length of the cylinder, finite density transitions occur.
In the case in which the Higgs profile is not constant, the full system of
coupled field equations reduce to the Lam\'e equation for the gauge field (the
Higgs field being an elliptic function). For large values of this length, the
energetically favored configuration is the one with a constant Higgs profile,

Existing IQA works for MRI give only a general quality score, agnostic to the

quality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore,
the same score may have different implications for different scans. We propose
a framework with multi-task CNN model trained with calibrated labels and

well-defined and efficient labeling task. Image rulers address varying quality
standards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN.
The model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI:

of microbiological images of Petri dishes that can be used to train deep
learning models in a fully supervised fashion. The developed generator employs
traditional computer vision algorithms together with a neural style transfer
method for data augmentation. We show that the method is able to synthesize a
dataset of realistic looking images that can be used to train a neural network
model capable of localising, segmenting, and classifying five different
microbial species. Our method requires significantly fewer resources to obtain
a useful dataset than collecting and labeling a whole large set of real images
with annotations. We show that starting with only 100 real images, we can
generate data to train a detector that achieves comparable results (detection
mAP = 0.416, and counting MAE = 4.49) to the same detector but trained on a
real, several dozen times bigger dataset (mAP = 0.520, MAE = 4.31), containing
over 7k images. We prove the usefulness of the method in microbe detection and
segmentation, but we expect that it is general and flexible and can also be
applicable in other domains of science and industry to detect various objects.

  Equations",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose physics-informed neural operators (PINO) that uses
available data and/or physics constraints to learn the solution operator of a
family of parametric Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This hybrid approach
allows PINO to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven and physics-based
methods. For instance, data-driven methods fail to learn when data is of
limited quantity and/or quality, and physics-based approaches fail to optimize
on challenging PDE constraints. By combining both data and PDE constraints,
PINO overcomes all these challenges. Additionally, a unique property that PINO
enjoys over other hybrid learning methods is its ability to incorporate data
and PDE constraints at different resolutions. This allows us to combine
coarse-resolution data, which is inexpensive to obtain from numerical solvers,
with higher resolution PDE constraints, and the resulting PINO has no
degradation in accuracy even on high-resolution test instances. This
discretization-invariance property in PINO is due to neural-operator framework
which learns mappings between function spaces and allows evaluation at
different resolutions without the need for re-training. Moreover, PINO succeeds
in the purely physics setting, where no data is available, while other
approaches such as the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fail due to
optimization challenges, e.g. in multi-scale dynamic systems such as Kolmogorov
flows. This is because PINO learns the solution operator by optimizing PDE
constraints on multiple instances while PINN optimizes PDE constraints of a
single PDE instance. Further, in PINO, we incorporate the Fourier neural
operator (FNO) architecture which achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over
numerical solvers and also allows us to compute explicit gradients on function
spaces efficiently.

of information. Spintronics has come a long way and spin modulation can be
realized by quantum interference and spin-orbit coupling effect. However, the
control of valley degree of freedom using quantum interference is still a
problem to be explored. Here we discover a mechanism of producing valley
polarization in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides nanoribbon with
attached stubs, in which valley-resolved Fano resonance are formed due to the
quantum interference of intervalley backscattering. When the quantum
interference occurs between the localized states at the edge of the stubs and
the continuous channels in the nanoribbon, the transmission dips of Fano effect
is valley-polarized. As the number of stubs increases, the valley-polarized
transmission dips will split and valley-resolved minigaps are formed by Fano
resonance with intervalley backscattering in stub superlattice. When the
electron incident energy is in these valley-resolved gaps of the superlattice,
even with several stubs, the transmission can have a significant valley
polarization. Our finding points to an opportunity to realize valley

however, the developmental and mechanistic foundations of collective behavior
have not been formally established. What learning mechanisms drive the
development of collective behavior in newborn animals? Here, we used deep
reinforcement learning and curiosity-driven learning -- two learning mechanisms
deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific research -- to build newborn
artificial agents that develop collective behavior. Like newborn animals, our
agents learn collective behavior from raw sensory inputs in naturalistic
environments. Our agents also learn collective behavior without external
rewards, using only intrinsic motivation (curiosity) to drive learning.
Specifically, when we raise our artificial agents in natural visual
environments with groupmates, the agents spontaneously develop ego-motion,
object recognition, and a preference for groupmates, rapidly learning all of
the core skills required for collective behavior. This work bridges the divide
between high-dimensional sensory inputs and collective action, resulting in a
pixels-to-actions model of collective animal behavior. More generally, we show
that two generic learning mechanisms -- deep reinforcement learning and
curiosity-driven learning -- are sufficient to learn collective behavior from
unsupervised natural experience.

this paper, we present a form of ""Neural BRDF algebra"", and focus on both

Spatial variation is straightforward to achieve by using textures of latent

numerically that by creating carefully chosen hydrophobic slip patterns on the

folding and twisting of fluid volumes, i.e., via a horse-shoe type
transformation map, or 2) by creating chaotic advection, through manipulation
of the hydrophobic boundary patterns on the floor of the channels. We have also
shown that by superposing stretching and folding with chaotic advection, mixing
can be optimized by significantly reducing mixing length, thereby opening up

BH and a neutron star (NS) or a binary NS (BNS). In the case of a high mass
accretion rate, the hyperaccretion disk is in a state of neutrino-dominated
accretion flow (NDAF) and emits numerous anisotropic MeV neutrinos. Only a
small fraction of these neutrinos annihilates in the space outside of the disk
and then launch ultrarelativistic jets that break away from the merger ejecta
to power gamma-ray bursts. Mergers and their remnants are generally considered
sources of gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and kilonovae. Anisotropic
neutrino emission and anisotropic high-velocity material outflows from central
BH-NDAF systems can also trigger strong GWs and luminous disk-outflow-driven
(DOD) kilonovae, respectively. In this paper, the anisotropic multimessenger
signals from NDAFs with outflows, including DOD kilonovae, MeV neutrinos, and
GWs, are presented. As the results, the typical AB magnitude of the DOD
kilonovae is lower than that of AT 2017gfo at the same distance, and it
decreases with increasing viewing angles and its anisotropy is not sensitive to
the outflow mass distribution but mainly determined by the velocity
distribution. Since neutrinos with $\gtrsim 10~\rm MeV$ are mainly produced in
the inner region of the disk, they will be dramatically deflected to a large
viewing angle by relativity effects. Moreover, the strains of GWs induced by
anisotropic neutrinos increase with increasing viewing angles. The accumulation
of multimessenger detection of the BH-NS/BNS mergers with different viewing
angles might further verify the existence of NDAFs with outflows.

  Vehicles: A Data-driven Approach",,,,,"cs.RO cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, road safety has attracted significant attention from
researchers and practitioners in the intelligent transport systems domain. As
one of the most common and vulnerable groups of road users, pedestrians cause
great concerns due to their unpredictable behavior and movement, as subtle
misunderstandings in vehicle-pedestrian interaction can easily lead to risky
situations or collisions. Existing methods use either predefined
collision-based models or human-labeling approaches to estimate the
pedestrians' risks. These approaches are usually limited by their poor
generalization ability and lack of consideration of interactions between the
ego vehicle and a pedestrian. This work tackles the listed problems by
proposing a Pedestrian Risk Level Prediction system. The system consists of
three modules. Firstly, vehicle-perspective pedestrian data are collected.
Since the data contains information regarding the movement of both the ego
vehicle and pedestrian, it can simplify the prediction of spatiotemporal
features in an interaction-aware fashion. Using the long short-term memory
model, the pedestrian trajectory prediction module predicts their
spatiotemporal features in the subsequent five frames. As the predicted
trajectory follows certain interaction and risk patterns, a hybrid clustering
and classification method is adopted to explore the risk patterns in the
spatiotemporal features and train a risk level classifier using the learned
patterns. Upon predicting the spatiotemporal features of pedestrians and
identifying the corresponding risk level, the risk patterns between the ego
vehicle and pedestrians are determined. Experimental results verified the
capability of the PRLP system to predict the risk level of pedestrians, thus
supporting the collision risk assessment of intelligent vehicles and providing
safety warnings to both vehicles and pedestrians.

high sensitivity of the electronic band structure to external stimulus such as

are Weyl nodes at the Fermi level EF. A prerequisite for the existence of Weyl
nodes is to either have inversion or time reversal symmetry broken. Weyl nodes
in systems with broken time reversal symmetry are ideal to realize the
tunability of the electronic band structure by magnetic field. Theoretically,
it has been shown that in ferromagnetic Weyl materials, the band structure is
dependent upon the magnetization direction and thus the electronic bands can be
tuned by controlling the magnetization direction. Here, we demonstrate tuning
of the band structure in a kagome Weyl ferromagnetic metal Fe3Sn2 with

changes in the band structure depending on the magnetization direction that

couplings, allow for highly interesting features such as isocurvature,
non-Gaussianity, and preheating. In this paper, we study two-field inflation in
the context of purely affine gravity, where the metrical structure results from
the dynamics of the spacetime affine connection. We introduce a covariant
formulation in the new framework and show that it leads to a curved field space
which can produce conspicuous departure from the purely metric gravity. In the
case where the fields are canonical, the field manifold gains a conformally
flat shape. Interestingly, while the manifold is generally curved, it is
possible to be flattened by allowing specific non-canonical field kinetic
terms. This in turn simplifies the inflationary dynamics significantly while
allowing for new predictions due to the effects of the nonminimal coupling
function on the potential solely. We use this new feature in studying two-field
inflation driven by quartic potentials for given parameter constants. We
perform a numerical solution of the slow-roll dynamics and track the possible
non-Gaussianity. We focus on field parameters that allow for spectral indices
within the favored region of the Planck results. These are associated to tiny
tensor-to-scalar ratios, $r \sim 10^{-6}$ for single field and $r \sim 10^{-4}$

The multivariate generating functions for the dimer models satisfy the
recurrence relations similar to the one for Fibonacci numbers. We give closed
formulae for the generating functions. We show that, in the large size limit
with specializations of the formal variables, the generating functions exhibit
the summations appearing in generalized Rogers--Ramanujan identities. Further,
the generating functions of the dimer models have infinite product formulae for
general values of formal variables in the large size limit. These formulae are
generalizations of Rogers--Ramanujan identities for multi variables. We also
give other several specializations which exhibit simple combinatorial formulae.
The analysis of the correlation functions, which we call emptiness formation
probabilities and moments, leads to the application of the formal power series
associated to the Dyck, Motzkin and Schr\""oder paths to the generating
functions for the dimer models. We give descriptions of the generating
functions of finite size in terms of these combinatorial objects, Dyck and
Motzkin paths with statistics. We have three additional results. First, the
convoluted generating functions for Fibonacci, Catalan and Motzkin numbers are
shown to be expressed as generating functions of Fibonacci, Dyck and Motzkin
words with the weights given by binomial coefficients. The second one is a
weight preserving correspondence between a Motzkin path and a set of Dyck
paths. The third one is a connection of the generating functions for the dimer

check for the signature missing HCONs, and for association with IRAS Reject

  For a lower mass planet (< 5 earth masses) in the distance range 200-400 AU,
we expect a pair or triplet of single HCONs with separations 2-35 arcmin.
Several hundred candidate associations are found and have been examined with

requirements for detected and non-detected HCON passes. A fitted orbit suggest
a distance of 225+-15 AU and a mass of 3-5 earth masses. Dynamical simulations
are needed to explore whether the candidate is consistent with existing planet

which TPO branches form a ``figure-eight-like stack of isolas'' located
adjacent to the snaky structure of SPO. Herein, we adopted input resources as a
bifurcation parameter. A drift bifurcation from SPO to TPO was observed by
introducing another parameter at which these two solution sheets merged. In
contrast to the monotone tail case, a nonlocal interaction appeared in the
heterogeneous problem between the TPO and heterogeneity, which created
infinitely many saddle solutions and finitely many stable stationary solutions
distributed across the entire line. TPO displayed a variety of dynamics
including pinning and depinning processes along with penetration (PEN) and
rebound (REB). The stable/unstable manifolds of these saddles interacted with
the TPO in a complex manner, which created a subtle dependence on the initial
condition, and a difficulty to predict the behavior after collision. A
systematic global exploration of solution branches induced by heterogeneities
enabled us to find all the asymptotic states after collision to predict the
solution results without solving the PDEs. The reduction method of
finite-dimensional ODE system allowed us to clarify the detailed mechanism of
the transitions from PEN to pinning and pinning to REB based on a dynamical
system perspective. Consequently, the basin boundary between two distinct
outputs against the heterogeneities yielded an infinitely many successive
reconnection of heteroclinic orbits among those saddles, because the strength
of heterogeneity increased and caused the aforementioned subtle dependence of
initial condition.

pooling, our proposal takes into account the temporal structure of the input

introduce two approaches. First, we have developed a Bayesian estimation of the

token is trained to mimic the predictions from the teacher network, while the

called deep noise suppression (DNS). During training, DNS methods are typically
trained with mean squared error (MSE) type loss functions, which do not
guarantee good perceptual quality. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ) is a widely used metric for evaluating speech quality. However, the
original PESQ algorithm is non-differentiable, and therefore cannot directly be
used as optimization criterion for gradient-based learning. In this work, we
propose an end-to-end non-intrusive PESQNet DNN to estimate the PESQ scores of
the enhanced speech signal. Thus, by providing a reference-free perceptual
loss, it serves as a mediator towards the DNS training, allowing to maximize
the PESQ score of the enhanced speech signal. We illustrate the potential of
our proposed PESQNet-mediated training on the basis of an already strong
baseline DNS. As further novelty, we propose to train the DNS and the PESQNet
alternatingly to keep the PESQNet up-to-date and perform well specifically for
the DNS under training. Our proposed method is compared to the same DNS trained
with MSE-based loss for joint denoising and dereverberation, and the
Interspeech 2021 DNS Challenge baseline. Detailed analysis shows that the
PESQNet mediation can further increase the DNS performance by about 0.1 PESQ
points on synthetic test data and by 0.03 DNSMOS points on real test data,

creates a platform for comparing segmentation methods of the primary gross

the segmentation task, we proposed a new network based on an encoder-decoder

low-level and high-level semantics at full scales. Additionally, we used
Conditional Random Fields as a post-processing step to refine the predicted

conjunctive doctrines, concerning a class $\Lambda$ of morphisms of their base
category, to deepen the study of regular and exact completions of existential
elementary Lawvere's doctrines. After providing a characterization of
generalized existential completions, we observe that both the subobjects
doctrine $\mathrm{Sub}_{C}$ and the weak subobjects doctrine
$\Psi_{\mathcal{C}}$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ with finite limits are
generalized existential completions of the constant true doctrine, the first
along the class of all the monomorphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ while the latter
along all the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$. We then name full existential
completion a generalized completion of a conjunctive doctrine along the class
of all the morphisms of its base. From this we immediately deduce that both the
regular and the exact completion of a finite limit category are regular and
exact completions of full existential doctrines since it is known that both the
regular completion $(\mathcal{D})_{ reg / lex}$ and the exact completion
$(\mathcal{D})_{ex / lex}$ of a finite limit category $\mathcal{D}$ are
respectively the regular completion $\mathrm{Reg}(\Psi_{\mathcal{D}})$ and the
exact completion $\mathcal{T}_{\Psi_{\mathcal{D}}}$ (as an instance of the
tripos-to-topos construction) of the weak subobjects doctrine
$\Psi_{\mathcal{D}}$ of $\mathcal{D}$. Here we prove that the condition of
being a generic full existential completion is also sufficient to produce a
regular/exact completion equivalent to a regular/exact completion of a finite
limit category. Then, we show more specialized characterizations from which we
derive known results as well as remarkable examples of exact completions of

the relation between random elements in metric spaces. In this paper, we
present a novel index called metric distributional discrepancy (MDD) to measure
the dependence between a random element $X$ and a categorical variable $Y$,
which is applicable to the medical image and genetic data. The metric
distributional discrepancy statistics can be considered as the distance between
the conditional distribution of $X$ given each class of $Y$ and the
unconditional distribution of $X$. MDD enjoys some significant merits compared
to other dependence-measures. For instance, MDD is zero if and only if $X$ and
$Y$ are independent. MDD test is a distribution-free test since there is no
assumption on the distribution of random elements. Furthermore, MDD test is
robust to the data with heavy-tailed distribution and potential outliers. We
demonstrate the validity of our theory and the property of the MDD test by
several numerical experiments and real data analysis.

segmentation techniques is the DRIVE data set. Since DRIVE contains a
predefined split of training and test images, the published performance results
of the various segmentation techniques should provide a reliable ranking of the
algorithms. Including more than 100 papers in the study, we performed a
detailed numerical analysis of the coherence of the published performance

the field of view (FoV), which has a significant impact on the performance
scores. We attempted to eliminate the biases using numerical techniques to
provide a more realistic picture of the state of the art. Based on the results,
we have formulated several findings, most notably: despite the well-defined

non-comparable figures; in contrast to the near-perfect accuracy scores
reported in the literature, the highest accuracy score achieved to date is
0.9582 in the FoV region, which is 1% higher than that of human annotators. The

small tilt, the fermions are still localized and form a Mott-insulating state,

While the localized state is naively expected to be broken with a large tilt,
in fact, the fermions are still localized under a large tilt due to the
Wannier-Stark localization and it can be regarded as a localized spin system.
We find that the sign of the exchange coupling is changed and the ferromagnetic

perturbation theory and the real-time numerical simulation with the fermionic
Hubbard chain. Our simulation exhibits that it is possible to effectively
control the speed and time direction of the dynamics by changing the size of

nonlinear waves of wavenumber $k$ in a scalar field theory pseudodual to the

integrable. Here, we interpret the model as a novel 3D cylindrically symmetric
quartic oscillator with an additional rotational energy. The quantum theory has
two dimensionless parameters. Upon separating variables in the Schr\""odinger
equation, we find that the radial equation has a four-term recurrence relation.
It is of type $[0,1,1_6]$ and lies beyond the ellipsoidal Lam\'e and Heun
equations in Ince's classification. At strong coupling $\lambda$, the energies
of highly excited states are shown to depend on the scaling variable $\lambda
k$. The energy spectrum at weak coupling and its dependence on wavenumber $k$
in a double-scaling strong coupling limit are obtained. The semi-classical WKB
quantization condition is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. Numerical
inversion enables us to establish a $(\lambda k)^{2/3}$ dispersion relation for
highly energetic quantized 'screwons' at moderate and strong coupling. We also
suggest a mapping between our radial equation and one of Zinn-Justin and
Jentschura that could facilitate a resurgent WKB expansion for energy levels.
In another direction, we show that the equations of motion of the RR model can
also be viewed as Euler equations for a step-3 nilpotent Lie algebra. We use
our canonical quantization to uncover an infinite dimensional reducible unitary
representation of this nilpotent algebra, which is then decomposed using its
Casimir operators.

metric: the sum of proportional changes in local species abundances relative to
their global species abundances, with a correction for species close to
extinction. As we show, this metric quantifies changes in the mean long-term
global survival probability of species. It links mathematically to a widely
cited global biodiversity indicator, the Living Planet Index, for which we
propose an improved formula that directly addresses the known problem of
singularities caused by extinctions. We show that, in an ideal market, trade in
our metric would lead to near-optimal allocation of resources to species
conservation. We further show that the metric is closely related to several
other metrics and indices already in use. Barriers to adoption are therefore
low. Used in conjunction with metrics addressing ecosystem functioning and
services, potential areas of application include biodiversity related financial
disclosures and voluntary or legislated no net biodiversity loss policies.

from observation sets in presence of detection uncertainty, noise and clutter,
this paper develops a new trajectory probability hypothesis density (TPHD)
filter, which is referred to as the JTC-TPHD filter. The JTC-TPHD filter
classifies different targets based on their motion models and each target is
assigned with multiple class hypotheses. By using this strategy, we can not
only obtain the category information of the targets, but also a more accurate
trajectory estimation than the traditional TPHD filter. The JTC-TPHD filter is
derived by finding the best Poisson posterior approximation over trajectories
on an augmented state space using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)
minimization. The Gaussian mixture is adopted for the implementation, which is
referred to as the GM-JTC-TPHD filter. The L-scan approximation is also
presented for the GM-JTC-TPHD filter, which possesses lower computational

fabrication of meta-biomaterials that combine a rationally designed 3D
architecture (e.g., to tune mechanical and mass transport properties) with
nanoscale surface features (e.g., to guide the differentiation of stem cells).
Self-folding is an attractive approach for realizing such materials. However,
self-folded lattices are generally too compliant as there is an inherent
competition between the ease-of-folding requirements and the final load-bearing
characteristics. Inspired by sheet metal forming, we propose an alternative
route for the fabrication of origami lattices. This automated folding approach
allows for the introduction of sharp folds into thick metal sheets, thereby
enhancing their stiffness. We then demonstrate the first time ever realization
of automatically folded origami lattices with bone-mimicking mechanical
properties (elastic modulus = 0.5 GPa). The proposed approach is highly
scalable given that the unit cells making up the meta-biomaterial can be
arbitrarily large in number and small in dimensions. To demonstrate the
scalability and versatility of the proposed approach, we fabricated origami
lattices with > 100 unit cells, lattices with unit cells as small as 1.25 mm,
and auxetic lattices. We then used inductively coupled plasma reactive ion
etching to nanopattern the surface of the sheets prior to folding. Protected by
a thin layer of coating, these nanoscale features remained intact during the
folding process. A cell culture assay was then used to assess the bone tissue
regeneration performance of the folded origami. We found that the nanopatterned
folded specimens exhibit significantly increased mineralization as compared to
their non-patterned counterparts.

which is a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. To solve this

optimize the resource allocation policy and beamforming vectors iteratively.
Furthermore, the sum-rate maximization problem for non-orthogonal multiple

location-based matching algorithm to determine the sub-channel assignment,
where a transmitted user and a reflected user are grouped on a sub-channel.
Then, a three-step approach is proposed, where the decoding orders,
beamforming-coefficient vectors, and power allocation are optimized by
employing semidefinite programming, convex upper bound approximation, and
geometry programming, respectively. Numerical results unveil that: 1) For OMA,
a general design that includes same-side user-pairing for channel assignment is
preferable, while for NOMA, the proposed transmission-and-reflection scheme can
achieve near-optimal performance. 2) The STAR-RIS-aided NOMA network

been resolved using long baseline interferometry and the secondary component
shown to contribute some 15\% of the total flux, a spectroscopic detection of
the companion star was so far unsuccessful. To achieve our goals, we use a
combined data set from interferometry with the Navy Precision Optical
Interferometer (NPOI), photometry with the TESS space observatory, and
high-resolution spectroscopy with the HERMES fibre-fed spectrograph at the La
Palma observatory. We use the method of spectral disentangling to search for
the contribution of a companion star in the observed composite HERMES spectra,
to separate the spectral contributions of both components, and to determine
orbital elements of the $\alpha$ Dra system. TESS light curves are analysed in
an iterative fashion with spectroscopic inference of stellar atmospheric
parameters to determine fundamental stellar properties and their uncertainties.
Finally, NPOI interferometric measurements are used for determination of the
orbital parameters of the system and angular diameters of both binary
components. We report the first firm spectroscopic detection of the secondary
component in $\alpha$ Dra and deliver disentangled spectra of both binary
components. The inferred near-core mixing properties of both components do not
support a dependence of the convective core overshooting on the stellar mass.
At the same time, the $\alpha$ Dra system provides extra support to hypothesise
that the mass discrepancy in eclipsing spectroscopic double-lined binaries is
associated with inferior atmospheric modelling of intermediate- and high-mass
stars, and less so with the predictive power of stellar structure and evolution
models as to the amount of near-core mixing and mass of the convective core.

starburst galaxy IC 10, which is known to contain a population of young high
mass X-ray binaries. We searched for pulsations in 207 point-like X-ray sources
in the direction of IC 10 by a 2012 \xmm~observation with a total exposure time
of 134.5 ks. Pulsation searches in faint objects can be sensitive to the energy
bands of the light curves, and the source and background extraction areas. We
analyzed separately the PN and MOS barycenter corrected 0.2-12 keV data, with
good time interval filtering. Different schemes for source and background
extraction were compared, and the search was repeated in the narrower 0.5-8 keV
energy band to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. For the most conservative
parameters, 5 point sources produced significant peaks in the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram (99\% significance, single trial, assuming white noise). A similar
number of different candidates result from alternative analyses. A $\sim$4100 s
period seen in all 3 instruments for the black hole (BH) + Wolf-Rayet (WR)
binary IC 10 X-1 is probably due to red noise of astrophysical origin.
Considering the periods, luminosities, and spatial distribution of the pulsar
candidates in the direction of IC 10, they do not belong to the same
distribution as the ones in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way. This result
holds even if the candidates are spurious, since if the Small Magellanic Cloud
were placed at the distance of IC 10, we would expect to see $\sim$5 pulsars at
$L_x>10^{36}$ \lx ~inside the $D_{25}$ contour, and their periods would be of
order 100 seconds, rather than the mostly $\sim$1 s periods for the candidates
reported here, which lie outside the main body of the galaxy.

independent sets of an input graph $G$. Rapid mixing is of interest in
approximately sampling a structure, over some underlying set or graph, from
some target distribution. In the case of independent sets, we show that when
$G$ has bounded treewidth, this random walk -- known as the hardcore Glauber
dynamics -- mixes rapidly for all values of the standard parameter $\lambda >
0$, giving a simple alternative to existing sampling algorithms for these
structures.
  We also show rapid mixing for Markov chains on dominating sets and $b$-edge
covers (for fixed $b\geq 1$ and $\lambda > 0$) in the case where treewidth is
bounded, and for Markov chains on the $b$-matchings (for fixed $b \geq 1$ and
$\lambda > 0$), the maximal independent sets, and the maximal $b$-matchings of
a graph (for fixed $b \geq 1$), in the case where carving width is bounded.
  We prove our results by developing a divide-and-conquer framework using the
well-known multicommodity flows technique. Using this technique, we
additionally show that a similar dynamics on the $k$-angulations of a convex
set of $n$ points mixes in quasipolynomial time for all $k \geq 3$. (McShine
and Tetali gave a stronger result in the special case $k = 3$.)
  Our technique also allows us to strengthen existing results by Dyer,
Goldberg, and Jerrum and by Heinrich for the Glauber dynamics on the
$q$-colorings of $G$ on graphs of bounded carving width, when $q \geq \Delta +
2$ is bounded. Specifically, our technique yields an improvement in the
dependence on treewidth when $\Delta < 2t$ or when $q < 4t$ and $\Delta < t^2$.

gas and dust properties. Therefore, any details concerning the relationship
between the dust properties and the interstellar environments are lost. Here we
utilize the wealth of extinction and elemental abundance data obtained by space
telescopes and explore the dust properties of a large number of individual

derive the abundances of the major dust-forming elements (i.e., C, O, Si, Mg

the derived dust depletions with the observed gas-phase abundances of these

elemental depletions. It is found that for the majority of the sight lines the

being present at a location are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML have
resorted to pseudo-absence generation methods as a way to circumvent this
issue. The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in a region
of interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at
least a specific distance away from true presence points. In this paper, we
compare this random sampling approach to more advanced pseudo-absence
generation methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal background
extent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds
in Africa. Interestingly, we find that for the algorithms we tested, namely
logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests and maximum entropy, all
popular in prior work, the logistic model performed significantly better than
the more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms of prediction accuracy
and F1 score. Although background extent limitation combined with random
sampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for LR this was not the
case, and instead, a significant improvement was obtained when using
environmental profiling. In light of this, we conclude that a simpler ML
approach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence
generation, specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and
effective approach to predicting locust breeding grounds across Africa.

interaction of random variables along time, with applications ranging from
statistical physics and thermodynamics to system's biology and the simulation
of complex systems. Despite being studied since the 19th century, little is
known about how the dynamics of random fields are related to the geometric
properties of their parametric spaces. For example, how can we quantify the
similarity between two random fields operating in different regimes using an
intrinsic measure? In this paper, we propose a numerical method for the
computation of geodesic distances in Gaussian random field manifolds. First, we
derive the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space (the 3 x 3
first-order Fisher information matrix), then we derive the 27 Christoffel
symbols required in the definition of the system of non-linear differential
equations whose solution is a geodesic curve starting at the initial
conditions. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied to numerically solve
the non-linear system through an iterative approach. The obtained results show
that the proposed method can estimate the geodesic distances for several
different initial conditions. Besides, the results reveal an interesting
pattern: in several cases, the geodesic curve obtained by reversing the system
of differential equations in time does not match the original curve, suggesting
the existence of irreversible geometric deformations in the trajectory of a
moving reference traveling along a geodesic curve.

through subtle nudges by influential accounts, allowing for complex means of
reinforcing vilification of marginalized groups, an increasingly significant
problem in the media environment in the Global South. We identify dangerous
speech by influential accounts on Twitter in India around three key events,
examining both the language and networks of messaging that condones or actively
promotes violence against vulnerable groups. We characterize dangerous speech
users by assigning Danger Amplification Belief scores and show that dangerous
users are more active on Twitter as compared to other users as well as most
influential in the network, in terms of a larger following as well as volume of
verified accounts. We find that dangerous users have a more polarized
viewership, suggesting that their audience is more susceptible to incitement.
Using a mix of network centrality measures and qualitative analysis, we find
that most dangerous accounts tend to either be in mass media related
occupations or allied with low-ranking, right-leaning politicians, and act as
""broadcasters"" in the network, where they are best positioned to spearhead the
rapid dissemination of dangerous speech across the platform.

distance between multiple source-target domain pairs via feature distribution
alignment, an approach borrowed from the single source setting. However, with
diverse source domains, aligning pairwise feature distributions is challenging
and could even be counter-productive for MSDA. In this paper, we introduce a
novel approach: transferable attribute learning. The motivation is simple:
although different domains can have drastically different visual appearances,
they contain the same set of classes characterized by the same set of
attributes; an MSDA model thus should focus on learning the most transferable
attributes for the target domain. Adopting this approach, we propose a domain
attention consistency network, dubbed DAC-Net. The key design is a feature
channel attention module, which aims to identify transferable features
(attributes). Importantly, the attention module is supervised by a consistency
loss, which is imposed on the distributions of channel attention weights
between source and target domains. Moreover, to facilitate discriminative
feature learning on the target data, we combine pseudo-labeling with a class
compactness loss to minimize the distance between the target features and the
classifier's weight vectors. Extensive experiments on three MSDA benchmarks
show that our DAC-Net achieves new state of the art performance on all of them.

Fibonacci sequence, have been intensely studied over millennia and yet still
hide new mathematics. Such a recursion was used by Ap\'ery in his proof of the
irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, later named the Ap\'ery constant. Ap\'ery's proof
used a specific linear recursion containing integer polynomials forming a
continued fraction; called polynomial continued fractions (PCFs). Similar
polynomial recursions prove the irrationality of other mathematical constants
such as $\pi$ and $e$. More generally, the sequences generated by PCFs form
Diophantine approximations (DAs), which are ubiquitous in areas of math such as
number theory. It is not known which polynomial recursions create useful DAs
and whether they prove irrationality. Here, we present general conclusions and
conjectures about DAs created from PCFs. Specifically, we generalize Ap\'ery's
work, going beyond his particular choice of PCF, finding the conditions under
which a PCF proves irrationality or provides an efficient DA. To provide
concrete examples, we apply our findings to PCFs found by the Ramanujan Machine
algorithms to represent fundamental constants such as $\pi$, $e$, $\zeta(3)$,
and the Catalan constant G. For each such PCF, we demonstrate the extraction of
its convergence rate and efficiency, as well as the bound it provides for the
irrationality measure of the fundamental constant. We further propose new DA
conjectures based on PCFs. Our findings motivate future research on sequences
created by any linear recursions with integer coefficients, to aid the
development of systematic algorithms for finding DAs of fundamental constants.
Consequently, our study may contribute to ongoing efforts to answer open
questions, such as the proof of the irrationality of the Catalan constant or of

the missing data mechanism which determines the data we observe. Under the
ignorability condition of Rubin (1976), however, likelihood-based inference for
the outcome process does not depend on the missing data mechanism so that only
the former needs to be estimated; partially because of this simplification,
ignorability is often used as a baseline assumption. We study the implications
of Bayesian ignorability in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance
parameters and argue that ignorability is typically incompatible with sensible
prior beliefs about the amount of selection bias. We show that, for many
problems, ignorability directly implies that the prior on the selection bias is
tightly concentrated around zero. This is demonstrated on several models of
practical interest, and the effect of ignorability on the posterior
distribution is characterized for high-dimensional linear models with a ridge
regression prior. We then show both how to build high-dimensional models which
encode sensible beliefs about the selection bias and also show that under

interesting research aspect. Text annotation helps the patent practitioners
such as examiners and patent attorneys to quickly identify the key arguments of
any invention, successively providing a timely marking of a patent text. In the
process of manual patent analysis, to attain better readability, recognising
the semantic information by marking paragraphs is in practice. This semantic
annotation process is laborious and time-consuming. To alleviate such a
problem, we proposed a novel dataset to train Machine Learning algorithms to
automate the highlighting process. The contributions of this work are: i) we
developed a multi-class, novel dataset of size 150k samples by traversing USPTO
patents over a decade, ii) articulated statistics and distributions of data
using imperative exploratory data analysis, iii) baseline Machine Learning
models are developed to utilize the dataset to address patent paragraph
highlighting task, iv) dataset and codes relating to this task are open-sourced
through a dedicated GIT web page:
https://github.com/Renuk9390/Patent_Sentiment_Analysis and v) future path to
extend this work using Deep Learning and domain specific pre-trained language
models to develop a tool to highlight is provided. This work assist patent
practitioners in highlighting semantic information automatically and aid to
create a sustainable and efficient patent analysis using the aptitude of
Machine Learning.

valuable services to increase different companies' revenue. Several approaches
exist in handling paper recommender systems. While most existing recommender
systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach,
there are hybrid approaches that can improve recommendation accuracy using a
combination of both approaches. Even though many algorithms are proposed using
such methods, it is still necessary for further improvement. In this paper, we
propose a recommender system method using a graph-based model associated with
the similarity of users' ratings, in combination with users' demographic and
location information. By utilizing the advantages of Autoencoder feature
extraction, we extract new features based on all combined attributes. Using the
new set of features for clustering users, our proposed approach (GHRS) has
gained a significant improvement, which dominates other methods' performance in
the cold-start problem. The experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms many existing recommendation algorithms
on recommendation accuracy.

safety in nearby countries. The reasons for displacement have been generated by
phenomena of terrestrial origin, but exposure to unexpected extra-terrestrial
threats poses a different scenario. An asteroid impact warning implies a change
of paradigm which would represent a historic precedent. In this regard, the
analogies with natural disasters must be considered, along with multiple
possible scenarios, and legal aspects related to a) the legal framework to
regulate this situation; b) the action and responsibility of the states; and c)
the definition of impact refugee and the reconfiguration of traditional
concepts such as deterritorialized states. In addition, the decision-making
process and the actors involved must be led by a cooperative effort to improve
international law. These new circumstances should be established with a
consideration of inequalities between the states, and an aim of protecting
humanity through democratic solutions using the safest, most effective

complex motions as a result of simple inputs. However, these fluidic actuators
typically exhibit unimodal deformation upon inflation. Here, we present a new
design concept for modular, fluidic actuators that can switch between
deformation modes as a response to an input threshold. Our system comprises
bistable origami modules in which snapping breaks rotational symmetry, giving
access to a bending deformation. By tuning geometry, the modules can be
designed to snap at different pressure thresholds, rotate clockwise or
counterclockwise when actuated, and bend in different planes. Due to their
ability to assume multiple deformation modes as response to a single pressure
input we call our system MuA-Ori, or Multimodal Actuated Origami. MuA-Ori
provides an ideal platform to design actuators that can switch between
different configurations, reach multiple, pre-defined targets in space, and
move along complex trajectories.

commonly used in casual conversations and literary writings. Their meanings are
usually highly non-compositional. The idiom cloze task is a challenge problem
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research problem. Previous approaches to
this task are built on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and achieved
reasonably well performance on existing datasets. However, they fall short in
understanding the highly non-compositional meaning of idiomatic expressions.
They also do not consider both the local and global context at the same time.
In this paper, we proposed a BERT-based embedding Seq2Seq model that encodes
idiomatic expressions and considers them in both global and local context. Our
model uses XLNET as the encoder and RoBERTa for choosing the most probable
idiom for a given context. Experiments on the EPIE Static Corpus dataset show
that our model performs better than existing state-of-the-arts.

Existing, naive defenses can be partially broken with an adaptive attack. In
classification tasks, the Randomized Smoothing paradigm has been shown to be
effective at defending models. However, it is difficult to apply this paradigm
to ASR tasks, due to their complexity and the sequential nature of their
outputs. Our paper overcomes some of these challenges by leveraging
speech-specific tools like enhancement and ROVER voting to design an ASR model
that is robust to perturbations. We apply adaptive versions of state-of-the-art
attacks, such as the Imperceptible ASR attack, to our model, and show that our
strongest defense is robust to all attacks that use inaudible noise, and can

  grasping using limited labelled data","12",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grasping objects intelligently is a challenging task even for humans and we
spend a considerable amount of time during our childhood to learn how to grasp
objects correctly. In the case of robots, we can not afford to spend that much
time on making it to learn how to grasp objects effectively. Therefore, in the
present research we propose an efficient learning architecture based on VQVAE
so that robots can be taught with sufficient data corresponding to correct
grasping. However, getting sufficient labelled data is extremely difficult in
the robot grasping domain. To help solve this problem, a semi-supervised
learning based model which has much more generalization capability even with
limited labelled data set, has been investigated. Its performance shows 6\%
improvement when compared with existing state-of-the-art models including our
earlier model. During experimentation, It has been observed that our proposed
model, RGGCNN2, performs significantly better, both in grasping isolated
objects as well as objects in a cluttered environment, compared to the existing
approaches which do not use unlabelled data for generating grasping rectangles.
To the best of our knowledge, developing an intelligent robot grasping model
(based on semi-supervised learning) trained through representation learning and
exploiting the high-quality learning ability of GGCNN2 architecture with the
limited number of labelled dataset together with the learned latent embeddings,
can be used as a de-facto training method which has been established and also
validated in this paper through rigorous hardware experimentations using Baxter
(Anukul) research robot.
