rearrangements has been widely investigated in glass forming liquids and
glasses. In this paper we use the excess two-body entropy $S_2$ and
tetrahedrality $\n_{tet}$ as the per-particle local structural order parameters
to explore such correlations in a three-dimensional model glass subjected to
cyclic shear deformation. We first show that for both liquid configurations and
the corresponding inherent structures, local ordering increases upon lowering
temperature, signaled by a decrease in the two-body entropy and an increase in
tetrahedrality. When the inherent structures, or glasses, are periodically
sheared athermally, they eventually reach absorbing states for small shear
amplitudes, which do not change from one cycle to the next. Large strain
amplitudes result in the formation of shear bands, within which particle motion
is diffusive. We show that in the steady state, there is a clear difference in
the local structural environment of particles that will be part of plastic
rearrangements during the next shear cycle and that of particles that are
immobile. In particular, particles with higher $S_2$ and lower $n_{tet}$ are
more likely to go through rearrangements irrespective of the average energies
of the configurations and strain amplitude. For high shear, we find very
distinctive local order outside the mobile shear band region, where almost
$30\%$ of the particles are involved in icosahedral clusters, contrasting
strongly with the fraction of $<5\%$ found inside the shear band.

different sites for proton acceleration and neutrino emission, i.e. within the
magnetosphere, in the current sheet region beyond the light cylinder, and in
relativistic shocks far away from the magnetosphere. Different cooling
processes for protons and pions are considered to calculate the neutrino
emission suppression factor within each scenario. We find that the flux of the

decrease of the target photon number density. We calculate the neutrino flux
from FRB 200428 and its associated X-ray burst. The flux of the most optimistic
case invoking magnetospheric proton acceleration is still $\sim4$ orders of
magnitude below the IceCube sensitivity. We also estimate the diffuse neutrino
background from all FRB-emitting magnetars in the universe. The total neutrino
flux of magnetars during their FRB emission phases is a negligible fraction of
observed diffuse emission even under the most optimistic magnetospheric

and containing images of reduced quality. In this work, we propose a novel
generative model that learns a flexible non-parametric prior over interpolation
trajectories, conditioned on a pair of source and target images. Instead of
relying on deterministic interpolation methods (such as linear or spherical
interpolation in latent space), we devise a framework that learns a
distribution of trajectories between two given images using Latent Second-Order
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. Through a hybrid combination of
reconstruction and adversarial losses, the generator is trained to map the
sampled points from these trajectories to sequences of realistic images that
smoothly transition from the source to the target image. Through comprehensive

fraction of non-binary black holes in the population}. We demonstrate the
applicability of this method using simulated GW signals injected into Gaussian
noise following the design sensitivities of the Advanced LIGO Advanced Virgo
detectors. We compare the performance of this method with a
traditionally-followed hierarchical inference approach. Both the methods are
equally effective to hint at inhomogeneous populations, however, we find the
mixture-likelihood approach to be more natural for mixture populations
comprising compact objects of diverse classes. We also discuss the possible
systematics in the mixture-likelihood approach, caused by several reasons,
including the limited sensitivity of the second-generation detectors, specific
features of the astrophysical population distributions, and the limitations
posed by the waveform models employed. Finally, we apply this method to the
LIGO-Virgo detections published in the second GW transient catalog (GWTC-2) and
find them consistent with a binary black hole population within the statistical
precision.

This difference can be explained by comparing the contribution of electrostatic
interactions between the partially charged titanium and oxygen atoms and water
atoms to the van der Waals interactions, which increases the cooling time by
about 10 times. The effects of diameter and temperature of nanoparticle,
surface wettability on the interfacial thermal conductance are also

increasing the temperature of the heated nanoparticle from 400 K to 600 K led

with joint optimization we achieve improvements that do not present themselves

that Patchick~125 likely exhibits a mean metallicity $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle
\sim -1.7$, which represents a significant increase in metallicity for this
cluster compared to previous low-resolution spectroscopic analyses. We also
found a mean radial velocity of 95.9 km s$^{-1}$, which is $\sim$21.6 km
s$^{-1}$ higher than reported in the literature. The observed stars exhibit an
$\alpha$-enrichment ([Mg/Fe]$\lesssim+0.20$, and [Si/Fe]$\lesssim +0.30$) that
follows the typical trend of metal-poor GCs. The aluminum abundance ratios for
the present two member stars are enhanced in [Al/Fe]$\gtrsim +0.58$, which is a
typical enrichment characteristic of the so-called `second-generation' of stars
in GCs at similar metallicity. This supports the possible presence of the
multiple-population phenomenon in Patchick~125, as well as its genuine GC
nature. Further, Patchick~125 shows a low-energy, low-eccentric ($<0.4$) and
retrograde orbit captured by the inner Galaxy, near the edge of the bulge. We

allowing realization of any unitary on the quantum register. We review the main
experimental tools, and describe in detail unique aspects of the computer: the
use of robust entangling gates and the development of a quantum coherent

carrying out quantum error correction protocols in future experiments.

whether the local laws of physics require that $M_3$ be equipped with a
canonical orientation, are among the unsettled questions in cosmology and
quantum field theory. It is often assumed that a test for spatial orientability
requires a global journey across the whole $3-$space. Since such a global
expedition is not feasible, theoretical arguments are usually offered to
support the choice of time orientation for the spacetime manifold $M_4$, and
space orientation for $M_3$. Theoretical arguments can certainly be used, but
one would expect that the ultimate answer to the orientability question should
rely on observations or local experiments, or can come from a topological
fundamental theory in physics. In a recent paper we have argued that it is
potentially possible to locally access the $3-$space orientability of Minkowski
spacetime through effects involving 'point-like charged particles' under
quantum electromagnetic fluctuations. Specifically, we studied the stochastic
motions of a charged particle and an electric dipole subjected to these
fluctuations in Minkowski spacetime, with either an orientable or a
non-orientable $3-$space topology, and derived expressions for a statistical
orientability indicator in these two flat topologically inequivalent manifolds.
For the dipole we found that a characteristic inversion pattern exhibited by
the curves of the orientability indicator is a signature of non-orientability,
making it possible to locally probe the orientability of the $3-$space. Here,
to shed some additional light on the spatial orientability, we briefly review
these results, and also discuss some of its features and consequences. The
results might open the way to a conceivable experiment involving quantum
fluctuations to look into the spatial orientability of Minkowski empty
spacetime.

evidencing a lowering and an increase of the electronic polarizability around

Zn-O bonds and the local structure around Zn ions do not change. It is
concluded that the dilution of NiWO$_4$ with Zn ions is accompanied by an

can continue with its mission even after losing control authority over some of
its actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly
undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no
control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target
after a partial loss of control authority. However, after such a malfunction, a
resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to
its initial capabilities. To quantify this loss of performance we introduce the
notion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio of the minimal times
required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive
computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a
complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear,
optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to
provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience of control
systems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets. Relying on
control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of
quantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. We illustrate our
method on two numerical examples: a trajectory controller for low-thrust
spacecrafts and a UAV with eight propellers.

fundamental to the synthesis of complex biological molecules and is a promising
framework for the synthesis of synthetic chemical complexes. Unlike the
superficially similar process of self-assembly, however, the development of
synthetic systems that implement templated copying of copolymers under constant
environmental conditions has been challenging. The main difficulty has been
overcoming product inhibition, or the tendency of products to adhere strongly
to their templates - an effect that gets exponentially stronger with template
length. We develop coarse-grained models of copolymerisation on a finite-length
template and analyse them through stochastic simulation. We use these models
first to demonstrate that product inhibition prevents reliable template
copying, and then ask how this problem can be overcome to achieve cyclic
production of polymer copies of the right length and sequence in an autonomous
and chemically-driven context. We find that a simple addition to the model is
sufficient to generate far longer polymer products that initially form on, and
then separate from, the template. In this approach, some of the free energy of
polymerisation is diverted into disrupting copy-template bonds behind the
leading edge of the growing copy copolymer. By additionally weakening the final
copy-template bond at the end of the template, the model predicts that reliable
copying with a high yield of full-length, sequence-matched products is possible
over large ranges of parameter space, opening the way to the engineering of
synthetic copying systems that operate autonomously.

conceptual tool to shape technologies and societies, collective efforts towards
designing future societies are constrained by both internal and external
factors. Internal constraints on design are discussed by evoking Hardin's
thought experiment regarding 'the Tragedy of the Commons'. Further, Hayek's
classical distinction between 'cosmos' and 'taxis' is used to demarcate
external constraints on design. Finally, five design principles are presented
which are aimed at helping policymakers manage the internal and external

needs to account for the emergent properties of complex systems by allowing

Phosphorescent iridium complexes are integral to the widespread

bound for the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted quantum capacity. As computing
energy-constrained squashed entanglement of the channel is challenging due to a
double optimization (over the set of density matrices and the isometric
extensions of a squashing channel), we first derive an upper bound for it, and
then we discuss how tight that bound is for energy-constrained LOCC-assisted
quantum capacity of bosonic dephasing channel. We prove that the optimal input
state is diagonal in the Fock basis. Furthermore, we prove that for a generic
channel, the optimal squashing channel belongs to the set of symmetric quantum
Markov chain inducer (SQMCI) channels of the channel system-environment output,
provided that such a set is non-empty. With supporting arguments, we conjecture
that this is instead the case for the bosonic dephasing channel. Hence, for it
we analyze two explicit examples of squashing channels which are not SQMCI, but
are symmetric. Through them, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the
energy-constrained LOCC-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic dephasing
channel in terms of its quantum capacity with different noise parameters. As
the difference between upper and lower bounds is at most of the order

trajectories in participants with early Alzheimer's disease (n=1342) and
presymptomatic individuals (n=756) over 24 and 48 months respectively. Baseline
magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, demographics, and APOE genotype

and non-decliners with up to 79% area under the curve (cross-validated and
out-of-sample). Using these prognostic models to recruit enriched cohorts of
decliners can reduce required sample sizes by as much as 51%, while maintaining
the same detection power, and thus may improve trial quality, derisk endpoint
failures, and accelerate therapeutic development in Alzheimer's disease.

robust connectivity. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and
vision for enabling the connectivity applications of aerial vehicles utilizing
current and future communication technologies. We begin by categorizing the
connectivity use cases per aerial vehicle and analyzing their connectivity
requirements. By reviewing more than 500 related studies, we aim for a
comprehensive approach to cover wireless communication technologies, and
provide an overview of recent findings from the literature toward the
possibilities and challenges of employing the wireless communication standards.
After analyzing the network architectures, we list the open-source testbed
platforms to facilitate future investigations. This study helped us observe
that while numerous works focused on cellular technologies for aerial
platforms, a single wireless technology is not sufficient to meet the stringent
connectivity demands of the aerial use cases. We identified the need of further
investigations on multi-technology network architectures to enable robust

combinations to develop unified aerial networks that can meet the diverse

superior expressivity of multi-agent generative adversarial networks raise
important and overlooked theoretical questions regarding optimization in
two-team games. Formally, two-team zero-sum games are defined as multi-player
games where players are split into two competing sets of agents, each
experiencing a utility identical to that of their teammates and opposite to
that of the opposing team. We focus on the solution concept of Nash equilibria
(NE). We first show that computing NE for this class of games is
$\textit{hard}$ for the complexity class ${\mathrm{CLS}}$. To further examine
the capabilities of online learning algorithms in games with full-information
feedback, we propose a benchmark of a simple -- yet nontrivial -- family of
such games. These games do not enjoy the properties used to prove convergence
for relevant algorithms. In particular, we use a dynamical systems perspective
to demonstrate that gradient descent-ascent, its optimistic variant, optimistic
multiplicative weights update, and extra gradient fail to converge (even
locally) to a Nash equilibrium. On a brighter note, we propose a first-order
method that leverages control theory techniques and under some conditions
enjoys last-iterate local convergence to a Nash equilibrium. We also believe
our proposed method is of independent interest for general min-max
optimization.

to a receiver such that even if a constant fraction of the communicated bits
are corrupted, the receiver can still learn the message correctly. Due to their
importance and fundamental nature, $\mathsf{ECC}$s have been extensively
studied, one of the main goals being to maximize the fraction of errors that
the $\mathsf{ECC}$ is resilient to.
  For adversarial erasure errors (over a binary channel) the maximal error
resilience of an $\mathsf{ECC}$ is $\frac12$ of the communicated bits. In this
work, we break this $\frac12$ barrier by introducing the notion of an
interactive error correcting code ($\mathsf{iECC}$) and constructing an
$\mathsf{iECC}$ that is resilient to adversarial erasure of $\frac35$ of the
total communicated bits. We emphasize that the adversary can corrupt both the
sending party and the receiving party, and that both parties' rounds contribute
to the adversary's budget.
  We also prove an impossibility (upper) bound of $\frac23$ on the maximal
resilience of any binary $\mathsf{iECC}$ to adversarial erasures. In the bit
flip setting, we prove an impossibility bound of $\frac27$.

and bounded ratio, the zd-tree can be built in $O(n)$ work with
$O(n^{\epsilon})$ span for constant $\epsilon<1$, and searching for the

our k-nearest neighbor algorithms against existing parallel k-nearest neighbor
algorithms, showing that our implementations are generally faster than the

operators (doi: 10.1063/5.0026762), which ensure (1) spin completeness and (2)
spin adaption i.e. spin purity of the CC wave function. In contrast to the
proof-of-concept matrix-representation-based implementation presented there,
the present implementation relies on second quantization and factorized tensor
contractions. The generated singles and doubles operators are embedded in an
equation generation engine. In the latter, Wick's theorem is used to derive
prefactors arising from spin integration directly from the spin-free full
contraction patterns. The obtained Wick terms composed of products of Kronecker
deltas are represented by special non-antisymmetrized Goldstone diagrams.
Identical (redundant) diagrams are identified by solving the underlying graph
isomorphism problem. All non-redundant graphs are then automatically translated
to locally -- one term at a time -- factorized tensor contractions. Finally,
the spin-adapted and spin-complete (SASC) CCS and CCSD variants are applied to
a set of small molecular test systems. Both correlation energies and amplitude
norms hint towards a reasonable convergence of the SASC-CCSD method for a BCH
series truncation of order four. In comparison to spin orbital CCSD, SASC-CCSD
leads to slightly improved correlation energies with differences of up to 0.886

close, but different from that in the standard randomized benchmarking, and we
find the leading correction. Using relations to the local invariants of
two-qubit gates we identify all exceptional gates with several slow
exponentials and analyze possibilities to extract their decay rates from the
measured curves.

that all eigen-modes are localized near the boundary, and has profound impact
on a wide range of bulk properties. In particular, topological systems with
NHSE have stimulated extensive research interests recently, given the fresh
theoretical and experimental challenges therein. Here we propose a readily
implementable scheme for achieving NHSE with band topology in ultracold gases.
Specifically, the scheme realizes the one-dimensional optical Raman lattice
with two types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an additional laser-induced
dissipation. By tuning the dissipation and the SOC strengths, NHSE and band
topology can be individually controlled such that they can coexist in a
considerable parameter regime. To identify the topological phase in the
presence of NHSE, we have restored the bulk-boundary correspondence by invoking
the non-Bloch band theory, and discussed the dynamic signals for detection. Our
work serves as a guideline for engineering topological lattices with NHSE in
the highly tunable environment of cold atoms, paving the way for future studies
of exotic non-Hermitian physics in a genuine quantum many-body setting.

equivalence problem for all known biprojective APN functions. Furthermore, we
give a new family of biprojective APN functions. Using our method, we count the
number of inequivalent APN functions in all known biprojective APN families and
show that the new family found in this paper gives exponentially many new
inequivalent APN functions. Quite recently, the Taniguchi family of APN

achieved by training a more accurate model.

ansatz of $f(Q,T)=f_1(Q)+f_2(T)$, which has been broadly studied in the
literature and the coincident gauge where the connection vanishes, we got
equations consistent with $f(Q)$ gravity when $f_{T}=0$. In the case of the
tensor perturbations, the propagation of gravitational waves was found to be
identical to $f(Q)$, as expected. For scalar perturbations, outside the limit
$f_T = 0$, we got that the coupling between $Q$ and $T$ in the Lagrangian
produces a coupling between the perturbation of the density and the pressure.
The presence of $T$ in the Lagrangian breaks the equation of the conservation
of energy, which in turn breaks the standard $\rho' + 3\mathcal{H} (\rho+p) =
0$ relation. We also derived a coupled system of differential equations between
$\delta$, the density contrast and $v$ in the $\mathcal{H}<<k$ limit and with
negligible time derivative of the scalar perturbation potentials, which will be
useful in future studies to see whether this class of theories constitute a
good alternative to dark matter. These results might also enable to test
$f(Q,T)$ gravity with CMB and standard siren data that will help to determine

characterize the shape of a quasihole and analyze its anisotropy. We then
compare the quasihole's anisotropy with the intrinsic geometric metric of the
system that is extracted from the maximal overlap between the numerically
obtained quasihole ground state and a set of model wave functions of
anisotropic quasiholes. For a static system, we find that the quasihole's
anisotropy, similar to the intrinsic metric, grows with the anisotropy of the
band mass tensor. When the quasihole develops well, we observe a correspondence
between the anisotropy of the quasihole and the intrinsic metric of the
underlying anisotropic FQH state. We also drive the system out of equilibrium
by suddenly changing the band mass tensor. In this case, the shape of the
quasihole evolves with time and shows similar dynamics with the intrinsic
metric of the postquench state. The evolving frequency matches the energy of a

the density profile of a quasihole is a useful tool to estimate the intrinsic

(DJSC) system in which multiple radar sensors are deployed. Each sensor is
equipped with a sensing function and a communication function, and thus it is a
JSC node. The JSC nodes are able to perform sensing their surrounding
environments, e.g., weather conditions or available spectrum. Furthermore, they
can cooperatively detect and track a common target. The information, i.e., of
the environment and target, collected by the JSC nodes is transmitted to a base
station (BS) for further processing. As such, different aspects of the target
to be viewed simultaneously, which significantly improves the performance of
the target detection and tracking. However, both the sensing function and
communication function require a certain amount of bandwidth for their
operations, and deploying multiple JSC nodes may consume a large amount of
bandwidth. Therefore, we investigate the bandwidth allocation problem for the
DJSC system. In particular, we aim to optimize the bandwidth allocation to the
sensing function and the communication function of the JSC nodes. To improve
the allocation efficiency while benefiting the spatial diversity advantage of
the DJSC systems, the objective is to maximize the sum of sensing performances,
i.e., estimation rates, communication performances, i.e., communication data
rates, and fairnesses of all the users. The optimization problem is non-convex
and difficult to be solved. For this, we propose a fully polynomial time
approximation algorithm, and we prove that the approximation algorithm can
guarantee a near-optimal solution with an accuracy bound of $\epsilon$.
Furthermore, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. The
simulation results show that both the proposed algorithms are able to achieve
the solutions close to the optimum in a computationally efficient fashion.

some ISM gas conditions, WAs can be generated. However, the covering factor of
WAs is much smaller than that given by observations. This indicates that other

their integrated circuits (IC). While this trend allows them to tackle
fabrication costs, it introduces security concerns as external (and potentially
malicious) parties can access critical parts of the designs and steal or modify
the Intellectual Property (IP). Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) redaction is a promising
technique to protect critical IPs of an ASIC by \textit{redacting} (i.e.,
removing) critical parts and mapping them onto a custom reconfigurable fabric.
Only trusted parties will receive the correct bitstream to restore the redacted
functionality. While previous studies imply that using an eFPGA is a sufficient
condition to provide security against IP threats like reverse-engineering,
whether this truly holds for all eFPGA architectures is unclear, thus
motivating the study in this paper. We examine the security of eFPGA fabrics
generated by varying different FPGA design parameters. We characterize the
power, performance, and area (PPA) characteristics and evaluate each fabric's

work with custom eFPGA fabrics rather than off-the-shelf commercial FPGAs and
reveals that only considering a redaction fabric's bitstream size is inadequate

to various sources of bias. One method of adjusting for the residual biases in
the estimation of a treatment effect is through negative control outcomes,
where the treatment does not affect the outcome. The empirical calibration
procedure is a technique that uses negative controls to calibrate p-values. An
extension of empirical calibration calibrates the coverage of the 95%
confidence interval of a treatment effect estimate by using negative control
outcomes as well as positive control outcomes (where treatment affects the
outcome).
  Methods: The effect of empirical calibration of confidence intervals was
analyzed using simulated datasets with known treatment effects. The simulations
consisted of binary treatment and binary outcome, with biases resulting from
unmeasured confounder, model misspecification, measurement error, and lack of
positivity. The performance of the empirical calibration was evaluated by
determining the change in the coverage of the confidence interval and the bias
in the treatment effect estimate.
  Results: Empirical calibration increased coverage of the 95% confidence
interval of the treatment effect estimate under most bias scenarios but was
inconsistent in adjusting the bias in the treatment effect estimate. Empirical
calibration of confidence intervals was most effective when adjusting for the
unmeasured confounding bias. Suitable negative controls had a large impact on
the adjustment made by empirical calibration, but small improvements in the
coverage of the outcome of interest were also observable when using unsuitable
negative controls.

used to determine whether $K_0^{*0}(1430)$ belongs to the ground state or the
first excited state, if the data were available. We also note that some decays
have large direct $CP$ asymmetries, some of which are also sensitive to the
scenarios, such as the $B_s \to a_0^+(1450)K^{*-}$ and the $B_s\to f_0(1500)
K^{*0}$ decays. Since the experimental measurements of $B_s\to VS$ decays are
on the way, combined with the available data in the future, we expect the
theoretical predictions will shed light on the structure of the scalar mesons.

in applications. Effective strategies and approaches, \textit{e.g.}
re-weighting, or loss correction, are designed to alleviate the negative impact
of label noise when training a neural network. Those existing works usually
rely on the pre-specified architecture and manually tuning the additional
hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose warped probabilistic inference
(WarPI) to achieve adaptively rectifying the training procedure for the
classification network within the meta-learning scenario. In contrast to the
deterministic models, WarPI is formulated as a hierarchical probabilistic model
by learning an amortization meta-network, which can resolve sample ambiguity
and be therefore more robust to serious label noise. Unlike the existing
approximated weighting function of directly generating weight values from
losses, our meta-network is learned to estimate a rectifying vector from the
input of the logits and labels, which has the capability of leveraging
sufficient information lying in them. This provides an effective way to rectify
the learning procedure for the classification network, demonstrating a
significant improvement of the generalization ability. Besides, modeling the
rectifying vector as a latent variable and learning the meta-network can be
seamlessly integrated into the SGD optimization of the classification network.
We evaluate WarPI on four benchmarks of robust learning with noisy labels and
achieve the new state-of-the-art under variant noise types. Extensive study and
analysis also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

exceptional quality on the energy-dependent X-ray pulse profile of pulsars.
However, in searching for evidence of pulsations, Guillot et al. (2019)
introduce a procedure to select an ordered subset of the data that maximizes a
detection statistic (the H-test). I show that this procedure can degrade
subsequent analyses using an idealized model with a stationary expected count
rates from both noise and signal. Specifically, the data-selection procedure
biases the inferred mean count rate to be too low, biases the inferred
pulsation amplitude to be too high, and that the size of these biases scales
strongly with the amount of data that is rejected and the true signal
amplitude. The procedure also alters the null-distribution of the H-test
rendering nominal detection significance estimates overly optimistic. While the
idealized model does not capture all the complexities of real NICER data, it
suggests that these biases could be important for NICER's observations of
J0740+6620 and other faint pulsars (observations of J0030+0451 are likely less
affected). I estimate that these selection effects may introduce a bias of
$\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ on average in the inferred modulation depth of lightcurves
like J0740+6620's, and may be as large as $\mathcal{O}(50\%)$ for fainter
pulsars. However, the change for a single dataset like J0740+6620 is expected
to be a shift between $-5\%$ and $+20\%$. This could imply that the lower limit
on J0740+6620's radius is slightly larger than it should be, although
preliminary investigations suggest the change in the radius constraints are
$\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ with real J0740+6620 data.

Pre-processing of data based on rank transformation has been suggested as a

be very useful in many data mining applications. In this paper, we present a
better and effective alternative based on ranks over multiple sub-samples of

Alternating Automatic Register Machine (AARM). An AARM possesses the basic
features of a conventional register machine and an alternating Turing machine,
but can carry out computations using bounded automatic relations in a single
step. One finding is that an AARM can recognise some NP-complete problems,
including SAT (using a particular coding), in $\log^* n + O(1)$ steps. On the
other hand, if all problems in P can be solved by an AARM in $O(\log^*n)$
rounds, then $\text{P} \subset \text{PSPACE}$.
  Furthermore, we study an even more computationally powerful machine, called a
Polynomial-Size Padded Alternating Automatic Register Machine (PAARM), which
allows the input to be padded with a polynomial-size string. It is shown that
the polynomial hierarchy can be characterised as the languages that are
recognised by a PAARM in $\log^*n + O(1)$ steps. These results illustrate the
power of alternation when combined with computations involving automatic
relations, and uncover a finer gradation between known complexity classes.

performance is thus affected significantly. Introducing other modalities such
as depth and infrared data is an effective way to handle imaging limitations of
individual sources, but multi-modal imaging platforms usually require elaborate
designs and cannot be applied in many real-world applications at present.
Near-infrared (NIR) imaging becomes an essential part of many surveillance
cameras, whose imaging is switchable between RGB and NIR based on the light
intensity. These two modalities are heterogeneous with very different visual
properties and thus bring big challenges for visual tracking. However, existing
works have not studied this challenging problem. In this work, we address the
cross-modal object tracking problem and contribute a new video dataset,
including 654 cross-modal image sequences with over 481K frames in total, and
the average video length is more than 735 frames. To promote the research and

learns the modality-aware target representation to mitigate the appearance gap

could thus be flexibly embedded into different tracking frameworks. Extensive

methods for simply-connected open and closed surfaces with the target of the
parameterization being a spherical cap. Our methods optimize the shape of the
parameter domain along with the mapping from the object surface to the

spherical cap region of the unit sphere in an area-preserving manner while also
exhibiting low conformal distortion. We further develop a set of spherical

directly optimizes for the reconstructed surface, which enables us to
synthesize finer geometric details with fewer artifacts. Unlike deep 3D
generative models that directly generate explicit representations such as
meshes, our model can synthesize shapes with arbitrary topology. The core of
DMTet includes a deformable tetrahedral grid that encodes a discretized signed
distance function and a differentiable marching tetrahedra layer that converts
the implicit signed distance representation to the explicit surface mesh
representation. This combination allows joint optimization of the surface
geometry and topology as well as generation of the hierarchy of subdivisions
using reconstruction and adversarial losses defined explicitly on the surface

the changes that result from the heat-treatment by employing

The main effect of heat-treatment is material densification, which presumably

X-ray, and electron-beam diffraction experiments indicate that the heat-treated

noticeable that the classes of drift terms become wider if the drift term is

follow under an additional condition on the gradients of the drift terms with
the aid of methods developed in Wasserstein spaces. One of our main tools is so

was introduced in the 1930s but has not been theoretically proven until recent
years. All of its analysis in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)
setting requires an exact oracle to provide optimal solutions with any input.
However, such an oracle is usually not feasible since many combinatorial
optimization problems are NP-hard and only approximation oracles are available.
An example (Wang and Chen, 2018) has shown the failure of TS to learn with an
approximation oracle. However, this oracle is uncommon and is designed only for
a specific problem instance. It is still an open question whether the
convergence analysis of TS can be extended beyond the exact oracle in CMAB. In
this paper, we study this question under the greedy oracle, which is a common
(approximation) oracle with theoretical guarantees to solve many (offline)
combinatorial optimization problems. We provide a problem-dependent regret
lower bound of order $\Omega(\log T/\Delta^2)$ to quantify the hardness of TS
to solve CMAB problems with greedy oracle, where $T$ is the time horizon and
$\Delta$ is some reward gap. We also provide an almost matching regret upper
bound. These are the first theoretical results for TS to solve CMAB with a
common approximation oracle and break the misconception that TS cannot work
with approximation oracles.

Regular expressions in programming languages (RegEx) such as JavaScript,
feature non-standard semantics of operators (e.g. greedy/lazy Kleene star), as
well as additional features such as capturing groups and references. While
symbolic execution of programs containing RegExes appeals to string solvers
natively supporting important features of RegEx, such a string solver is
hitherto missing. In this paper, we propose the first string theory and string
solver that natively provide such a support. The key idea of our string solver
is to introduce a new automata model, called prioritized streaming string
transducers (PSST), to formalize the semantics of RegEx-dependent string
functions. PSSTs combine priorities, which have previously been introduced in
prioritized finite-state automata to capture greedy/lazy semantics, with string
variables as in streaming string transducers to model capturing groups. We
validate the consistency of the formal semantics with the actual JavaScript
semantics by extensive experiments. Furthermore, to solve the string
constraints, we show that PSSTs enjoy nice closure and algorithmic properties,
in particular, the regularity-preserving property (i.e., pre-images of regular
constraints under PSSTs are regular), and introduce a sound sequent calculus
that exploits these properties and performs propagation of regular constraints
by means of taking post-images or pre-images. Although the satisfiability of
the string constraint language is undecidable, we show that our approach is
complete for the so-called straight-line fragment. We evaluate the performance
of our string solver on over 195000 string constraints generated from an
open-source RegEx library. The experimental results show the efficacy of our
approach, drastically improving the existing methods in both precision and
efficiency.

magnetic field structure around astrophysical objects. In this paper, we study
the linear polarization of X-ray emissions from gamma-ray binary systems based
on pulsar scenarios. We discuss synchrotron emissions from pulsar wind
particles accelerated by a standing shock. We explore three kinds of
axisymmetric magnetic field structures: (i) toroidal magnetic fields, (ii)
poloidal magnetic fields, and (iii) tangled magnetic fields. Because of the
axisymmetric structure, the polarization angle of integrated emission is
oriented along or perpendicular to the shock-cone axis projected on the sky and
swings by 360? in one orbit. For the toroidal case, the polarization angle is
always directed along the shock cone axis and smoothly changes along the
orbital phase. For the poloidal/tangled magnetic field, the direction of the
polarization angle depends on the system parameters and orbital phase. In one
orbit, the polarization degree for the toroidal case can reach the maximum
value of the synchrotron radiation (? 70%), while the maximum polarization
degree for poloidal/tangled field cases is several 10%. We apply our model to
bright gamma-ray binary LS 5039 and make predictions for future observations.
With the expected sensitivity of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, linear
polarization can be detected by an observation of several days if the magnetic
field is dominated by the toroidal magnetic field. If the magnetic field is
dominated by the poloidal/tangled field, significant detection is expected with

transparency of models, which is helpful for machine learning to be trusted in
real applications. However, explanation methods have recently been demonstrated
to be vulnerable to manipulation, where we can easily change a model's
explanation while keeping its prediction constant. To tackle this problem, some
efforts have been paid to use more stable explanation methods or to change
model configurations. In this work, we tackle the problem from the training
perspective, and propose a new training scheme called Adversarial Training on
EXplanations (ATEX) to improve the internal explanation stability of a model
regardless of the specific explanation method being applied. Instead of
directly specifying explanation values over data instances, ATEX only puts
requirement on model predictions which avoids involving second-order
derivatives in optimization. As a further discussion, we also find that
explanation stability is closely related to another property of the model,
i.e., the risk of being exposed to adversarial attack. Through experiments,
besides showing that ATEX improves model robustness against manipulation
targeting explanation, it also brings additional benefits including smoothing
explanations and improving the efficacy of adversarial training if applied to
the model.

the attack and defense implementations, and 3) unifying the evaluation protocol
in refined scenarios. By leveraging the GRB pipeline, the end-users can focus
on the development of robust GML models with automated data processing and

can learn new classes quickly even given few samples since human can tell what
discriminative features should be focused on about each category based on both
the visual and semantic prior knowledge. To better utilize those prior
knowledge, we propose the SEmantic Guided Attention (SEGA) mechanism where the
semantic knowledge is used to guide the visual perception in a top-down manner
about what visual features should be paid attention to when distinguishing a
category from the others. As a result, the embedding of the novel class even
with few samples can be more discriminative. Concretely, a feature extractor is
trained to embed few images of each novel class into a visual prototype with
the help of transferring visual prior knowledge from base classes. Then we
learn a network that maps semantic knowledge to category-specific attention
vectors which will be used to perform feature selection to enhance the visual
prototypes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS,

interests. Existing approaches mainly adopt a supervised manner and heavily
rely on coupled image-report pairs. However, in the medical domain, building a
large-scale image-report paired dataset is both time-consuming and expensive.
To relax the dependency on paired data, we propose an unsupervised model
Knowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE) which accepts independent sets of images
and reports in training. KGAE consists of a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a
knowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder. The knowledge graph
works as the shared latent space to bridge the visual and textual domains; The
knowledge-driven encoder projects medical images and reports to the

generates a medical report given a coordinate in this space. Since the
knowledge-driven encoder and decoder can be trained with independent sets of
images and reports, KGAE is unsupervised. The experiments show that the
unsupervised KGAE generates desirable medical reports without using any
image-report training pairs. Moreover, KGAE can also work in both
semi-supervised and supervised settings, and accept paired images and reports
in training. By further fine-tuning with image-report pairs, KGAE consistently
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on two datasets.

according to explicit expressions, three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
simulations show that the acceleration for $e^+$ beam of $\sim$nC charge with
$\sim$GV/m gradient, $\lesssim$0.5% induced energy spread and $\sim$50% energy

current profile of the more tunable $e^-$ beam instead of the $e^+$ beam is
enough to obtain such favorable results. A theoretical analysis considering
both linear and nonlinear plasma responses in hollow plasma channels is
proposed to quantify the beam loading effects. This theory agrees very well

moment from an untrimmed video, to match a language query, i.e., a sentence.
Without considering bias in moment annotations (e.g., start and end positions

annotations, and do not well learn cross-modal reasoning between video and
language query. In this paper, we propose two debiasing strategies, data
debiasing and model debiasing, to ""force"" a TSGV model to capture cross-modal
interactions. Data debiasing performs data oversampling through video
truncation to balance moment temporal distribution in train set. Model
debiasing leverages video-only and query-only models to capture the
distribution bias, and forces the model to learn cross-modal interactions.
Using VSLNet as the base model, we evaluate impact of the two strategies on two
datasets that contain out-of-distribution test instances. Results show that
both strategies are effective in improving model generalization capability.
Equipped with both debiasing strategies, VSLNet achieves best results on both

schemes where networks react and adapt toward given flow patterns. Doing so, a
system reduces dissipation and network volume, thereby altering its final form.
Yet, recent numeric studies on network morphogenesis, incorporating uptake of
metabolites by the embedding tissue, have indicated the conventional approach
to be insufficient. Here, we systematically study a hybrid-model which combines
the network adaptation schemes intended to generate space-filling perfusion as
well as optimal filtration of metabolites. As a result, we find hydrodynamic
stimuli (wall-shear stress) and filtration based stimuli (uptake of
metabolites) to be antagonistic as hydrodynamically optimized systems have
suboptimal uptake qualities and vice versa. We show that a switch between
different optimization regimes is typically accompanied with a complex
transition between topologically redundant meshes and spanning trees. Depending
on the metabolite demand and uptake capabilities of the adaptating networks, we
are further able to demonstrate the existence of nullity re-entrant behavior
and the development of compromised phenotypes such as dangling non-perfused

this problem:
  - an $n \log n+o(n \log n)$-bit succinct data structure that supports
adjacency query in $O(\log n)$ time, neighborhood query in $O(d \log n)$ time
and finally, degree query in $\min\{O(\log^2 n), O(d \log n)\}$ where $d$ is
the degree of the queried vertex.

adjacency and degree queries in $O(1)$ time, and the neighborhood query in
$O(d)$ time where $d$ is the degree of the queried vertex.
  Central to our data structures is the usage of the classical heavy path

Persistent Threats (APT), are commonly adopted by modern attackers. Recent
studies propose leveraging the rich contextual information in data provenance
to detect threats in a host. Data provenance is a directed acyclic graph
constructed from system audit data. Nodes in a provenance graph represent
system entities (e.g., $processes$ and $files$) and edges represent system
calls in the direction of information flow. However, previous studies, which
extract features of the whole provenance graph, are not sensitive to the small
number of threat-related entities and thus result in low performance when
hunting stealthy threats.
  We present threaTrace, an anomaly-based detector that detects host-based
threats at system entity level without prior knowledge of attack patterns. We
tailor GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to learn every benign
entity's role in a provenance graph. threaTrace is a real-time system, which is
scalable of monitoring a long-term running host and capable of detecting
host-based intrusion in their early phase. We evaluate threaTrace on three
public datasets. The results show that threaTrace outperforms three
state-of-the-art host intrusion detection systems.

made of High Density Polyethylene located in a strong magnetic field. The
experiment was designed so that Askaryan and magnetically-induced components of
the radio emission could be measured independently. At the same time, we
performed a detailed simulation of this experiment to predict the radio signal

the simulation scheme and make a comparison with data characteristics such as
linearity with magnetic field and amplitude. The simulations agree with the
measurements within uncertainties and present a good description of the data.
In particular, reflections within the target that accounted for the largest
systematic uncertainties are addressed. The prediction of the amplitude of
Askaryan emission agrees with measurements to within 5% for the endpoint

on the concept of the information efficiency of a recursive function, which is
defined as the difference between the information in the input and the output.
The theory allows us to study planar representations of various infinite
domains. Dilation theory studies the information effects of recursive
operations in terms of topological deformations of the plane. I show that the
well-known class of finite sets of natural numbers behaves erratically under
such transformations. It is subject to phase transitions that in some cases
have a fractal nature. The class is semi-countable: there is no intrinsic
information theory for this class and there are no efficient methods for
systematic search.
  There is a relation between the information efficiency of the function and
the time needed to compute it: a deterministic computational process can
destroy information in linear time, but it can only generate information at
logarithmic speed. Checking functions for problems in NP are information
discarding. Consequently, when we try to solve a decision problem based on an
efficiently computable checking function, we need exponential time to
reconstruct the information destroyed by such a function.
  NP-complete problems are hard because they are defined on semi-countable
domains. There is a smaller class of problems, based on countable domains, that
has a more transparent structure. One such problem, Subset Bitwise XOR, which
could also be described as Multiple Mutual Key Encryption, is shown to be in NP
but not in P. At the end of the paper I sketch a systematic taxonomy for

performance of masked face presentation detection (PAD). The main issues facing
the mask face PAD are the wrongly classified bona fide masked faces and the

these issues by proposing a method that considers partial attack labels to
supervise the PAD model training, as well as regional weighted inference to
further improve the PAD performance by varying the focus on different facial

the dynamics of the shock front and downstream flow with a special emphasis on
the reconnecting equatorial current sheet. We examine whether giant plasmoids
produced in the reconnection process could be good candidates for the knots. To
this end, we perform large semi-global three-dimensional particle-in-cell

used to extrapolate numerical results to pulsar wind nebula scales. The shocked
material collapses into the midplane, forming and feeding a large-scale, but
thin, ring-like current layer. The sheet breaks up into a dynamical chain of
merging plasmoids reminiscent of three-dimensional reconnection. Plasmoids grow
to a macroscopic size. The final number of plasmoids predicted is solely
governed by the inverse of the dimensionless reconnection rate. The formation
of giant plasmoids is a robust feature of pulsar wind termination shocks. They
provide a natural explanation for the inner-ring knots in the Crab Nebula,

auditory image in the midbrain (inferior colliculus) of objects in the
acoustical environment of the listener. It is shown that the ear is a temporal
imaging system that comprises three transformations of the envelope functions:
cochlear group-delay dispersion, cochlear time lensing, and neural group-delay
dispersion. These elements are analogous to the optical transformations in
vision of diffraction between the object and the eye, spatial lensing by the
lens, and second diffraction between the lens and the retina. Unlike the eye,
it is established that the human auditory system is naturally defocused, so
that coherent stimuli do not react to the defocus, whereas completely
incoherent stimuli are impacted by it and may be blurred by design. It is
argued that the auditory system can use this differential focusing to enhance
or degrade the images of real-world acoustical objects that are partially
coherent. The theory is founded on coherence and temporal imaging theories that
were adopted from optics. In addition to the imaging transformations, the
corresponding inverse-domain modulation transfer functions are derived and
interpreted with consideration to the nonuniform neural sampling operation of
the auditory nerve. These ideas are used to rigorously initiate the concepts of
sharpness and blur in auditory imaging, auditory aberrations, and auditory
depth of field. In parallel, ideas from communication theory are used to show
that the organ of Corti functions as a multichannel phase-locked loop (PLL)
that constitutes the point of entry for auditory phase locking and hence
conserves the signal coherence. It provides an anchor for a dual coherent and
noncoherent auditory detection in the auditory brain that culminates in
auditory accommodation. Implications on hearing impairments are discussed as
well.

in an off-policy manner, with which sampled data can be used multiple times. In
addition, we enhance the stability of OPIfVI with spectral normalization to
mitigate the side-effect of off-policy training. The core factor, contributing

meaningful features from visual inputs. Hence, OPIfVI employs data augmentation
from computer vision to help train encoders that can better extract features

state information to determine the next sampling instant, rendering the STC
mechanism dynamic. Using dynamic variables has proven to be powerful for
increasing sampling intervals for the closely related concept of
event-triggered control, but has so far not been exploited for STC. Two
variants of the dynamic STC framework are presented. The first variant can be
used without further knowledge on the disturbance and leads to guarantees on

to determine sampling instants and guarantees asymptotic stability of a set
containing the origin. In both cases, hybrid Lyapunov function techniques are
used to derive the respective stability guarantees. Different choices for the

problem for initial data which are small perturbations in the non-congested
zone of travelling wave profiles. We prove two different results. First, we
show that for arbitrarily large perturbations, the Cauchy problem is locally
well-posed in weighted Sobolev spaces. The solution we obtain takes the form
(vs, us)(t, x -- x(t)), where x < x(t) is the congested zone and x > x(t) is

processing a pattern as observed, not capturing the underlying feature

address this issue, we propose the Grassmannian learning mutual subspace method
(G-LMSM), a NN layer embedded on top of CNNs as a classifier, that can process
image sets more effectively and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The
image set is represented by a low-dimensional input subspace; and this input
subspace is matched with reference subspaces by a similarity of their canonical
angles, an interpretable and easy to compute metric. The key idea of G-LMSM is
that the reference subspaces are learned as points on the Grassmann manifold,
optimized with Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. This learning is stable,
efficient and theoretically well-grounded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method on hand shape recognition, face identification, and facial

because of their advantages over formulations based on body-fitted meshes for
problems with moving interfaces. In such methods, the cells (or elements) which
are cut by the interface between two different domains need to be integrated
using special techniques in order to obtain optimal convergence rates and
accurate fluxes across the interface. The adaptive integration technique in
which the cells are recursively subdivided is one of the popular techniques for
the numerical integration of cut-cells due to its advantages over tessellation,
particularly for problems involving complex geometries in three dimensions.
Although adaptive integration does not impose any limitations on the
representation of the geometry of immersed solids as it requires only point
location algorithms, it becomes computationally expensive for recovering
optimal convergence rates. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of
the adaptive integration of cut-cells for applications in computational fluid
dynamics and fluid-structure interaction. We assess the effect of the accuracy
of integration of cut cells on convergence rates in velocity and pressure
fields, and then on forces and displacements for fluid-structure interaction
problems by studying several examples in two and three dimensions. By taking
the computational cost and the accuracy of forces and displacements into
account, we demonstrate that numerical results of acceptable accuracy for FSI
problems involving laminar flows can be obtained with only fewer levels of
refinement. In particular, we show that three levels of adaptive refinement are
sufficient for obtaining force and displacement values of acceptable accuracy
for laminar fluid-structure interaction problems.

improvement, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent
studies have shown that adversaries can fool the models even if they can only
access the models' hard-label output. However, since many queries are needed to
find imperceptible adversarial noise, reducing the number of queries is crucial
for these attacks. In this paper, we point out two limitations of existing
decision-based black-box attacks. We observe that they waste queries for
background noise optimization, and they do not take advantage of adversarial
perturbations generated for other images. We exploit 3D face alignment to
overcome these limitations and propose a general strategy for query-efficient
black-box attacks on face recognition named Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary
Attack (GADA). Our core idea is to create an adversarial perturbation in the UV
texture map and project it onto the face in the image. It greatly improves
query efficiency by limiting the perturbation search space to the facial area
and effectively recycling previous perturbations. We apply the GADA strategy to
two existing attack methods and show overwhelming performance improvement in
the experiments on the LFW and CPLFW datasets. Furthermore, we also present a
novel attack strategy that can circumvent query similarity-based stateful
detection that identifies the process of query-based black-box attacks.

nonmagnetic crystals, which described by the type-II magnetic space groups
(MSGs), has been established. However, a systematic investigation of emergent
particles in magnetic crystals has not yet been performed, due to the
complexity of the symmetries of magnetically ordered structures. Here, we
address this challenging task by exploring the possibilities of the emergent
particles in the 674 type-III MSGs. Based on effective k.p Hamiltonian and our
classification of emergent particles [Yu et al., Sci. Bull. 67, 375 (2022)
DOI:10.1016/j.scib.2021.10.023], we identify all possible emergent particles,
including spinful and spinless, essential and accidental particles in the
type-III MSGs. We find that all emergent particles in type-III MSGs also exist
in type-II MSGs, with only one exception, i.e. the combined quadratic nodal
line and nodal surface (QNL/NS). Moreover, tabulations of the emergent
particles in each of the 674 type-III MSGs, together with the symmetry
operations, the small corepresentations, the effective k.p Hamiltonians, and
the topological character of these particles, are explicitly presented.
Remarkably, combining this work and our homemade SpaceGroupIrep and MSGCorep
packages will provide an effcient way to search topological magnetic materials

inform decisions that affect humans and their environment. While the use of
ADMS can improve the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making processes, it
is also coupled with ethical challenges. Unfortunately, the governance
mechanisms currently used to oversee human decision-making often fail when
applied to ADMS. In previous work, we proposed that ethics-based auditing
(EBA), i.e. a structured process by which ADMS are assessed for consistency
with relevant principles or norms, can (a) help organisations verify claims
about their ADMS and (b) provide decision-subjects with justifications for the
outputs produced by ADMS. In this article, we outline the conditions under
which EBA procedures can be feasible and effective in practice. First, we argue
that EBA is best understood as a 'soft' yet 'formal' governance mechanism. This
implies that the main responsibility of auditors should be to spark ethical
deliberation at key intervention points throughout the software development
process and ensure that there is sufficient documentation to respond to
potential inquiries. Second, we frame ADMS as parts of larger socio-technical
systems to demonstrate that to be feasible and effective, EBA procedures must
link to intervention points that span all levels of organisational governance
and all phases of the software lifecycle. The main function of EBA should
therefore be to inform, formalise, assess, and interlink existing governance
structures. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our findings. To
support the emergence of feasible and effective EBA procedures, policymakers
and regulators could provide standardised reporting formats, facilitate
knowledge exchange, provide guidance on how to resolve normative tensions, and
create an independent body to oversee EBA of ADMS.

fixed price F, while the consumer has the corresponding long position.
Moreover, both players are risk-averse with respect to their financial position
and their risk aversions are modelled through an integrated-variance
penalization. We study the impact of risk aversion on the interaction between
the producer and the consumer as well as on the derivative price. In
mathematical terms, we are dealing with a two-player linear-quadratic
McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential game. Using methods based on the
martingale optimality principle and BSDEs, we find a Nash equilibrium and
characterize the corresponding strategies and payoffs in semi-explicit form.
Furthermore, we compute the two indifference prices (one for the producer and
one for the consumer) induced by that equilibrium and we determine the quantity
\lambda such that the players agree on the price. Finally, we illustrate our
results with some numerics. In particular, we focus on how the risk aversions
and the volatility control costs of the players affect the derivative price.

acceleration is a mixed blessing insofar as it increases the harvested
entanglement for a large detector energy gap relative to the interaction
duration parameter, whilst inhibiting the entanglement harvested for a small
energy gap. Regarding the harvesting-achievable separation range between the
detectors, we further find that for very small acceleration and large energy
gap, both relative to the duration parameter, acceleration-assisted enhancement
can happen in all three acceleration scenarios. This is in sharp contrast to
what was argued previously: that the harvesting-achievable range can be
enhanced only for anti-parallel acceleration. However, for a not too small
acceleration relative to the duration parameter and an energy gap larger than
the acceleration, we find that only detectors in parallel acceleration possess
a harvesting-achievable range larger than those at rest.

critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to authentication

time attack, whereby an adversary executes their attack before or during the
machine learning model training. In this work, we propose a new training time
attack against computer vision based machine learning models, namely model
hijacking attack. The adversary aims to hijack a target model to execute a
different task than its original one without the model owner noticing. Model
hijacking can cause accountability and security risks since a hijacked model
owner can be framed for having their model offering illegal or unethical
services. Model hijacking attacks are launched in the same way as existing data
poisoning attacks. However, one requirement of the model hijacking attack is to
be stealthy, i.e., the data samples used to hijack the target model should look
similar to the model's original training dataset. To this end, we propose two
different model hijacking attacks, namely Chameleon and Adverse Chameleon,
based on a novel encoder-decoder style ML model, namely the Camouflager. Our
evaluation shows that both of our model hijacking attacks achieve a high attack
success rate, with a negligible drop in model utility.

the physical distance between halo center and the spine of filaments from high
redshift to $z=0$, only shows clear difference between the inner and outer

properties of gas in prominent and tenuous filaments, which appear in
relatively highly and intermediate overdense regions, respectively. The gas in
prominent filaments is hotter. Around $26\%$, $38\%$ and $45\%$ of gases in
prominent filaments are hotter than $10^6$ K at $z=1.0, 0.5$ and $z=0.0$

namely on mostly structured meshes with a few sufficiently separated
unstructured regions. To this end, we first define the mixed smoothness
B-splines that are $C^0$ continuous in the unstructured regions of the mesh but
have higher smoothness everywhere else. Subsequently, the SB-splines are
obtained by smoothly blending in the physical space the mixed smoothness
B-splines with Bernstein bases of equal degree. One of the key novelties of our
approach is that the required smooth weight functions are assembled from the
available smooth B-splines on the unstructured mesh. The SB-splines are
globally smooth, non-negative, have no breakpoints within the elements and
reduce to conventional B-splines away from the unstructured regions of the
mesh. Although we consider only quadratic mixed smoothness B-splines in this
paper, the construction generalises to arbitrary degrees. We demonstrate the
excellent performance of SB-splines studying Poisson and biharmonic problems on
semi-structured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, and numerically
establishing their optimal convergence in one and two dimensions.

Employing a combination of computational tools, namely density-functional

contrasting magnetic properties of BaRuO$_3$ in the 3C and 4H structures. Our
study reveals that the difference in connectivity of RuO$_6$ octahedra in the
two phases results in different Ru-O covalency, which in turn influences
substantially the strengths of screened interaction values for Hubbard $U$ and
Hund's rule $J$. With estimated $U$ and $J$ values, the 3C phase turns out to
be a ferromagnetic metal, while the 4H phase shows paramagnetic behavior with
vanishing ordered moments. However, this paramagnetic phase bears signatures of
antiferromagnetic correlations, as confirmed by a calculation of the magnetic
susceptibility. We find that the 4H phase is found to be at the verge of
antiferromagnetic long-range order, which can be stabilized upon slight changes
of screened Coulomb parameters $U$ and $J$, opening up the possibility of

offer excellent performance with nearly zero parameter tuning. Remarkably, RFs
seem to be impervious to overfitting even though their basic building blocks
are well-known to overfit. Recently, a broadly received study argued that a RF
exhibits a so-called double-descent curve: First, the model overfits the data
in a u-shaped curve and then, once a certain model complexity is reached, it
suddenly improves its performance again. In this paper, we challenge the notion
that model capacity is the correct tool to explain the success of RF and argue
that the algorithm which trains the model plays a more important role than
previously thought. We show that a RF does not exhibit a double-descent curve
but rather has a single descent. Hence, it does not overfit in the classic
sense. We further present a RF variation that also does not overfit although
its decision boundary approximates that of an overfitted DT. Similar, we show
that a DT which approximates the decision boundary of a RF will still overfit.
Last, we study the diversity of an ensemble as a tool the estimate its
performance. To do so, we introduce Negative Correlation Forest (NCForest)
which allows for precise control over the diversity in the ensemble. We show,
that the diversity and the bias indeed have a crucial impact on the performance
of the RF. Having too low diversity collapses the performance of the RF into a
a single tree, whereas having too much diversity means that most trees do not
produce correct outputs anymore. However, in-between these two extremes we find
a large range of different trade-offs with all roughly equal performance.
Hence, the specific trade-off between bias and diversity does not matter as
long as the algorithm reaches this good trade-off regime.

of photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion has found several uses
in quantum information science, however, it is not suitable for applications
involving long-distance propagation as the entanglement decays very rapidly

centimetres of propagation, and the effect becomes even more pronounced in
turbulent environments. In contrast, in this article, we show that entanglement
in the angle-orbital angular momentum (OAM) bases exhibits a remarkably
different behaviour. As with the position-momentum case, initially, the
angle-OAM entanglement decays with propagation, but as the photons continue to
travel further from the source, the photons regain their strongly correlated
behaviour, and the entanglement returns. We theoretically and experimentally
demonstrate this behaviour and show that entanglement returns even in the
presence of strong turbulence. The only effect of turbulence is to increase the
propagation distance for revival, but once revived, the two photons remain
entangled up to an arbitrary propagation distance. This work highlights the
role that OAM-angle entanglement will play in applications where quantum

weakening instabilities and earthquakes. Here, we simulate steady-state

conditions are tested and the two types of boundary conditions are found to
yield distinct velocity profiles and friction laws. The inertial number, $I$,
exerts the largest control on the layers' behavior, but additional dependencies
of friction on normal stress and thickness of the layer are observed under
constant stress boundary condition. We find that shear-band localization, which
is present in the quasistatic regime ($I<10^{-3}$) in rate-controlled shear, is
absent under stress-controlled loading. In the latter case, flow ceases when
macroscopic friction coefficient approaches the quasistatic friction value. The
inertial regime that occurs at higher inertial numbers ($I>10^{-3}$) is
associated with distributed shear, and friction and porosity that increase with
shear rate (rate-strengthening regime). The finding that shear under constant
stress boundary condition produces the inertial, distributed shear but never
quasistatic, localized deformation is rationalized based on low fluctuations of
shear forces in granular contacts for stress-controlled loading. By examining
porosity within and outside a shear band, we also provide a mechanical reason
why the transition between quasistatic and inertial shear coincides with the
transition between localized and distributed strain.

operating in the convective zone is a challenging problem because the dynamo
action is hidden below the photosphere. Here we present results of a
statistical study of flaring active regions (ARs) that produced strong solar
flares of an X-ray class X1.0 and higher during a time period that covered
solar cycles 23 and 24. We introduced a magneto-morphological classification
(MMC) of ARs, which allowed us to estimate possible contribution of the
turbulent component of the dynamo into the structure of an AR. We found that in
72\% of cases, flaring ARs do not comply with the empirical laws of the global
dynamo (frequently they are not bipolar ARs, or, if they are, they violate
either Hale polarity law, or the Joy's law, or the leading sunspot prevalence
rule), which may be attributed to the influence of the turbulent dynamo action
inside the convective zone on spatial scales of typical ARs. Thus it appears
that the flaring is governed by the turbulent component of solar dynamo. A
contribution into the flaring from these ARs-``violators'' is enhanced during
the second maximum and the descending phase of a solar cycle, when the toroidal
field weakens and the influence of the turbulent component becomes more
pronounced. These observational findings are in consensus with a concept of the
essential role of non-linearities and turbulent intermittency in the magnetic
fields generation inside the convective zone, which follows from simulations of
dynamo.

sparsity of LiDAR points in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a
Siamese voxel-to-BEV tracker, which can significantly improve the tracking
performance in sparse 3D point clouds. Specifically, it consists of a Siamese
shape-aware feature learning network and a voxel-to-BEV target localization
network. The Siamese shape-aware feature learning network can capture 3D shape
information of the object to learn the discriminative features of the object so
that the potential target from the background in sparse point clouds can be
identified. To this end, we first perform template feature embedding to embed
the template's feature into the potential target and then generate a dense 3D
shape to characterize the shape information of the potential target. For
localizing the tracked target, the voxel-to-BEV target localization network
regresses the target's 2D center and the $z$-axis center from the dense bird's
eye view (BEV) feature map in an anchor-free manner. Concretely, we compress
the voxelized point cloud along $z$-axis through max pooling to obtain a dense
BEV feature map, where the regression of the 2D center and the $z$-axis center

given discrete vector field on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The framework
exploits the concept of acyclic matching, a combinatorial tool at the core of
discrete Morse theory. We introduce the new concept of complete acyclic
matchings and we show that they give the same end result of Gaussian
elimination. Basically, instead of doing costly row and column operations on a
sparse matrix, we compute equivalent cheap combinatorial operations that
preserve the underlying sparsity structure. Currently, the most efficient
algorithms proposed in literature to find discrete vector potentials make use
of tree-cotree techniques. We show that they compute a special type of complete
acyclic matchings. Moreover, we show that the problem of computing them is
equivalent to the problem of deciding whether a given mesh has a topological
property called collapsibility. This fact gives a topological characterization
of well-known termination problems of tree-cotree techniques. We propose a new
recursive algorithm to compute discrete vector potentials. It works directly on
basis elements of $1$- and $2$-chains by performing elementary Gaussian
operations on them associated with acyclic matchings. However, the main novelty
is that it can be applied recursively. Indeed, the recursion process allows us
to sidetrack termination problems of the standard tree-cotree techniques. We
tested the algorithm on pathological triangulations with known topological
obstructions. In all tested problems we observe linear computational complexity
as a function of mesh size. Moreover, the algorithm is purely graph-based so it
is straightforward to implement and does not require specialized external
procedures. We believe that our framework could offer new perspectives to
sparse matrix computations.

and Ib, respectively) are the explosions of massive stars that have lost some
or most of their outer envelopes. How they lose their mass is unclear, but it
likely involves binary interaction. So far, seven progenitors of such
supernovae have been identified in pre-explosion imaging (five for Type IIb
events and two for Type Ib events). Here, we evolve detailed binary stellar
evolution models in order to better understand the nature of these progenitors.
We find that the amount of hydrogen left in the envelope at the time of
explosion greatly depends on the post-interaction mass-loss rate. The leftover
hydrogen, in turn, strongly affects progenitor properties, such as temperature
and photospheric radius, in non-trivial ways. Together with extinction and
distance uncertainties in progenitor data, it is difficult to deduce an
accurate progenitor hydrogen mass from pre-explosion imaging. We quantify this
uncertainty and find that available data are consistent with a proposed Type
Ib-IIb hydrogen mass threshold of approximately 0.033 Msun, implying that even
Type Ib progenitors are not pure helium stars. These results alleviate the
proposed tension between the Type Ib classification of SN 2019yvr and its
candidate progenitor properties. We also estimate the brightness of a surviving
2019yvr progenitor companion, which might be detected in future observations.

Using the IR, we find a similar O/H--N/O relation to that known in the optical.
As opposite, we find systematically lower N/O IR abundances when compared to
the optical determinations, especially at high values of N/O (log(N/O) > -0.8).
We explore various hypotheses to account for this difference: (i) difference in
ionization structure traced by optical (O+, N+ regions) versus IR lines (O++,
N++ regions); (ii) contamination of diffuse ionized gas affecting the optical
lines used to compute the N/O abundance; (iii) dust obscuration affecting the
optical-based determinations. However, we have not found any correlation of the
Delta(N/O)= (N/O)_OPT-(N/O)_IR with either ionization, or electron density, or
optical extinction. We speculatively suggest that accretion of metal-poor gas

difference, because the rapid decrease of total abundances during infall is
followed by a N/O ratio decrease due to primary production of young - possibly
embedded - massive stars, are preferentially traced by the IR diagnostics,
while optical diagnostics would better trace the secondary production, when

ungratified performance on regression tasks because the nature between these
and classification tasks differs. In this paper, a novel sign-exponent-only
floating-point network (SEOFP-NET) technique is proposed to compress the model
size and accelerate the inference time for speech enhancement, a regression
task of speech signal processing. The proposed method compressed the sizes of
deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement models by quantizing the
fraction bits of single-precision floating-point parameters during training.
Before inference implementation, all parameters in the trained SEOFP-NET model
are slightly adjusted to accelerate the inference time by replacing the
floating-point multiplier with an integer-adder. For generalization, the
SEOFP-NET technique is introduced to different speech enhancement tasks in
speech signal processing with different model architectures under various
corpora. The experimental results indicate that the size of SEOFP-NET models
can be significantly compressed by up to 81.249% without noticeably downgrading
their speech enhancement performance, and the inference time can be accelerated
to 1.212x compared with the baseline models. The results also verify that the
proposed SEOFP-NET can cooperate with other efficiency strategies to achieve a
synergy effect for model compression. In addition, the just noticeable
difference (JND) was applied to the user study experiment to statistically
analyze the effect of speech enhancement on listening. The results indicate
that the listeners cannot facilely differentiate between the enhanced speech
signals processed by the baseline model and the proposed SEOFP-NET.

stellar light curves are usually phase-folded over a range of trial epochs and
periods. This approach, however, is not applicable in a straightforward manner
to exomoons. Planet-moon transits either have to be modeled in great detail
(including their orbital dynamics, mutual eclipses etc.), which is
computationally expensive, or key simplifications have to be assumed. One such
simplification is to search for moon transits outside of the planetary
transits. The question we address in this report is how much in-transit data of
an exomoon remains uncontaminated by the near-simultaneous transits of its host
planet. We develop an analytical framework and test our results with a

reduction to 42%. These values are astonishingly small. The gain in speed for
any exomoon transit search algorithm that ignores the planetary in-transit data
comes at the heavy price of losing a substantial fraction of what is supposedly
a tiny signal in the first place.

influence the mechanical properties of the outcoming material. Given the scarce

combination with ion selective electrodes, effects of additives on the
formation of C-S-H can be monitored and quantified resulting in new insights
into the C-S-H formation in the presence of additives. Thus, this work can be
regarded as a step towards a facilitated design of tailor-made C-S-H, which

2256 at low frequencies, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope

prominent known relics, with a remarkably spectacular network of filamentary
substructures. The new uGMRT (300-850 MHz) and LOFAR (120-169 MHz)
observations, combined with the archival Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA;
1-4 GHz) data, allowed us to carry out the first spatially resolved spectral
analysis of the exceptional relic emission down to 6 arcsec resolution over a
broad range of frequencies. Our new sensitive radio images confirm the presence
of complex filaments of magnetized relativistic plasma also at low frequencies.
We find that the integrated spectrum of the relic is consistent with a single
power law, without any sign of spectral steepening, at least below 3 GHz.
Unlike previous claims, the relic shows an integrated spectral index of
$-1.07\pm0.02$ between 144 MHz and 3 GHz, which is consistent with the
(quasi)stationary shock approximation. The spatially resolved spectral analysis
suggests that the relic surface very likely traces the complex shock front,
with a broad distribution of Mach numbers propagating through a turbulent and
dynamically active intracluster medium. Our results show that the northern part
of the relic is seen edge-on and the southern part close to face-on. We suggest
that the complex filaments are regions where higher Mach numbers dominate the
(re-)acceleration of electrons that are responsible for the observed radio
emission.

Cooperating Searching (TMICS), for dealing with various video rain

cannot cover various rain streaks distribution, we first design a
hyper-parameter optimization model about task variable and hyper-parameter.
Based on the proposed optimization model, we design a collaborative structure
for video deraining. This structure includes Dominant Network Architecture

introducing an Attention-based Averaging Scheme (AAS). To better explore
inter-frame information from videos, we introduce a macroscopic structure
searching scheme that searches from Optical Flow Module (OFM) and Temporal

differentiable neural architecture searching from a compact candidate set of
task-specific operations to discover desirable rain streaks removal

It is assumed that the academic age, or the time elapsed from the first

limitations of the proxy in academic career studies, using as an example the
entire population of Polish academic scientists visible in the last decade in
global science and holding at least a PhD (N = 20,569). The proxy works well
for science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM)
disciplines; however, for non-STEMM disciplines (particularly for humanities
and social sciences), it has a dramatically worse performance. This negative
conclusion is particularly important for systems that have only become recently
visible in global academic journals. The micro-level data suggest a delayed
participation of social scientists and humanists in global science networks,
with practical implications for predicting biological age from academic age. We
calculate correlation coefficients, present contingency analysis of academic
career stages with academic positions and age groups, and create a linear
multivariate regression model. Our research suggests that in scientifically
developing countries, academic age as a proxy for biological age should be used
more cautiously than in advanced countries: ideally, it should be used only for

radicalisation and recruitment. To illustrate a few potential uses, we apply
statistical and data-mining techniques to analyse the online extremist

involved a global array of 24 ground radio telescopes observing at 5 GHz and 22
GHz, together with the Space Radio Telescope (SRT). Furthermore, the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) and the phased Very Large Array (VLA) observed the source
quasi-simultaneously at 15 GHz and 43 GHz. Fringes between the ground array and
the SRT were detected on baseline lengths up to 8.1 times the Earth's diameter,
providing unprecedented resolution for 3C 84 at these wavelengths. We note that
the corresponding fringe spacing is 125 microarcsec at 5 GHz and 27 microarcsec

increased power of the young jet is inflating a bubble of hot plasma as it
carves its way through the ambient medium of the central region of the galaxy.
Here, we estimate the minimum energy stored in the mini-cocoon, along with its
pressure, volume, expansion speed, and the ratio of heavy particles to
relativistic electrons, as well as the density of the ambient medium. About
half of the energy delivered by the jet is dumped into the mini-cocoon and the
quasi-spherical shape of the bubble suggests that this energy may be
transferred to a significantly larger volume of the interstellar medium than
what would be accomplished by the well-collimated jet on its own. The pressure
of the hot mini-cocoon also provides a natural explanation for the almost

$10-100$\,\tiny{ A.U.} from moderately bright stars ($T_{\rm eff} \sim
8,000-10,000$\,K). They have also been extracted from primitive meteorites;
some of these are clearly pre-solar, that is to say that they formed far from
the solar system and therefore traversed the interstellar medium, where they
must exist but, because we see no evidence of them, must be extremely well
hidden. Our goal is to understand if it is possible to constrain the sizes and
shapes of nano-diamonds in circumstellar media using the observed ratio,
[CH]/[CH$_2$], of their surface CH$_2$ and CH infrared bands at $\simeq
3.43\,\mu$m and $\simeq 3.53\,\mu$m, respectively. We calculated the CH and
CH$_2$ abundances on nano-diamonds using two approaches. The first assumes
regular and semi-regular polyhedra (tetrahedra, octahedra, and cubes and their
truncated forms). The second uses a diamond bonding network to derive the
structures of tetrahedral and octahedral particles, and their truncated
variants, and also of spherical nano-diamonds. As a function of the particle
size and shape, and for the two different calculation methods, we derived the
relative abundance ratio [CH]/[CH$_2$], which can then be weighted by their
laboratory-measured infrared band intensities. The two methods give good
agreement and indicate that the spread in values, over the different particle
forms, is more that an order of magnitude for any size. We conclude that the
ratio [CH]/[CH$_2$], and their infrared band ratio, strongly depend upon
particle size and shape. For a given shape or size, the ratio can vary by more
than an order of magnitude. It may therefore be difficult to constrain
nano-diamond sizes using the observed $3-4\,\mu$m spectra alone. James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectra may help, but only if bands are
size-specific.

typical for strong field Quantum Electrodynamics is of fundamental importance.
One of the most promising intensification schemes is based on the
relativistic-flying mirror concept, which shows that the electromagnetic
radiation reflected by the mirror will be frequency up-shifted by a factor of 4
gamma^2 (gamma: the Lorentz factor of the mirror). In laser-plasma
interactions, such a mirror travels with relativistic velocities and typically
has a parabolic form, which is advantageous for light intensification. Thus, a
relativistic-flying parabolic mirror reflects the counter-propagating radiation
in a form of focused and flying electromagnetic wave with a high frequency. The
relativistic-flying motion of the laser focus makes the electric and magnetic
field distributions of the focus complicated, and the mathematical expressions
describing the field distributions of the focus is important. We present
analytical expressions describing the field distribution formed by an ideal
flying mirror having a perfect reflectance over the entire surface and
wavelength range. The peak field strength of an incident laser pulse with a
center wavelength of lambda_0 and an effective beam radius of w_e is enhanced
by a factor proportional to gamma^3 (w_e/lambda_0) in the relativistic limit.
Electron-positron pair production is investigated in the context of invariant
fields based on the enhanced electromagnetic field. The pair production rate
under the relativistic-flying laser focus is modified by the Lorentz
gamma-factor and the beam radius-wavelength ratio (w_e/lambda_0). We show that
the electron-positron pairs can be created by colliding two counter-propagating
relativistic-flying laser focuses in vacuum, each of which is formed when a 180
TW laser pulse is reflected by a relativistic-flying parabolic mirror with a
gamma = 12.2.

role in the single degenerate scenario for the progenitors of type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous studies on the WD + main sequence star evolution
have shown that the magnetic fields of WDs may significantly influence their
accretion and nuclear burning processes. In this work we focus on the evolution
of magnetized WD + He star binaries with detailed stellar evolution and binary
population synthesis (BPS) calculations. In the case of magnetized WDs, the
magnetic fields may disrupt the inner regions of the accretion disk, funnel the
accretion flow onto the polar caps, and even confine helium burning within the
caps.We find that, for WDs with sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the
parameter space of the potential SN Ia progenitor systems shrinks toward
shorter orbital periods and lower donor masses compared with that in the
non-magnetized WD case. The reason is that the magnetic confinement usually
works with relatively high mass transfer rates, which can trigger strong wind
mass loss from the WD, thus limiting the He-rich mass accumulation efficiency.
The surviving companion stars are likely of low-mass at the moment of the SN
explosions, which can be regarded as a possible explanation for the
non-detection of surviving companions after the SNe or inside the SN remnants.
However, the corresponding birthrate of Galactic SNe Ia in our high-magnetic
models is estimated to be ~(0.08-0.13) * 10^{-3} yr^{-1}( ~0.17-0.28 *
10^{-3}yr^{-1} for the non-magnetic models), significantly lower than the
observed Galactic SN Ia birthrate.

skills of students for a given learning domain. It is one of the key components

In parallel with the success of deep neural networks in other fields, we have
seen researchers take similar approaches in the learning science community.
However, most existing deep learning based knowledge tracing models either: (1)
only use the correct/incorrect response (ignoring useful information from other
modalities) or (2) design their network architectures through domain expertise
via trial and error. In this paper, we propose a sequential model based
optimization approach that combines multimodal fusion and neural architecture
search within one framework. The commonly used neural architecture search
technique could be considered as a special case of our proposed approach when
there is only one modality involved. We further propose to use a new metric
called time-weighted Area Under the Curve (weighted AUC) to measure how a
sequence model performs with time. We evaluate our methods on two public real
datasets showing the discovered model is able to achieve superior performance.
Unlike most existing works, we conduct McNemar's test on the model predictions

solutions and cutting-edge technologies to access spin physics in polarised
fixed-target collisions at high energy, exploring the unique kinematic regime
offered by LHC and exploiting new final states by means of the LHCb detector.
The forward geometry of the LHCb spectrometer is perfectly suited for the
reconstruction of particles produced in fixed-target collisions. This
configuration, with centre of mass energies ranging from
$\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=115~\rm{GeV}$ in $p-p$ interactions to
$\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=72~\rm{GeV}$ in heavy ion collisions, allows to cover a
wide backward rapidity region, including the poorly explored high$-x$ regime.
With the instrumentation of the proposed target system, LHCb will become the
first experiment simultaneously collecting unpolarised beam-beam collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=14~\rm{TeV}$ and both unpolarised and polarised beam-target
collisions. The status of the project is presented along with a selection of
physics opportunities.

(THEMIS) this work investigates in detail the surface processes and chemistry
relating to core/mantle interstellar and cometary grain structures and its
influence on the nature of these fascinating particles. It appears that a
realistic consideration of the nature and chemical reactivity of interstellar
grain surfaces could self-consistently and within a coherent framework explain:
the anomalous oxygen depletion, the nature of the CO dark gas, the formation of
'polar ice' mantles, the red wing on the 3 um water ice band, the basis for the
O-rich chemistry observed in hot cores, the origin of organic nano-globules and
the \sim 3.2 um 'carbonyl' absorption band observed in comet reflectance
spectra. It is proposed that the reaction of gas phase species with
carbonaceous a- C(:H) grain surfaces in the interstellar medium, in particular
the incorporation of atomic oxygen into grain surfaces in epoxide functional
groups, is the key to explaining these observations. Thus, the chemistry of
cosmic dust is much more intimately related with that of the interstellar gas
than has previously been considered. The current models for interstellar gas
and dust chemistry will therefore most likely need to be fundamentally modified
to include these new grain surface processes.

between the up- and down-quark mass basis in the Standard Model (SM). The
observation of first row CKM unitarity violation has recently emerged as a new
anomaly of the SM, known as the ""Cabibbo Angle Anomaly"" (CAA). With current
measurements, comparing the elements $V_{ud}$ and $V_{us}$ extracted from beta
and kaon decays respectively, the tension with the SM prediction amounts to
$\sim$$3\,\sigma$. Recently, it has been pointed out that this anomaly can also
be seen as a discrepancy in the determination of the Fermi constant from muon
decay vs $\beta$ and K decays, once CKM unitarity is assumed. In fact, possible
explanations in terms on New Physics fall under two broad classes:
contributions to $\beta$ decay and/or to $\mu$ decay. In this proceedings, we
discuss these solutions in terms of gauge invariant dimension 6 operators in
SMEFT and simplified extensions of the Standard Model. The latter could
introduce correlations with other anomalies in the SM, pointing to new and

static observables of neutron stars (NSs) accessible by multi-messenger

properties are not enough to discern conventional NSs from hybrid stars.
However, if one assumes that hadrons present in the neutron star core are only
neutrons and protons, the lepton fraction is in principle determined
unequivocally by the condition of chemical equilibrium. Using a simple
analytical method based on a polynomial expansion of the EoS, we show that
multiple solutions are possible to the beta-equilibrium equation, leading to a
characteristic indetermination on the composition of the interiors of NSs, even
in the purely nucleonic hypothesis. We further show that additional empirical
information on symmetric matter at high densities are not very efficient to pin
down the composition, if uncertainties on measurements are accounted for. We
conclude that constraints on the symmetry energy at high densities only, can
make meaningful impact to decipher the composition of neutron star core. Our
results give a lower limit to the uncertainty on the NS core composition that

working within the constraints of limited run time and computing power. This
work is compared against other real time segmentation methods on a dataset

this case, the target area is defined as the artificial grass field. The method
is also tested on a maritime dataset collected by a moving vessel, where the
aim is to separate the ocean region from the rest of the image. This dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model can generalise to a variety of vision

that atmospheric evaporation is variable, going from undetected to enhanced
evaporation in a $1.5$-year interval. Coincidentally or not, when HD189733b was
observed to be evaporating, a stellar flare had just occurred 8h prior to the
observation. This led to the question of whether this temporal variation in
evaporation occurred due to the flare, an unseen associated coronal mass
ejection (CME), or even the effect of both simultaneously. In this work, we
investigate the impact of flares (radiation), winds, and CMEs (particles) on
the atmosphere of HD189733b using 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of
atmospheric evaporation that self-consistently include stellar photon heating.
We study four cases: first- the quiescent phase of the star including stellar
wind, second- a flare, third- a CME, and fourth- a flare that is followed by a
CME. Compared to the quiescent case, we find that the flare alone increases the
evaporation rate by only 25%, while the CME leads to a factor of 4 increase in
escape rate. We calculate Ly-$\alpha$ synthetic transits and find that the
flare alone cannot explain the observed high blueshifted velocities seen in the
Ly-$\alpha$ observation. The CME, however, leads to an increase in the velocity
of the escaping atmosphere, enhancing the transit depth at high blueshifted
velocities. While the effects of CMEs show a promising potential to explain the
blueshifted line feature, our models are not able to fully explain the
blueshifted transit depths, indicating that they might require additional
physical mechanisms.

specifically Huff's curves and the Hessian family of elliptic curves (like
Hessian, twisted Hessian and generalized Hessian curves) with a point of order
$3$. We bring up some known compression functions on those models and present
new ones as well. For (almost) every presented compression function,
differential addition and point doubling formulas are shown. As in the case of
high-degree compression functions manual investigation of differential addition

$2$. Moreover, one may find, defined for this compression function,
differential addition and doubling formulas of the same efficiency as

we present an ab-initio analysis of EE for the Ising model in the presence of a
topological defect. While the behavior of the EE depends, as expected, on the
geometric arrangement of the subsystem with respect to the defect, we find that
zero-energy modes give rise to crucial finite-size corrections. Importantly,
contrary to the field-theory predictions, the universal subleading term in the
EE when the defect lies at the edge of the subsystem arises entirely due to
these zero-energy modes and is not directly related to the modular S-matrix of
the Ising CFT.

how the robot learns, it is equally important that this learning is transparent
to the human teacher. Visual displays that show the robot's uncertainty can
potentially communicate this information; however, we hypothesize that visual
feedback mechanisms miss out on the physical connection between the human and

conforms to the surface of a robot arm, adding a haptic signal at an existing

demonstrate how soft actuation creates a salient haptic signal while still
allowing flexibility in device mounting. Using a psychophysics experiment, we
show that users can accurately distinguish inflation levels of the wrapped
display with an average Weber fraction of 11.4%. When we place the wrapped
display around the arm of a robotic manipulator, users are able to interpret
and leverage the haptic signal in sample robot learning tasks, improving
identification of areas where the robot needs more training and enabling the

$(\mathrm{tw},\omega)$-boundedness also has useful algorithmic implications for

  We provide a partial answer to this question by means of a new min-max graph
invariant related to tree decompositions. We define the independence number of
a tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph as the maximum independence
number over all subgraphs of $G$ induced by some bag of $\mathcal{T}$. The
tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is then defined as the minimum
independence number over all tree decompositions of $G$. Generalizing a result
on chordal graphs due to Cameron and Hell from 2006, we show that if a graph is
given together with a tree decomposition with bounded independence number, then
the Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem can be solved in polynomial

difference equations in finite dimensions. After giving the definition, we
study the extent to which the projection $P(k)$ in a dichotomy is unique. For
equations on $\mathbb{Z}$ it is unique but for equations on $\mathbb{Z}_+$ only
its range is unique and for $\mathbb{Z}_-$ only its nullspace.
  Here we strengthen Kalkbrenner's results and give a complete characterization
of all possible projections.
  Next we study the possibility of extending the dichotomy to a larger
interval. We reproduce the results of P\"" otzsche but also show exactly when
the original projection remains unchanged.
  Next we prove that the roughness theorem, well known for additive
perturbations, holds for multiplicative perturbations also. The proof uses
ideas of Zhou, Lu and Zhang.
  Finally, following Ducrot, Magal and Seydi, we mention that the results by
Palmer on finite time conditions on dichotomy for the invertible case can be
extended to the noninvertible case.

latent space of generative models. The objective is to identify semantic
directions in latent space. To this end, we propose to fit a multilinear tensor
model on a structured facial expression database, which is initially embedded
into latent space. We validate our approach on StyleGAN trained on FFHQ using
BU-3DFE as a structured facial expression database. We show how the parameters
of the multilinear tensor model can be approximated by Alternating Least
Squares. Further, we introduce a tacked style-separated tensor model, defined
as an ensemble of style-specific models to integrate our approach with the
extended latent space of StyleGAN. We show that taking the individual styles of
the extended latent space into account leads to higher model flexibility and
lower reconstruction error. Finally, we do several experiments comparing our
approach to former work on both GANs and multilinear models. Concretely, we
analyze the expression subspace and find that the expression trajectories meet
at an apathetic face that is consistent with earlier work. We also show that by
changing the pose of a person, the generated image from our approach is closer
to the ground truth than results from two competing approaches.

gravitational synchrotron radiation (GSR), i.e., the direct emission by the
bending of the trajectory of a relativistic charged particle, much like the
conventional electromagnetic synchrotron radiation (EMSR), albeit with
characteristic difference in their radiation spectra. While the conventional
EMSR spectrum peaks at the critical frequency,
$\omega_c=\gamma^3\omega_0\gg\omega_0$, the spectrum of GSR peaks at the
storage ring fundamental frequency $\omega_0$, which is much lower. The other
is the resonant conversion of EMSR to GWs at the same frequency through the
storage ring bending magnets, i.e., the Gertsenshtein effect. Invoking LHC at
CERN as a numerical example, we found that the spacetime perturbation
associated with GSR, $h\sim 5\times 10^{-40}$, falls far below the sensitivity
of GW detectors based on the LIGO-type Michelson interferometry approach. On

presence of a powerful and highly variable disk wind, where two possible phases
outflowing with $v_{\rm out1}/c\sim -0.07$ and $v_{\rm out2}/c\sim -0.2$ were
observed. Multi-epoch X-ray observations, covering the period from 2010 to
2018, showed that the lower velocity component is persistent, as it was
detected in all the observations, while the faster phase outflowing with
$v_{\rm out2}/c\sim -0.2$ appeared to be more sporadic. Here we present the
analysis of a new monitoring campaign of MCG-03-58-007 performed in May-June
2019 and consisting of four simultaneous XMM-Newton & NuSTAR observations. We
confirm that the disk wind in MCG-03-58-007 is persistent, as it is detected in
all the observations, and powerful, having a kinetic power that ranges between
0.5-10% of the Eddington luminosity. The highly ionized wind (log($ \xi/{\rm

its velocity. This is the first time where we have observed a substantial
variability of the outflowing velocity in a disk wind, which dropped from
$v_{\rm {out}}/c\sim -0.2$ (as measured in the first three observations) to
$v_{\rm {out}}/c\sim -0.074$ in just 16 days. We conclude that such a dramatic
and fast variability of the outflowing velocity could be due to the
acceleration of the wind, as recently proposed by Mizumoto et al. (2021). Here,
the faster wind, seen in the first three observations, is already accelerated
to $v_{\rm {out}}/c \sim -0.2$, while in the last observation our line of sight
intercepts only the slower, pre-accelerated streamline.

sublattice, has attracted considerable attention because it may be a
realization of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Recently, a new honeycomb
material, $\alpha$-RuI$_3$, was prepared under moderate high-pressure and it is
stable under ambient conditions. However, different from $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$,
$\alpha$-RuI$_3$ was reported to be a paramagnetic metal without long-range
magnetic order down to $0.35$ K. Here, the structural and electronic properties
of the quasi-two-dimensional $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ are theoretically studied. First,
based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the ABC
stacking honeycomb-layer $R\overline{3}$ (No. 148) structure is found to be the
most likely stacking order for $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ along the $c$-axis.
Furthermore, both $R\overline{3}$ and $P\overline{3}1c$ are dynamically stable
because no imaginary frequency modes were obtained in the phononic dispersion
spectrum. Moreover, the different physical behavior of $\alpha$-RuI$_3$
compared to $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ can be understood naturally. The strong
hybridization between Ru $4d$ and I $5p$ orbitals decreases the effective
atomic Hubbard repulsion $U$, leading the electrons of RuI$_3$ to be less
localized than in RuCl$_3$. As a consequence, the effective repulsion $U$ is
reduced from Cl to I, leading to the metallic nature of $\alpha$-RuI$_3$. Based
on the DFT+$U$ ($U_{\rm eff} = 2$ eV), plus spin-orbital coupling (SOC), we
obtained a spin-orbit Mott insulating behavior for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and, by
the same procedure, a metallic behavior for $\alpha$-RuI$_3$, in good agreement
with experimental results. Furthermore, when introducing a large (unrealistic)
$U_{\rm eff} = 6$ eV, the spin-orbit Mott gap opens in $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ as
well, supporting the physical picture we are proposing.

main challenge of this approach is to have enough resolution at the interface
to approach the sharp-interface methods. The method presented here addresses
this problem by solving the phase field variable on a mesh twice as fine as
that used for the velocities, pressure, and polymer-stress constitutive
equations. The method is based on second-order finite differences for the
discretization of the fully coupled Navier-Stokes, polymeric constitutive and
Cahn-Hilliard equations, and it is implemented in a 2D pencil-like domain
decomposition to benefit from existing highly-scalable parallel algorithms. A
FFT-based solver is used for the Helmholtz and Poisson equations with different

impose the dynamic contact angle boundary conditions in the case of large

and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by
analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during
fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically
measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized
self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling
methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance
traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to
correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less
confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of
image and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our
approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image
classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the
target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline
methods by 3.56% on average in two noisy settings.

distance of the client to its closest facility, plus (a small constant times)
the truncated distance to its second-closest facility. We move from one
solution to another only if the latter can be obtained by swapping a constant
number of facilities, and has a smaller potential than the former. This refined

recently. The proportionality between migration speed and the disc's viscosity
is broken by the presence of vortices that appear at the edges of the
planet-induced gap. Our goal is to investigate vortex-driven migration in
low-viscosity discs in the presence of radial advection of gas, as expected
from angular momentum removal by magnetised disc winds. We performed three
dimensional simulations using the grid-based code FARGOCA. We mimicked the
effects of a disc wind by applying a synthetic torque on a surface layer of the
disc characterised by a prescribed column density Sigma_A so that it results in
a disc accretion rate of 10^-8 Solar masses per year. Discs with this structure
are called 'layered' and the layer where the torque is applied is denoted as
'active'. We also consider the case of accretion focussed near the disc
midplane to mimic transport properties induced by a large Hall effect or by
weak Ohmic diffusion. We observe two migration phases: in the first phase, the
migration of the planet is driven by the vortex and is directed inwards. This
phase ends when the vortex disappear. Migration depends on the ability of the
torque from the planet to block the accretion flow. When the flow is fast and
unimpeded (small Sigma_A) migration is very slow. When the accretion flow is
completely blocked, migration is faster and the speed is controlled by the rate
at which the accretion flow refills the gap behind the migrating planet. The
migration speed of a giant planet in a layered protoplanetary disc depends on
the thickness of the accreting layer. The lack of large-scale migration
apparently experienced by the majority of giant exoplanets can be explained if
the accreting layer is sufficiently thin to allow unimpeded accretion through
the disc.

is of great clinical significance but extremely challenging due to bleeding,
lighting reflection, and motion blur in the complicated surgical environment.
Compared with existing solutions, which either neglect geometric relationships
among targeting objects or capture the relationships by using complicated
aggregation schemes, the proposed network is capable of achieving satisfactory
accuracy while maintaining real-time performance by taking full advantage of
the spatial relations among landmarks. We first devise an algorithm to
automatically generate relation keypoint heatmaps, which are able to
intuitively represent the prior knowledge of spatial relations among landmarks
without using any extra manual annotation efforts. We then develop two
complementary regularization schemes to progressively incorporate the prior
knowledge into the training process. While one scheme introduces pixel-level
regularization by multi-task learning, the other integrates global-level
regularization by harnessing a newly designed grouped consistency evaluator,
which adds relation constraints to the proposed network in an adversarial
manner. Both schemes are beneficial to the model in training, and can be
readily unloaded in inference to achieve real-time detection. We establish a
large in-house dataset of ESD surgery for esophageal cancer to validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy and efficiency, achieving better detection results faster. Promising
results on two downstream applications further corroborate the great potential

large-scale pre-training and have high computational complexity. Furthermore,
SA can only model self-affinities within a single sample, ignoring the

a novel brain tumor segmentation network in the case of missing one or more

feature-enhanced generator, a correlation constraint block and a segmentation
network. The feature-enhanced generator utilizes the available modalities to
generate 3D feature-enhanced image representing the missing modality. The
correlation constraint block can exploit the multi-source correlation between
the modalities and also constrain the generator to synthesize a
feature-enhanced modality which must have a coherent correlation with the
available modalities. The segmentation network is a multi-encoder based U-Net
to achieve the final brain tumor segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated
on BraTS 2018 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method which achieves the average Dice Score of 82.9, 74.9 and

important approaches for pursuing users to save energy in residences. This can
help in identifying faulty devices and wasted energy by devices when left On

of individual devices without intrusive sensors on each device. Non-intrusive
load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, is a blind source separation
problem which requires a system to estimate the electricity usage of individual
appliances from the aggregated household energy consumption. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for performing load
disaggregation on low frequency power data obtained from residential
households. We combine a series of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural
Networks and Long Short Term Memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to extract features that can
identify active appliances and retrieve their power consumption given the
aggregated household power value. We used CNNs to extract features from main
readings in a given time frame and then used those features to classify if a
given appliance is active at that time period or not. Following that, the
extracted features are used to model a generation problem using LSTM. We train
the LSTM to generate the disaggregated energy consumption of a particular
appliance. Our neural network is capable of generating detailed feedback of
demand-side, providing vital insights to the end-user about their electricity
consumption. The algorithm was designed for low power offline devices such as
ESP32. Empirical calculations show that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art on the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD).

be robust enough for determination of EC in low time complexity or not
well-scalable for large networks, hence rendering them practically unreliable/
computationally expensive. So, it is of the essence to develop a method that is
scalable in low computational time. Hence, we propose a deep learning model for
the identification of nodes with high Eigenvector Centrality. There have been a
few previous works in identifying the high ranked nodes with supervised
learning methods, but in real-world cases, the graphs are not labelled and
hence deployment of supervised learning methods becomes a hazard and its usage
becomes impractical. So, we devise CUL(Centrality with Unsupervised Learning)
method to learn the relative EC scores in a network in an unsupervised manner.
To achieve this, we develop an Encoder-Decoder based framework that maps the
nodes to their respective estimated EC scores. Extensive experiments were
conducted on different synthetic and real-world networks. We compared CUL
against a baseline supervised method for EC estimation similar to some of the
past works. It was observed that even with training on a minuscule number of
training datasets, CUL delivers a relatively better accuracy score when
identifying the higher ranked nodes than its supervised counterpart. We also
show that CUL is much faster and has a smaller runtime than the conventional
baseline method for EC computation. The code is available at

medium (ISM) that are likely to represent the initial conditions for massive

cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR) and chemical age, in different regions of the
massive IRDC G28.37+00.07 by comparing observed abundances of multiple
molecules and molecular ions with the predictions of astrochemical models. We
have computed a series of single-zone astrochemical models with a gas-grain
network that systematically explores the parameter space of density,
temperature, CRIR, and visual extinction. We have also investigated the effects
of choices of CO ice binding energy and temperatures achieved in transient
heating of grains when struck by cosmic rays. We selected 10 positions across
the IRDC that are known to have a variety of star formation activity. We
utilised mid-infrared (MIR) extinction maps and sub-mm emission maps to measure
the mass surface densities of these regions, needed for abundance and volume
density estimates. The sub-mm emission maps were also used to measure
temperatures. We then used IRAM-30m observations of various tracers to estimate
column densities and thus abundances. Using estimates of the abundances of CO,
HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$ we find consistency with astrochemical models that have
relatively low CRIRs of $\zeta \sim10^{-18}$ to $\sim10^{-17}\:{\rm s}^{-1}$,
with no evidence for systematic variation with the level of star formation
activity. Astrochemical ages are found to be < 1 Myr. We discuss potential
sources of systematic uncertainties in these results and the overall

phase-field method, the curvature-driven motion is always contained in the

{\phi}-equation. For reason of mass conservation, the {\mu}-equation is written
with a mixed formulation which involves the composition c and the chemical
potential. The closure relationship between c and {\mu} is derived by assuming
quadratic free energies of bulk phases. The anti-trapping current is also
considered in the composition equation for simulations with null solid
diffusion. The lattice Boltzmann schemes are implemented in LBM_saclay, a
numerical code running on various High Performance Computing architectures.
Validations are carried out with analytical solutions representative of
dissolution and precipitation. Simulations with or without counter term are
compared on the shape of porous medium characterized by microtomography. The
computations have run on a single GPU-V100.

realization-to-realization variability or a refined description of modeled
quantities. In that case, it is necessary to sample elements from unknown
high-dimensional spaces with possibly millions of degrees of freedom. While
there exist methods able to sample elements from probability density functions
(PDF) with known shapes, several approximations need to be made when the
distribution is unknown. In this paper the sampling method, as well as the
inference of the underlying distribution, are both handled with a data-driven
method known as generative adversarial networks (GAN), which trains two
competing neural networks to produce a network that can effectively generate
samples from the training set distribution. In practice, it is often necessary
to draw samples from conditional distributions. When the conditional variables
are continuous, only one (if any) data point corresponding to a particular
value of a conditioning variable may be available, which is not sufficient to
estimate the conditional distribution. This work handles this problem using an
a priori estimation of the conditional moments of a PDF. Two approaches,
stochastic estimation, and an external neural network are compared here for
computing these moments; however, any preferred method can be used. The
algorithm is demonstrated in the case of the deconvolution of a filtered
turbulent flow field. It is shown that all the versions of the proposed
algorithm effectively sample the target conditional distribution with minimal
impact on the quality of the samples compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Additionally, the procedure can be used as a metric for the diversity of
samples generated by a conditional GAN (cGAN) conditioned with continuous
variables.

  Periodogram and Gaussianity Assumptions",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mimicking and learning the long-term memory of efficient markets is a
fundamental problem in the interaction between machine learning and financial
economics to sequential data. Despite the prominence of this issue, current
treatments either remain largely limited to heuristic techniques or rely
significantly on periodogram or Gaussianty assumptions. In this paper, we
present the ApeRIodic SEmi-parametric (ARISE) process for investigating
efficient markets. The ARISE process is formulated as an infinite-sum function
of some known processes and employs the aperiodic spectrum estimation to
determine the key hyper-parameters, thus possessing the power and potential of
modeling the price data with long-term memory, non-stationarity, and aperiodic
spectrum. We further theoretically show that the ARISE process has the
mean-square convergence, consistency, and asymptotic normality without
periodogram and Gaussianity assumptions. In practice, we apply the ARISE
process to identify the efficiency of real-world markets. Besides, we also
provide two alternative ARISE applications: studying the long-term memorability
of various machine-learning models and developing a latent state-space model
for inference and forecasting of time series. The numerical experiments confirm
the superiority of our proposed approaches.

both the cylinder and floor are generally treated as rigid bodies in normal
textbooks. When the air resistance is ignored, the equation of motion has a
solution with a constant velocity. However, in the real world, permanent motion
does not occur. The difficulty cannot be solved only by the horizontal force,
because a horizontal force opposite the translational direction increases the
angular velocity of rotation around the center. Therefore other mechanisms need
to be examined. There are two main reasons for this result. 1) Both a cylinder
and a floor are not perfect circle and perfect plane, but have uneven surfaces.
The micro bumps on the surface yield small collisions in the direction
perpendicular to the floor. The collisions generate a rolling friction torque
around the center. 2) A strong force acts on the contact part which is
deformed. The high-speed deformation produces a history effect on the
relationship between stress and strain, because the compressed wave in the
contact part diffuses to the outside at the speed of sound. Therefore a rolling
friction torque is also generated. Both torques are caused by forces
perpendicular to the floor. The rolling friction torque eliminates the
discrepancy between the textbook results and reality by solving the
simultaneous differential equations of rotation and translation. This method is
useful for studying rolling systems such as trains and cars.

  strains in Railway Bridge members under train induced vibration","Accepted in ICDSMLA 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Bridge health monitoring using machine learning tools has become an efficient
and cost-effective approach in recent times. In the present study, strains in
railway bridge member, available from a previous study conducted by IIT
Guwahati has been utilized. These strain data were collected from an existing
bridge while trains were passing over the bridge. LSTM is used to train the
network and to predict strains in different members of the railway bridge.
Actual field data has been used for the purpose of predicting strain in
different members using strain data from a single member, yet it has been
observed that they are quite agreeable to those of ground truth values. This is
in spite of the fact that a lot of noise existed in the data, thus showing the
efficacy of LSTM in training and predicting even from noisy field data. This
may easily open up the possibility of collecting data from the bridge with a
much lesser number of sensors and predicting the strain data in other members
through LSTM network.

conceptual and computational simplicity, have been verified to be able to
provide promising results in tasks such as template matching, tending to yield
peaks that are sharper and narrower than those typically obtained by standard
cross-correlation, while also attenuating substantially secondary matchings. In
this work, the multiset-based correlations based on the real-valued multiset
Jaccard and coincidence indices are compared from the perspective of template
matching, with encouraging results which have implications for pattern
recognition, deep learning, and scientific modeling in general. The
multiset-based correlation methods, and especially the coincidence index,
presented remarkable performance characterized by sharper and narrower peaks
while secondary peaks were attenuated, which was maintained even in presence of
intense levels of noise. In particular, the two methods derived from the
coincidence index led to particularly interesting results. The cross
correlation, however, presented the best robustness to symmetric additive
noise, which suggested a new combination of the considered approaches. After a
preliminary investigation of the relative performance of the multiset
approaches, as well as the classic cross-correlation, a systematic comparison
framework is proposed and applied for the study of the aforementioned methods.
Several results are reported, including the confirmation, at least for the
considered type of data, of the coincidence correlation as providing enhanced
performance regarding detection of narrow, sharp peaks while secondary matches
are duly attenuated. The combined method also resulted promising for dealing
with signals in presence of intense additive noise.
