examples, among which the iterative methods have been demonstrated the ability
to find a strong attack. However, the computation of an adversarial
perturbation for a new data point requires solving a time-consuming
optimization problem from scratch. To generate a stronger attack, it normally
requires updating a data point with more iterations. In this paper, we show the
existence of a meta adversarial perturbation (MAP), a better initialization
that causes natural images to be misclassified with high probability after
being updated through only a one-step gradient ascent update, and propose an
algorithm for computing such perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments,
and the empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural
networks are vulnerable to meta perturbations. We further show that these
perturbations are not only image-agnostic, but also model-agnostic, as a single
perturbation generalizes well across unseen data points and different neural
network architectures.

to generate them. The main purpose of HEXME meshes is to enable consistent and
fair evaluation of hexahedral meshing algorithms and related techniques. The
tetrahedral meshes have been generated with Gmsh, starting from 63
computer-aided design (CAD) models coming from various databases. To highlight
and label the various and challenging aspects of hexahedral mesh generation,
the CAD models are classified into three categories: simple, nasty and
industrial. For each CAD model, we provide three kinds of tetrahedral meshes.
The mesh generation yielding those 189 tetrahedral meshes is defined thanks to
Snakemake, a modern workflow management system, which allows us to define a
fully automated, extensible and sustainable workflow. It is possible to
download the whole dataset or to pick some meshes by browsing the online
catalog. Since there is no doubt that the hexahedral meshing techniques are
going to progress, the HEXME dataset is also built with evolution in mind. A
public GitHub repository hosts the HEXME workflow, in which external
contributions and future releases are possible and encouraged.

with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The measurement uses a high-purity
selection of ~650k neutrino-induced muon tracks from the Northern celestial
hemisphere, corresponding to 9.5 years of experimental data. With respect to
previous publications, the measurement is improved by the increased size of the
event sample and the extended model testing beyond simple power-law hypotheses.
An updated treatment of systematic uncertainties and atmospheric background
fluxes has been implemented based on recent models. The best-fit single
power-law parameterization for the astrophysical energy spectrum results in a
normalization of $\phi_{\mathrm{@100TeV}}^{\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu} =
1.44_{-0.26}^{+0.25} \times
10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ and
a spectral index $\gamma_{\mathrm{SPL}} = 2.37_{-0.09}^{+0.09}$, constrained in
the energy range from $15\,\mathrm{TeV}$ to $5\,\mathrm{PeV}$. The model tests
include a single power law with a spectral cutoff at high energies, a
log-parabola model, several source-class specific flux predictions from the
literature and a model-independent spectral unfolding. The data is well
consistent with a single power law hypothesis, however, spectra with softening
above one PeV are statistically more favorable at a two sigma level.

We discuss a practical procedure of phase reconstruction by virtue of a

We exemplify the potential benefits and limitations of the approach by applying
it to a generic observable of a forced Stuart-Landau oscillator. Although in
many cases, unavoidable amplitude modulation of the observed signal does not
allow for perfect phase reconstruction, in cases of strong stability of
oscillations and a high frequency of the forcing, iterated Hilbert transform
embeddings significantly improve the quality of the reconstructed phase. We
also demonstrate that for significant amplitude modulation, iterated embeddings

Gladyshev estimators in an entirely model-free setting, because no assumption

our proof is probabilistic and relies on a martingale that is hidden in the
Faber--Schauder expansion of $x$. Since the Gladyshev estimators are not

speed explicitly depending on the particle position. The oscillating spatial
profile of the swim velocity considered in this paper takes inspiration from
experimental studies based on Janus particles whose speed can be modulated by
an external source of light. We suggest and apply an appropriate model of an
active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particle to the present case. This allows us to
predict the stationary properties, by finding the exact solution of the
steady-state probability distribution of particle position and velocity. From
this, we obtain the spatial density profile and show that its form is
consistent with the one found in the framework of other popular models. The
reduced velocity distribution highlights the emergence of non-Gaussianity in
our generalized AOUP model which becomes more evident as the spatial dependence
of the velocity profile becomes more pronounced. Then, we focus on the
time-dependent properties of the system. Velocity autocorrelation functions are
studied in the steady-state combining numerical and analytical methods derived
under suitable approximations. We observe a non-monotonic decay in the temporal
shape of the velocity autocorrelation function which depends on the ratio
between the persistence length and the spatial period of the swim velocity.
Finally, we numerically and analytically study the mean square displacement and
the long-time diffusion coefficient. The ballistic regime, observed in the
small-time region, is deeply affected by the properties of the swim velocity
landscape which induces also a crossover to a sub-ballistic but superdiffusive
regime for intermediate times. Finally, the long-time diffusion coefficient
decreases as the amplitude of the swim velocity oscillations increases because
the diffusion is determined by those regions where the particles are slow.

breaking of the inherent Goldstone shift symmetry. The interplay of a weak
explicit breaking of the $U(1)$ and phase relaxation renders the DC electric
conductivity finite but does not result in a Drude-like peak. In this scenario
we show the validity of a universal relation, found in the context of
translational symmetry breaking, between the phase relaxation rate, the mass of
the pseudo-Goldstone and the Goldstone diffusivity.

decouple feedforward parameters from DNN architectures and leverage additive

then finetuned on task objectives to improve task accuracy. We conduct
extensive experiments on MobileNet-v2, VGG-11, ResNet-50, Feature Pyramid
Networks, and pruned DNNs trained for classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks. The conceptually simple scheme consistently outperforms
iterative unstructured pruning. Applied to ResNet-50 with 76.1% top-1 accuracy
on the ILSVRC12 classification challenge, it achieves a $7.2\times$ compression
ratio with no accuracy loss and a $15.3\times$ compression ratio at 74.79%

happen across network layers and that learning shared representations for an
entire DNN can achieve better accuracy at the same compression ratio than
compressing the model as multiple separate parts. We release PyTorch code to
facilitate DNN deployment on resource-constrained devices and spur future

specifications over unknown discrete-time stochastic systems. When a model of
the system is available, barrier certificates have been successfully applied
for ensuring the satisfaction of safety specifications. In this work, we
formulate the computation of barrier certificates as a robust convex program
(RCP). Solving the acquired RCP is hard in general because the model of the
system that appears in one of the constraints of the RCP is unknown. We propose
a data-driven approach that replaces the uncountable number of constraints in
the RCP with a finite number of constraints by taking finitely many random
samples from the trajectories of the system. We thus replace the original RCP
with a scenario convex program (SCP) and show how to relate their optimizers.
We guarantee that the solution of the SCP is a solution of the RCP with a

pre-computed value. This provides a lower bound on the safety probability of
the original unknown system together with a controller in the case of
synthesis. We also discuss an extension of our verification approach to a case
where the associated robust program is non-convex and show how a similar
methodology can be applied. Finally, the applicability of our proposed approach
is illustrated through three case studies.

framework that attempts to integrate the interactive approach with the high

Python interpreter on the client side for the interactions with the scientist

  In this paper, we are proposing several client-side optimization techniques
for the Arkouda framework that maintain the interactive nature of the Arkouda

We do this by intercepting the Python operations in the interpreter, and
delaying their execution until the user requires the data, or we fill out the

Chapel server side (thus saving on the allocation, initialization and
deallocation of the Chapel arrays), tracking and caching the results of
function calls on the Arkouda arrays (thus avoiding repeated computation) and
reusing the results of array operations by performing common subexpression
elimination.
  We evaluate our approach on several Arkouda benchmarks and a large collection

improvements between 20% and 120% across the board, while fully maintaining the

frequency. They enable precision frequency comparisons between atoms in
separate locations to probe the space-time variation of fundamental constants,
the properties of dark matter, and for geodesy. Measurements on independent
systems are limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL); measurements on
entangled systems, in contrast, can surpass the SQL to reach the ultimate
precision allowed by quantum theory - the so-called Heisenberg limit. While
local entangling operations have been used to demonstrate this enhancement at
microscopic distances, frequency comparisons between remote atomic clocks
require rapid high-fidelity entanglement between separate systems that have no
intrinsic interactions. We demonstrate the first quantum network of entangled
optical clocks using two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions separated by a macroscopic distance
(2 m), that are entangled using a photonic link. We characterise the
entanglement enhancement for frequency comparisons between the ions. We find
that entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by a factor close to
$\sqrt{2}$, as predicted for the Heisenberg limit, thus halving the number of
measurements required to reach a given precision. Practically, today's optical
clocks are typically limited by laser dephasing; in this regime, we find that
using entangled clocks confers an even greater benefit, yielding a factor 4
reduction in the number of measurements compared to conventional correlation
spectroscopy techniques. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this
enhancement for measuring a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. Our
results show that quantum networks have now attained sufficient maturity for
enhanced metrology. This two-node network could be extended to additional
nodes, to other species of trapped particles, or to larger entangled systems

manipulators or deformable robots comprising of push-pull rod actuation, fluid
drives still pose great challenges due to high actuation variability and
nonlinear mechanical system responses. In this work we investigate the
capabilities of a hydraulic, parallel soft robot to intrinsically sense and
subsequently control contact forces. A comprehensive algorithm is derived for
static, quasi-static and dynamic force sensing which relies on fluid volume and

controllable for both systems, with the capability of controlling directional
contact forces in case of the multi degree-of-freedom parallel soft robot.

scaling behavior from the hydrogen atom. We will demonstrate that these
fundamental properties enable a thermodynamic limit of a single Rydberg atom
subjected to interactions with nearby ground state atoms. The limit is reached
by simultaneously increasing the number of ground state atoms and the level of
excitation of the Rydberg atom, for which the Coulomb potential supplies
infinitely many and highly degenerate excited states. Our study reveals a
surprising connection to an archetypal concept of condensed matter physics,
Anderson localization, facilitated by a direct mapping between the Rydberg
atom's electronic spectrum and the spectrum of a tight-binding Hamiltonian. The
hopping amplitudes of this tight-binding system are determined by the
arrangement of ground state atoms and can range from nearest-neighbor to
power-law-tailed to effectively infinite-range, giving rise to different
localization scenarios. For arrangements yielding nearest-neighbor hopping
amplitudes we identify clear signatures of the Anderson localization of the
Rydberg electron.

  Translation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of unpaired image-to-image translation is to produce an output image
reflecting the target domain's style while keeping unrelated contents of the
input source image unchanged. However, due to the lack of attention to the
content change in existing methods, the semantic information from source images
suffers from degradation during translation. In the paper, to address this
issue, we introduce a novel approach, Global and Local Alignment Networks
(GLA-Net). The global alignment network aims to transfer the input image from
the source domain to the target domain. To effectively do so, we learn the
parameters (mean and standard deviation) of multivariate Gaussian distributions
as style features by using an MLP-Mixer based style encoder. To transfer the
style more accurately, we employ an adaptive instance normalization layer in
the encoder, with the parameters of the target multivariate Gaussian
distribution as input. We also adopt regularization and likelihood losses to
further reduce the domain gap and produce high-quality outputs. Additionally,
we introduce a local alignment network, which employs a pretrained
self-supervised model to produce an attention map via a novel local alignment
loss, ensuring that the translation network focuses on relevant pixels.
Extensive experiments conducted on five public datasets demonstrate that our
method effectively generates sharper and more realistic images than existing
approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/ygjwd12345/GLANet.

how the well-being, productivity, social contacts, and needs of software

Variables such as levels of well-being increased while anxiety and loneliness
decreased during the pandemic. Symmetrically, indicators of well-being (e.g.,
quality of social contacts) increased when lockdown measures were slowly
lifted. On the other hand, other variables, including boredom and productivity,
remained constant. Additionally, we run a preliminary investigation into the
future of work at the end of the pandemic. A thematic analysis revealed that
some form of hybrid work is here to stay. Also, we found that having previously
changed jobs and low job satisfaction was reliably associated with the
intention to change jobs again, in case the work condition is not deemed
adequate to developers' needs. This suggests specific challenges for software
organizations that need to tailor various work arrangements if they want to be
attractive employers. We conclude this paper with several actionable

adversaries that can only corrupt the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ and adaptive
adversaries that can have their corruptions depend on the specific sample $S$

  In this work, we investigate whether oblivious adversaries are effectively
equivalent to adaptive adversaries, across all noise models studied in the

presence of oblivious adversaries always be well-approximated by that of an
algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ in the presence of adaptive adversaries? Our first
result shows that this is indeed the case for the broad class of statistical
query algorithms, under all reasonable noise models. We then show that in the
specific case of additive noise, this equivalence holds for all algorithms.
Finally, we map out an approach towards proving this statement in its fullest

and improving quantum hardware. A collection of protocols known as Randomized
Benchmarking (RB) was developed in the past decade, which provides an efficient
way to measure error rates in quantum systems. In a recent paper
(arxiv:2010.07974), a general framework for RB was proposed, which encompassed
most of the known RB protocols and overcame the limitation on error models in
previous works. However, even this general framework has a restriction: it can
only be applied to a finite group of gates. This does not meet the need posed
by experiments, in particular the demand for benchmarking non-Clifford gates
and continuous gate sets on quantum devices. In this work we generalize the RB
framework to continuous groups of gates and show that as long as the noise
level is reasonably small, the output can be approximated as a linear
combination of matrix exponential decays. As an application, we numerically
study the fully randomized benchmarking protocol (i.e. RB with the entire
unitary group as the gate set) enabled by our proof. This provides a unified
way to estimate the gate fidelity for any quantum gate in an experiment.

key problem in reinforcement learning (RL), where sample inefficiency has posed
serious challenges for practical applications. Recent works have shown that
using expressive policy function approximators and conditioning on future
trajectory information -- such as future states in hindsight experience replay
or returns-to-go in Decision Transformer (DT) -- enables efficient learning of
multi-task policies, where at times online RL is fully replaced by offline
behavioral cloning, e.g. sequence modeling. We demonstrate that all these
approaches are doing hindsight information matching (HIM) -- training policies
that can output the rest of trajectory that matches some statistics of future
state information. We present Generalized Decision Transformer (GDT) for
solving any HIM problem, and show how different choices for the feature
function and the anti-causal aggregator not only recover DT as a special case,
but also lead to novel Categorical DT (CDT) and Bi-directional DT (BDT) for
matching different statistics of the future. For evaluating CDT and BDT, we
define offline multi-task state-marginal matching (SMM) and imitation learning
(IL) as two generic HIM problems, propose a Wasserstein distance loss as a
metric for both, and empirically study them on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks. CDT, which simply replaces anti-causal summation with anti-causal
binning in DT, enables the first effective offline multi-task SMM algorithm
that generalizes well to unseen and even synthetic multi-modal state-feature
distributions. BDT, which uses an anti-causal second transformer as the
aggregator, can learn to model any statistics of the future and outperforms DT
variants in offline multi-task IL. Our generalized formulations from HIM and

  eigenvalues bounded from below","44 pages, 13 figures",,,,"math.CO math.MG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its
adjacency matrix. We show that the family of graphs with smallest eigenvalue at
least $-\lambda$ can be defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs
if and only if $\lambda < \lambda^*$, where $\lambda^* = \beta^{1/2} +
\beta^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$ and $\beta$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x +
1$. This resolves a question raised by Bussemaker and Neumaier. As a byproduct,
we find all the limit points of smallest eigenvalues of graphs, supplementing
Hoffman's work on those limit points in $[-2, \infty)$.
  We also prove that the same conclusion about forbidden subgraph
characterization holds for signed graphs, and we give an application to
symmetric integer matrices whose diagonal entries are all zero. Our impetus for
the study of signed graphs is to determine the maximum cardinality of a
spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in
high dimensions. Denote by $N_{\alpha, \beta}(n)$ the maximum number of unit
vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where all pairwise inner products lie in $\{\alpha,
\beta\}$ with $-1 \le \beta < 0 \le \alpha < 1$. Very recently Jiang, Tidor,
Yao, Zhang and Zhao determined the limit of $N_{\alpha, \beta}(d)/d$ as
$d\to\infty$ when $\alpha + 2\beta < 0$ or $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in
\{1,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\}$, and they proposed a conjecture on the limit in terms of
eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We establish their conjecture
whenever $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha - \beta) < \lambda^*$.

formation of planetesimals from pebbles. Understanding how this instability
operates under realistic conditions expected in protoplanetary disks is
therefore crucial to assess the efficiency of planet formation. Contemporary
models of protoplanetary disks show that magnetic fields are key to driving gas
accretion through large-scale, laminar magnetic stresses. However, the effect
of such magnetic fields on the streaming instability has not been examined in
detail. To this end, we study the stability of dusty, magnetized gas in a
protoplanetary disk. We find the streaming instability can be enhanced by
passive magnetic torques and even persist in the absence of a global radial
pressure gradient. In this case, instability is attributed to the azimuthal
drift between dust and gas, unlike the classical streaming instability, which
is driven by radial drift. This suggests that the streaming instability can
remain effective inside dust-trapping pressure bumps in accreting disks. When a
live vertical field is considered, we find the magneto-rotational instability
can be damped by dust feedback, while the classic streaming instability can be
stabilized by magnetic perturbations. We also find that Alfv\'en waves can be
destabilized by dust-gas drift, but this instability requires nearly ideal
conditions. We discuss the possible implications of these results for dust
dynamics and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks.

supernovae (SNe Ia) depend on understanding the effects of 'contamination' from

state-of-the-art simulations of photometrically identified SN Ia samples and
determine cosmological biases due to such 'non-Ia' contamination in the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) 5-year SN sample. As part of the analysis, we test on our
DES simulations the performance of SuperNNova, a photometric SN classifier
based on recurrent neural networks. Depending on the choice of non-Ia SN models
in both the simulated data sample and training sample, contamination ranges
from 0.8-3.5 %, with the efficiency of the classification from 97.7-99.5 %.
Using the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) framework and
its extension 'BEAMS with Bias Correction' (BBC), we produce a redshift-binned
Hubble diagram marginalised over contamination and corrected for selection
effects and we use it to constrain the dark energy equation-of-state, $w$.
Assuming a flat universe with Gaussian $\Omega_M$ prior of $0.311\pm0.010$, we
show that biases on $w$ are $<0.008$ when using SuperNNova and accounting for a
wide range of non-Ia SN models in the simulations. Systematic uncertainties
associated with contamination are estimated to be at most $\sigma_{w,
\mathrm{syst}}=0.004$. This compares to an expected statistical uncertainty of
$\sigma_{w,\mathrm{stat}}=0.039$ for the DES-SN sample, thus showing that
contamination is not a limiting uncertainty in our analysis. We also measure
biases due to contamination on $w_0$ and $w_a$ (assuming a flat universe), and
find these to be $<$0.009 in $w_0$ and $<$0.108 in $w_a$, hence 5 to 10 times

out star-formation and propose either small-scale synchrotron jets, frustrated

the electron temperature. Alternatively, direct-abundance methods exist that
measure the temperature of the emitting gas directly, though these methods
usually require challenging observations of highly-excited auroral lines.
Low-lying far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines are largely insensitive to
electron temperature and thus provide an attractive alternative to
optically-derived abundances. Here, we introduce the far-infrared abundances

free-free emission and hydrogen recombination-lines, to derive direct, absolute

electromagnetic field obeying a dominant energy condition in a strictly
stationary, everywhere regular, asymptotically flat spacetime must be either
trivial or a stealth field. The first theorem holds in static spacetimes and is
independent of the gravitational part of the action, as long as the coupling of
the electromagnetic field to the gravitational field is minimal. The second
theorem assumes Einstein--Hilbert gravitational action and relies on the
positive energy theorem, but does not assume that the spacetime metric is
static. In addition, we discuss possible generalizations of these results, to
theories with charged matter, as well as higher-dimensional nonlinear
electromagnetic fields.

(BHs) can inform our understanding of the origin of ""seed"" black holes at high
redshift. Here we search for signatures of accreting massive BHs in a sample of
dwarf galaxies ($M_\star \le 3 \times 10^9~M_\odot$, $z \leq 0.15$) selected
from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) using X-ray observations from the eROSITA Final
Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). On average, our search is sensitive to active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies that are accreting at $\gtrsim 1%$ of
their Eddington luminosity. Of the ${\sim}28,000$ X-ray sources in eFEDS and
the 495 dwarf galaxies in the NSA within the eFEDS footprint, we find six
galaxies hosting possible active massive BHs. If the X-ray sources are indeed
associated with the dwarf galaxies, the X-ray emission is above that expected
from star formation, with X-ray source luminosities of $L_{0.5-8~\textrm{keV}}
\sim 10^{39\textrm{-}40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Additionally, after accounting for
chance alignments of background AGNs with dwarf galaxies, we estimate there are
between 0-9 real associations between dwarf galaxies and X-ray sources in the
eFEDS field at the 95% confidence level. From this we find an upper limit on
the eFEDS-detected dwarf galaxy AGN fraction of $\le 1.8%$, which is broadly
consistent with similar studies at other wavelengths. We extrapolate these
findings from the eFEDS sky coverage to the planned eROSITA All-Sky Survey and
estimate that upon completion, the all-sky survey could yield as many as
${\sim}1350$ AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies at low redshift.

implies that $\nu(G)$ is bounded by a constant; and that $3$-coloring linear
$3$-uniform hypergraphs $G$ with $\nu(G) \leq 532$ is NP-hard.

of strongly correlated topological phases of matter -- to a large extent is
captured by weakly interacting quasiparticles known as composite fermions
(CFs). In this paper, based on numerical simulations and effective field
theory, we argue that some \emph{high energy} states in the FQH spectra
necessitate a different description based on \emph{parton} quasiparticles. We
show that Jain states at filling factor $\nu{=}n/(2pn\pm1)$ with integers
$n,p{\geq}2$, support two kinds of collective modes: in addition to the
well-known Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) mode, they host a high energy
collective mode, which is interpreted as the GMP mode of partons. We elucidate
observable signatures of the parton mode in the dynamics following a geometric
quench. We construct a microscopic wave function for the parton mode, and
demonstrate agreement between its variational energy and exact diagonalization.
Using the parton construction, we derive a field theory of the Jain states and
show that the previously proposed effective theories follow from our approach.
Our results point to partons being ""real"" quasiparticles which, in a way
reminiscent of quarks, only become observable at sufficiently high energies.

data dependencies in data profiling due to their ability to identify
relationships in data such as primary and foreign keys. These relationships are
equally important when dealing with nested data formats such as JSON. However,
the definition of functional and inclusion dependencies makes use of a flat,
unnested relational model which misses many useful types of dependencies on
data which involve nested data models.
  In this work, we identify types of dependencies which are not captured by
traditional functional and inclusion dependencies but which nevertheless
capture meaningful relationships among nested data. We also demonstrate how
algorithms for mining these traditional dependencies can be adapted to also
mine nested dependencies. The first strategy simply flattens the input data and
feeds into unmodified existing algorithms. We present a second strategy which
instead adapts the algorithm to efficiently process JSON data as input which in
some cases leads to a reduction in runtime by multiple orders of magnitude on
real-world datasets. We further show how these algorithms can be adapted to
produce useful results in the presence of a percentage of incomplete or invalid

each method of ensuring type integrity comes with its own blame-assignment

  Typed Racket has a rich migratory type system and enforces the types with a
Natural semantics. Reticulated Python has a simple structural type system
extended with Dynamic and enforces types with a Transient semantics. While
Typed Racket satisfies the most stringent gradual-type soundness properties at
a significant performance cost, Reticulated Python seems to limit the
performance penalty to a tolerable degree and is nevertheless type sound. This
comparison raises the question of whether Transient checking is applicable to

  This paper reports on the surprising difficulties of adapting the Transient
semantics of Reticulated Python to the rich migratory type system of Typed
Racket. The resulting implementation, Shallow Typed Racket, is faster than the
standard Deep Typed Racket but only when the Transient blame assignment
strategy is disabled. For language designers, this report provides valuable
hints on how to equip an existing compiler to support a Transient semantics.
For theoreticians, the negative experience with Transient blame calls for a

  Issue 2, Article 8","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2022/6/8",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Tables are ubiquitous formats for data. Therefore, techniques for
writing correct programs over tables, and debugging incorrect ones, are vital.
Our specific focus in this paper is on rich types that articulate the
properties of tabular operations. We wish to study both their expressive power
and _diagnostic quality_.
  Inquiry: There is no ""standard library"" of table operations. As a result,
every paper (and project) is free to use its own (sub)set of operations. This
makes artifacts very difficult to compare, and it can be hard to tell whether
omitted operations were left out by oversight or because they cannot actually
be expressed. Furthermore, virtually no papers discuss the quality of type
error feedback.
  Approach: We combed through several existing languages and libraries to
create a ""standard library"" of table operations. Each entry is accompanied by a
detailed specification of its ""type,"" expressed independent of (and hence not
constrained by) any type language. We also studied and categorized a corpus of
(student) program edits that resulted in table-related errors. We used this to
generate a suite of erroneous programs. Finally, we adapted the concept of a
datasheet to facilitate comparisons of different implementations.
  Knowledge: Our benchmark creates a common ground to frame work in this area.
Language designers who claim to support typed programming over tables have a
clear suite against which to demonstrate their system's expressive power. Our
family of errors also gives them a chance to demonstrate the quality of
feedback. Researchers who improve one aspect -- especially error reporting --
without changing the other can demonstrate their improvement, as can those who
engage in trade-offs between the two. The net result should be much better
science in both expressiveness and diagnostics. We also introduce a datasheet
format for presenting this knowledge in a methodical way.
  Grounding: We have generated our benchmark from real languages, libraries,
and programs, as well as personal experience conducting and teaching data
science. We have drawn on experience in engineering and, more recently, in data
science to generate the datasheet.
  Importance: Claims about type support for tabular programming are hard to
evaluate. However, tabular programming is ubiquitous, and the expressive power
of type systems keeps growing. Our benchmark and datasheet can help lead to
more orderly science. It also benefits programmers trying to choose a language.

tree flattening, and a compiler for a simple expression language) to spotlight
their dependence on associativity. Grounding: We replay developments of these

increasingly important form of software testing. Furthermore, it serves as a
concrete gateway into the abstract area of formal methods. Specifically, we
focus on students learning PBT methods.
  Inquiry: How well do students do at PBT? Our goal is to assess the quality of
the predicates they write as part of PBT. Prior work introduced the idea of
decomposing the predicate's property into a conjunction of independent
subproperties. Testing the predicate against each subproperty gives a
""semantic"" understanding of their performance.
  Approach: The notion of independence of subproperties both seems intuitive
and was an important condition in prior work. First, we show that this
condition is overly restrictive and might hide valuable information: it both
undercounts errors and makes it hard to capture misconceptions. Second, we
introduce two forms of automation, one based on PBT tools and the other on
SAT-solving, to enable testing of student predicates. Third, we compare the
output of these automated tools against manually-constructed tests. Fourth, we
also measure the performance of those tools. Finally, we re-assess student
performance reported in prior work.
  Knowledge: We show the difficulty caused by the independent subproperty
requirement. We provide insight into how to use automation effectively to
assess PBT predicates. In particular, we discuss the steps we had to take to
beat human performance. We also provide insight into how to make the automation
work efficiently. Finally, we present a much richer account than prior work of
how students did.
  Grounding: Our methods are grounded in mathematical logic. We also make use
of well-understood principles of test generation from more formal
specifications. This combination ensures the soundness of our work. We use
standard methods to measure performance.
  Importance: As both educators and programmers, we believe PBT is a valuable
tool for students to learn, and its importance will only grow as more
developers appreciate its value. Effective teaching requires a clear
understanding of student knowledge and progress. Our methods enable a rich and
automated analysis of student performance on PBT that yields insight into their
understanding and can capture misconceptions. We therefore expect these results
to be valuable to educators.

this as the restarting of accretion during the high state. We further
identified three short outbursts lasting ~ 1 d in DW Cnc with a mean recurrence
time of ~ 60 d and an amplitude of ~ 1 mag. These are the first outbursts
identified in DW Cnc since 2008. Due to the short nature of these events we
identify them not as a result of accretion instabilities but instead either
from instabilities originating from the interaction of the magnetorotational
instability in the accretion disc and the magnetic field generated by the white
dwarf or the result of magnetic gating.

galaxies through feeding and feedback processes. A spatially resolved
multiwavelength survey is required to map the interaction of AGN with their
host galaxies on different spatial scales and different phases of the ISM. The
goal of CARS is to obtain the necessary spatially resolved multiwavelength
observations for an unbiased sample of local unobscured luminous AGN. We
present the overall CARS survey design and the associated wide-field optical
IFU spectroscopy for all 41 CARS targets at z<0.06 randomly selected from the
Hamburg/ESO survey of luminous unobscured AGN. This data set provides the
backbone of CARS and allows us to characterize host galaxy morphologies, AGN
parameters, precise systemic redshifts, and ionized gas distributions including
excitation conditions, kinematics, and metallicities in unprecedented detail.
We focus our study on the size of the ENLR which has been traditionally
connected to AGN luminosity. Given the large scatter in the ENLR
size-luminosity relation, we performed a large parameter search to identify
potentially more fundamental relations. Remarkably, we identified the strongest
correlation between the maximum projected ENLR size and the black hole mass,
consistent with an $R_\mathrm{ENLR,max}\sim M_\mathrm{BH}^{0.5}$ relationship.
We interpret the maximum ENLR size as a timescale indicator of a single BH
radiative-efficient accretion episode for which we inferred log(t_AGN) =
(0.45+- 0.08)log(M_BH)+1.78 using forward modeling. The extrapolation of our
inferred relation toward higher BH masses is consistent with an independent
lifetime estimate from the HeII proximity zones around luminous AGN at z~3.
While our proposed link between the BH mass and AGN lifetime might be a
secondary correlation itself or impacted by unknown biases, it has a few
relevant implications if confirmed.

outflows on host galaxy scales. While large spectroscopic surveys like SDSS
have characterized the kinematics of [O III] for large samples of AGN,
estimating the associated energetics requires spatially resolving these
outflows with, for example, IFU studies. As part of CARS we obtained
spatially-resolved IFU spectroscopy for a representative sample of 39 luminous
type 1 AGN at 0.01<z<0.06 with MUSE and VIMOS IFUs at the VLT to infer the
spatial location of the ionized gas outflows. We compare the light
distributions of the [O III] wing to that of the H$\beta$ broad emission line
region, a classical point source (PSF). We then use the PSF to distinguish
between the unresolved and resolved [O III] wing emission. We further determine
its location using spectro-astrometry for the point-like sources. The [O III]
wing is spatially unresolved in 23 out of the 36 AGN with >80 % of the flux
associated with a point-like source. We measure <100 pc offsets in the spatial
location of the outflow from the AGN nucleus using the spectro-astrometry
technique for these sources. For the other 13 AGN, the [O III] wing emission is
resolved and possibly extended on kpc scale. We conclude that [O III] wing
emission can be compact or extended in an unbiased luminous AGN sample, where
both cases are likely to appear. Electron density in the compact [O III] wing
regions (median $n_e$~1900 cm$^{-3}$) is nearly a magnitude higher than in the
extended ones (median $n_e$~500 cm$^{-3}$). The presence of spatially extended
and compact [O III] wing emission is unrelated to the AGN bolometric luminosity
and to inclination effects, which means other features such as time delays, or
mechanical feedback/radio jets may shape the ionized gas outflow properties.

different tracers for AGN host galaxies in the Close AGN Reference Survey
(CARS) to provide new observational insights. We construct integrated
panchromatic spectral energy distributions (SED) to measure the FIR luminosity
as a tracer for the recent (< 100 Myr) SFR. In addition, we use integral-field
unit observation of the CARS targets to employ the H$\alpha$ luminosity
decontaminated by AGN excitation as a proxy for the current (< 5 Myr) SFR. We
find that significant differences in specific SFR of the AGN host galaxies as
compared with the larger galaxy population disappear once cold gas mass, in
addition to stellar mass, is used to predict the SFR. We identify individual
galaxies with a significant difference in their SFR which can be related to a
recent enhancement or decline in their SFR history that might be related to
various processes including interactions, gas consumption, outflows and AGN
feedback. AGN can occur in various stages of galaxy evolution which makes it
difficult to relate the SFR solely to the impact of the AGN. We do not find any
strong evidence for global positive or negative AGN feedback in the CARS
sample. However, there is tentative evidence that 1) the relative orientation
of the AGN engine with respect to the host galaxies might alter the efficiency
of AGN feedback and 2) the recent SFH is an additional tool to identify rapid
changes in galaxy growth driven by the AGN or other processes.

projected onto the physical Hilbert space through a constraint which is
optimized, together with the single-particle orbitals, using a neural network
parametrization. This construction draws inspiration from the success of hidden
particle representations but overcomes the limitations associated with the
mean-field treatment of the constraint often used in this context. Our

ansatz for the explicit form of the polaron dispersion. It has the form of a
power series of the sine function of the momentum with interaction-dependent

are connected to the Maclaurin series of the polaron dispersion and thus it is
sufficient to calculate latter quantity to automatically find the power series

realistically from small numbers of images. In contrast to all previous NeRF
methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the
volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of
features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into
intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are
estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components
are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that
are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has
semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving
feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive

cubic-order scalar self-interactions allows a possibility for realizing
negative ISW-galaxy cross-correlations, while the K-mouflage model predicts a
positive correlation similar to the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model. In
our analysis, we fix the parameters of each model to their best-fit values
derived from a baseline likelihood analysis with observational data from CMB,
baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae type Ia. Then we fit those

GCCG best-fit models degrade the fit to the ISW-galaxy cross-correlation data

best-fit values constrained from the baseline likelihood, the cubic-order
scalar self-interaction gives rise to suppressed ISW tails relative to

rest-frame end time of the plateau emission, $T_{\rm a, radio}^*$, and its

between those mechanisms through the value of the parameter $b$ ($b_c = 1$) and
the scaling behavior of parameter $\tau$ on the Weibull function,
$\exp[-(t/\tau)^b]$, used to adjust drug release data in pharmaceutical
literature. Numerical investigations on the size dependence of the
characteristic release time $\tau$ found it to satisfy either linear or
quadratic scaling relations on either erosive or diffusive regimes. Along the
crossover the characteristic time scales with the average coefficient observed
on the extreme regimes ({\it i.e.}, $\tau \sim L^{3/2}$), and we show that this
result can be derived analytically by assuming an Arrhenius relation for the
diffusion coefficient inside the capsule. Based on these relations a
phenomenological expression for the characteristic release in terms of size $L$
and erosion rate $\kappa$ is proposed, which can be useful for predicting the
crossover erosion rate $\kappa_c$. We applied this relation to the experimental
literature data for the release of acetaminophen immersed in a wax matrix and
found them to be consistent with our numerical results.

the performance of automatically-generated individualized designs, as required
by Industry 4.0, with enhanced sustainability by means of component reuse. For
optimal modular design, two key questions must be answered: (i) what should the
topology of individual modules be like and (ii) how should modules be arranged
at the product scale? We address these challenges by proposing a bi-level
sequential strategy that combines free material design, clustering techniques,
and topology optimization. First, using free material optimization enhanced
with post-processing for checkerboard suppression, we determine the
distribution of elasticity tensors at the product scale. To extract the
sought-after modular arrangement, we partition the obtained elasticity tensors
with a novel deterministic clustering algorithm and interpret its outputs
within Wang tiling formalism. Finally, we design interiors of individual
modules by solving a single-scale topology optimization problem with the design
space reduced by modular mapping, conveniently starting from an initial guess
provided by free material optimization. We illustrate these developments with
three benchmarks first, covering compliance minimization of modular structures,
and, for the first time, the design of non-periodic compliant modular
mechanisms. Furthermore, we design a set of modules reusable in an inverter and
in gripper mechanisms, which ultimately pave the way towards the rational
design of modular architectured (meta)materials.

Here, we examine the thermoelectric response of a $d$-wave superconductor
connected to normal-metal reservoirs under a temperature bias using a fully
self-consistent quasiclassical theory. The thermoelectrically induced
quasiparticle current is cancelled by superflow in an open circuit setup, but
at the cost of a charge imbalance induced at the contacts and extending across
the structure. We investigate the resulting thermopower and thermophase and
their dependencies on scattering phase shift, mean free path, and interface
transparency. For crystal-axis orientations such that surface-bound zero-energy
Andreev states are formed, the thermoelectric effect is reduced as a result of
locally reduced electron-hole asymmetry. For a semiballistic superconductor

Centre, Sagittarius A*, displays flaring emission in the X-ray band atop a
steady, quiescent level. Flares are also observed in the near-infrared band.
The physical process producing the flares is not fully understood and it is
unclear if the flaring rate varies, although some recent works suggest it has
reached unprecedented variability in recent years. Using over a decade of
regular X-ray monitoring of Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, we studied the
variations in count rate of Sgr A* on time scales of years. We decomposed the
X-ray emission into quiescent and flaring emission, modelled as a constant and
power law process, respectively. We found that the complete, multi-year dataset
cannot be described by a stationary distribution of flare fluxes, while
individual years follow this model better. In three of the ten studied years,
the data is consistent with a purely Poissonian quiescent distribution, while
for five years only an upper limit of the flare flux distribution parameter
could be determined. We find that these possible changes cannot be explained
fully by the different number of observations per year. Combined, these results
are instead consistent with a changing flaring rate of Sgr A*, appearing more
active between 2006-2007 and 2017-2019, than between 2008-2012. Finally, we
discuss this result in the context of flare models and the passing of gaseous
objects, and discuss the extra statistical steps taken, for instance to deal

heterogeneity of variable types including continuous lab values, categorical

data, some variables are {\em missing not at random (MNAR)} but deliberately
not collected and thus are a source of information. For example, lab tests may
be deemed necessary for some patients on the basis of suspected diagnosis, but
not for others. Here we present the MURAL forest -- an unsupervised random
forest for representing data with disparate variable types (e.g., categorical,
continuous, MNAR). MURAL forests consist of a set of decision trees where
node-splitting variables are chosen at random, such that the marginal entropy
of all other variables is minimized by the split. This allows us to also split
on MNAR variables and discrete variables in a way that is consistent with the
continuous variables. The end goal is to learn the MURAL embedding of patients
using average tree distances between those patients. These distances can be fed
to nonlinear dimensionality reduction method like PHATE to derive visualizable
embeddings. While such methods are ubiquitous in continuous-valued datasets
(like single cell RNA-sequencing) they have not been used extensively in mixed
variable data. We showcase the use of our method on one artificial and two
clinical datasets. We show that using our approach, we can visualize and
classify data more accurately than competing approaches. Finally, we show that
MURAL can also be used to compare cohorts of patients via the recently proposed

systematically investigate the chemiresistive response within the framework of

the fundamental role of quantum interference (QI) in the sensing process, and
we propose it as a paradigmatic mechanism for sensing. Owing to the open-shell
character of NO$_2$, its interaction with pyrene gives rise to a Fano resonance
thereby triggering the strongest chemiresistive response, while the weaker
interactions with H$_2$O and NH$_3$ result in lower sensitivity. We demonstrate
that by exploiting destructive QI arising in the meta-substituted pyrene, it is
possible to calibrate the sensor to enhance both its sensitivity and chemical

be detected and distinguished. These results provide a fundamental strategy to

  quantifying spatial truss connection complexity",,,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The connections of a spatial truss structure play a critical role in the safe
and efficient transfer of axial forces between members. For discrete
connections, they can also improve construction efficiency by acting as
registration devices that lock members in precise orientations. As more
geometrically complex spatial trusses are enabled by computational workflows
and the demand for material-efficient spanning systems, there is a need to
understand the effects of global form on the demands at the connections. For
large-scale structures with irregular geometry, customizing individual nodes to
meet exact member orientations and force demands may be infeasible; conversely,
standardizing all connections results in oversized nodes and a compromise in
registration potential. We propose a method for quantifying the complexity of
spatial truss designs by the variation in nodal force demands. By representing
nodal forces as a geometric object, we leverage the spherical harmonic shape
descriptor, developed for applications in computational geometry, to
characterize each node by a rotation and translation-invariant fixed-length
vector. We define a complexity score for spatial truss design by the variance
in the positions of the feature vectors in higher-dimensional space, providing
an additional performance metric during early stage design exploration. We then
develop a pathway towards reducing complexity by clustering nodes with respect
to their feature vectors to reduce the number of unique connectors for design
while minimizing the effects of mass standardization.

ancestral configurations, studying the directed graphs that provide graphical
representations of lattices of ancestral configurations. For a matching gene
tree topology and species tree topology, we present a method for defining the
digraph of ancestral configurations from the tree topology by using iterated
cartesian products of graphs. We show that a specific set of paths on the
digraph of ancestral configurations is in bijection with the set of labeled
histories -- a well-known phylogenetic object that enumerates possible temporal
orderings of the coalescences of a tree. For each of a series of tree families,
we obtain closed-form expressions for the number of labeled histories by using
this bijection to count paths on associated digraphs. Finally, we prove that
our lattice construction extends to nonmatching tree pairs, and we use it to
characterize pairs $(G,S)$ having the maximal number of ancestral

two of them was also introduced, where internal amplitudes are allowed to vary

perform the parameter estimation for each of the reconstructions to then

we found a better fit to the data, up to $4\sigma$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM,
and the presence of some interesting features, i.e. an oscillatory behaviour at
late times, a decrease in the dark energy density component at early times and
a transition to the phantom divide-line in the EoS. To discern these features
from noisy contributions, we include a principal component analysis and found
that some of these characteristics should be taken into account to satisfy

directly on encrypted fields in the database-as-a-service (DaaS) paradigm.
While fully HE exhibits great expressiveness but prohibitive performance
overhead, a better balance between flexibility and efficiency can be achieved
by partially HE schemes. Performance-wise, however, the encryption rate of
state-of-the-art HE schemes is still orders of magnitude lower than the I/O
throughput, rendering the HE scheme the performance bottleneck.
  This paper proposes INCHE, an incrementally homomorphic encryption scheme,
which aims to boost the performance of HE schemes by incrementally encrypting

intrinsic correlation between plaintexts and cache them for future reuse such
that expensive HE primitives from plaintexts to ciphertexts are avoided. We
prove the semantic security of INCHE under the chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)

breaking the barrier by proving minibatch SGD converges to a critical point of
the full log-likelihood loss function, and recovers model hyperparameters with
rate $O(\frac{1}{K})$ for $K$ iterations, up to a statistical error term
depending on the minibatch size. Our theoretical guarantees hold provided that
the kernel functions exhibit exponential or polynomial eigendecay which is
satisfied by a wide range of kernels commonly used in GPs. Numerical studies on

in the rugged environments on cow pastures and provide a cost-effective method

since weed distribution on pastures is unknown. Given a limited field of view,
online path planning is necessary to detect weeds and plan paths to mow them.
We study the general online path planning problem for an autonomous mower with

algorithms that are able to utilize new information about weeds to optimize
path length and ensure coverage. We deploy our algorithms on the Cowbot and
perform field experiments to validate the suitability of our methods for

relate the image-derived features to gamma-ray spectral features obtained using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) under different regularizations. We

buyers with private valuations for the items. A buyer either participates
directly in the auction or is represented by an intermediary, who represents a
subset of buyers. Our goal is to design robust mechanisms that are independent
of the demand structure (i.e. how the buyers are partitioned across
intermediaries), and perform well under a wide variety of possible contracts
between intermediaries and buyers.
  We first study the case of $k$ identical items where each buyer draws its
private valuation for an item i.i.d. from a known $\lambda$-regular
distribution. We construct a robust mechanism that, independent of the demand
structure and under certain conditions on the contracts between intermediaries
and buyers, obtains a constant factor of the revenue that the mechanism
designer could obtain had she known the buyers' valuations. In other words, our
mechanism's expected revenue achieves a constant factor of the optimal welfare,
regardless of the demand structure. Our mechanism is a simple posted-price
mechanism that sets a take-it-or-leave-it per-item price that depends on $k$
and the total number of buyers, but does not depend on the demand structure or
the downstream contracts.
  Next we generalize our result to the case when the items are not identical.
We assume that the item valuations are separable. For this case, we design a
mechanism that obtains at least a constant fraction of the optimal welfare, by
using a menu of posted prices. This mechanism is also independent of the demand
structure, but makes a relatively stronger assumption on the contracts between
intermediaries and buyers, namely that each intermediary prefers outcomes with
a higher sum of utilities of the subset of buyers represented by it.

incurs a longer decoding delay than a well-known K-repetition. To avoid a long

demographic groups that share the same state and action spaces to achieve
approximately the same expected time-discounted rewards. We first provide a
decomposition theorem for return disparity, which decomposes the return
disparity of any two MDPs sharing the same state and action spaces into the
distance between group-wise reward functions, the discrepancy of group
policies, and the discrepancy between state visitation distributions induced by
the group policies. Motivated by our decomposition theorem, we propose
algorithms to mitigate return disparity via learning a shared group policy with
state visitation distributional alignment using integral probability metrics.

ViT in the real industrial environment, especially in safety-critical
scenarios. In this work, we propose PatchCensor, aiming to certify the patch
robustness of ViT by applying exhaustive testing. We try to provide a provable
guarantee by considering the worst patch attack scenarios. Unlike empirical
defenses against adversarial patches that may be adaptively breached, certified
robust approaches can provide a certified accuracy against arbitrary attacks
under certain conditions. However, existing robustness certifications are
mostly based on robust training, which often requires substantial training
efforts and the sacrifice of model performance on normal samples. To bridge the
gap, PatchCensor seeks to improve the robustness of the whole system by
detecting abnormal inputs instead of training a robust model and asking it to
give reliable results for every input, which may inevitably compromise
accuracy. Specifically, each input is tested by voting over multiple inferences
with different mutated attention masks, where at least one inference is
guaranteed to exclude the abnormal patch. This can be seen as complete-coverage
testing, which could provide a statistical guarantee on inference at the test
time. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PatchCensor is able to
achieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel
adversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques
while achieving similar clean accuracy (81.8% on ImageNet). Meanwhile, our
technique also supports flexible configurations to handle different adversarial
patch sizes (up to 25%) by simply changing the masking strategy.

to severe economic and operational damage. To solve this problem, research has
focused on leveraging deep learning techniques that help reduce false alerts.
However, a shortcoming is that these works often require or implicitly assume
the physical and cyber sensors to be trustworthy. Implicit trust of data is a
major problem with using artificial intelligence or machine learning for CPS
security, because during critical attack detection time they are more at risk,
with greater likelihood and impact, of also being compromised. To address this
shortcoming, the problem is reframed on how to make good decisions given
uncertainty. Then, the decision is detection, and the uncertainty includes
whether the data used for ML-based IDS is compromised. Thus, this work presents
an approach for reducing false alerts in CPS power systems by dealing
uncertainty without the knowledge of prior distribution of alerts.
Specifically, an evidence theoretic based approach leveraging Dempster Shafer
combination rules are proposed for reducing false alerts. A multi-hypothesis
mass function model is designed that leverages probability scores obtained from
various supervised-learning classifiers. Using this model, a
location-cum-domain based fusion framework is proposed and evaluated with
different combination rules, that fuse multiple evidence from inter-domain and
intra-domain sensors. The approach is demonstrated in a cyber-physical power
system testbed with Man-In-The-Middle attack emulation in a large-scale
synthetic electric grid. For evaluating the performance, plausibility, belief,
pignistic, etc. metrics as decision functions are considered. To improve the
performance, a multi-objective based genetic algorithm is proposed for feature
selection considering the decision metrics as the fitness function.

Recently, the twist degree of freedom has been introduced into various

question is whether twistronics and moir\'e physics can be extended to
electronics with potential applications in the twist-enabled signal processing.
Here, we demonstrate both in theory and experiment that lots of fascinating
moir\'e physics can be engineered using electric circuits with extremely high
degrees of freedom. By suitably designing the interlayer coupling and biasing
of one sublattice for the twisted bilayer circuit, the low-energy flat bands
with large bandgaps away from other states can be realized at various twist
angles. Based on the moir\'e circuit with a fixed twist angle, we
experimentally demonstrate the effect of band narrowing as well as the
localization of electric energy when a magic value of the interlayer coupling
is applied. Furthermore, the topological edge states, which originate from the
moir\'e potential induced pseudomagnetic field, are also observed for the first

applications in the field of intergraded circuit design.

domains may have poor generalization performance on unseen target domains. To
address this issue, we propose FedADG to equip federated learning with domain
generalization capability. FedADG employs the federated adversarial learning
approach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains
via matching each distribution to a reference distribution. The reference
distribution is adaptively generated (by accommodating all source domains) to
minimize the domain shift distance during alignment. In FedADG, the alignment
is fine-grained since each class is aligned independently. In this way, the
learned feature representation is supposed to be universal, so it can
generalize well on the unseen domains. Intensive experiments on various
datasets demonstrate that FedADG has comparable performance with the
state-of-the-art.

operations for industrial robots. We propose a solution within the general
setting of learning from demonstration (LfD), where a nominal trajectory is
provided through demonstration by an expert teacher. This can be used to learn
a suitable representation of the skill that can be generalized to novel
positions of one of the parts involved in the assembly, for example the hole in
a peg-in-hole (PiH) insertion task. Under the expectation that this novel
position might not be entirely accurately estimated by a vision or other
sensing system, the robot will need to further modify the generated trajectory
in response to force readings measured by means of a force-torque (F/T) sensor
mounted at the wrist of the robot or another suitable location. Under the
assumption of constant velocity of traversing the reference trajectory during
assembly, we propose a novel accommodation force controller that allows the
robot to safely explore different contact configurations. The data collected
using this controller is used to train a Gaussian process model to predict the
misalignment in the position of the peg with respect to the target hole. We
show that the proposed learning-based approach can correct various contact
configurations caused by misalignment between the assembled parts in a PiH

perform adaptive insertion using force feedback from the trained machine

statistics have demonstrated that $A_{He}$ in slow solar wind correlates
tightly with sunspot number. However, less attention is paid to the solar cycle
dependence of $A_{He}$ within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and
comparing the $A_{He}$ characteristics of ICMEs and solar wind. In this paper
we conduct a statistical comparison of Helium abundance between ICMEs and solar
wind near 1 AU with observations of \textit{Advanced Composition Explorer} from
1998 to 2019, and find that the ICME $A_{He}$ also exhibits the obvious solar
cycle dependence. Meanwhile, we find that the $A_{He}$ is obviously higher
within ICMEs compared to solar wind, and the means within 37\% and 12\% of
ICMEs exceed 5 and 8.5, respectively. It is interesting to answer where and how
the high Helium abundance originates. Our statistics demonstrate that 21\%
(3\%) of ICME (slow wind) $A_{He}$ data points exceed 8.5 around solar maximum,
which decreases dramatically near minimum, while no such high $A_{He}$ values
appear in the fast wind throughout the whole solar cycle. This indicates that
the high $A_{He}$ (e.g., $>$8.5) emanates from active regions as more ICMEs and
slow wind originates from active regions around maximum, and supports that both
active regions and quiet-Sun regions are the sources of slow wind. We suggest
that the high $A_{He}$ from active regions could be explained by means of the
magnetic loop confinement model and/or photoionization effect.

from the galaxy center by about 0.2"" (1.4 pkpc). The Hubble deep images at
longer wavelengths show that the emission is unlikely provided by low-redshift
interlopers. The photometric and spectroscopic data show that the possible
contribution of an active galactic nucleus is quite low. Fitting the spectral
energy distribution of this source to stellar population synthesis models, we
find that the galaxy is young (~50 Myr) and actively forming stars with a rate
of 52.1$\pm$4.9 $M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The significant star formation and
the spatially offset LyC emission support a scenario where the ionizing photons
escape from the low-density cavities in the ISM excavated by massive young

(AirComp) system for phase asynchronous OFDM-based federated edge learning
systems. Existing analog AirComp systems often assume perfect phase alignment
via channel precoding and utilize uncoded analog modulation for model
aggregation. In contrast, our digital AirComp system leverages digital
modulation and channel codes to overcome phase asynchrony, thereby achieving
accurate model aggregation in the asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems. To
realize a digital AirComp system, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access
protocol that allows simultaneous transmissions from multiple edge devices, and
present a joint channel decoding and aggregation (Jt-CDA) decoder (i.e.,
full-state joint decoder). To reduce the computation complexity, we further
present a reduced-complexity Jt-CDA decoder (i.e., reduced-state joint
decoder), and its arithmetic sum bit error rate performance is similar to that
of the full-state joint decoder for most signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.
Simulation results on test accuracy (of CIFAR10 dataset) versus SNR show that:
1) analog AirComp systems are sensitive to phase asynchrony under practical
setup, and the test accuracy performance exhibits an error floor even at high
SNR regime; 2) our digital AirComp system outperforms an analog AirComp system
by at least 1.5 times when SNR 9dB, demonstrating the advantage of digital
AirComp in asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems.

demonstrated using a robotic swimmer, comprised of a ""head"" sphere and a ""tail""

viscoelastic jet at the tail, which develops due to the fore-aft asymmetry of
the swimmer. Optimized cylindrical and conic tail geometries are shown to
double the propulsive signal, relative to the optimal spherical tail. Finally,
we show that we can use observations of this robot to infer rheological

nonclassical behaviors of EDL including overcharging followed by co-ion
adsorption. In this paper, we characterize the EDL formed near an electrified
graphene interface in dilute aqueous $YCl_3$ solution using in situ high
resolution x-ray reflectivity (also known as crystal truncation rod (CTR)) and
resonant anomalous x-ray reflectivity (RAXR). These interfacial-specific
techniques reveal the electron density profiles with molecular-scale
resolution. We find that yttrium ions ($Y^{3+}$) readily adsorb to the
negatively charged graphene surface to form an extended ion profile. This ion
distribution resembles a classical diffuse layer but with a significantly high
ion coverage, i.e., 1 $Y^{3+}$ per 11.4 $\pm$ 1.6 A$^2$, compared to the value
calculated from the capacitance measured by cyclic voltammetry (1 $Y^{3+}$ per
~240 A$^2$). Such overcharging can be explained by co-adsorption of chloride
that effectively screens the excess positive charge. The adsorbed $Y^{3+}$
profile also shows a molecular-scale gap ($\geq$5 A) from the top graphene
surfaces, which is attributed to the presence of intervening water molecules
between the adsorbents and adsorbates as well as the lack of inner-sphere
surface complexation on chemically inert graphene. We also demonstrate
controlled adsorption by varying the applied potential and reveal consistent
$Y^{3+}$ ion position with respect to the surface and increasing cation

a face-to-face interaction network because it explains the persistent
communities caused by the stationary communication patterns of citizens and
visitors in a city. We regarded citizens and visitors as two kinds of particles
and the community as a phase and theorized the stability of the community
structure using the equilibrium conditions among communities. We formulated the
chemical potentials of the communities and examined whether they were in
equilibrium under the assumption of a canonical ensemble. We estimated the
chemical potentials of persistent communities and found that these values
matched within approximately 10% error for each day. This result indicates that
the cause of persistent communities is the stability of community structure.

dynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread
applications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has
received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and
machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and
control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control,
active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis,
have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an
algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on
approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of
neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free
energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different
possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman
filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere
qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based
on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering.
In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters
consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy
minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers
a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and
standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic
inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural
implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.

result based on static appearances of objects. The motion network estimates the
optical flow via very few parameters, which are optimized rapidly by an online

refines the initial segmentation result using the optical flow. Extensive

During the learning period, a sequence of events relating to firing along a

sequence of events is consolidated in the synaptic weight matrix when a reward
is fed. For retrieval, the sequential activation of conjunctive cue-place cells
toward the reward location is internally generated by an impetus input. In the

layers with quaternion feature transformation to perform message propagation.
Finally, we combine the embeddings generated at each layer with the mean
pooling strategy to obtain the final embeddings for recommendation. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed

human-centric image generation due to its tremendous real-world potential. Yet,
as most try-on approaches fit in-shop garments onto a target person, they
require the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training
dataset, severely limiting their scalability. While a few recent works attempt
to transfer garments directly from one person to another, alleviating the need
to collect paired datasets, their performance is impacted by the lack of paired
(supervised) information. In particular, disentangling style and spatial
information of the garment becomes a challenge, which existing methods either
address by requiring auxiliary data or extensive online optimization
procedures, thereby still inhibiting their scalability. To achieve a
\emph{scalable} virtual try-on system that can transfer arbitrary garments
between a source and a target person in an unsupervised manner, we thus propose
a texture-preserving end-to-end network, the PAtch-routed SpaTially-Adaptive
GAN (PASTA-GAN), that facilitates real-world unpaired virtual try-on.
Specifically, to disentangle the style and spatial information of each garment,
PASTA-GAN consists of an innovative patch-routed disentanglement module for
successfully retaining garment texture and shape characteristics. Guided by the
source person keypoints, the patch-routed disentanglement module first
decouples garments into normalized patches, thus eliminating the inherent
spatial information of the garment, and then reconstructs the normalized
patches to the warped garment complying with the target person pose. Given the
warped garment, PASTA-GAN further introduces novel spatially-adaptive residual
blocks that guide the generator to synthesize more realistic garment details.

images, they have limited style controllability, thus could suffer from
translation errors. In this work, we show that the activation function is one
of the crucial components in controlling the direction of image synthesis.
Specifically, we explicitly demonstrated that the slope parameters of the
rectifier could change the data distribution and be used independently to
control the direction of translation. To improve the style controllability, two
simple but effective techniques are proposed, including Adaptive ReLU (AdaReLU)
and structural adaptive function. The AdaReLU can dynamically adjust the slope
parameters according to the target style and can be utilized to increase the
controllability by combining with Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN).
Meanwhile, the structural adaptative function enables rectifiers to manipulate
the structure of feature maps more effectively. It is composed of the proposed
structural convolution (StruConv), an efficient convolutional module that can
choose the area to be activated based on the mean and variance specified by
AdaIN. Extensive experiments show that the proposed techniques can greatly
increase the network controllability and output diversity in style-based image
translation tasks.

spaces. To this end we first introduce the notion of an equinormed set using a
suitable family of semi-norms on the given normed space satisfying some natural
conditions. Those conditions, roughly speaking, state that the norm can be
approximated (on the equinormed sets even uniformly) by the elements of this
family. As we are given some freedom of choice of the underlying semi-normed
structure that is used to define equinormed sets, our approach opens a new
perspective for building compactness criteria in specific normed spaces. As an
example we show that natural selections of families of semi-norms in spaces
$C(X,\mathbb{R})$ and $l^p$ for $p\in[1,+\infty)$ lead to the well-known
compactness criteria (including the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem). In the second
part of the paper, applying the abstract theorems, we construct a simple
compactness criterion in the space of functions of bounded Schramm variation

the space of functions of bounded Jordan variation to the space of functions of

  Game-Theoretic Approach",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The metaverse is regarded as a new wave of technological transformation that
provides a virtual space for people to interact through digital avatars. To
achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the
key technology. However, computing-intensive tasks of real-time rendering from
metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single
resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload
the metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the
collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC).
Therefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework
for the metaverse services, especially for the vehicular metaverse. In the
framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated
to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse. Specifically,
in the upper layer, a miner coalition formation game is formulated based on a
reputation metric to select reliable workers. To guarantee the reliable
management of reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the
subjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database. In the lower
layer, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is considered to attract
reliable workers selected in the upper layer to participate in rendering tasks.
The simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to
malicious workers. Compared with the best-effort worker selection scheme, the
proposed scheme can improve the utility of metaverse service provider and the
average profit of CDC workers.

customizes individual components of the framework and provides a
Spatio-temporal integration of crime information. It develops an automated

preferential vacant sites is a key to clarifying migration pathways. Here we
report the anisotropic oxygen-ion migration mediated by strain in ultrathin
cobaltites via in-situ thermal activation in an atomic-resolved transmission

the atomic structure during the OVC switching, which is manifested as the
vertical-to-horizontal OVC switching under tensile strain, but the
horizontal-to-diagonal switching under compression. We evaluate the topotactic
structural changes to OVC, determine the crucial role of tolerance factor for
OVC stability and establish the strain-dependent phase diagram. Our work
provides a practical guide for engineering OVC orientation that is applicable

The method relies on a reformulation of the constrained minimization problem in

(IVA) can blindly separate N sources from their sound mixture even with diffuse
noise when a sufficiently large number (=M) of microphones are available (i.e.,
M>>N). However, the estimation accuracy seriously degrades as the number of
microphones, or more specifically M-N (>=0), decreases. To overcome this
limitation of IVA, we propose switching IVA (swIVA) in this paper. With swIVA,
time frames of an observed signal with time-varying characteristics are
clustered into several groups, each of which can be well handled by IVA using a
small number of microphones, and thus accurate estimation can be achieved by
applying IVA individually to each of the groups. Conventionally, a switching
mechanism was introduced into a beamformer; however, no blind source separation
algorithms with a switching mechanism have been successfully developed until
this paper. In order to incorporate dereverberation capability, this paper
further extends swIVA to blind Convolutional beamforming algorithm (swCIVA). It
integrates swIVA and switching Weighted Prediction Error-based dereverberation
(swWPE) in a jointly optimal way. We show that both swIVA and swCIVA can be
optimized effectively based on blind signal processing, and that their
performance can be further improved using a spatial guide for the
initialization. Experiments show that both proposed methods largely outperform
conventional IVA and its Convolutional beamforming extension (CIVA) in terms of
objective signal quality and automatic speech recognition scores when using a

the two-particle entanglement and many-body correlations among members of the

under flow towards the singlet ground state at the strong-coupling fixed point.
Both the number-diagonal and off-diagonal correlations within the conduction

the local moment and strong-coupling ground states, and is related to a change

years. In existing meta-learning approaches, learning tasks for training
meta-models are usually collected from public datasets, which brings the
difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of meta-learning tasks with a large
amount of training data. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach
based on randomly generated meta-learning tasks to obtain a parametric loss for
classification learning based on big data. The loss is represented by a deep
neural network, called meta-loss network (MLN). To train the MLN, we construct
a large number of classification learning tasks through randomly generating
training data, validation data, and corresponding ground-truth linear
classifier. Our approach has two advantages. First, sufficient meta-learning
tasks with large number of training data can be obtained easily. Second, the
ground-truth classifier is given, so that the difference between the learned
classifier and the ground-truth model can be measured to reflect the
performance of MLN more precisely than validation accuracy. Based on this
difference, we apply the evolutionary strategy algorithm to find out the
optimal MLN. The resultant MLN not only leads to satisfactory learning effects
on generated linear classifier learning tasks for testing, but also behaves
very well on generated nonlinear classifier learning tasks and various public
classification tasks. Our MLN stably surpass cross-entropy (CE) and mean square
error (MSE) in testing accuracy and generalization ability. These results
illustrate the possibility of achieving satisfactory meta-learning effects

earth orbit (LEO) satellites have appealing characteristics of ubiquitous

still high, relative to counterparts of ground mobile networks. To support
massively interconnected devices with intelligent adaptive learning and reduce
expensive traffic in SatCom, we propose federated learning (FL) in LEO-based
satellite communication networks. We first review the state-of-the-art
LEO-based SatCom and related machine learning (ML) techniques, and then analyze
four possible ways of combining ML with satellite networks. The learning
performance of the proposed strategies is evaluated by simulation and results
reveal that FL-based computing networks improve the performance of
communication overheads and latency. Finally, we discuss future research topics

V-VLC systems include many noise sources: solar radiation, background lighting

frameworks temporarily move long-lived objects outside the managed heap

(1) high serialization/deserialization (S/D) cost, and (2) high memory pressure
when off-heap objects are moved back to the managed heap for processing. In
this paper, we propose TeraHeap, a system that eliminates S/D overhead and
expensive GC scans for a large portion of the objects in big data frameworks.
TeraHeap relies on three concepts. (1) It eliminates S/D cost by extending the
managed runtime (JVM) to use a second high-capacity heap (H2) over a fast
storage device. (2) It reduces GC cost by fencing the garbage collector from
scanning H2 objects. (3) It offers a simple hint-based interface, which allows
frameworks to leverage knowledge about objects for populating H2. We implement
TeraHeap in OpenJDK and evaluate it with 15 widely used applications in two
real-world big data frameworks, Spark and Giraph. Our evaluation shows that for
the same DRAM size, TeraHeap improves performance by up to 73% and 28% compared

propagation of unreliable sources as a main vehicle of misinformation, the
present study focuses on exploring the role of scientists whose views oppose
the scientific consensus. Using Nobelists in Physiology and Medicine as a proxy
for scientific consensus, we analyze two separate datasets: 15.8K tweets by
13.1K unique users on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and 208K tweets by 151K
unique users on COVID-19 broadly which mention the Nobelist names. Our analyses
reveal that dissenting scientists are amplified by a factor of 426 relative to
true scientific consensus in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, and by a factor
of 43 in the context of COVID-19 generally. Although more popular accounts tend
to mention consensus-abiding scientists more, our results suggest that this
false consensus is driven by higher engagement with dissent-mentioning tweets.
Furthermore, false consensus mostly occurs due to traffic spikes following
highly popularized statements of dissenting scientists. We find that dissenting
voices are mainly discussed in French, English-speaking, Turkish, Brazilian,
Argentine, Indian, and Japanese misinformation clusters. This research suggests
that social media platforms should prioritize the exposure of consensus-abiding

techniques such as spatial- and channel-wise attention to enhance performance.
Another technique that has drawn attention in recent years is residual dense

are capable of extracting diverse features with varied receptive fields and
thus, enhancing performance. However, consecutive stacked convolutional
operators may not necessarily generate features that facilitate the
identification of the target structures. In this paper, we propose a
progressive alternating attention network (PAANet). We develop progressive
alternating attention dense (PAAD) blocks, which construct a guiding attention
map (GAM) after every convolutional layer in the dense blocks using features
from all scales. The GAM allows the following layers in the dense blocks to
focus on the spatial locations relevant to the target region. Every alternate
PAAD block inverts the GAM to generate a reverse attention map which guides
ensuing layers to extract boundary and edge-related information, refining the
segmentation process. Our experiments on three different biomedical image

finite initial second moment) there will be aggregation, and if $M=8 \pi$ (and
finite initial second moment) we get a blow-up in infinite time. Finally,
motivated by the use of entropy techniques on several parts of the work, we
decide to further develop them on other type of equations.

Cayley-Dickson algebras, from complex numbers to octonions and sedenions. This
correspondence leads to a natural enlargement of the Standard Model color
sector, from a SU(3) gauge group to an exceptional Higgs-broken G(2) group,
following the octonionic automorphism relation guideline. In this picture, an
additional ensemble of massive G(2)-gluons emerges, which is separated from the
particle dynamics of the Standard Model.

  Theoretic Perspective","26 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) becomes popular and has shown great potentials in
training large-scale machine learning (ML) models without exposing the owners'
raw data. In FL, the data owners can train ML models based on their local data
and only send the model updates rather than raw data to the model owner for
aggregation. To improve learning performance in terms of model accuracy and
training completion time, it is essential to recruit sufficient participants.
Meanwhile, the data owners are rational and may be unwilling to participate in
the collaborative learning process due to the resource consumption. To address
the issues, there have been various works recently proposed to motivate the
data owners to contribute their resources. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive review for the economic and game theoretic approaches proposed in
the literature to design various schemes for stimulating data owners to
participate in FL training process. In particular, we first present the
fundamentals and background of FL, economic theories commonly used in incentive
mechanism design. Then, we review applications of game theory and economic
approaches applied for incentive mechanisms design of FL. Finally, we highlight
some open issues and future research directions concerning incentive mechanism
design of FL.

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) follows a sub-exponential power-law scaling
whenever effective control interventions are in place. Taking this into
consideration, we present a new phenomenological logistic model that is
well-suited for such power-law epidemic growth.
  Methods: We empirically develop the logistic growth model using simple
scaling arguments, known boundary conditions and a comparison with available
data from four countries, Belgium, China, Denmark and Germany, where (arguably)
effective containment measures were put in place during the first wave of the
pandemic. A non-linear least-squares minimization algorithm is used to map the
parameter space and make optimal predictions.
  Results: Unlike other logistic growth models, our presented model is shown to
consistently make accurate predictions of peak heights, peak locations and
cumulative saturation values for incomplete epidemic growth curves. We further
show that the power-law growth model also works reasonably well when
containment and lock down strategies are not as stringent as they were during
the first wave of infections in 2020. On the basis of this agreement, the model
was used to forecast COVID-19 fatalities for the third wave in South Africa,
which is currently in progress.
  Conclusions: We anticipate that our presented model will be useful for a
similar forecasting of COVID-19 induced infections/deaths in other regions as
well as other cases of infectious disease outbreaks, particularly when
power-law scaling is observed.

precise motion. Such devices, however, are prompt to nonlinear control issues
due to the flexibility in joints and the friction in the motors within the
dynamics of their rigid part. To address these issues, the Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs) and Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) approaches are
implemented in the Takagy-Sugeno Fuzzy Model (T-SFM). We propose the following
methodology; initially, the state space equations of the nonlinear manipulator
model are derived. Next, a Takagy-Sugeno Fuzzy Model (T-SFM) technique is used
for linearizing the state space equations of the nonlinear manipulator. The
T-SFM controller is developed using the Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC)
method. The prime concept of the designed controller is to compensate for all
the fuzzy rules. Furthermore, the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are applied
to generate adequate cases to ensure stability and control. Convex programming
methods are applied to solve the developed LMIs problems. Simulations developed
for the proposed model show that the proposed controller stabilized the system
with zero tracking error in less than 1.5 s.

learning, refers to the task of learning with unlabeled documents and a few
predefined representative words of categories, known as seed words. The recent
generative dataless methods construct document-specific category priors by
using seed word occurrences only, however, such category priors often contain
very limited and even noisy supervised signals. To remedy this problem, in this
paper we propose a novel formulation of category prior. First, for each
document, we consider its label membership degree by not only counting seed
word occurrences, but also using a novel prototype scheme, which captures
pseudo-nearest neighboring categories. Second, for each label, we consider its
frequency prior knowledge of the corpus, which is also a discriminative
knowledge for classification. By incorporating the proposed category prior into
the previous generative dataless method, we suggest a novel generative dataless
method, namely Weakly Supervised Prototype Topic Model (WSPTM). The
experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that WSPTM outperforms
the existing baseline methods.
