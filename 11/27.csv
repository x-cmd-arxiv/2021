flows with moving contact lines in three dimensions. The mathematical model
consists of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the two immiscible
fluids with the standard interface conditions, the Navier slip condition along
the solid wall, and a contact angle condition which relates the dynamic contact
angle to the normal velocity of the contact line (Ren et al. (2010)
\cite{Ren10}). In the numerical method, the governing equations for the fluid
dynamics are coupled with an advection equation for a level-set function. The
latter models the dynamics of the fluid interface. Following the standard
practice, the interface conditions are taken into account by introducing a
singular force on the interface in the momentum equation. This results in a
single set of governing equations in the whole fluid domain. Similar to the
treatment of the interface conditions, the contact angle condition is imposed
by introducing a singular force, which acts in the normal direction of the
contact line, into the Navier slip condition. The new boundary condition, which
unifies the Navier slip condition and the contact angle condition, is imposed
along the solid wall. The model is solved using the finite difference method.
Numerical results, including a convergence study, are presented for the
spreading of a droplet on both homogeneous and inhomogeneous solid walls, as
well as the dynamics of a droplet on an inclined plate under gravity.

quantum channel that mediates the transmission maps the orthogonal states into
non-orthogonal states, possibly mixed. If an accurate model of the channel is
unavailable, then the states received by Bob are unknown. In order to decode
the transmitted information we propose to train a measurement device to achieve
the smallest possible error in the discrimination process. This is achieved by
supplementing the quantum channel with a classical one, which allows the
transmission of information required for the training, and resorting to a
noise-tolerant optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the training method in
the case of minimum-error discrimination and show that it achieves error
probabilities very close to the optimal one. In particular, in the case of two
unknown pure states our proposal approaches the Helstrom bound. A similar
result holds for a larger number of states in higher dimensions. We also show
that a reduction of the search space, which is used in the training process,
leads to a considerable reduction in the required resources. Finally, we apply
our proposal to the case of the dephasing channel reaching an accurate value of
the optimal error probability.

of many important factors determining the success of future tokamaks. In JET,
eight in-vessel antennas were installed to actively probe stable AEs with
frequencies ranging 25-250 kHz and toroidal mode numbers $\vert n \vert < 20$.
During the 2019-2020 deuterium campaign, almost 7500 resonances and their
frequencies $f_0$, net damping rates $\gamma < 0$, and toroidal mode numbers
were measured in almost 800 plasma discharges. From a statistical analysis of
this database, continuum and radiative damping are inferred to increase with
edge safety factor, edge magnetic shear, and when including non-ideal effects.
Both stable AE observations and their associated damping rates are found to
decrease with $\vert n \vert$. Active antenna excitation is also found to be
ineffective in H-mode as opposed to L-mode; this is likely due to the increased
edge density gradient's effect on accessibility and ELM-related noise's impact
on mode identification. A novel measurement is reported of a marginally stable,
edge-localized Ellipticity-induced AE probed by the antennas during high-power
auxiliary heating (ICRH and NBI) up to 25 MW. NOVA-K kinetic-MHD simulations
show good agreement with experimental measurements of $f_0$, $\gamma$, and $n$,
indicating the dominance of continuum and electron Landau damping in this case.
Similar experimental and computational studies are planned for the recent
hydrogen and ongoing tritium campaigns, in preparation for the upcoming DT
campaign.

is characterized by local chiral currents. This chiral superfluid phase is
shown to undergo a phase transition to a chiral Mott insulator for sufficiently
strong interactions. Our work establishes coupled $\pi$-flux plaquettes as a
practical route for the emergence of orbital order and chiral phases of matter.

that taking such views into account in the design of the JRS can lead to
improved model performance. Also, it may lead to a more uniform distribution of

perspective of algorithm fairness. Here we find that this is rarely discussed

removing the discriminatory feature would be sufficient. With respect to the
type of models used in JRS, authors frequently label their method as `hybrid'.
Unfortunately, they thereby obscure what these methods entail. Using existing
recommender taxonomies, we split this large class of hybrids into subcategories
that are easier to analyse. We further find that data availability, and in
particular the availability of click data, has a large impact on the choice of
method and validation. Last, although the generalizability of JRS across

systems. Two of the QSO2s are red early-type galaxies with no CO(2-1) detected.
In the interacting galaxies, the central kpc contains 18-25% of the total cold
molecular gas, whereas in the spirals it is only 5-12%. J1010+0612 and
J1430+1339 show double-peaked CO morphologies which do not have optical
counterparts. Based on our analysis of the ionized and molecular kinematics and
mm continuum emission, these CO morphologies are most likely produced by AGN
feedback in the form of outflows, jets, and/or shocks. The CO kinematics of the
QSO2s are dominated by rotation but also reveal noncircular motions. According
to our analysis of the kinematics, these noncircular motions correspond to
molecular outflows mostly coplanar with the CO discs in four of the QSO2s, and
either to a coplanar inflow or vertical outflow in the case of J1010+0612.
These outflows represent 0.2-0.7% of the QSO2s' total molecular gas mass and
have maximum velocities of 200-350 km/s, radii from 0.4 to 1.3 kpc, and outflow
rates of 8-16 Msun/yr. These properties are intermediate between those of the
mild molecular outflows measured for Seyferts, and the fast and energetic
outflows of ULIRGs. This suggests that it is not only AGN luminosity that
drives massive molecular outflows. Other factors such as jet power, coupling
between winds, jets, and/or ionized outflows and the CO discs, and amount or
geometry of dense gas in the nuclear regions might be also relevant. Thus,
although we do not find evidence for a significant impact of quasar feedback on
the total molecular gas reservoirs and SFRs, it appears to be modifying the
distribution of cold molecular gas in the central kpc of the galaxies.

(1) Our method can not only learn visual representation from images but also
learn corresponding linguistic representation from noisy class-level text

the learned visual-linguistic representation to improve the visual recognition
performance, especially for classes with fewer image samples. We also conduct
extensive experiments and set the new state-of-the-art performance on

contact interface, its best descriptions at the macroscopic scale remain
phenomenological. The so called ""rate-and-state"" models, which specify the
friction response in terms of the relative sliding velocity and the ""age"" of
the contact interface, fail to uncover the nano-scale mechanisms governing the
macro-scale response, while models of friction at the atomic scale often
overlook how roughness can alter the friction behavior. Here we bridge this gap
between nano and macro descriptions of friction by correlating the physical
origin of macroscopic friction to the existence, due to nanometric roughness,
of contact junctions between adsorbed monolayers. Their dynamics, as we show,
emerges from molecular motion. Through coupled experimental and atomic
simulations, we highlight that transient friction overshoots its steady-state
value after the system is allowed to rest, with the friction force decaying to
a steady-state value over a distance of a few nanometers, much smaller than the
junction size, even with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.6 nm. We demonstrate
how this transient decay is intrinsically related to the evolution of the
number of cross-surface attractive physical links between adsorbed molecules on
rough surfaces. We also show that roughness is a sufficient condition for the
appearance of frictional aging. In systems that show structural aging, this
paints contact junctions as a key component in the observation of the transient
friction overshoot, and shows how infrajunction molecular motion can control
the macroscopic response.

a key problem in many applications. Here, we develop a statistical model and
algorithm for tracking an unknown number of targets based on the probabilistic
fusion of observations from two classes of data sources. The first class,
referred to as target-independent perception systems (TIPSs), consists of
sensors that periodically produce noisy measurements of targets without
requiring target cooperation. The second class, referred to as target-dependent
reporting systems (TDRSs), relies on cooperative targets that report noisy
measurements of their state and their identity. We present a joint TIPS-TDRS
observation model that accounts for observation-origin uncertainty, missed
detections, false alarms, and asynchronicity. We then establish a factor graph
that represents this observation model along with a state evolution model
including target identities. Finally, by executing the sum-product algorithm on
that factor graph, we obtain a scalable multitarget tracking algorithm with
inherent TIPS-TDRS fusion. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
evaluated using simulated data as well as real data from a maritime
surveillance experiment.

to such multi-critical accretion flow, one needs to employ numerical solutions
of the corresponding fluid dynamics equations. In the present work, we develop
a {\it{completely analytical}} solution scheme which may be used to find
several trans-critical flow behaviours of aforementioned accretion, without
explicitly solving the flow equations numerically. We study all possible
geometric configurations of the flow profile, governed by all possible
thermodynamic equations of state. We use Sturm's chain algorithm to find out
how many physically acceptable critical points the accretion flow can have, and
discuss the transition from the mono to the multi-critical flow profile, and
related bifurcation phenomena. We thus illustrate, completely analytically, the
application of certain aspects of the dynamical systems theory in the field of
large scale astrophysical flow under the influence of strong gravity. Our work
may possibly be generalized to calculate the maximal number of equilibrium

growing attention to cybersecurity, where many challenges remain unresolved.
Namely, for intrusion detection, new algorithms that are more robust,
effective, and able to use more information are needed. Moreover, the intrusion
detection task faces a serious challenge associated with the extreme class
imbalance between normal and malicious traffics. Recently, graph-neural network
(GNN) achieved state-of-the-art performance to model the network topology in
cybersecurity tasks. However, only a few works exist using GNNs to tackle the

the attention mechanism are still under-explored. This paper presents two novel
graph-based solutions for intrusion detection, the modified E-GraphSAGE, and
E-ResGATalgorithms, which rely on the established GraphSAGE and graph attention

into the GNN leveraging the available graph information. Residual connections
are added as a strategy to deal with the high-class imbalance, aiming at
retaining the original information and improving the minority classes'

Dark Scattering model and implement it into ReACT. The reaction is combined
with a pseudo spectrum from EuclidEmulator2 and compared to N-body simulations.
Using standard mass function and concentration-mass relation, we find
predictions to be 1 % accurate at $z=0$ up to $k=0.8~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for the
largest interaction strength tested ($\xi=50$ b/GeV), improving to $2~h/{\rm

agreement at $z=1$ up to scales above $3.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, being close to
$1~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$. Finally, we improve our predictions with the
inclusion of baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos and study degeneracies
between the effects of these contributions and those of the interaction.
Limiting the scales to where our modelling is 1 % accurate, we find a
degeneracy between the interaction and feedback, but not with massive
neutrinos. We expect the degeneracy with feedback to be resolvable by including
smaller scales. This work represents the first analytical tool for calculating
the nonlinear spectrum for interacting dark energy models.

predict the backbone curve of reinforced concrete shear (structural) walls

detailed test database consisting of 384 reinforced concrete shear walls under
cyclic loading were utilized to predict seven critical points to define the
backbone curves, namely: shear at cracking point; shear and displacement at
yielding point; and peak shear force and corresponding displacement; and
ultimate displacement and corresponding shear. The predictive models were
developed based on the Gaussian Process Regression method (GPR), which adopts a
non-parametric Bayesian approach. The ability of the proposed GPR-based model
to make accurate and robust estimations for the backbone curves was validated
based on unseen data using a hundred random sampling procedure. The prediction
accuracies (i.e., ratio of predicted/actual values) are close to 1.0, whereas
the coefficient of determination (R2) values range between 0.90-0.97 for all

  of Germany: Trading from the Perspective of a Wind Park Operator","17 pages, including appendix., 11 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rising extension of renewable energies, the intraday electricity
markets have recorded a growing popularity amongst traders as well as electric
utilities to cope with the induced volatility of the energy supply. Through
their short trading horizon and continuous nature, the intraday markets offer
the ability to adjust trading decisions from the day-ahead market or reduce
trading risk in a short-term notice. Producers of renewable energies utilize
the intraday market to lower their forecast risk, by modifying their provided
capacities based on current forecasts. However, the market dynamics are complex
due to the fact that the power grids have to remain stable and electricity is
only partly storable. Consequently, robust and intelligent trading strategies
are required that are capable to operate in the intraday market. In this work,
we propose a novel autonomous trading approach based on Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms as a possible solution. For this purpose, we model
the intraday trade as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and employ the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm as our DRL approach. A simulation framework
is introduced that enables the trading of the continuous intraday price in a
resolution of one minute steps. We test our framework in a case study from the
perspective of a wind park operator. We include next to general trade
information both price and wind forecasts. On a test scenario of German
intraday trading results from 2018, we are able to outperform multiple
baselines with at least 45.24% improvement, showing the advantage of the DRL
algorithm. However, we also discuss limitations and enhancements of the DRL
agent, in order to increase the performance in future works.

is shown to form a Lorentz invariant. Although our findings are not able to
determine, via first principles, an information-theoretic Lorentz invariant,
they pave the way for fundamental incursions along this line.

to generate synthetic data, especially images, for data sharing purposes. Given
the vital importance of preserving the privacy of the individual data points in
the original data, GANs are trained utilizing frameworks with robust privacy
guarantees such as Differential Privacy (DP). However, these approaches remain
widely unstudied beyond single performance metrics when presented with
imbalanced datasets. To this end, we systematically compare GANs trained with
the two best-known DP frameworks for deep learning, DP-SGD, and PATE, in
different data imbalance settings from two perspectives -- the size of the
classes in the generated synthetic data and their classification performance.
  Our analyses show that applying PATE, similarly to DP-SGD, has a disparate
effect on the under/over-represented classes but in a much milder magnitude
making it more robust. Interestingly, our experiments consistently show that
for PATE, unlike DP-SGD, the privacy-utility trade-off is not monotonically
decreasing but is much smoother and inverted U-shaped, meaning that adding a
small degree of privacy actually helps generalization. However, we have also
identified some settings (e.g., large imbalance) where PATE-GAN completely
fails to learn some subparts of the training data.

champion inducing a round-robin tournament among the players by employing a
machine learning model to estimate who wins each pairwise comparison. Our
contribution, thus, allows finding the champion by performing a low number of

we show that all-optical, mode-selective manipulation of the crystal lattice
can be used to enhance and stabilize high-temperature ferromagnetism in

unsaturated low-temperature magnetic moment, and a suppressed Curie

temperatures and transient ferromagnetism is realized up to $T_{neq} >$ 80 K,
nearly three times the thermodynamic transition temperature. First-principles
and model calculations of the nonlinear phonon-orbital-spin coupling reveal
that these effects originate from dynamical changes to the orbital polarization
and the makeup of the lowest quasi-degenerate Ti $t_{2g}$ levels. Notably,
light-induced high temperature ferromagnetism in YTiO$_3$ is found to be
metastable over many nanoseconds, underscoring the ability to dynamically

structures and a vast amount of information. The field of modern pathology has
been systematized around the findings and observations obtained from light

to those at the cellular level; thus, observations of cellular ultrastructures
are difficult. Therefore, only vague information can be collected. Various
imaging methodologies and tissue staining techniques have been created to
further understand the complexity of biological tissues. Using such approaches,
it has been realized that cellular morphology data that comprehensively acquire
biological tissue information can be treated as new omics information, termed
the 'Totalities of body tissue morphology (morphome)'. In addition, it is also
possible to revisit vague morphological information quantitatively and
objectively using knowledge relating to the latest scientific information.
Currently, new technologies are allowing additional frontiers to be opened.
Indeed, I believe that a new revolution is about to take place regarding the
'viewing' of tissues by innovative imaging technologies such as 'wide-area
electron microscopy (EM)', which can observe a wide area of several millimeters
or more with nano-level resolution. Moreover, with the advent of cutting-edge
information technology, I expect big data processing to be more innovative.
Through the incorporation of these new methodologies, the field of pathology is
expected to deepen through the identification of previously unknown structures,
the quantification of infrequent rare events, the new reclassification of
diseases, and the automatic diagnosis of diseases. In this review, I introduce
the innovation of the EM imaging and discuss the field of pathology with regard

or collective freezing for known stochastic local search strategies. An
exponential computational effort is generally required to unfreeze such
variables and explore other unseen regions of the configuration space. Here, we
introduce a quantum-inspired family of nonlocal Nonequilibrium Monte Carlo
(NMC) algorithms by developing an adaptive gradient-free strategy that can
efficiently learn key instance-wise geometrical features of the cost function.
That information is employed on-the-fly to construct spatially inhomogeneous
thermal fluctuations for collectively unfreezing variables at various length
scales, circumventing costly exploration versus exploitation trade-offs. We
apply our algorithm to two of the most challenging combinatorial optimization
problems: random k-satisfiability (k-SAT) near the computational phase
transitions and Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP). We observe significant
speedup and robustness over both specialized deterministic solvers and generic
stochastic solvers. In particular, for 90% of random 4-SAT instances we find
solutions that are inaccessible for the best specialized deterministic
algorithm known as Survey Propagation (SP) with an order of magnitude
improvement in the quality of solutions for the hardest 10% instances. We also
demonstrate two orders of magnitude improvement in time-to-solution over the
state-of-the-art generic stochastic solver known as Adaptive Parallel Tempering
(APT).

constrained using observations. Using the unprecedented amount and quality of

APOGEE and Gaia, we aim to derive strong constraints on the infall history of
the inner (less than 6 kpc) Galaxy (with a focus on stars between 4-6 kpc,
which we show is an appropriate proxy for the entire inner disc). We have
implemented gas infall into a chemical evolution model of the Galaxy disc, and
used a Schmidt-Kennicutt law to connect the infall to the star formation. We
explore a number of models, and two different formulations of the infall law.
In one formulation, the infall is non-parametric, and in the other the infall
has an explicitly exponential form. We fit the model parameters to the
time-[Si/Fe] distribution of solar vicinity stars, and the metallicity and
[Si/Fe] distribution function of stars with a galactocentric radius between 4-6
kpc from APOGEE. Our results point to a fast early gas accretion, with an upper
limit of accretion timescale of around 2 Gyr in the inner disc of the Milky
Way. This suggests that at least half the baryons were in place within 2-3 Gyr
of the Big Bang, and that half the stars of the inner disc formed within the
first 5 Gyr, during the thick disc formation phase. This implies that the
stellar mass of the inner disc is dominated by the thick disc, supporting our
previous work, and that the gas accretion onto the inner disc was rapid and

integral to numerous emergent quantum phenomena. A striking example is the Bose
gas, which upon confinement to one dimension (1D) obeys an infinite set of
conservation laws, prohibiting thermalization and constraining dynamics. In our
experiment, we demonstrate that such 1D behavior can extend much farther into
the dimensional crossover towards 3D than expected. Starting from a weakly
interacting Bose gas trapped in a highly elongated potential, we perform a
quench to instigate dynamics of a single density mode. Employing the theory of
Generalized Hydrodynamics, we identify the dominant relaxation mechanism as the
1D dephasing of the relevant collective excitations of the system, the
rapidities. Surprisingly, the dephasing remains dominant even for temperatures
far exceeding conventional limits of one-dimensionality where thermalization
should occur. We attribute our observations to an emergent Pauli blocking of
transverse excitations, caused by the rapidities assuming fermionic statistics,
despite the gas being purely bosonic. Thus, our study suggests that 1D physics
is less fragile than previously thought, as it can persist even in the presence
of significant perturbations. More broadly, by employing the exact Bethe ansatz
solutions of the many-body system, we facilitate an interpretation of how the
emergent macroscopic behavior arises from the microscopic interactions.

generative modeling to capture the set of similar individuals in the generative
latent space. This enables us to learn individually fair representations that
map similar individuals close together by using adversarial training to
minimize the distance between their representations. Finally, we employ
randomized smoothing to provably map similar individuals close together, in
turn ensuring that local robustness verification of the downstream application
results in end-to-end fairness certification. Our experimental evaluation on
challenging real-world image data demonstrates that our method increases
certified individual fairness by up to 90% without significantly affecting task
utility.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The goal of contrastive learning based pre-training is to leverage large
quantities of unlabeled data to produce a model that can be readily adapted
downstream. Current approaches revolve around solving an image discrimination
task: given an anchor image, an augmented counterpart of that image, and some
other images, the model must produce representations such that the distance
between the anchor and its counterpart is small, and the distances between the
anchor and the other images are large. There are two significant problems with
this approach: (i) by contrasting representations at the image-level, it is
hard to generate detailed object-sensitive features that are beneficial to
downstream object-level tasks such as instance segmentation; (ii) the
augmentation strategy of producing an augmented counterpart is fixed, making
learning less effective at the later stages of pre-training. In this work, we
introduce Curricular Contrastive Object-level Pre-training (CCOP) to tackle
these problems: (i) we use selective search to find rough object regions and
use them to build an inter-image object-level contrastive loss and an
intra-image object-level discrimination loss into our pre-training objective;
(ii) we present a curriculum learning mechanism that adaptively augments the
generated regions, which allows the model to consistently acquire a useful
learning signal, even in the later stages of pre-training. Our experiments show
that our approach improves on the MoCo v2 baseline by a large margin on
multiple object-level tasks when pre-training on multi-object scene image
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/CCOP.

a voxel representation (without transforming into a point cloud or mesh),
naturally a fully implicit optimization of geometry and camera poses and easy

several other related conjectures.
  We prove the weak Additive Basis conjecture proposed by Szegedy, making a
significant step towards the Additive Basis conjecture of Jaeger, Linial,
Payan, and Tarsi. In fact, we prove it in a strong form: there exists a set
$A\subset\mathbb{F}_p^*$ of size $O(\log p)$ such that if
$B\subset\mathbb{F}_p^{n}$ is the union of $p$ linear bases, then $A\cdot
B=\{a\cdot v:a\in A, v\in B\}$ is an additive basis.
  An old result of Tomkinson states that if $G$ is a group, and
$\{H_{i}x_{i}:i\in [k]\}$ is an irredundant coset cover of $G$, then
$|G:\bigcap_{i\in [k]} H_{i}|\leq k!,$ and this bound is the best possible. It
is a longstanding open problem whether the upper bound can be improved to
$e^{O(k)}$ in case we restrict cosets to subgroups. Pyber proposed to study
this question for abelian groups. We show that somewhat surprisingly, if $G$ is
abelian, the upper bound can be improved to $e^{O(k\log \log k)}$ already in
the case of general coset covers, making the first substantial improvement over
the $k!$ bound.

compute posterior distributions on the mass and spin of the initial black holes

theorem. We use different waveform models to quantify systematic waveform
uncertainties for the area increase law with the two events. We find that these
errors may lead to overstating the confidence with which the area theorem is
confirmed. For example, we find $>99\%$ agreement with the area theorem for
GW150914 if a damped sinusoid consisting of a single-mode is used at merger to
estimate the final area. This is because this model overestimates the final
mass. Including an overtone of the dominant mode decreases the confidence to
$\sim94\%$; using a full merger-ringdown model further decreases the confidence
to $\sim 85-90\%$. We find that comparing the measured change in the area to
the expected change in area yields a more robust test, as it also captures over

parent compound of the recently discovered family of infinite-layer (IL)
nickelate superconductors, using multiple experimental and theoretical methods.
Our specific heat, muon-spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and magnetic susceptibility
measurements on polycrystalline LaNiO$_{2}$ show that long-range magnetic order
remains absent down to 2 K. Nevertheless, we detect residual entropy in the
low-temperature specific heat, which is compatible with a model fit that
includes paramagnon excitations. The $\mu$SR and low-field static and dynamic
magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the presence of short-range
magnetic correlations and glassy spin dynamics, which we attribute to local
oxygen non-stoichiometry in the average infinite-layer crystal structure. This
glassy behavior can be suppressed in strong external fields, allowing us to
extract the intrinsic paramagnetic susceptibility. Remarkably, we find that the
intrinsic susceptibility shows non-Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures,
in analogy to doped cuprates that possess robust non-local spin fluctuations.
The distinct temperature dependence of the intrinsic susceptibility of
LaNiO$_{2}$ can be theoretically understood by a multi-method study of the
single-band Hubbard model in which we apply complementary cutting-edge quantum
many-body techniques (dynamical mean-field theory, cellular dynamical
mean-field theory and the dynamical vertex approximation) to investigate the
influence of both short- and long-ranged correlations. Our results suggest a
profound analogy between the magnetic correlations in parent (undoped) IL

Z boson, and two quarks produced by the decay of a Z, W, or Higgs boson H. The
analysis is sensitive to resonances with masses in the range 450 to 2000 GeV.
Two categories are defined corresponding to the merged or resolved
reconstruction of the hadronically decaying boson. The search is based on data
collected during 2016-2018 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No significant excess is observed in the data
above the standard model background expectation. Upper limits on the production
cross section of heavy, narrow spin-2 and spin-1 resonances are derived as
functions of the resonance mass, and exclusion limits on the production of bulk
graviton particles and W$'$ bosons are calculated in the framework of the
warped extra dimensions and heavy vector triplet models, respectively. In
addition, upper limits on the ALP-mediated diboson production cross section and
ALP couplings to standard model particles are obtained in the framework of
linear and chiral effective field theories. These are the first limits on
nonresonant ALP-mediated ZZ and ZH production obtained by the LHC experiments.

element-wise absolute value function. This problem is severely ill-posed
because both the kernel and signal are unknown and, in addition, the
measurements are phaseless, leading to many $\boldsymbol{x}$-$\boldsymbol{h}$
pairs that correspond to the measurements. Therefore, to guarantee a stable
recovery of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{h}$ from $\boldsymbol{y}$, we
assume that the kernel $\boldsymbol{h}$ and the signal $\boldsymbol{x}$ lie in
known subspaces of dimensions $k$ and $s$, respectively, such that $m\gg k+s$.
We solve this problem by proposing a blind deconvolution algorithm for
phaseless super-resolution (BliPhaSu) to minimize a non-convex least-squares
objective function. The method first estimates a low-resolution version of both
signals through a spectral algorithm, which are then refined based upon a
sequence of stochastic gradient iterations. We show that our BliPhaSu algorithm
converges linearly to a pair of true signals on expectation under a proper
initialization that is based on spectral method. Numerical results from
experimental data demonstrate perfect recovery of both $\boldsymbol{h}$ and
$\boldsymbol{x}$ using our method.

nuclear rearrangements during chemical reactions in an highly enantio-sensitive
manner. Using a state-of-the-art implementation of time-dependent density
functional theory, we explore how the nonlinear response of the prototypical
chiral molecule H2O2 changes as a function of its dihedral angle, which defines
its handedness. The macroscopic intensity emitted from randomly oriented
molecules at even harmonic frequencies (of the fundamental) depends strongly on
this nuclear coordinate. Because of the ultrafast nature of such nonlinear
interactions, the direct mapping between chiral dichroism and nuclear geometry
provides a way to probe chiral nuclear dynamics at their natural time scales.
Our work paves the way for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging of
enantio-sensitive dynamics in more complex chiral systems, including

identity switch. We reveal that premature tracklet termination is the main
cause of identity switches in modern 3DMOT systems. To address this, we propose
Immortal Tracker, a simple tracking system that utilizes trajectory prediction
to maintain tracklets for objects gone dark. We employ a simple Kalman filter
for trajectory prediction and preserve the tracklet by prediction when the

gains the benefits of data-driven methods under sparse point density while

  Detection","Published as a conference paper at AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal Activity Detection aims to predict activity classes per frame, in
contrast to video-level predictions in Activity Classification (i.e., Activity
Recognition). Due to the expensive frame-level annotations required for
detection, the scale of detection datasets is limited. Thus, commonly, previous
work on temporal activity detection resorts to fine-tuning a classification
model pretrained on large-scale classification datasets (e.g., Kinetics-400).
However, such pretrained models are not ideal for downstream detection, due to
the disparity between the pretraining and the downstream fine-tuning tasks. In
this work, we propose a novel 'weakly-guided self-supervised' pretraining
method for detection. We leverage weak labels (classification) to introduce a
self-supervised pretext task (detection) by generating frame-level pseudo
labels, multi-action frames, and action segments. Simply put, we design a
detection task similar to downstream, on large-scale classification data,
without extra annotations. We show that the models pretrained with the proposed
weakly-guided self-supervised detection task outperform prior work on multiple
challenging activity detection benchmarks, including Charades and MultiTHUMOS.
Our extensive ablations further provide insights on when and how to use the

mechanisms, feed-forward networks or convolutions has been highly effective in
recent years. Such methods usually have a common pipeline: a tokenization
method, followed by a set of layers/blocks for information mixing, both within

flattened, discarding the spatial structure within each patch. As a result, any

have significant gains when spatial structure is preserved during tokenization,

implements a random Pauli once followed by the implementation of a random

in the form of a quantum channel. We show that when this scheme is implemented
$k$ times, then, in the $k \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the overall scheme
implements a unitary $3$-design. This is proved by studying the
eigendecomposition of the scheme: the $+1$ eigenspace of the scheme coincides
with that of an exact unitary $3$-design, and the remaining eigenvalues are
bounded by a constant. Using this we prove that the scheme has to be
implemented approximately $\mathcal{O}(m + \log 1/\epsilon)$ times to obtain an
$\epsilon$-approximate unitary $3$-design, where $m$ is the number of qubits,
and $\epsilon$ is the diamond-norm distance of the exact unitary $3$-design.
Also, the scheme implements an asymptotic unitary $2$-design with the following
convergence rate: it has to be sampled $\mathcal{O}(\log 1/\epsilon)$ times to
be an $\epsilon$-approximate unitary $2$-design. Since transvection Cliffords
are a conjugacy class of the Clifford group, the eigenspaces of the scheme's
quantum channel coincide with the irreducible invariant subspaces of the
adjoint representation of the Clifford group. Some of the subrepresentations we
obtain are the same as were obtained in J. Math. Phys. 59, 072201 (2018),

decomposition of the adjoint representation for $3$ copies for the Clifford
group. Thus, aside from providing a scheme for the implementation of unitary
$3$-design, this work is of interest for studying representation theory of the
Clifford group, and the potential applications of this topic. The paper ends
with open questions regarding the scheme and representation theory of the

synthesis from a collection of posed input images. Like most view synthesis
methods, NeRF uses tonemapped low dynamic range (LDR) as input; these images
have been processed by a lossy camera pipeline that smooths detail, clips
highlights, and distorts the simple noise distribution of raw sensor data. We
modify NeRF to instead train directly on linear raw images, preserving the
scene's full dynamic range. By rendering raw output images from the resulting
NeRF, we can perform novel high dynamic range (HDR) view synthesis tasks. In
addition to changing the camera viewpoint, we can manipulate focus, exposure,
and tonemapping after the fact. Although a single raw image appears
significantly more noisy than a postprocessed one, we show that NeRF is highly
robust to the zero-mean distribution of raw noise. When optimized over many
noisy raw inputs (25-200), NeRF produces a scene representation so accurate
that its rendered novel views outperform dedicated single and multi-image deep
raw denoisers run on the same wide baseline input images. As a result, our

between aforementioned theories and observations. Here, leveraging a fast
machine learning inference framework, we present the discovery of the offset

close-wide and inner-outer degeneracies, generalises to resonant topologies,
and upon reanalysis, not only appears ubiquitous in previously published

inconsistencies. Our analysis demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not
strictly result in degenerate magnifications and that the commonly invoked

elliptical galaxy NGC 2693 as part of the MASSIVE survey. We combine high
signal-to-noise integral field spectroscopy (IFS) from the Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph (GMOS) with wide-field data from the Mitchell Spectrograph at
McDonald Observatory to extract and model stellar kinematics of NGC 2693 from
the central $\sim 150$ pc out to $\sim2.5$ effective radii. Observations from
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 are used to determine the stellar light
distribution. We perform fully triaxial Schwarzschild orbit modeling using the
latest TriOS code and a Bayesian search in 6-D galaxy model parameter space to
determine NGC 2693's SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$), stellar mass-to-light ratio,
dark matter content, and intrinsic shape. We find $M_\text{BH} = \left(1.7\pm
0.4\right)\times 10^{9}\ M_\odot$ and a triaxial intrinsic shape with axis
ratios $p=b/a=0.902 \pm 0.009$ and $q=c/a=0.721^{+0.011}_{-0.010}$, triaxiality
parameter $T = 0.39 \pm 0.04$. In comparison, the best-fit orbit model in the
axisymmetric limit and (cylindrical) Jeans anisotropic model of NGC 2693 prefer
$M_\text{BH} = \left(2.4\pm 0.6\right)\times 10^{9}\ M_\odot$ and $M_\text{BH}
= \left(2.9\pm 0.3\right)\times 10^{9}\ M_\odot$, respectively. Neither model
can account for the non-axisymmetric stellar velocity features present in the

source of gravitational waves (GWs) for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). DWDs with GW frequencies below $\sim1$ mHz will be the dominant
contributor to a stochastic foreground caused by overlapping GW signals.
Population modeling of Galactic DWDs typically assumes a binary fraction of 50%
and a log-uniform Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) orbital period distribution.
However, recent observations have shown that the binary fraction of close,
solar-type stars exhibits a strong anti-correlation with metallicity which
modulates the ZAMS orbital period distribution below $10^4$ days. In this study
we perform the first simulation of the Galactic DWD population observable by
LISA which incorporates an empirically-derived metallicity-dependent binary
fraction, using the binary population synthesis suite COSMIC and a
metallicity-dependent star formation history. We compare two models: one which
assumes a metallicity-dependent binary fraction, and one with a binary fraction
of 50%. We repeat our analysis for three different assumptions for Roche-lobe
overflow interactions. We find that while metallicity impacts the evolution and
intrinsic properties of our simulated DWD progenitor binaries, the
LISA-resolvable populations of the two models remain roughly indistinguishable.
However, the size of the total Galactic DWD population orbiting in the LISA
frequency band is reduced by more than half when accounting for a
metallicity-dependent binary fraction for two of our four variations, which
also lowers the effective foreground. The LISA population remains unchanged in
number for two variations, highlighting the sensitivity of the population to
binary evolution prescriptions.

depletion timescales decrease towards lower $z$, with H$_2$ depletion times
remaining below the Hubble time and comparable to the dynamical time at all

efficient at driving cold-gas collapse in a broad variety of environments and

Moreover, we identify five systems with $M_\mathrm{WD} < 0.5\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
which are most likely representative of helium-core white dwarfs, showing that
these CVs are present in the overall population. We reveal the presence of an
anti-correlation between the average accretion rates and the white dwarf masses

reflects the rate of system angular momentum loss, this correlation suggests
the presence of an additional mechanism of angular momentum loss that is more
efficient at low white dwarf masses. This is the fundamental concept of the
recently proposed empirical prescription of consequential angular momentum loss
(eCAML) and our results provide observational support for it, although we also
highlight how its current recipe needs to be refined to better reproduce the

the Galactic disk, the latitudinal proper motion has a close projection with
vertical velocity, such that the phase-space spiral in the plane of vertical
position and vertical velocity can be observed without requiring that all stars
have available radial velocity information. We divided the Galactic plane into
360 separate data samples, each corresponding to an area cell in the Galactic
plane in the distance range of 1.4-3.4 kpc, with an approximate cell length of
200-400 pc. Roughly half of our data samples were disqualified altogether due
to severe selection effects, especially in the direction of the Galactic
centre. In the remainder, we were able to infer the vertical gravitational
potential by fitting an analytic model of the phase-space spiral to the data.
This work is the first of its kind, in the sense that we are weighing distant
regions of the Galactic disk with a high spatial resolution, without relying on
the strong assumptions of axisymmetry. Post-inference, we fit a thin disk scale
length of $2.2\pm 0.1$ kpc, although this value is sensitive to the considered
spatial region. We see surface density variations as a function of azimuth on
the order of 10-20 %, which is roughly the size of our estimated sum of
potential systematic biases. With this work, we have demonstrated that our
method can be used to weigh distant regions of the Galactic disk despite strong
selection effects. We expect to reach even greater distances and improve our
accuracy with future Gaia data releases and further improvements to our method.

structure, halo density profiles, and on the abundance of different baryonic
phases within halos and in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The unified picture
that emerges from our analysis is that the main physical drivers shaping the
distribution of matter at all scales are star formation-driven galactic
outflows at $z>2$ for lower mass halos and AGN jets at $z<2$ in higher mass
halos. Feedback suppresses the baryon mass function with time relative to the
halo mass function, and it even impacts the halo mass function itself at the
~20% level, particularly evacuating the centres and enhancing dark matter just
outside halos. At early epochs baryons pile up in the centres of halos, but by
late epochs and particularly in massive systems gas has mostly been evacuated
from within the inner halo. AGN jets are so efficient at such evacuation that
at low redshifts the baryon fraction within $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13} \, \rm

The baryon fraction enclosed in a sphere around such halos approaches the
cosmic value $\Omega_{\rm b}/\Omega_{\rm m}$ only at 10-20 virial radii. As a
result, 87% of the baryonic mass in the Universe lies in the IGM at $z=0$, with

with excellent detection prospects at current and future experiments. Light
mediator freeze-in is UV-insensitive insofar as most DM is produced at late
times, and thus the DM abundance does not depend on the unknown early evolution
of our universe. However the final DM yield retains a dependence on the initial
DM population, which is usually assumed to be exactly zero. We point out that
in models with light mediators, the final DM yield will also depend on the
initial conditions assumed for the light mediator population. We describe a
class of scenarios we call ""glaciation"" where DM freezing in from the SM
encounters a pre-existing thermal bath of mediators, and study the dependence
of the final DM yield on the initial temperature of this dark radiation bath.
To compute DM scattering rates in this cosmology, we derive for the first time
an exact integral expression for the Boltzmann collision term describing
interactions between two species at different temperatures. We quantify the
dependence of the DM yield on the initial dark temperature and find that it can
be sizeable in regions near the traditional (zero initial abundance) freeze-in
curve. We generalize the freeze-in curve to a glaciation band, which can extend
as much as an order of magnitude below the traditional freeze-in direct
detection target, and point out that the DM phase space distribution as well as
the yield can be strongly dependent on initial conditions.

high-S\'ersic indices and $82.9\%$ show low-S\'ersic indices. We study the
impact that the environment, mergers and bars have in shaping the surface
brightness profiles. We explore two different definitions for local environment
and find no correlation between bulge properties and the environment where they
reside. Simulated galaxies with higher S\'ersic indices show, on average, a
higher fraction of ex-situ stars in their kinematically selected bulges. For
this bulge population the last significant merger (total mass ratio $m_{\rm
sat}/m_{\rm host} > 0.1$) occurs, on average, at later times. However, a
substantial fraction of low-S\'ersic index bulges also experience a late
significant merger. We find that bars play an important role in the development
of the different types of photometric bulges. We show that the fraction of
simulated galaxies with strong bars is smaller for the high- than for the
low-S\'ersic index population, reaching differences of $20\%$ at $z > 1$.
Simulated galaxies with high fractions of ex-situ stars in the bulge do not
develop strong bars. Conversely, simulated galaxies with long-lived strong bars
have bulges with ex-situ fractions, $f_{\rm ex-situ} < 0.2$.

observable rocky debris requires the presence of at least one terrestrial or
giant planet to have gravitationally perturbed the progenitor of the debris
into the star. However, these planets could have been previously been engulfed
by the star or escaped the system, leaving behind asteroids, boulders, cobbles,
pebbles, sand and dust. These remaining small bodies could then persist
throughout the host star's evolution into a white dwarf at ~2-100 au scales,
and then be radiatively dragged into the white dwarf without the help of a
planet. Here we identify the parameter space and cooling ages for which this
one metal-pollution mechanism is feasible by, for the first time, coupling
Poynting-Robertson drag, the Yarkovsky effect and the YORP effect solely from
rapidly dimming white dwarf radiation. We find that this no-planet pollution
scenario is efficient for remnant 10^{-5}-10^{-4} m dust up to about 80 au,
10^{-4}-10^{-3} m sand up to about 25 au and 10^{-3}-10^{-2} m small pebbles up
to about 8 au, and perhaps 10^{-1}-10^{0} m small boulders up to tens of au.
Further, young white dwarf radiation can spin up large strength-less boulders
with radii 10^{2}-10^{3} m to destruction, breaking them down into smaller
fragments which then can be dragged towards the white dwarf. Our work hence
introduces a planet-less metal-pollution mechanism that may be active in some
fraction of white dwarf planetary systems.

external tidal field. We investigate how Galactic globular clusters with
observed tails are affected by satellite dwarf galaxies by simulating tails in
galaxy models with and without dwarf galaxies. The simulations indicate that
tidal tails can be subdivided into into three categories based on how they are
affected by dwarf galaxies: 1) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor cluster's
orbit (NGC 4590, Pal 1, Pal 5), 2) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor
cluster's orbit and individual tail stars (NGC 362, NGC 1851, NGC 4147, NGC
5466, NGC 7492, Pal 14, Pal 15), and 3) dwarf galaxies negligibly affect tidal
tails (NGC 288, NGC 5139, NGC 5904, Eridanus). Perturbations to a cluster's
orbit occur when dwarf galaxies pass within its orbit, altering the size and
shape of the orbital and tail path. Direct interactions between one or more
dwarf galaxies and tail stars lead to kinks and spurs, however we find that
features are more difficult to observe in projection. We further find that the
tails of Pal 5 are shorter in the galaxy model with dwarf galaxies as it is
closer to apocentre, which results in the tails being compressed. Additional
simulations reveal that differences between tidal tails in the two galaxy
models are primarily due to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Understanding how dwarf
galaxies affect tidal tails allows for tails to be used to map the distribution
of matter in dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way.

Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit, has been commonly explained as being caused by
the stripping of stellar envelopes by metallicity-dependent, line-driven winds.
As such, the theoretical expectation is that the HD limit should be higher at
lower metallicity, where weaker mass-loss rates mean that higher initial masses
are required for an envelope to be stripped. In this paper, we test this
prediction by measuring the luminosity function of RSGs in M31 and comparing to
those in the LMC and SMC. We find that $\log (L_{\rm max}/L_{\odot}) = 5.53 \pm
0.03$ in M31 (Z $\gtrsim$ Z$_{\odot}$), consistent with the limit found for
both the LMC (Z $\sim$ 0.5 Z$_{\odot}$) and SMC (Z $\sim$ 0.25 Z$_{\odot}$),
while the RSG luminosity distributions in these 3 galaxies are consistent to
within 1$\sigma$. We therefore find no evidence for a metallicity dependence on
both the HD limit and the RSG luminosity function, and conclude that
line-driven winds on the main sequence are not the cause of the HD limit.

cross-power spectrum between filtered and squared maps of the cosmic microwave

Reionization (EoR). This kSZ$^2$-galaxy cross-power spectrum statistic has been
successfully detected at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 1.5$). Here we extend
this method to $z \gtrsim 6$ as a potential means to extract signatures of
patchy reionization. We model the expected signal across multiple photometric
redshift bins using semi-numeric simulations of the reionization process. In
principle, the cross-correlation statistic robustly extracts reionization-era
contributions to the kSZ signal, while its redshift evolution yields valuable
information regarding the timing of reionization. Specifically, the model
cross-correlation signal near $\ell \sim 1,000$ peaks during the early stages
of the EoR, when about 20% of the volume of the universe is ionized. Detectible
$\ell$ modes mainly reflect squeezed triangle configurations of the related
bispectrum, quantifying correlations between the galaxy overdensity field on
large scales and the smaller-scale kSZ power. We forecast the prospects for
detecting this signal using future wide-field samples of Lyman-break galaxies
from the Roman Space Telescope and next-generation CMB surveys including the
Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. We find that a roughly 13$\sigma$

significant negative pair binding energy occurs, and the singlet pairing
correlation function dominates with the algebraic decay while the
single-particle Green's function and spin correlation function decay
exponentially. On the other hand, quasi-periodicity leads to nontrivial
topological nature in insulating states, characterized by different integer
Chern numbers at different fillings. Due to the interplay among the topology,
the interaction, and the 1D confinement, gapless edge modes show strong
spin-charge separation and in different regions can relate to different
collective modes, which are the charge of a single fermion, the magnon, and the
singlet-pair. We also find two interaction driven topological transitions: i)
at particle filling $\rho=1/2$, the low-energy edge excitations change from the
magnon to singlet-pair, accompanied with pair formation in bulk; and ii) at
$\rho=3/4$, while the gapless edge mode remains the charge of a single fermion,
there is a gap-closing point and a $\pi$-phase shift in the quasi-particle

broad line region (BLR) clouds velocity distribution, their distance from the
central supermassive black hole ($R_{BLR}$) and the virial factor ($f$).
Understanding whether biases arise in $M_{BH}$ estimation with increasing
obscuration is possible only by studying a large (N$>$100) statistical sample
of obscuration unbiased (hard) X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in
the rest-frame near-infrared (0.8-2.5$\mu$m) since it penetrates deeper into
the BLR than the optical. We present a detailed analysis of 65 local
BAT-selected Seyfert galaxies observed with Magellan/FIRE. Adding these to the
near-infrared BAT AGN spectroscopic survey (BASS) database, we study a total of
314 unique near-infrared spectra. While the FWHMs of H$\alpha$ and
near-infrared broad lines (He\textsc{i}, Pa$\beta$, Pa$\alpha$) remain unbiased
to either BLR extinction or X-ray obscuration, the H$\alpha$ broad line
luminosity is suppressed when $N_H\gtrsim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, systematically
underestimating $M_{BH}$ by $0.23-0.46$ dex. Near-infrared line luminosities
should be preferred to H$\alpha$ until $N_H<10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while at higher
obscuration a less biased $R_{BLR}$ proxy should be adopted. We estimate $f$
for Seyfert 1 and 2 using two obscuration-unbiased $M_{BH}$ measurements, i.e.
the stellar velocity dispersion and a BH mass prescription based on
near-infrared and X-ray, and find that the virial factors do not depend on
redshift or obscuration, but for some broad lines show a mild anti-correlation
with $M_{BH}$. Our results show the critical impact obscuration can have on BLR
characterization and the importance of the near-infrared and X-rays for a less
biased view of the BLR.

interpretational conclusions, including: that a photon is neither a particle
nor a wave but rather a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of entity that toggles between the
two possibilities, that reality is observer-dependent, and that systems either
do not have properties prior to measurements or else have properties that are
subject to nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences. In this work, we
show that such conclusions are not, in fact, forced on us by the phenomena. We
do so by describing an alternative to quantum theory, a statistical theory of a
classical discrete field (the `toy field theory') that reproduces the relevant
phenomenology of quantum interference while rejecting these radical
interpretational claims. It also reproduces a number of related interference
experiments that are thought to support these interpretational claims, such as
the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, and the
quantum eraser experiment. The systems in the toy field theory are field modes,
each of which possesses, at all times, both a particle-like property (a
discrete occupation number) and a wave-like property (a discrete phase).
Although these two properties are jointly possessed, the theory stipulates that
they cannot be jointly known. The phenomenology that is generally cited in
favour of nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences ends up being
explained in terms of inferences about distant or past systems, and all that is
observer-dependent is the observer's knowledge of reality, not reality itself.

both quantum and classical hardware. Formulating and verifying the
decomposition of logical operations into physical ones is a challenge in
itself. In this paper, we propose QECV, a verification framework that can
efficiently verify the formal correctness of stabilizer codes, arguably the
most important class of QEC codes. QECV first comes with a concise language,
QECV-Lang, where stabilizers are treated as a first-class object, to represent
QEC programs. Stabilizers are also used as predicates in our new assertion
language, QECV-Assn, as logical and arithmetic operations of stabilizers can be
naturally defined. We derive a sound quantum Hoare logic proof system with a
set of inference rules for QECV to efficiently reason about the correctness of
QEC programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QECV with both theoretical
complexity analysis and in-depth case studies of two well-known stabilizer QEC

proposed data qubit layout optimization reduces the overhead of syndrome
extraction and serves as a good initial point for following optimizations.
Second, we only use bridge qubits enclosed by data qubits and reduce the number
of bridge qubits by merging short path between data qubits. The proposed bridge
qubit optimization reduces the probability of bridge qubit conflicts and
further minimizes the syndrome extraction overhead. Third, we propose an
efficient heuristic to schedule syndrome extractions. Based on the proposed
data qubit allocation, we devise a good initial schedule of syndrome

by a complete surface code error detection cycle. Our experiments on

propose an evaluation framework for domain generalization algorithms that
allows decomposition of the error into components capturing distinct aspects of
generalization. Inspired by the prevalence of algorithms based on the idea of
domain-invariant representation learning, we extend the evaluation framework to
capture various types of failures in achieving invariance. We show that the

generate point distributions for variable resolution Delaunay triangular and
tetrahedral meshes in two and three-dimensions, respectively. nMAPS consists of
two principal stages. In the first stage, an initial point distribution is
produced using a cell-based rejection algorithm. In the second stage, holes in
the sample are detected using an efficient background grid and filled in to
obtain a near-maximal covering. Extensive testing shows that nMAPS generates a
variable resolution mesh in linear run time with the number of accepted points.
We demonstrate nMAPS capabilities by meshing three-dimensional discrete
fracture networks (DFN) and the surrounding volume. The discretized boundaries
of the fractures, which are represented as planar polygons, are used as the
seed of 2D-nMAPS to produce a conforming Delaunay triangulation. The combined
mesh of the DFN is used as the seed for 3D-nMAPS, which produces conforming
Delaunay tetrahedra surrounding the network. Under a set of conditions that
naturally arise in maximal Poisson-disk samples and are satisfied by nMAPS, the
two-dimensional Delaunay triangulations are guaranteed to only have
well-behaved triangular faces. While nMAPS does not provide triangulation
quality bounds in more than two dimensions, we found that low-quality
tetrahedra in 3D are infrequent, can be readily detected and removed, and a

Theory (MPT) have successfully isolated the acoustic component in all regions
of the jet, to better understand the dynamics as well as to develop wavepacket
models. MPT is however a data-intensive method since the inherent Poisson
equation solution requires fluctuation quantities in the entire flowfield; as
such, it has to date been applied only to numerically obtained data. This work
develops an approach to extend its application to extract coherent wavepackets
from high-speed schlieren images. The procedure maps pixel intensities from the
schlieren to a scaled surrogate for the density gradient integrated along the
line of sight. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated using
experimental as well as simulated schlieren images representing a wide range of
imperfectly-expanded free and impinging jet configurations. When combined with
Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, the method yields modes that
accurately capture (i) the Mach wave radiation from a military-style jet, (ii)
the mode shapes of the feedback tones in an impinging jet, and (iii) the
screech signature in twin rectangular jets, without recourse to user adjusted
parameters. This technique has the potential to greatly expand the use of
high-speed diagnostics and provide real-time monitoring of the acoustic content

  Abstract shorten to meet Arxiv limit",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal
lightness in various graph classes, such as in general graphs, Euclidean
spanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings of previous works on light
spanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be
applied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always
sub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal
in the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into
account a wider range of involved parameters.
  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified
framework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the
framework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light
spanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced
than that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework
is developed in two papers. The current paper is the second of the two -- it
builds on the basis of the unified framework laid in the first paper, and then
strengthens it to achieve more refined optimality bounds for several graph
classes. Among various applications and implications of our framework, we
highlight here the following:
  For $K_r$-minor-free graphs, we provide a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with
lightness $\tilde{O}_{r,\epsilon}( \frac{r}{\epsilon} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$,
improving the lightness bound $\tilde{O}_{r,\epsilon}( \frac{r}{\epsilon^3})$
of Borradaile, Le and Wulff-Nilsen. We complement our upper bound with a lower
bound construction, for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner must have lightness
$\Omega(\frac{r}{\epsilon} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$. We note that the quadratic
dependency on $1/\epsilon$ we proved here is surprising, as the prior work
suggested that the dependency on $\epsilon$ should be $1/\epsilon$.

sphere glasses is a significant milestone for theoretical physics. How relevant
this description might be for understanding low-dimensional glass-forming
liquids, however, remains unclear. These liquids indeed exhibit a complex
interplay between structure and dynamics, and the importance of this interplay
might only slowly diminish as dimension $d$ increases. A careful numerical
assessment of the matter has long been hindered by the exponential increase of
computational costs with $d$. By revisiting a once common simulation technique
involving the use of periodic boundary conditions modeled on $D_d$ lattices, we
here partly sidestep this difficulty, thus allowing the study of hard sphere
liquids up to $d=13$. Parallel efforts by Mangeat and Zamponi [Phys. Rev. E 93,
012609 (2016)] have expanded the mean-field description of glasses to finite
$d$ by leveraging standard liquid-state theory, and thus help bridge the gap
from the other direction. The relatively smooth evolution of both structure and
dynamics across the $d$ gap allows us to relate the two approaches, and to
identify some of the missing features that a finite-$d$ theory of glasses might
hope to include to achieve near quantitative agreement.

fields reproducing statistical characteristics of realistic turbulence is still
a challenge. The synthetic eddy method, previously introduced in the context of
inflow conditions for large eddy simulations, is based on the assumption that
turbulence can be regarded as a superposition of coherent structures. In this
paper, a new type of synthetic eddy method is proposed, where the fundamental
eddy is constructed by superposing three Hill's vortices, with their axes
orthogonal to each other. A distribution of Hill's vortices is used to
synthesize an anisotropic turbulent velocity field that satisfies the
incompressibility condition and match a given Reynolds stress tensor. The
amplitudes of the three vortices that form the fundamental eddy are calculated
from known Reynolds stress profiles through a transformation from the physical
reference frame to the principal-axis reference frame. In this way,
divergence-free anisotropic turbulent velocity fields are obtained that can
reproduce a given Reynolds stress tensor. The model was tested on both
isotropic and anisotropic turbulent velocity fields, in the framework of grid
turbulence decay and turbulent channel flow, respectively. The transition from
artificial to realistic turbulence in the proximity to the inflow boundary was
found to be small in all test cases that were considered.

used in atmosphere and climate models to discretize the horizontal dimension.
In contrast to structured latitude-longitude grids, triangular grids are
unstructured and the neighbors of a grid cell do not simply follow from the
grid cell index. This complicates the identification of connected components
compared to structured grids. Here, we show that this complication can be
addressed by involving the mathematical tool of cubulation, which allows one to
map the 2-d cells of the triangular grid onto the vertices of the 3-d cells of
a cubic grid. Because the latter is structured, connected components can be
readily identified by previously developed software packages for cubic grids.
Computing the cubulation can be expensive, but importantly needs to be done
only once for a given grid. We implement our method in a Python package that we
name TriCCo and make available via pypi, gitlab and zenodo. We document the
package and demonstrate its application using simulation output from the ICON
atmosphere model. Finally, we characterize its computational performance and
compare it to graph-based identifications of connected components using
breadth-first search. The latter shows that TriCCo is ready for triangular
grids with up to 500,000 cells, but that its speed and memory requirement
should be improved for the application to larger grids.

having unique properties such as quasi-continuous change of conductance and
long-term storage of resistive states. However, identifying the physical
mechanisms of resistive switching and evolution of conductive filaments in such
structures still remains a major challenge. In this work, aiming at a better
understanding of these phenomena, we experimentally investigate an unusual
effect of enhanced conductive filament stability in memristors with copper
filaments under the applied voltage and present a simplified theoretical model
of the effect of a quantum current through a filament on its shape. Our
semi-quantitative, continuous model predicts, indeed, that for a thin filament,
the ""quantum pressure"" exerted on its walls by the recoil of charge carriers
can well compete with the surface tension and crucially affect the evolution of
the filament profile at the voltages around 1V. At lower voltages, the quantum
pressure is expected to provide extra stability to the filaments supporting
quantized conductance, which we also reveal experimentally using a novel
methodology focusing on retention statistics. Our results indicate that the
recoil effects could potentially be important for resistive switching in
memristive devices with metallic filaments and that taking them into account in
rational design of memristors could help achieve their better retention and
plasticity characteristics.

are located at irregular intervals of the geometric parameters. Existing
approaches to sample grain boundary energy subspaces therefore either need a
huge amount of datapoints or a~priori knowledge of the positions of these

yields many downstream applications from a single model. The main difficulty in
learning energy-based models with the ""contrastive approaches"" is the
generation of samples from the current energy function at each iteration. Many
advances have been made to accomplish this subroutine cheaply. Nevertheless,
all such sampling paradigms run MCMC targeting the current model, which
requires infinitely long chains to generate samples from the true energy
distribution and is problematic in practice. This paper proposes an alternative
approach to getting these samples and avoiding crude MCMC sampling from the
current model. We accomplish this by viewing the evolution of the modeling
distribution as (i) the evolution of the energy function, and (ii) the
evolution of the samples from this distribution along some vector field. We
subsequently derive this time-dependent vector field such that the particles
following this field are approximately distributed as the current density
model. Thereby we match the evolution of the particles with the evolution of
the energy function prescribed by the learning procedure. Importantly, unlike
Monte Carlo sampling, our method targets to match the current distribution in a

estimation and inference of treatment effects leveraging a series of datasets
that arrive sequentially without storing or re-accessing individual-level raw

proposed framework for online causal inference. In particular, our framework is
robust to biased data batches in the sense that the proposed online estimator
is asymptotically unbiased as long as the pooled data is a random sample of the
target population regardless of whether each data batch is. We also provide an
R package for analyzing streaming observational data that enjoys great
computation efficiency compared to existing software packages for offline

persist within the physics discipline. In this paper, we present innovative,
programmatic implementations over an eight-year period at an undergraduate,
liberal arts physics program. Some of these innovations accord with
nationally-published, `best practices' for undergraduate physics programs,
while others are novel to the program's context. Within this eight-year period,
alterations are separated into curricular, co-curricular, and experiential
elements. Innovations are introduced in some detail, and data are presented
before, during, and after their introduction. While it is currently impossible
to say which elements had the greatest impact, the synergistic combination did
have a positive effect on the program. Not only did the number of total majors
and graduates increase, there was a 200% increase of women degree recipients
compared to the previous ten years, which boosted average graduation rates
above the national average (30% > 20%). Women were retained within the
undergraduate physics major at a higher percentage during this time period when
compared to men in the program. Lastly, these women physics majors maintained
careers in science advancement fields at a rate of ~90% after $\leq5$ years

is two-fold: a) to validate quantitatively the work of national physics
organizations within the context of a liberal arts institution, and b) to
suggest that a multi-level approach is most efficacious when considering
programmatic innovations.

material along a set of phonons is launched after its infrared-active phonons
are selectively excited using external light pulses. The microscopic mechanism
underlying this phenomenon is the nonlinear coupling of the pumped
infrared-active mode to other phonon modes present in a material. Nonlinear
phonon couplings can cause finite time-averaged atomic displacements with or
without broken crystal symmetries depending on the order, magnitude and sign of
the nonlinearities. Such coherent lattice displacements along phonon
coordinates can be used to control the physical properties of materials and
even induce transient phases with lower symmetries. Light-control of materials
via nonlinear phononics has become a practical reality due to the availability
of intense mid-infrared lasers that can drive large-amplitude oscillations of
the infrared-active phonons of materials. Mid-infrared pump induced
insulator-metal transitions and spin and orbital order melting have been
observed in pump-probe experiments. First principles based microscopic theory
of nonlinear phononics has been developed, and it has been used to better
understand how the lattice evolves after a mid-infrared pump excitation of
infrared-active phonons. This theory has been used to predict light-induced
switching of ferroelectric polarization as well as ferroelectricity in
paraelectrics and ferromagnetism in antiferromagnets, which have been partially
confirmed in recent experiments. This review summarizes the experimental and
theoretical developments within this emerging field.

  Teams through Perspective-taking Spaces","CSCW 2022",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or
deliberate, they often fail to engage with each others' perspectives in a
constructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst,
it can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working
together. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by
highlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter
interaction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because
they fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team
norms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless
team members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion
will be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded
intervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication
in teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the benefits
of ""experimental spaces"" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate
conducive to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses
the benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a
norm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere
achieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to
induce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to
an alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team
experience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction,
encouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted
teams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that
``experimental spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of
encouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving
communication in virtual teams.

histological brain sections to determine the spatial course of nerve fibres
(myelinated axons). While the in-plane fibre directions can be determined with
high accuracy, the computation of the out-of-plane fibre inclinations is more
challenging because they are derived from the strength of the birefringence
signals (retardation), which depends e.g. on the amount of nerve fibres. One
possibility to improve the accuracy is to consider the average transmitted
light intensity (transmittance weighting). The current procedure requires
effortful manual adjustment of parameters and anatomical knowledge. Here, we
introduce an automated, optimised computation of the fibre inclinations,
allowing for a much faster, reproducible determination of fibre orientations in
3D-PLI. Depending on the degree of myelination, the algorithm uses different
models (transmittance-weighted, unweighted, or a linear combination), allowing
to go beyond traditional definitions of white and grey matter and account for
regionally specific behaviour. As the algorithm is parallelised and GPU
optimised, and uses images from standard 3D-PLI (retardation and
transmittance), it can be applied to large data sets, also from previous
measurements. The functionality is demonstrated on unstained coronal and
sagittal histological sections of vervet monkey and rat brains.

communication (OWC), which is a strong candidate to fulfill the unprecedented
increase in user-traffic expected in the near future. In OWC, a high number of
optical access points (APs) is usually deployed on the ceiling of an indoor
environment to serve multiple users with different demands. Despite the high
data rates of OWC networks, due to the use of the optical band for data
transmission, they cannot replace current radio frequency (RF) wireless
networks where OWC has several issues including the small converge area of an
optical AP, the lack of uplink transmission and high blockage probabilities.
However, OWC has the potential to support the requirements in the next
generation (6G) of wireless communications. In this context, heterogeneous
optical/RF networks can be considered to overcome the limitations of OWC and RF
systems, while providing a high quality of service in terms of achievable data
rates and coverage. In this work, infrared lasers, vertical-cavity
surface-emitting(VCSEL) lasers, are used as the key elements of optical APs for
serving multiple users. Then, transmission schemes such as zero forcing (ZF)
and blind interference alignment (BIA) are introduced to manage multi-user
interference and maximize the sum rate of users. Moreover, a WiFi system is
considered to provide uplink transmission and serve users that experience a low
signal to noise ratio (SNR) from the optical system. To use the resources of
the heterogeneous optical/RF network efficiently, we derive a utility-based
objective function that aims to maximize the overall sum rate of the network.

These difficulties can be alleviated by the approximate coupled-pair (ACP)
theories, in which selected $(T_2)^2$ diagrams in the CCSD amplitude equations
are removed, but there is no generally accepted and robust way of incorporating
connected triply excited ($T_3$) clusters within the ACP framework. It is also
not clear if the specific combinations of $(T_2)^2$ diagrams that work well for

with many important applications. In practice, facial landmark detection can be
affected by a lot of natural degradations. One of the most common and important
degradations is the shadow caused by light source blocking. While many advanced
shadow removal methods have been proposed to recover the image quality in
recent years, their effects to facial landmark detection are not well studied.
For example, it remains unclear whether shadow removal could enhance the
robustness of facial landmark detection to diverse shadow patterns or not. In
this work, for the first attempt, we construct a novel benchmark to link two
independent but related tasks (i.e., shadow removal and facial landmark
detection). In particular, the proposed benchmark covers diverse face shadows
with different intensities, sizes, shapes, and locations. Moreover, to mine
hard shadow patterns against facial landmark detection, we propose a novel
method (i.e., adversarial shadow attack), which allows us to construct a
challenging subset of the benchmark for a comprehensive analysis. With the
constructed benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on three state-of-the-art
shadow removal methods and three landmark detectors. The observation of this
work motivates us to design a novel detection-aware shadow removal framework,
which empowers shadow removal to achieve higher restoration quality and enhance
the shadow robustness of deployed facial landmark detectors.

For potential applications of CNDs as advanced materials for optoelectronic

for doping heteroatoms into CNDs. In this work, we synthesize the multi-color
fluorescent by using a fast and effective microwave method where the CNDs are

that the prepared N-CNDs can generate blue (445 nm), green (546 nm), and orange
(617 nm) fluorescence or PL with the mass ratio of the raw materials at 1:1,
1:2 and 1:3, respectively. We find that the N content in N-CNDs leads to
different surface/edge states in $n-\pi^*$ domain. Thus, the wavelength of the
PL emission from N-CNDs can be tuned via controlling the N concentration doped

light generation with a mesoscopic number (i.e., dozens to hundreds) of pump

regime, squeezing occurs alongside significant pump depletion, compromising the
predictions made by conventional semiclassical models for squeezing.
Furthermore, nonlinear interactions among multiple frequency modes render the
system dynamics exponentially intractable in na\""ive quantum models, requiring
a more sophisticated modeling framework. To this end, we construct a nonlinear
Gaussian approximation to the squeezing dynamics, defining a ""Gaussian
interaction frame"" (GIF) in which non-Gaussian quantum dynamics can be isolated
and concisely described using a few dominant (i.e., principal) supermodes.
Numerical simulations of our model reveal non-Gaussian distortions of squeezing
in the mesoscopic regime, largely associated with signal-pump entanglement. We
argue that the state of the art in nonlinear nanophotonics is quickly
approaching this regime, providing an all-optical platform for experimental
studies of the semiclassical-to-quantum transition in a rich paradigm of
coherent, multimode nonlinear dynamics. Mesoscopic pulsed squeezing thus
provides an intriguing case study of the rapid rise in dynamic complexity
associated with semiclassical-to-quantum crossover, which we view as a
correlate of the emergence of new information-processing capacities in the

component of D-poor nebular hydrogen and water from the D-rich mesostases.
45-95$\%$ of water in the minerals characterized by low $\delta$D$_{SMOW}$
values was contributed by nebular hydrogen. S-type asteroids dominantly

consistency of galaxy-galaxy lensing signals ($\Delta\Sigma$) across different
data-sets and to carry out end-to-end tests of systematic errors. We perform a
blind comparison of the amplitude of $\Delta\Sigma$ using lens samples from
BOSS and six independent lensing surveys. We find good agreement between
empirically estimated and reported systematic errors which agree to better than
2.3$\sigma$ in four lens bins and three radial ranges. For lenses with $z_{\rm
L}>0.43$ and considering statistical errors, we detect a 3-4$\sigma$
correlation between lensing amplitude and survey depth. This correlation could
arise from the increasing impact at higher redshift of unrecognised galaxy
blends on shear calibration and imperfections in photometric redshift
calibration. At $z_{\rm L}>0.54$ amplitudes may additionally correlate with
foreground stellar density. The amplitude of these trends is within
survey-defined systematic error budgets which are designed to include known
shear and redshift calibration uncertainty. Using a fully empirical and
conservative method, we do not find evidence for large unknown systematics.
Systematic errors greater than 15% (25%) ruled out in three lens bins at 68%
(95%) confidence at $z<0.54$. Differences with respect to predictions based on
clustering are observed to be at the 20-30% level. Our results therefore
suggest that lensing systematics alone are unlikely to fully explain the
""lensing is low"" effect at $z<0.54$. This analysis demonstrates the power of
cross-survey comparisons and provides a promising path for identifying and
reducing systematics in future lensing analyses.

generalized Ohm's law including the effects of ambipolar and Hall drift. While
both describe transport processes that arise from the multifluid equations and
are therefore of hyperbolic nature, they are often incorporated in models as a
diffusive, i.e. parabolic process. While the formulation as such is easy to
include in standard MHD models, the resulting diffusive time-step constraints
do require often a computationally more expensive implicit treatment or
super-time-stepping approaches. In this paper we discuss an implementation that
retains the hyperbolic nature and allows for an explicit integration with small
computational overhead. In the case of ambipolar drift, this formulation arises
naturally by simply retaining a time derivative of the drift velocity that is
typically omitted. This alone leads to time-step constraints that are
comparable to the native MHD time-step constraint for a solar setup including
the region from photosphere to lower solar corona. We discuss an accelerated
treatment that can further reduce time-step constraints if necessary. In the
case of Hall drift we propose a hyperbolic formulation that is numerically
similar to that for the ambipolar drift and we show that the combination of
both can be applied to simulations of the solar chromosphere at minimal
computational expense.

it is still a challenge for robots to decide grasping position when given
different tasks in unstructured real life environments. In order to overcome
this challenge, creating a proper knowledge representation framework is the
key. Unlike the previous work, in this paper, task is defined as a triplet
including grasping tool, desired action and target object. Our proposed
algorithm GATER (Grasp--Action--Target Embeddings and Relations) models the
relationship among grasping tools--action--target objects in embedding space.
To validate our method, a novel dataset is created for task-specific grasping.
GATER is trained on the new dataset and achieve task-specific grasping
inference with 94.6\% success rate. Finally, the effectiveness of GATER
algorithm is tested on a real service robot platform. GATER algorithm has its
potential in human behavior prediction and human-robot interaction.

operators, and a main focus of the Vision Zero strategy employed by the City of
Austin, Texas. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to
effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these
treatments are most needed remains a challenge. Current practice requires
manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to
an identification process that is time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern
changes over time, and lacks scalability. Mid-block locations, where safety
countermeasures are often needed the most, are especially hard to identify and
monitor. The goal for this research is to understand the correlation between
bus stop locations and mid-block crossings, so as to assist traffic engineers
in implementing Vision Zero strategies to improve pedestrian safety. In a prior
work, we have developed a tool to detect pedestrian crossing events with
traffic camera video using a deep neural network model to identify crossing
events. In this paper, we extend the methods to identify bus stop usage with
traffic camera video from off-the-shelf CCTV pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) traffic
monitoring cameras installed at nearby intersections. We correlate the video
detection results for mid-block crossings near a bus stop, with pedestrian
activity at the bus stops in each side of the mid-block crossing. We also
implement a web portal to facilitate manual review of pedestrian activity
detections by automating creation of video clips that show only crossing
events, thereby vastly improving the efficiency of the human review process.

inference complexity of fully quantized vision transformers. In addition,
observing an extreme non-uniform distribution in attention maps, we propose

hydrodynamic simulations at $z\le 1$, we determine the cosines of the alignment
angles, $\cos\alpha$, between the galaxy stellar and DM spins. Creating four
$\cos\alpha$-selected samples of the galaxies and then controlling them to
share the same density and mass distributions, we determine the average
strengths of the alignments between the galaxy stellar spins and the tidal
tensor major axes over each sample. It is clearly shown that at $z\le 0.5$ the
more severely the galaxy stellar spin directions deviate from the DM
counterparts, the stronger the peculiar tidal alignments become. Taking the
ensemble averages of such galaxy properties as central blackhole to stellar
mass ratio, specific star formation rate, formation epoch, stellar-to-total
mass ratio, velocity dispersions, average metallicity, and degree of the cosmic
web anisotropy over each sample, we also find that all of these properties
exhibit either strong correlations or anti-correlations with $\cos\alpha$. Our
results imply that the peculiar tidal alignments of the galaxy stellar spins
may be caused by anisotropic occurrence of some baryonic process responsible
for discharging stellar materials from the galaxies along the tidal major
directions at $z<1$.

show that proper elements can also be used within space debris dynamics to
identify groups of fragments associated to the same break-up event. The
proposed method allows to reconstruct the evolutionary history and possibly to
associate the fragments to a parent body. The procedure relies on different
steps: (i) the development of a model for an approximate, though accurate,

of fragments through a simulated break-up event. We consider a model that
includes the Keplerian part, an approximation of the geopotential, and the
gravitational influence of Sun and Moon. We also evaluate the contribution of
Solar radiation pressure and the effect of noise on the orbital elements. We
implement a Lie series normalization procedure to compute the proper elements
associated to semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination. Based upon a wide
range of samples, we conclude that the distribution of the proper elements in
simulated break-up events (either collisions and explosions) shows an
impressive connection with the dynamics observed immediately after the
catastrophic event. The results are corroborated by a statistical data analysis

success probability, which is a special case of the fine-grained metric, the
meta distribution (MD) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). To address
this issue, we propose the transdimensional approach as an alternative. Here,
the union of 1D PPPs on the streets is simplified to the transdimensional PPP

the accuracy of the TPPP further improves under shadowing. Lastly, we use the

maintaining a target fraction of reliable links. A key insight is that the

greatly advanced this field and leads to a hot topic named NeuIR (i.e., neural
information retrieval), especially the paradigm of pre-training methods (PTMs).
Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model size, pre-trained
models can learn universal language representations from massive textual data,
which are beneficial to the ranking task of IR. Recently, a large number of
works, which are dedicated to the application of PTMs in IR, have been
introduced to promote the retrieval performance. Considering the rapid progress
of this direction, this survey aims to provide a systematic review of
pre-training methods in IR. To be specific, we present an overview of PTMs
applied in different components of an IR system, including the retrieval
component, the re-ranking component, and other components. In addition, we also
introduce PTMs specifically designed for IR, and summarize available datasets
as well as benchmark leaderboards. Moreover, we discuss some open challenges
and highlight several promising directions, with the hope of inspiring and
facilitating more works on these topics for future research.

industrial safety engineering. However, a great storehouse of industrial safety
knowledge (ISK) in HAZOP reports has not been thoroughly exploited. In order to
reuse and unlock the value of ISK and optimize HAZOP, we have developed a novel
knowledge graph for industrial safety (ISKG) with HAZOP as the carrier through
bridging data science and engineering design. Specifically, firstly,
considering that the knowledge contained in HAZOP reports of different
processes in industry is not the same, we creatively develope a general ISK
standardization framework, it provides a practical scheme for integrating HAZOP
reports from various processes and uniformly representing the ISK with diverse
expressions. Secondly, we conceive a novel and reliable information extraction
model based on deep learning combined with data science, it can effectively
mine ISK from HAZOP reports, which alleviates the obstacle of ISK extraction
caused by the particularity of HAZOP text. Finally, we build ISK triples and
store them in the Neo4j graph database. We take indirect coal liquefaction
process as a case study to develop ISKG, and its oriented applications can
optimize HAZOP and mine the potential of ISK, which is of great significance to
improve the security of the system and enhance prevention awareness for people.
ISKG containing the ISK standardization framework and the information
extraction model sets an example of the interaction between data science and
engineering design, which can enlighten other researchers and extend the
perspectives of industrial safety.

of an eigenstate of one observable implies complete randomness in its
complementary observable. In quantum cryptography, complementarity allows us to
formulate security analyses in terms of phase-error correction. However, in the
device-independent regime that offers security without device characterization,
the concept becomes much subtler. Security proofs of device-independent quantum
cryptography tasks are often complex and quite different from those of their
more standard device-dependent cousins. The existing proofs pose huge
challenges to experiments, among which large data-size requirement is a crux.
Here, we show the complementarity security origin of the device-independent
tasks. By linking complementarity with quantum nonlocality, we recast the
device-independent scheme into a quantum error correction protocol. Going
beyond the identical-and-independent-distribution case, we consider the most
general attack. We generalize the sample entropy in classical Shannon theory
for the finite-size analysis. Our method exhibits good finite-size performance
and brings the device-independent scheme to a more practical regime. Applying
it to the data in a recent ion-trap-based device-independent quantum key
distribution experiment, one could reduce the requirement on data size to less
than a third. Furthermore, the complementarity approach can be naturally
extended to advantage key distillation to ease experiments by tolerating higher
loss and lower transmittance.

A general activation function for knowledge discovery","Accepted by Neurocomputing",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning oriented named entity recognition (DNER) has gradually become
the paradigm of knowledge discovery, which greatly promotes domain
intelligence. However, the current activation function of DNER fails to treat
gradient vanishing, no negative output or non-differentiable existence, which
may impede knowledge exploration caused by the omission and incomplete
representation of latent semantics. To break through the dilemma, we present a
novel activation function termed KDAC. Detailly, KDAC is an aggregation
function with multiple conversion modes. The backbone of the activation region
is the interaction between exponent and linearity, and the both ends extend
through adaptive linear divergence, which surmounts the obstacle of gradient
vanishing and no negative output. Crucially, the non-differentiable points are
alerted and eliminated by an approximate smoothing algorithm. KDAC has a series
of brilliant properties, including nonlinear, stable near-linear transformation
and derivative, as well as dynamic style, etc. We perform experiments based on
BERT-BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model on six benchmark datasets containing different domain
knowledge, such as Weibo, Clinical, E-commerce, Resume, HAZOP and People's

provide more generalized activation to stimulate the performance of DNER. We
hope that KDAC can be exploited as a promising activation function to devote
itself to the construction of knowledge.

geometry, with a uniform local structure in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset
{\mathbb R}^d$, $d\ge 1$. When $\Omega=[0,1]$, such graphs include the standard
Toeplitz graphs and, for $\Omega=[0,1]^d$, the considered class includes
$d$-level Toeplitz graphs. In the general case, the underlying sequence of
adjacency matrices has a canonical eigenvalue distribution, in the Weyl sense,
and it has been shown in the theoretical part of this work that we can
associate to it a symbol $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{f}}$. The knowledge of the
symbol and of its basic analytical features provides key information on the
eigenvalue structure in terms of localization, spectral gap, clustering, and
global distribution. In the present paper, many different applications are
discussed and various numerical examples are presented in order to underline
the practical use of the developed theory. Tests and applications are mainly
obtained from the approximation of differential operators via numerical schemes
such as Finite Differences (FDs), Finite Elements (FEs), and Isogeometric

spectral properties of adjacency matrices and Laplacian operators of general

text is relatively high, and the correlation and similarity between the
information are large, which is easy to cause the problem of high deviation and
high standard deviation of the model, no specific activation function has been
designed in previous studies, and the traditional activation function has the

problems, a novel activation function AIS is proposed in this paper. AIS is an
activation function applied in industrial safety engineering, which is composed
of two piecewise nonlinear functions. In the positive region, the structure
combining exponential function and quadratic function is used to alleviate the
problem of deviation and standard deviation, and the linear function is added
to modify it, which makes the whole activation function smoother and overcomes
the problem of gradient vanishing. In the negative region, the cubic function
structure is used to solve the negative region problem and accelerate the
convergence of the model. Based on the deep learning model of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF,
the performance of AIS is evaluated. The results show that, compared with other
activation functions, AIS overcomes the problems of gradient vanishing and
negative region, reduces the deviation of the model, speeds up the model
fitting, and improves the extraction ability of the model for industrial
entities.

interests (mixed-motive environments) has recently received considerable
attention in multi-agent learning. However, the mixed-motive environments
typically studied have a single cooperative outcome on which all agents can
agree. Many real-world multi-agent environments are instead bargaining problems
(BPs): they have several Pareto-optimal payoff profiles over which agents have
conflicting preferences. We argue that typical cooperation-inducing learning
algorithms fail to cooperate in BPs when there is room for normative
disagreement resulting in the existence of multiple competing cooperative
equilibria, and illustrate this problem empirically. To remedy the issue, we
introduce the notion of norm-adaptive policies. Norm-adaptive policies are
capable of behaving according to different norms in different circumstances,
creating opportunities for resolving normative disagreement. We develop a class
of norm-adaptive policies and show in experiments that these significantly
increase cooperation. However, norm-adaptiveness cannot address residual
bargaining failure arising from a fundamental tradeoff between exploitability
and cooperative robustness.

binding on the mechanical stability and energy landscape of proteins are
incompletely understood. Here we use a combination of single-molecule optical
tweezers and MD simulations to investigate the effect of ligand binding on the
energy landscape of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) binding protein (ACBP). ACBP is a
topologically simple and highly conserved four-alpha-helix bundle protein that
acts as an intracellular transporter and buffer for fatty-acyl CoA and is
active in membrane assembly. We have previously described the behavior of ACBP
under tension, revealing a highly extended transition state (TS) located almost
halfway between the unfolded and native states. Here, we performed force-ramp
and force-jump experiments, in combination with advanced statistical analysis,
to show that octanoyl-CoA binding increases the activation free energy for the
unfolding reaction of ACBP without affecting the position of the transition
state along the reaction coordinate. It follows that ligand binding enhances
the mechanical resistance and thermodynamic stability of the protein, without
changing its mechanical compliance. Steered molecular dynamics simulations
allowed us to rationalize the results in terms of key interactions that
octanoyl-CoA establishes with the four alpha-helices of ACBP and showed that
the unfolding pathway is marginally affected by the ligand. The results show
that ligand-induced mechanical stabilization effects can be complex and may
prove useful for the rational design of stabilizing ligands.

structures under self-weight load. Such loads change their magnitude and/or
location as the topology optimization advances and pose several unique
challenges, e.g., non-monotonous behavior of compliance objective, parasitic
effects of the low-stiffness elements, and unconstrained nature of the
problems. The modified SIMP material scheme is employed with the three-field
density representation technique (original, filtered, and projected design
fields) to achieve optimized solutions~close~to~0-1. A novel mass density
interpolation strategy is proposed using a smooth Heaviside function, which
provides a continuous transition between solid and void states of elements and
facilitates tuning of the non-monotonous behavior of the objective. A
constraint that implicitly imposes a lower bound on the permitted volume is
conceptualized using the maximum permitted mass and the current mass of the
evolving design. Sensitivities of the objective and self-weight are evaluated
using the adjoint-variable method. Compliance of the domain is minimized to
achieve the optimized designs using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. The
Efficacy and robustness of the presented approach are demonstrated by designing
various 2D and 3D structures involving self-weight. The proposed approach
maintains the constrained nature of the optimization problems and provides
smooth and rapid objective convergence.

into a maximum-a-posteriori framework and address it by manually designing
kinds of regularization terms and data terms of the latent clear images.
However, explicitly designing these two terms is quite challenging and usually
leads to complex optimization problems which are difficult to solve. In this
paper, we propose an effective non-blind deconvolution approach by learning
discriminative shrinkage functions to implicitly model these terms. In contrast
to most existing methods that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or
radial basis functions to simply learn the regularization term, we formulate
both the data term and regularization term and split the deconvolution model
into data-related and regularization-related sub-problems according to the
alternating direction method of multipliers. We explore the properties of the
Maxout function and develop a deep CNN model with a Maxout layer to learn
discriminative shrinkage functions to directly approximate the solutions of
these two sub-problems. Moreover, given the fast-Fourier-transform-based image
restoration usually leads to ringing artifacts while conjugate-gradient-based
approach is time-consuming, we develop the Conjugate Gradient Network to
restore the latent clear images effectively and efficiently. Experimental
results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the

the impact of straggling workers. We evaluate DSAG for principal component
analysis, cast as a finite-sum optimization problem, of a large genomics

semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for it. That

collapse of massive stars. It is believed that the afterglow property is
determined by the density of the material in the surrounding interstellar
medium. Therefore, the circumburst density can be used to distinguish between
an interstellar wind $n(R) \propto R^{\rm -k}$, and a constant density medium
(ISM), $n(R) = const$. Previous studies with different afterglow samples, show
that the circumburst medium of GRBs is neither simply supported by an
interstellar wind, nor completely favored by an ISM. In this work, our new
sample is consisted of 39 GRBs with smoothly onset bump-like features in early
X-ray afterglows, in which 20 GRBs have the redshift measurements. By using a
smooth broken power law function to fit the bumps of X-ray light curves, we
derive the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as the feature width ($\omega$),
as well as the rise and decay time scales of the bumps ($T_{\rm r}$ and $T_{\rm
d}$). The correlations between the timescales of X-ray bumps are similar to
those found previously in the optical afterglows. Based on the fireball forward
shock (FS) model of the thin shell case, we obtain the distribution of the
electron spectral index $p$, and further constrain the medium density
distribution index $k$. The new inferred $k$ is found to be concentrated at
1.0, with a range from 0.2 to 1.8. This finding is consistent with previous
studies. The conclusion of our detailed investigation for X-ray afterglows
suggests that the ambient medium of the selected GRBs is not homogeneous, i.e.,
neither ISM nor the typical interstellar wind.

The GW memory corresponding to the all 48 events has been estimated. The most
interesting results are for GW190814. The corresponding GW memory is about
$-1\times10^{-23}$ and $1\times10^{-23}$ for Hanford detector and Livingston
detector respectively. At the same time we find with 3$\sigma$ C.L. that the
memory strain of GW190814 is negative on Hanford detector while positive on
Livingston detector.

which has not been detected yet. Amounts of memory events can form a stochastic
gravitational wave memory background. Here we find that memory background can
be described as a Brownian motion in the condition that the observation time is
longer than the averaged time interval between two successive memory events. We
investigate, for the first time, the memory background of binary black hole
coalescences. We only consider the spectrum of the memory background for a
relatively low frequency range. So we can use the step function to approximate
the waveform for each memory event. Then we find that the spectrum is a power
law with index -2. And the amplitude of the power law spectrum depends on and
only on the merger rate of the binary black holes. Consequently, the memory
background not only provides a brand new means to detect gravitational wave
memory but also opens a new window to explore the event rate of binary black
hole mergers and the gravity theory. Space-based detectors are ideal to detect
the gravitational wave memory background which corresponds to supermassive
binary black holes. Since gravitational wave memory is only sensitive to the
merger stage of binary black hole coalescence, the memory background will be an
ideal probe of the famous final parsec problem.

thermograms only contain low-level patterns such as blobs of various shapes. A
contour-based anomaly detector can then map the reconstruction error matrix to
an anomaly score to identify faulty antenna arrays and increase the
classification F-measure (F-M) by up to 46%. We show our approach on the time
series thermograms collected by our antenna testing system. Conventionally, a
variational autoencoder (VAE) learning observation noise may yield better
results than a VAE with a constant noise assumption. However, we demonstrate
that this is not the case for anomaly detection on such low-level patterns for
two reasons. First, the baseline metric reconstruction probability, which
incorporates the learned observation noise, fails to differentiate anomalous
patterns. Second, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve of a VAE with a lower observation noise assumption achieves 11.83% higher
than that of a VAE with learned noise.

applications, such as video clipping and character collection. This task is
common but overlooked by previous person search works which focus on

surveillance scenes. For example, a person may change his clothes frequently.
To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a Unified Detector and Graph
Network (UDGNet) for person search in media. UDGNet is the first person search
framework to detect and re-identify the human body and head simultaneously.
Specifically, it first builds two branches based on a unified network to detect
the human body and head, then the detected body and head are used for
re-identification. This dual-task approach can significantly enhance
discriminative learning. To tackle the cloth-changing issue, UDGNet builds two
graphs to explore reliable links among cloth-changing samples and utilizes a
graph network to learn better embeddings. This design effectively enhances the
robustness of person search to cloth-changing challenges. Besides, we
demonstrate that UDGNet can be implemented with both anchor-based and
anchor-free person search frameworks and further achieve performance
improvement. This paper also contributes a large-scale dataset for Person
Search in Media (PSM), which provides both body and head annotations. It is by
far the largest dataset for person search in media. Experiments show that
UDGNet improves the anchor-free model AlignPS by 12.1% in mAP. Meanwhile, it
shows good generalization across surveillance and longterm scenarios. The

discontinuous spectral element methods, now generalizing previous spatial
eigenanalysis that did not include time integration errors. The influence of
discrete time integration is discussed in detail for different explicit
Runge-Kutta (1st to 4th order accurate) schemes combined with either
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) or Spectral Difference (SD) methods, both here
recovered from the Flux Reconstruction (FR) scheme. Selected numerical
experiments using the improved SD method by Liang and Jameson [1] are performed
to quantify the influence of time integration errors on actual simulations.
These involve test cases of varied complexity, from one-dimensional linear
advection equation studies to well-resolved and under-resolved inviscid
vortical flows. It is shown that, while both well-resolved and under-resolved
simulations of linear problems correlate well with the eigenanalysis prediction
of time integration errors, the correlation can be much worse for
under-resolved nonlinear problems. The effect of mesh regularity is also
considered, where time integration errors are found to be, in the case of
irregular grids, less pronounced than those of the spatial discretisation. In
fact, for the under-resolved vortical flows considered, the predominance of
spatial errors made it practically impossible for time integration errors to be
distinctly identified. Nevertheless, for well-resolved nonlinear simulations,
the effect of time integration errors could still be recognized. This
highlights that the interaction between space and time discretisation errors is
more complex than otherwise anticipated, contributing to the current
understanding about when eigenanalysis can effectively predict the behaviour of
numerical errors in practical under-resolved nonlinear problems, including
under-resolved turbulence computations.

applied to study the action of automorphisms on Brauer characters of finite

normalize the distributions of intermediate layers in deep learning, enabling
faster training and better generalization accuracy. However, in fidelity image
Super-Resolution (SR), it is believed that normalization layers get rid of
range flexibility by normalizing the features and they are simply removed from
modern SR networks. In this paper, we study this phenomenon quantitatively and
qualitatively. We found that the standard deviation of the residual feature
shrinks a lot after normalization layers, which causes the performance
degradation in SR networks. Standard deviation reflects the amount of variation
of pixel values. When the variation becomes smaller, the edges will become less
discriminative for the network to resolve. To address this problem, we propose
an Adaptive Deviation Modulator (AdaDM), in which a modulation factor is
adaptively predicted to amplify the pixel deviation. For better generalization
performance, we apply BN in state-of-the-art SR networks with the proposed
AdaDM. Meanwhile, the deviation amplification strategy in AdaDM makes the edge
information in the feature more distinguishable. As a consequence, SR networks
with BN and our AdaDM can get substantial performance improvements on benchmark
datasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness
of our method.

properly established model of motion, capable of describing its rich context.
However, commonly used motion representations often fail to accurately encode
the full articulation of motion, or present artifacts. In this work, we address
the fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion
modeling, suitable for deep character animation, one that can better constrain
poses and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics.
Our representation is based on dual quaternions, the mathematical abstractions
with well-defined operations, which simultaneously encode rotational and
positional orientation, enabling a hierarchy-aware encoding, centered around
the root. We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion
artifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular
representations. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various
losses that can be incorporated during learning. Leveraging the fact that our
representation implicitly encodes skeletal motion attributes, we train a
network on a dataset comprising of skeletons with different proportions,
without the need to retarget them first to a universal skeleton, which causes
subtle motion elements to be missed. We show that smooth and natural poses can
be achieved, paving the way for fascinating applications.

equation of motion coupled cluster (CVS-EOM-IP-CCSD) via the frozen density

alternating concatenation of a contraction operator (quantum operation) and a

we prove the optimal convergence rate of order $\tfrac{1}{n}$ of the Zeno

Chernoff-type $\sqrt{n}$-Lemma, which we believe to be of independent interest.
Moreover, we generalize the convergence result for the Zeno effect in two
directions: We weaken the assumptions on the generator, inducing the Zeno
dynamics generated by an unbounded generator and we improve the convergence to
the uniform topology. Finally, we provide a large class of examples arising

2-dimensional space is discretized by a weighted triangular tessellation. In
order to evaluate how well the tessellation approximates the 2-dimensional
space, we study three types of shortest paths: a weighted shortest path~$
\mathit{SP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ in the
space; a weighted shortest vertex path $ \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $, which is a
shortest path where the vertices of the path are vertices of the tessellation;
and a weighted shortest grid path~$ \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest
path whose edges are edges of the tessellation. The ratios $ \frac{\lVert
\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, $ \frac{\lVert

  Cross-Validation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Common cross-validation (CV) methods like k-fold cross-validation or
Monte-Carlo cross-validation estimate the predictive performance of a learner
by repeatedly training it on a large portion of the given data and testing on
the remaining data. These techniques have two major drawbacks. First, they can
be unnecessarily slow on large datasets. Second, beyond an estimation of the
final performance, they give almost no insights into the learning process of
the validated algorithm. In this paper, we present a new approach for
validation based on learning curves (LCCV). Instead of creating train-test
splits with a large portion of training data, LCCV iteratively increases the
number of instances used for training. In the context of model selection, it
discards models that are very unlikely to become competitive. We run a large
scale experiment on the 67 datasets from the AutoML benchmark and empirically
show that in over 90% of the cases using LCCV leads to similar performance (at
most 1.5% difference) as using 5/10-fold CV. However, it yields substantial
runtime reductions of over 20% on average. Additionally, it provides important
insights, which for example allow assessing the benefits of acquiring more
data. These results are orthogonal to other advances in the field of AutoML.

This formula resums to all perturbative orders a certain class of Feynman

However, the explicit calculations at next-to-leading logarithmic order

(HSISR), an usually method is to use the prior information of the hyperspectral
images (HSIs) as a regularization term to constrain the objective function.
Model-based methods using hand-crafted priors cannot fully characterize the
properties of HSIs. Learning-based methods usually use a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to learn the implicit priors of HSIs. However, the learning
ability of CNN is limited, it only considers the spatial characteristics of the
HSIs and ignores the spectral characteristics, and convolution is not effective
for long-range dependency modeling. There is still a lot of room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel HSISR method that uses
Transformer instead of CNN to learn the prior of HSIs. Specifically, we first
use the proximal gradient algorithm to solve the HSISR model, and then use an
unfolding network to simulate the iterative solution processes. The
self-attention layer of Transformer makes it have the ability of spatial global
interaction. In addition, we add 3D-CNN behind the Transformer layers to better
explore the spatio-spectral correlation of HSIs. Both quantitative and visual
results on two widely used HSI datasets and the real-world dataset demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a considerable gain compared to all the
mainstream algorithms including the most competitive conventional methods and

tasks, but there are fewer methods proposed for low-level tasks. It is
challenging to adopt vanilla contrastive learning technologies proposed for
high-level visual tasks straight to low-level visual tasks since the acquired
global visual representations are insufficient for low-level tasks requiring
rich texture and context information. In this paper, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework for single image super-resolution (SISR). We
investigate the contrastive learning-based SISR from two perspectives: sample
construction and feature embedding. The existing methods propose some naive
sample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a
negative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and they adopt a
prior model (e.g., pre-trained VGG model) to obtain the feature embedding
instead of exploring a task-friendly one. To this end, we propose a practical
contrastive learning framework for SISR that involves the generation of many
informative positive and hard negative samples in frequency space. Instead of
utilizing an additional pre-trained network, we design a simple but effective
embedding network inherited from the discriminator network and can be
iteratively optimized with the primary SR network making it task-generalizable.
Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our method compared
with benchmark methods and show remarkable gains of up to 0.21 dB over the

transforming a set of particles into samples from the posterior distribution.
Particles move in state space under the flow of an McKean-Vlasov-Ito process.
This work introduces the Variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) framework for data
assimilation, a general approach that includes previously known particle flow
filters as special cases. The McKean-Vlasov-Ito process that transforms
particles is defined via an optimal drift that depends on the selected
diffusion term. It is established that the underlying probability density -
sampled by the ensemble of particles - converges to the Bayesian posterior
probability density. For a finite number of particles the optimal drift
contains a regularization term that nudges particles toward becoming
independent random variables. Based on this analysis, we derive
computationally-feasible approximate regularization approaches that penalize
the mutual information between pairs of particles, and avoid particle collapse.
Moreover, the diffusion plays a role akin to a particle rejuvenation approach
that aims to alleviate particle collapse. The VFP framework is very flexible.
Different assumptions on prior and intermediate probability distributions can
be used to implement the optimal drift, and localization and covariance
shrinkage can be applied to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. A robust
implicit-explicit method is discussed for the efficient integration of stiff
McKean-Vlasov-Ito processes. The effectiveness of the VFP framework is
demonstrated on three progressively more challenging test problems, namely the
Lorenz '63, Lorenz '96 and the quasi-geostrophic equations.

been measured in the ultrahigh vacuum of an electrostatic storage ring to
values on the order of $10^4$ s$^{-1}$. The rates were measured as a competing
channel to unimolecular decay, and the rate constants pertain to the excitation
energies where these two channels compete. Such high values can only be
explained as photon emission from thermally excited electronic states, a
mechanism that has also been seen in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cations.
The high rates have a very strong stabilizing effect on the clusters and the
underlying mechanism gives a high energy conversion efficiency, with the
potential to reach high quantum efficiencies in the emission process. The
competing decay of unimolecular fragmentation defines upper limits for photon
energies that can be down-converted to lower energy photons. Including
previously measured cluster sizes provides the limits for all clusters C$_N^+$,
$N=8-27$, of values that vary from 10 to 14.5 eV, with a general increase with
size. Clusters absorbing photons of energies below these limits cool down
efficiently by emission of photons via electronic transitions and their
fragmentation is strongly reduced, increasing their survival in HI regions.

microscopy techniques for imaging the 3D refractive index (RI) distribution of
a sample from a set of 2D intensity-only measurements. The reconstruction of
artifact-free RI maps is a fundamental challenge in IDT due to the loss of
phase information and the missing cone problem. Neural fields (NF) has recently
emerged as a new deep learning (DL) approach for learning continuous
representations of physical fields. NF uses a coordinate-based neural network
to represent the field by mapping the spatial coordinates to the corresponding
physical quantities, in our case the complex-valued refractive index values. We
present DeCAF as the first NF-based IDT method that can learn a high-quality
continuous representation of a RI volume from its intensity-only and
limited-angle measurements. The representation in DeCAF is learned directly
from the measurements of the test sample by using the IDT forward model,
without any ground-truth RI maps. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate
DeCAF on the simulated and experimental biological samples. Our results show
that DeCAF can generate high-contrast and artifact-free RI maps and lead to up
to 2.1 times reduction in MSE over existing methods.

we propose a new EMTR fault location method using direct convolution. This
method is different from the traditional methods, and it only needs to
pre-calculate the assumed fault transients for a given network, which can be
stored in embedded hardware. The faults can be located efficiently via direct

perceptions are influenced by vaccination hesitancy, which affects the
acceptance of e-learning platforms. Hence, this research aimed to examine the
post-acceptance of e-learning platforms on the basis of a conceptual model that
employs different variables. Distinct contribution is made by every variable to
the post-acceptance of e-learning platforms. A hybrid model was used in the
current study in which technology acceptance model (TAM) determinants were
employed along with other external factors such as fear of vaccination,
perceived routine use, perceived enjoyment, perceived critical mass, and
self-efficiency which are directly linked to post-acceptance of e-learning
platforms. The focus of earlier studies on this topic has been on the
significance of e-learning acceptance in various environments and countries.
However, in this study, the newly-spread use of e-learning platforms in the
gulf area was examined using a hybrid conceptual model. The empirical studies
carried out in the past mainly used structural equation modelling (SEM)
analysis; however, this study used an evolving hybrid analysis approach, in
which SEM and the artificial neural network (ANN) that are based on deep

used in this study to determine the significance and performance of each
factor. The proposed model is backed by the findings of data analysis.

emitted-current-density-versus-voltage (J-V) curve. Knowledge of the

thermionic electron emission performance of cathodes, including predicting the
lifetime. However, there have been no first-principles physics-based models
that can predict the smooth TL-FSCL transition region for real thermionic
cathodes without applying physically difficult to justify a priori assumptions
or empirical phenomenological equations. Previous work detailing the nonuniform
thermionic emission found that the effects of 3-D space charge, patch fields,
and Schottky barrier lowering can lead to a smooth TL-FSCL transition region
from a model thermionic cathode surface with a checkerboard spatial
distribution of work function values. In this work, we construct a
physics-based nonuniform emission model for commercial dispenser cathodes for
the first time. This emission model is obtained by incorporating the cathode
surface grain orientation via electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and the
facet-orientation-specific work function values from density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. The model enables construction of two-dimensional emitted
current density maps of the cathode surface and corresponding J-T and J-V
curves. The predicted emission curves show excellent agreement with experiment,
not only in TL and FSCL regions but, crucially, also in the TL-FSCL transition
region. This model improves the understanding on the relationship between
thermionic emission and cathode microstructure, which is beneficial to the
design of vacuum electronic devices.

In this work, we report the 4-inch crack-free high-power UVC-LED wafer. This
achievement relies on a proposed strain-tailored strategy, where a
three-dimensional to two-dimensional (3D-2D) transition layer is introduced
during the homo-epitaxy of AlN on high temperature annealed (HTA)-AlN template,
which successfully drives the original compressive strain into tensile one and
thus solves the challenge of realizing high quality Al$_{0.6}$Ga$_{0.4}$N layer

pseudomorphically grown on the strain-tailored HTA-AlN template, leading to

compromising the bottlenecked contradictory in producing large-sized UVC-LED
wafer on pronounced crystalline AlN template: The compressive strain in HTA-AlN
allows for crack-free 4-inch wafer, but at the same time leads to a
deterioration of the AlGaN morphology and crystal quality. The launch of 4-inch
