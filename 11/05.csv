spectroscopy, free-space and fiber-optical communications, surveillance and
recognition, artificial intelligence, and medical imaging. However, developing
these emerging technologies and their large-scale use depend on the
availability of high-speed, low-noise, and cost-effective photodetectors. With
this perspective, here we demonstrate GeSn photodiodes grown on silicon wafers
featuring a high broadband operation covering the extended-SWIR range with a
peak responsivity of 0.3 A/W at room temperature. These GeSn devices exhibit a
high bandwidth reaching 7.5 GHz at 5 V bias with a 2.6 $\mu$m cutoff
wavelength, and their integration in ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy
applications is demonstrated. In addition to enabling time-resolved
electro-luminescence at 2.3 $\mu$m, the high-speed operation of GeSn detectors
was also exploited in the diagnostics of ultra-short pulses of a supercontinuum
laser with a temporal resolution in the picosecond range at 2.5 $\mu$m.
Establishing these capabilities highlights the potential of manufacturable GeSn
photodiodes for silicon-integrated high-speed extended-SWIR applications.

of driving automation. However, recent reports of demonstrative deployments of
automated vehicles (AVs) indicate that AVs are still difficult to meet the
expectation of other interacting drivers, which leads to several AV accidents
involving human-driven vehicles (HVs). This is most likely due to the lack of
understanding about the dynamic interaction process, especially about the human
drivers. By investigating the causes of 4,300 video clips of traffic accidents,
we find that the limited dynamic visual field of drivers is one leading factor
in inter-vehicle interaction accidents, especially in those involving trucks. A
game-theoretic decision algorithm considering social compatibility is proposed
to handle the interaction with a human-driven truck at an unsignalized
intersection. Starting from a probabilistic model for the visual field
characteristics of truck drivers, social fitness and reciprocal altruism in the
decision are incorporated in the game payoff design. Human-in-the-loop
experiments are carried out, in which 24 subjects are invited to drive and
interact with AVs deployed with the proposed algorithm and two comparison
algorithms. Totally 207 cases of intersection interactions are obtained and
analyzed, which shows that the proposed decision-making algorithm can not only
improve both safety and time efficiency, but also make AV decisions more in
line with the expectation of interacting human drivers. These findings can help
inform the design of automated driving decision algorithms, to ensure that AVs
can be safely and efficiently integrated into the human-dominated traffic.

for direct monolithic integration on c-Si, only a restricted number of top and
bottom cell architectures are compatible, due to either epitaxy or high
temperature constraints, where the interface between subcells is subject to a
trade-off between transmittance, electrical interconnection, and bottom cell
degradation. Using polySi/SiOx passivating contacts for Si, this degradation
can be largely circumvented by tuning the polySi/SiOx stacks to promote
gettering of contaminants admitted into the Si bottom cell during the top cell
synthesis. Applying this concept to the low-cost top cell chalcogenides
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), CuGaSe2 (CGSe) and AgInGaSe2 (AIGSe), fabricated under harsh
S or Se atmospheres above 550 {\deg}C, we show that increasing the
heavily-doped polySi layer thickness from 40 to up to 400 nm prevents a
reduction in Si carrier lifetime by one order of magnitude, with final
lifetimes above 500 us uniformly across areas up to 20 cm2. In all cases, the
increased resilience was correlated with a 99.9% reduction in contaminant
concentration in the c-Si bulk, provided by the thick polySi layer, which acts
as a buried gettering layer in the tandem structure without compromising the Si
passivation quality. The Si resilience decreased as AIGSe > CGSe > CZTS, in
accordance with the measured Cu contamination profiles and higher annealing
temperatures. An efficiency of up to 7% was achieved for a CZTS/Si tandem,
where the Si bottom cell is no longer the limiting factor.

the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Firstly, we
formalize a common general process to define families of metrics: the principle
of deformed metrics. We relate the recently introduced family of
alpha-Procrustes metrics to the general class of mean kernel metrics by
providing a sufficient condition under which elements of the former belongs to
the latter. Secondly, we focus on the principle of balanced bilinear forms that
we recently introduced. We give a new sufficient condition under which the
balanced bilinear form is a metric. It allows us to introduce the
Mixed-Euclidean (ME) metrics which generalize the Mixed-Power-Euclidean (MPE)
metrics. We unveal their link with the (u, v)-divergences and the ($\alpha$,
$\beta$)-divergences of information geometry and we provide an explicit formula
of the Riemann curvature tensor. We show that the sectional curvature of all ME
metrics can take negative values and we show experimentally that the sectional
curvature of all MPE metrics but the log-Euclidean, power-Euclidean and
power-affine metrics can take positive values.

transversally at $\Gamma$ (and counted with the appropriate integer
multiplicity). In view of well-known examples, our result is optimal, and it is

simple) cycle on an even number of vertices. As far as we know, no
polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact,
finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more
than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2) 1999)
and, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin. 2004; announced jointly at
STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterisation of
even-cycle-free directed graphs.
  Methodologically, our algorithm relies on algebraic fingerprinting and
randomized polynomial identity testing over a finite field, and uses a
generating polynomial implicit in Vazirani and Yannakakis ( Discrete Appl.
Math. 1989) that enumerates weighted cycle covers as a difference of a
permanent and a determinant polynomial. The need to work with the permanent is
where our main technical contribution occurs. We design a family of finite
commutative rings of characteristic 4 that simultaneously (i) give a
nondegenerate representation for the generating polynomial identity via the
permanent and the determinant, (ii) support efficient permanent computations,
and (iii) enable emulation of finite-field arithmetic in characteristic 2. Here
our work is foreshadowed by that of Bj\""orklund and Husfeldt (SIAM J. Comput.
2019), who used a considerably less efficient ring design to obtain a
polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest two disjoint paths problem.
  Building on work of Gilbert and Tarjan (Numer. Math. 1978) as well as Alon
and Yuster (J. ACM 2013), we also show how ideas from the nested dissection
technique for solving linear equation systems leads to faster algorithm designs
when we have control on the separator structure of the input graph; for
example, this happens when the input has bounded genus.

regularized policy optimization (RPO) algorithms with strong performance across
multiple domains. In this family of methods, agents are trained to maximize
cumulative reward while penalizing deviation in behavior from some reference,
or default policy. In addition to empirical success, there is a strong
theoretical foundation for understanding RPO methods applied to single tasks,
with connections to natural gradient, trust region, and variational approaches.
However, there is limited formal understanding of desirable properties for
default policies in the multitask setting, an increasingly important domain as
the field shifts towards training more generally capable agents. Here, we take
a first step towards filling this gap by formally linking the quality of the
default policy to its effect on optimization. Using these results, we then
derive a principled RPO algorithm for multitask learning with strong
performance guarantees.

flags changed areas to prioritise for downlink, shortening the response time.
We verified the efficacy of our system on a dataset composed of time series of
catastrophic events - which we plan to release alongside this publication -
demonstrating that RaVAEn outperforms pixel-wise baselines. Finally we tested

ratio to correct the discrepancy between the state distribution of the behavior
policy and that of the target policy. Our work goes beyond existing works on
the optimality of policy gradient methods in that existing works use the exact
policy gradient for updating the policy parameters while we use an approximate
and stochastic update step. Our update step is not a gradient update because we
do not use a density ratio to correct the state distribution, which aligns well
with what practitioners do. Our update is approximate because we use a learned
critic instead of the true value function. Our update is stochastic because at
each step the update is done for only the current state action pair. Moreover,
we remove several restrictive assumptions from existing works in our analysis.
Central to our work is the finite sample analysis of a generic stochastic
approximation algorithm with time-inhomogeneous update operators on
time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, based on its uniform contraction properties.

are reducible to decision problems; this has led to decision problems being
regarded as the $\textit{de facto}$ computational task to study in complexity
theory. In this work, we explore search-to-decision reductions for quantum
search problems, wherein a quantum algorithm makes queries to a classical
decision oracle to output a desired quantum state. In particular, we focus on
search-to-decision reductions for $\mathsf{QMA}$, and show that there exists a
quantum polynomial-time algorithm that can generate a witness for a
$\mathsf{QMA}$ problem up to inverse polynomial precision by making one query
to a $\mathsf{PP}$ decision oracle. We complement this result by showing that
$\mathsf{QMA}$-search does $\textit{not}$ reduce to $\mathsf{QMA}$-decision in
polynomial-time, relative to a quantum oracle.
  We also explore the more general $\textit{state synthesis problem}$, in which
the goal is to efficiently synthesize a target state by making queries to a
classical oracle encoding the state. We prove that there exists a classical
oracle with which any quantum state can be synthesized to inverse polynomial
precision using only one oracle query and to inverse exponential precision
using two oracle queries. This answers an open question of Aaronson from 2016,
who presented a state synthesis algorithm that makes $O(n)$ queries to a
classical oracle to prepare an $n$-qubit state, and asked if the query
complexity could be made sublinear.

must be considered. Once deployed, a ML model needs to be watched and
constantly supervised and debugged to guarantee its validity and robustness in
unexpected situations. Debugging in ML aims to identify (and address) the model
weaknesses in not trivial contexts. Several techniques have been proposed to
identify different types of model weaknesses, such as bias in classification,
model decay, adversarial attacks, etc., yet there is not a generic framework
that allows them to work in a collaborative, modular, portable, iterative way
and, more importantly, flexible enough to allow both human- and machine-driven
techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel containerized directed graph
framework to support and accelerate end-to-end ML workflow management,
supervision, and debugging. The framework allows defining and deploying ML
workflows in containers, tracking their metadata, checking their behavior in
production, and improving the models by using both learned and human-provided
knowledge. We demonstrate these capabilities by integrating in the framework
two hybrid systems to detect data drift distribution which identify the samples
that are far from the latent space of the original distribution, ask for human
intervention, and whether retrain the model or wrap it with a filter to remove
the noise of corrupted data at inference time. We test these systems on
MNIST-C, CIFAR-10-C, and FashionMNIST-C datasets, obtaining promising accuracy
results with the help of human involvement.

is an important tool in network science, e.g. to construct graph generators or
null-models. Here, the Edge Switching Markov Chain (ES-MC) is a common choice.
Given an arbitrary simple graph with the required degree sequence, ES-MC
carries out a large number of small changes, called edge switches, to
eventually obtain a uniform sample. In practice, reasonably short runs
efficiently yield approximate uniform samples.
  In this work, we study the problem of executing edge switches in parallel. We
discuss parallelizations of ES-MC, but find that this approach suffers from
complex dependencies between edge switches. For this reason, we propose the
Global Edge Switching Markov Chain (G-ES-MC), an ES-MC variant with simpler
dependencies. We show that G-ES-MC converges to the uniform distribution and
design shared-memory parallel algorithms for ES-MC and G-ES-MC. In an empirical
evaluation, we provide evidence that G-ES-MC requires not more switches than
ES-MC (and often fewer), and demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our
parallel G-ES-MC implementation.

GeV $\gamma$-ray light curves spanning 10.5 years (2008$-$2019). We find
significant positive and negative correlations between radio and $\gamma$-ray
fluxes in different time ranges. The time delays between radio and $\gamma$-ray
emission suggest that the observed $\gamma$-ray flares originated from multiple
regions upstream of the radio core, within a few parsecs from the central
engine. Using time-resolved 43 GHz VLBA maps we identified 14 jet components
moving downstream along the jet. Their apparent speeds range from 6 to 26 $c$,
showing notable variations in their position angles upstream the stationary
component ($\sim$0.53 mas from the core). The brightness temperature declines
as function of distance from the core according to a power-law which becomes
shallower at the location of the stationary component. We also find that the
periods at which significant correlations between radio and $\gamma$-ray
emission occur overlap with the times when the jet was oriented to the north.
Our results indicate that the passage of a propagating disturbance (or shock)
through the radio core and the orientation of the jet might be responsible for
the observed correlation between the radio and $\gamma$-ray variability. We
present a scenario that connects the positive correlation and the unusual
anti-correlation by combining the production of a flare and a dip at
$\gamma$-rays by a strong moving shock at different distances from the jet
apex.

Typically, the disturbance set is either assumed to be known a priori or

of computing a suitable input disturbance set in case the set of possible
output values is assigned a priori has received relatively little attention.
This problem arises in many contexts, such as in supervisory control, actuator

to compute input disturbance sets (and the corresponding set of states) such
that the resulting set of outputs matches as closely as possible a given set of
outputs, while additionally satisfying strict (inner or outer) inclusion
constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem by relying on
the concept of robust invariance. The effectiveness of the approach is
demonstrated in numerical examples that illustrate how to solve safe reference

classically solve this problem by contracting the corresponding tensor network
just once, and is massively more efficient than existing methods in obtaining a
large number of uncorrelated samples with a target fidelity. For the Sycamore
quantum supremacy circuit with $53$ qubits and $20$ cycles, we have generated
one million uncorrelated bitstrings $\{\mathbf s\}$ which are sampled from a
distribution $\hat P(\mathbf s)=|\hat \psi(\mathbf s)|^2$, where the
approximate state $\hat \psi$ has fidelity $F\approx 0.0037$. The whole
computation has cost about $15$ hours on a computational cluster with $512$
GPUs. The obtained one million samples, the contraction code and contraction
order is made public. If our algorithm could be implemented with high
efficiency on a modern supercomputer with ExaFLOPS performance, we estimate

The two mechanisms occur simultaneously when an intense laser pulse propagating

plasma bubble along the laser propagation path can either inhibit or conspire
with electron injection due to bubble expansion. We show that Carrier Envelope

Undulating Bubble (EPUB). The longitudinal structure of the electron bunch
injected by the EPUB can be controlled by laser polarization and power,
resulting in high-charge (multiple nano Coulombs) high-current (tens of kilo

problems in the QAOA, how to initialise the algorithm, and how to subsequently
train the parameters to find an optimal solution. For the former, we propose
graph neural networks (GNNs) as a warm-starting technique for QAOA. We
demonstrate that merging GNNs with QAOA can outperform both approaches

warm-start generalisation across not only graph instances, but also to
increasing graph sizes, a feature not straightforwardly available to other
warm-starting methods. For training the QAOA, we test several optimisers for
the MaxCut problem up to 16 qubits and benchmark against vanilla gradient

that a general-purpose Transformer model can perform multi-task AMT, jointly
transcribing arbitrary combinations of musical instruments across several

high-quality transcription results across a range of datasets, dramatically
improving performance for low-resource instruments (such as guitar), while

electronic structure in the presence of a perpendicular electric field as they
screen the external field. Finally, we analyze the contribution of the Hartree
potential to the crystal field, i.e. the on-site energy difference between the
inner and outer layers. We find that the on-site energy obtained from Hartree
theory has the same sign, but a smaller magnitude compared to previous studies
in which the on-site energy was determined by fitting tight-binding results to
ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) band structures. To understand this
quantitative difference, we analyze the ab initio Kohn-Sham potential obtained

investigate the confinement policies and the effect they made on the spread. We
found that implementations of the same confinement policies exhibit different
results in different countries. Specifically, lockdowns become less effective
in densely populated regions, because of the reluctance to comply with social
distancing measures. Lack of testing, contact tracing, and social awareness in
some countries forestall people from self-isolation and maintaining social
distance. Large labor camps with unhealthy living conditions also aid in high
community transmissions in countries depending on foreign labor. Distrust in
government policies and fake news instigate the spread in both developed and
under-developed countries. Large social gatherings play a vital role in causing
rapid outbreaks almost everywhere. While some countries were able to contain
the spread by implementing strict and widely adopted confinement policies, some
others contained the spread with the help of social distancing measures and
rigorous testing capacity. An early and rapid response at the beginning of the
pandemic is necessary to contain the spread, yet it is not always sufficient.

observation is that the CK-dual integrands contain a large number of free

that they cancel in the simplified integrands. We further perform the numerical
evaluation of the integrals at a special kinematics point using public packages
FIESTA and pySecDec based on the sector-decomposition approach. We find that
the numerical computation can be significantly simplified by expressing the

designed for preference-based RL. A key challenge with such a benchmark is
providing the ability to evaluate candidate algorithms quickly, which makes
relying on real human input for evaluation prohibitive. At the same time,
simulating human input as giving perfect preferences for the ground truth

adjacency matrix; these models find a vector representation of each node such
that the predicted probability of a link between two nodes increases with the
similarity (dot product) of their associated vectors. Recent work has shown
that these models are unable to capture key structures in real-world graphs,
particularly heterophilous structures, wherein links occur between dissimilar
nodes. In contrast, a factorization with two vectors per node, based on
logistic principal components analysis (LPCA), has been proven not only to
represent such structures, but also to provide exact low-rank factorization of
any graph with bounded max degree. However, this bound has limited
applicability to real-world networks, which often have power law degree
distributions with high max degree. Further, the LPCA model lacks
interpretability since its asymmetric factorization does not reflect the
undirectedness of the graph. We address these issues in two ways. First, we
prove a new bound for the LPCA model in terms of arboricity rather than max

real-world networks. Second, we propose an alternative graph model whose

polarization and magnetization fields, and free charge and current densities
are always admitted. These definitions assume no particular initial electronic
state of the crystal, and the set of microscopic fields satisfy the usual
relations of classical electrodynamics. Notably, when applied to a trivial
insulator initially occupying its $T=0$ ground state, the expressions for the
unperturbed polarization and orbital magnetization, and for the orbital
magnetoelectric polarizability tensor obtained from these different approaches
can agree. However, the ""modern theory of magnetization"" has been extended via
thermodynamic arguments to include metals and Chern insulators. We here compare
with that generalization and find disagreement; the manner in which the
expressions differ elucidates the distinct philosophies of these approaches.
Our approach leads to the usual electrical conductivity tensor in the
long-wavelength limit; in the absence of any scattering mechanisms, the dc
divergence of that tensor is due to the free current density and the
finite-frequency generalization of the anomalous Hall contribution arises from
a combination of bound and free current densities. As well, in the limit that
the electronic ground state is that of a trivial insulator, our expressions
reduce to those expected for the unperturbed polarization and magnetization,
and the electric susceptibility.

are all affected by major events. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most
sectors of the global economy, and there is by now plenty of evidence to
support this. The impact on stock markets is, however, still unclear. The fact
that most markets seem to have partly recovered while the pandemic is still
ongoing suggests that the relationship between stock returns and COVID-19 has
been subject to structural change. It is therefore important to know if a
structural break has occurred and, if it has, to infer the date of the break.
In the present paper we take this last observation as a source of motivation to
develop a new break detection toolbox that is applicable to different sized
panels, easy to implement and robust to general forms of unobserved
heterogeneity. The toolbox, which is the first of its kind, includes a test for
structural change, a break date estimator, and a break date confidence

September 25, 2020, leads to the detection of a structural break that is dated
to the first week of April. The effect of COVID-19 is negative before the break

short-lived. A possible explanation for this is the quantitative easing

which leads to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. However, solutions to the equation
are known only for specific symmetry-reduced systems, including models of
quantum cosmology. Novel methods, which enable solving the equation for complex
gravitational configurations are, therefore, worth seeking.
  Here, we propose and investigate a new method of solving the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation, which employs a variational quantum computing approach, and is
possible to implement on quantum computers. For this purpose, the gravitational
system is regularized, by performing spherical compactification of the phase
space. This makes the system's Hilbert space finite-dimensional and allows to
use $SU(2)$ variables, which are easy to handle in quantum computing. The
validity of the method is examined in the case of the flat de Sitter universe.
For the purpose of testing the method, both an emulator of a quantum computer
and the IBM superconducting quantum computer have been used. The advantages and

This could limit coresets use in practical applications. Moreover, small
coresets provably do not exist for many problems.

which is a natural relaxation of the standard definition and aims at
approximating the \emph{average} loss of the original data over the queries.
This allows us to use a learning paradigm to compute a small coreset of a given

queries. We derive formal guarantees for the proposed approach. Experimental
evaluation on deep networks and classic machine learning problems show that our

bursty traffic are expected to co-exist with cellular systems to serve several
latency-critical applications. Thus, it is important for the access points to
identify the active devices promptly with minimal resource consumption to
enable massive machine-type communication without disrupting the conventional
traffic. In this paper, a frequency-multiplexed strategy based on group testing
is proposed for activity detection which can take into account the constraints
on network latency while minimizing the overall resource utilization. The core
idea is that during each time-slot of active device discovery, multiple
subcarriers in frequency domain can be used to launch group tests in parallel
to reduce delay. Our proposed scheme is functional in the asymptotic and
non-asymptotic regime of the total number of devices $(n)$ and the number of
concurrently active devices $(k)$. We prove that, asymptotically, when the
number of available time-slots scale as $\Omega\big(\log (\frac{n}{k})\big)$,
the frequency-multiplexed group testing strategy requires $O\big(k\log
(\frac{n}{k})\big)$ time-frequency resources which is order-optimal and results
in an $O(k)$ reduction in the number of time-slots with respect to the optimal
strategy of fully-adaptive generalized binary splitting. Furthermore, we
establish that the frequency-multiplexed GT strategy shows significant
tolerance to estimation errors in $k$. Comparison with 3GPP standardized random
access protocol for NB-IoT indicates the superiority of our proposed strategy
in terms of access delay and overall resource utilization.

the possibility of dark matter vortices. We take a model agnostic approach, and
demonstrate that a collection of dark vortices can explain the data reported in

experiences a sharp drop. Acoustic waves excited by the supersonic shear in the

through that region. Here we examine the characteristics of the angular
momentum transport produced by the different types of wave modes emerging in

of the BLs. We provide a comparative analysis of the transport properties of
different modes across the range of relevant disc parameters. In particular, we
identify the types of modes which are responsible for the mass accretion onto
the central object. We find the correlated perturbations of surface density and
radial velocity to provide an important contribution to the mass accretion
rate. Although the wave-driven transport is intrinsically non-local, we do
observe a clear correlation between the angular momentum flux injected into the
disc by the waves and the mass accretion rate through the BL. We find the
efficiency of angular momentum transport (normalized by thermal pressure) to be
a weak function of the flow Mach number. We also quantify the wave-driven
evolution of the inner disc, in particular the modification of the angular

function, corresponding to either the topologically twisted index or a mixed
one. This generalizes results in three and four dimensions and correctly
reproduces the entropy of known black objects in AdS$_6 \times_{w} S^4$ and
AdS$_7\times S^4$. We also provide the supersymmetric background and explicitly
perform localization for the mixed index on $\Sigma_\mathfrak{g} \times S^1

astrophysics. Fluorine abundance was first measured for stars other than the
Sun in 1992, then for a handful metal-poor stars, which are likely to have
formed in the early Universe. The main production sites of fluorine are under
debate and include asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, $\nu$-process in
core-collapse supernovae, and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Due to the difference in
the mass and lifetime of progenitor stars, high redshift observations of
fluorine can help constrain the mechanism of fluorine production in massive
galaxies. Here, we report the detection of HF (S/N = 8) in absorption in a
gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxy at redshift z=4.4 with $N_{\rm
HF}$/$N_{\rm{H_2}}$ as high as $\sim2\times10^{-9}$, indicating a very quick
ramp-up of the chemical enrichment in this high-z galaxy. At z=4.4, AGB stars
of a few solar masses are very unlikely to dominate the enrichment. Instead, we
show that WR stars are required to produce the observed fluorine abundance at
this time, with other production mechanisms becoming important at later times.
These observations therefore provide an insight into the underlying processes
driving the `ramp-up' phase of chemical enrichment alongside rapid stellar mass
assembly in a young massive galaxy.

improving our general understanding of galaxy evolution. In the first paper in
this series, detailed morphological analysis of high-excitation radio galaxies
(HERGs) with intermediate radio powers suggested that the importance of
triggering via galaxy mergers and interactions increases strongly with AGN
radio power and weakly with optical emission-line luminosity. Here, we use an
online classification interface to expand our morphological analysis to a much
larger sample of 155 active galaxies (3CR radio galaxies, radio-intermediate
HERGs and Type 2 quasars) that covers a broad range in both 1.4 GHz radio power
and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission-line luminosity. All active galaxy samples are
found to exhibit excesses in their rates of morphological disturbance relative
to 378 stellar-mass- and redshift-matched non-active control galaxies
classified randomly and blindly alongside them. These excesses are highest for
the 3CR HERGs (4.7$\sigma$) and Type 2 quasar hosts (3.7$\sigma$), supporting
the idea that galaxy mergers provide the dominant triggering mechanism for
these subgroups. When the full active galaxy sample is considered, there is
clear evidence to suggest that the enhancement in the rate of disturbance
relative to the controls increases strongly with [OIII]$\lambda$5007
emission-line luminosity but not with 1.4 GHz radio power. Evidence that the
dominant AGN host types change from early-type galaxies at high radio powers to
late-type galaxies at low radio powers is also found, suggesting that
triggering by secular, disk-based processes holds more importance for
lower-power radio AGN.

cross sections $\sigma_v$, we also calculate effective J-factors for
velocity-dependent models, where the annihilation cross section is either
either p-wave ($\propto v^2/c^2$) or d-wave ($\propto v^4/c^4$). We use 12
pairs of simulations, each run with dark-matter-only (DMO) physics and FIRE-2
physics. We observe FIRE runs produce central dark matter velocity dispersions
that are systematically larger than in DMO runs by factors of $\sim 2.5-4$.
They also have a larger range of central ($\sim 400$ pc) dark matter densities
than the DMO runs ($\rho_{\rm FIRE}/\rho_{\rm DMO} \simeq 0.5 - 3$) owing to
the competing effects of baryonic contraction and feedback. At 3 degrees from
the Galactic Center, FIRE J-factors are $5-50$ (p-wave) and $15-500$ (d-wave)
times higher than in the DMO runs. The change in s-wave signal at 3 degrees is
more modest and can be higher or lower ($\sim 0.3-6$), though the shape of the
emission profile is flatter (less peaked towards the Galactic Center) and more
circular on the sky in FIRE runs. Our results for s-wave are broadly consistent
with the range of assumptions in most indirect detection studies. We observe
p-wave J-factors that are significantly enhanced compared to most past
estimates. We find that thermal models with p-wave annihilation may be within
range of detection in the near future.

qualitatively good agreement between the SFR or cold gas mass vs. stellar mass

compare the dispersion in the predicted scaling relations, and the correlation
in residuals on a halo-by-halo basis between halo mass and galaxy property
scaling relations. Intriguingly, we find similar correlations between residuals
in SMHM in the SAM and in TNG, suggesting that these relations may be shaped by
similar physical processes. Other scaling relations do not show significant

interactions to the chemical transport in the Standard Model plasma, which
imply that nonzero lepton flavor asymmetries summing up to $B-L = 0$ are enough
to generate the baryon asymmetry. Then, we describe two scenarios of what we
call {\it leptoflavorgenesis}, where efficient CLFV processes are responsible
for the generation of primordial lepton flavor asymmetries that are
subsequently converted to a baryon asymmetry by weak sphaleron processes. Here,
the conversion factor from lepton flavor asymmetry to baryon asymmetry is
suppressed by charged-lepton Yukawa couplings squared, which provides a natural

bulk samples of chiral disilicide NbSi$_2$ and TaSi$_2$. As previously
demonstrated in the experiments using single crystals of NbSi$_2$ and TaSi$_2$,
electrical transport measurements allow detection of direct and inverse signals
associated with the chirality-induced spin polarization even in the chiral
polycrystals. The spin polarization signals also appear in nonlocal
measurements, in which charge current flows only in the area millimeters away
from the detection electrode. These data mean that the spin polarization
phenomena occur regardless of the presence of crystalline grains in the
polycrystals, indicating a robustness and resilience of the chirality-induced
spin polarization. On the basis of the experimental data, we found that the sum
rule holds for the spin transport signals. A distribution of handedness over
the samples was determined on average in the polycrystals. While the mechanism
of preserving the spin polarization over millimeters remains to be clarified,
the present study may open up prospects of spin control and manipulation over
macroscopic length scales using chiral materials.

empirically to succeed in finding solutions at low density. This phenomenon has
been justified numerically by the existence of subdominant and dense connected

this paper, we establish formally such a phenomenon for both the symmetric and

subdominant connected cluster of solutions with almost maximal diameter, and
that an efficient multiscale majority algorithm can find solutions in such a

there exist clusters of linear diameter for the symmetric perceptron, as well

a spatial alignment of the tool trajectory to maximize the sparse goal reward
given by the environment. Second, we describe an imitation learning approach

For this we combine reinforcement learning with an optimization procedure to
find a control policy and the placement of the robot based on the tool motion

diffuse continuum (DC) emission from the broad-line region makes a substantial
contribution to the total continuum emission from ultraviolet through
near-infrared wavelengths. Evidence for this DC component is present in the
strong Balmer jump feature in AGN spectra, and possibly from reverberation
measurements that find longer lags than expected from disk emission alone.
However, the Balmer jump region contains numerous blended emission features,
making it difficult to isolate the DC emission strength. In contrast, the
Paschen jump region near 8200 \r{A} is relatively uncontaminated by other
strong emission features. Here, we examine whether the Paschen jump can aid in
constraining the DC contribution, using Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectra of
six nearby Seyfert 1 nuclei. The spectra appear smooth across the Paschen edge,
and we find no evidence of a Paschen spectral break or jump in total flux. We
fit multi-component spectral models over the range $6800-9700$ \r{A} and find
that the spectra can still be compatible with a significant DC contribution if
the DC Paschen jump is offset by an opposite spectral break resulting from
blended high-order Paschen emission lines. The fits imply DC contributions
ranging from $\sim$10% to 50% at 8000 \r{A}, but the fitting results are highly
dependent on assumptions made about other model components. These degeneracies
can potentially be alleviated by carrying out fits over a broader wavelength
range, provided that models can accurately represent the disk continuum shape,
Fe II emission, high-order Balmer line emission, and other components.

sensitivity of the gravitational wave observatories, observing strongly lensed
pair of events will become a real possibility. Lensed GW events will have very
accurately measured time delays, as well as magnification ratios. If the
corresponding lens system can be identified electromagnetically and the
redshifts of the lens and the host galaxy can be measured, such events can be
used to constrain important astrophysical parameters of the lens system. As
most lensing events will have image separations that will be significantly
smaller than the GW event localization uncertainties, it is important that we
develop diagnostics that will aid in the robust identification of such lensed
events. We define a new statistic based on the joint probability of lensing
observables that can be used to discriminate lensed pair of events from the
unlensed ones. To this end, we carry out simulations of lensed GW events to
infer the distribution of the relative time delays, relative magnifications
sub-divided by the type of lensed images. We compare this distribution to a
similar one obtained for random unlensed event pairs. Our improved statistic
can be used to improve the existing ranking approach adopted by the search
pipelines in order to down-select event pairs for joint parameter estimates.
The distributions we obtain can further be used to define more informative
priors in joint parameter estimation analyses for candidate lensed events.

candidate for energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly refrigeration.
However, the role of microstructure when several external fields are applied
simultaneously or sequentially has been scarcely discussed in literature. Here,
we synthesized ternary Ni-Mn-In alloys by suction casting and arc melting and
analyzed the microstructural influence on the response to magnetic fields and
uniaxial stress. By combining SEM-EBSD and stress-strain data, a significant
effect of texture on the stress-induced martensitic transformation is revealed.
It is shown that a <001> texture can strongly reduce the critical
transformation stresses. The effect of grain size on the material failure is
demonstrated and its influence on the magnetic-field-induced transformation
dynamics is investigated. Temperature-stress and temperature-magnetic field
phase diagrams are established and single caloric performances are
characterized in terms of ${\Delta}{s_T}$ and ${\Delta}{T_{ad}}$. The cyclic
${\Delta}{T_{ad}}$ values are compared to the ones achieved in the multicaloric
exploiting-hysteresis cycle. It turns out that a suction-cast microstructure
and the combination of both stimuli enables outstanding caloric effects in
moderate external fields which can significantly exceed the single caloric
performances. In particular for Ni-Mn-In, the maximum cyclic effect in magnetic
fields of 1.9 T is increased by more than 200 % to -4.1 K when a moderate
sequential stress of 55 MPa is applied. Our results illustrate the crucial role
of microstructure for multicaloric cooling using Ni-Mn-based metamagnetic

individuals is asymptotically reduced and the number of individuals under PrEP

large Fock states, as well as the deleterious effects of linear dissipation.
Here, we introduce a new effect in the physics of nonlinear bosons, arising
from the interplay of dissipation and Kerr nonlinearity. In this effect, a
nonlinear resonance is dissipationless when it has a particular number of
quanta (e.g., photons) inside it, and lossy otherwise. This loss, which results
from nonlinear interference, leads to several new quantum statistical effects.
For example, it leads to spontaneous condensation of intensity noise, which may
enable generation of large Fock and extremely photon-number-squeezed states of
light. We also show how this effect has implications for new classes of
optoelectronic devices such as lasers, which can stabilize extremely low-noise
states in an equilibrium between gain and the nonlinear loss that we introduce.
Throughout the text, we present examples of systems that may realize these
effects. In one, we show how the nonlinear dissipation could lead to optical
Fock states of $n=1000$, while in another, we show how conventional laser
architectures could be used to generate macroscopic light ($>10^{12}$ photons)
with nearly 95% less noise than the standard quantum limit.

Lyrae stars have led to the discovery of additional frequencies showing a
characteristic period ratio of 0.60-0.65 with the main pulsation mode. In a
promising model proposed by Dziembowski (2016), these signals are suggested to
be due to the excitation of non-radial modes with degrees 7, 8 and 9 (Cepheids)
or 8 and 9 (RR Lyrae). Such modes usually have low amplitudes in photometric
data. Spectroscopic time series offer an unexplored and promising way forward.
We simulated time series of synthetic line profiles for a representative
first-overtone classical Cepheid model and added a low-amplitude non-radial
mode. We studied sets of spectra with dense sampling and without noise,
so-called 'perfect' cases, as well as more realistic samplings and
signal-to-noise levels. Besides the first-overtone mode and the non-radial
mode, also the harmonics of both modes and combination signals were often
detected, but a sufficiently high sampling and signal-to-noise ratio prove
essential. The amplitudes of the non-radial mode and its harmonic depend on the
azimuthal order $m$. The inclination is also an important factor determining
the detectability of the non-radial mode and/or its harmonic. We compared the
results obtained for the predicted high degrees with those for lower-degree
modes. Finally, we studied the sampling requirements for detecting the
non-radial mode. Our findings can be used to plan a spectroscopic observing

growth on high-redshift galaxies, both in terms of the observed UV luminosity

of AGN to the total galaxy UV luminosity as a function of stellar mass and
redshift. We find that for $M_{UV} < -24$ mag and $z \approx 5 - 6$ the
galaxies for which the black hole UV luminosity outshines the stellar UV
emission become the majority, and we estimate their duty cycle. Secondly, we
study the evolution of the AGN and stellar luminosity functions (LFs), finding
that it is driven both by changes in their characteristic luminosities (i.e.
evolution of the intrinsic brightness of galaxies) and in their normalizations
(i.e. evolution of the number densities of galaxies), depending on the
luminosity range considered. Finally, we follow the mass assembly history for
three different halo mass bins, finding that the magnitude of AGN-driven
outflows depends on the host halo mass. We show that AGN feedback is most
effective when the energy emitted by the accreting black hole is approximately
$1\%$ of the halo binding energy, and that this condition is met in galaxies in
halos with $M_h \sim 10^{11.75} M_\odot$ at $z=4$. In such cases, AGN feedback
can drive outflows that are up to 100 times more energetic than SN-driven
outflows, and the star formation rate is a factor of three lower than for

behavior be predicted? We show that RNN and transformer language models exhibit
structured, consistent generalization in out-of-distribution contexts. We begin
by introducing two idealized models of generalization in next-word prediction:
a local context model in which generalization is consistent with the last word
observed, and a global context model in which generalization is consistent with
the global structure of the input. In experiments in English, Finnish,
Mandarin, and random regular languages, we demonstrate that neural language
models interpolate between these two forms of generalization: their predictions
are well-approximated by a log-linear combination of local and global
predictive distributions. We then show that, in some languages, noise mediates
the two forms of generalization: noise applied to input tokens encourages
global generalization, while noise in history representations encourages local
generalization. Finally, we offer a preliminary theoretical explanation of
these results by proving that the observed interpolation behavior is expected
in log-linear models with a particular feature correlation structure. These
results help explain the effectiveness of two popular regularization schemes
and show that aspects of sequence model generalization can be understood and
controlled.

""hothouse"" climate states, but little is known about how the atmosphere behaves
in such states. One distinguishing characteristic of hothouse climates is that
they feature lower-tropospheric radiative heating, rather than cooling, due to
the closing of the water vapor infrared window regions. Previous work has
suggested that this could lead to temperature inversions and significant
changes in cloud cover, but no previous modeling of the hothouse regime has
resolved convective-scale turbulent air motions and cloud cover directly, thus
leaving many questions about hothouse radiative heating unanswered. Here, we
conduct simulations that explicitly resolve convection and find that
lower-tropospheric radiative heating in hothouse climates causes the hydrologic
cycle to shift from a quasi-steady regime to a ""relaxation oscillator"" regime,
in which precipitation occurs in short and intense outbursts separated by
multi-day dry spells. The transition to the oscillatory regime is accompanied
by strongly enhanced local precipitation fluxes, a significant increase in
cloud cover, and a transiently positive (unstable) climate feedback parameter.
Our results indicate that hothouse climates may feature a novel form of

Specifically, we analyze a trade-off between changes in average energy and
changes in weight's variance, where work is extracted from the coherent and
incoherent ergotropy of the system. Primarily, we reveal that the extraction of
positive coherent ergotropy can be accompanied by the reduction of work
fluctuations (quantified by a variance loss) by utilizing the non-classical
states of a work reservoir. On the other hand, we derive a
fluctuation-decoherence relation for a quantum weight, defining a lower bound
of its energy dispersion via a dumping function of the coherent contribution to
the system's ergotropy. Specifically, it reveals that unlocking ergotropy from
coherences results in high fluctuations, which diverge when the total coherent
energy is unlocked. The proposed autonomous protocol of work extraction shows a
significant difference between extracting coherent and incoherent ergotropy:
The former can decrease the variance, but its absolute value diverges if more
and more energy is extracted, whereas for the latter, the gain is always
non-negative, but a total (incoherent) ergotropy can be extracted with finite
work fluctuations. Furthermore, we present the framework in terms of the
introduced quasi-probability distribution, which has a physical interpretation
of its cumulants, is free from the invasive nature of measurements, and reduces
to the two-point measurement scheme (TPM) for incoherent states. Finally, we
analytically solve the work-variance trade-off for a qubit, explicitly

compressive heating is dominant over the incompressive heating rate in all

derived from analytic models based on the mean free path (MFP) approximation
and compare them to the results of $N$-body simulations. Our goal is to
identify the cluster conditions under which the MFP approximation remains
valid. Adopting a range of particle numbers ($100\leq N\leq5000$) and different
combinations of particle masses and radii, we explore three different channels
leading to stellar collisions, all of which are expected to occur in realistic
stellar environments. At high densities, binaries form from isolated three-body
interactions of single stars. Hence, we consider collisions between single
stars and collisions involving binary stars, after they form in our
simulations. For the latter, we consider two channels for mergers, namely
direct stellar collisions during chaotic single-binary interactions and
perturbation-driven mergers of binaries due to random walks in eccentricity
approaching unity. In the densest systems considered here, a very massive
object is formed at the cluster centre, causing local stellar orbits to become
increasingly Keplerian and the assumptions going into our analytic model to
break down. Before reaching this limit, we obtain excellent agreement between
our theoretical predictions and the simulations: the analytic rates are
typically accurate to within one standard deviation for the entire parameter
space considered here, but the agreement is best for short integration times.
Our results have direct implications for blue straggler formation in dense star
clusters, and stellar mergers in galactic nuclei hosting massive black holes.

propose to use the model-agnostic instance attribution methods from
Interpretable Machine Learning, which identify the training instances that are
most influential to a neural model's predictions on test instances. We use
these influential triples as adversarial deletions. We further propose a
heuristic method to replace one of the two entities in each influential triple

improve the MRR degradation due to the attacks by up to 62% over the baselines.

whose atmospheric compositions record the infall of formerly orbiting planetary
objects--examining cases where Mg, Si, Ca and Fe are measured with precision.
We find no evidence for continental crust, or other crust types, even after

are discernible: one case is Earth like, but most are exotic in composition and
mineralogy. Because these exoplanets exceed the compositional spread of >4,000
nearby main sequence stars, their unique silicate compositions are unlikely to
reflect variations in parent star compositions. Instead, polluted white dwarfs
reveal greater planetary variety in our solar neighborhood than currently

nonminimum-uncertainty-product (stretched) Gaussian wave packets in the
framework of Caldeira-Leggett formalism and under the presence of a linear
potential is studied. As a dimensionless measure of decoherence, purity, a
quantity appearing in the definition of the {\it linear entropy}, is studied
taking into account the role of the stretching parameter. Special emphasis is
on the open dynamics of the well-known cat states and bosons and fermions
compared to distinguishable particles. For the cat state, while the stretching
parameter speeds up the decoherence, the external linear potential strength
does not affect the decoherence time; only the interference pattern is shifted.
Furthermore, the interference pattern is not observed for
minimum-uncertainty-product-Gaussian wave packets in the momentum space.
Concerning bosons and fermions, the question we have addressed is how the
symmetry of the wave functions of indistinguishable particles is manifested in
the decoherence process, which is understood here as the loss of being
indistinguishable due to the gradual emergence of classical statistics with
time. We have observed that the initial bunching and anti-bunching character of
bosons and fermions, respectively, in the momentum space are not preserved as a
function of the environmental parameters, temperature and damping constant.
However, fermionic distributions are slightly broader than the distinguishable
ones and these similar to the bosonic distributions. This general behavior
could be interpreted as a residual reminder of the symmetry of the wave
functions in the momentum space for this open dynamics.

increasingly used to assist in small molecule identification; however,
questions remain regarding the extent of its true utility in contributing to
such identifications, especially given its correlation with mass. To
investigate the contribution of CCS to uniqueness within a given library, we
measured its discriminatory capacity as a function of error in CCS values (from
measurement or prediction), CCS variance, parent mass, mass error, and/or
reference database size using a multi-directional grid search. While
experimental CCS databases exist, they are currently small; thus, we used a CCS
prediction tool, DarkChem, to provide theoretical CCS values for use in this
study. These predicted CCS values were then modified to mirror experimental
variance. By augmenting our search within a library based on mass alone with
CCS at a variety of accuracies, we found that, (i) the use of multiple adducts
(i.e. alternative ionized forms of the same parent compound) for the same
molecule, compared to using a single adduct, greatly improves specificity and
(ii) even a single CCS leads to a significant specificity boost when low CCS
error (e.g. 1% composite error) can be achieved. Based on these results, we
recommend using multiple adducts to build up evidence of presence, as each
adduct supplies additional information per dimension. Additionally, the utility
of ion mobility spectrometry when coupled with mass spectrometry should still
be considered, regardless of whether CCS is considered as an identification
metric, due to advantages such as increased peak resolution, sensitivity (e.g.
from reducing load on the detector at any given time), improvements in
data-independent MS/MS spectra acquisition, and cleaner tandem mass spectral

molecular universe and allow greater insight into complex biological and

measuring the metabolome, such as NMR spectroscopy, and separation techniques
coupled with mass spectrometry, such as LC-IMS-MS, have risen to this challenge
by yielding rich experimental data that can be queried by cross-reference with
similar information for known standards in reference libraries. Confident
identification of molecules in metabolomics studies, though, is often limited
by the diversity of available data across chemical space, the unavailability of
authentic reference standards, and the corresponding lack of comprehensiveness
of standard reference libraries. The In Silico Chemical Library Engine (ISiCLE)
addresses theses hindrances by providing a first-principles, cheminformatics
pipeline that yields collisional cross section (CCS) values for any given
molecule and without the need for training data. In this program, chemical
identifiers undergo MD simulations, quantum chemical transformations, and ion
mobility calculations for the generation of predicted CCS values. Here, we
present a new module for ISiCLE that addresses the sensitivity of CCS
predictions to ionization site location. An update to adduct creation methods
is proposed concerning a transition from pKa and pKb led predictions to a
Gibb's free energy (GFE) based determinacy of true ionization site location. A
validation set of experimentally confirmed molecular protonation sites was
assembled from literature and cross-referenced with the respective pKb
predicted locations and GFE values for all potential ionization site
placements. Upon evaluation of the two methods, the lowest GFE value was found
to predict the true ionization site location with 100% accuracy while pKb had
less accuracy.

exponentially with distance from the step. The step bound states have linear

was to work on mathematically interesting physical problems and he thought that

divided the state-space of a toy model field theory into continuous slices by

satisfy 1) user incentive compatibility (UIC), i.e., truthful bidding should be
a user's dominant strategy; 2) miner incentive compatibility (MIC), i.e., the
miner's dominant strategy is to faithfully implement the prescribed mechanism;

fairly shallow. This paper initiates the study of forecast aggregation in a
context where experts' knowledge is chosen adversarially from a broad class of
information structures. While in full generality it is impossible to achieve a
nontrivial performance guarantee, we show that doing so is possible under a
condition on the experts' information structure that we call \emph{projective

substitutes: that there are diminishing marginal returns to learning the
experts' signals. We show that under the projective substitutes condition,
taking the average of the experts' forecasts improves substantially upon the
strategy of trusting a random expert. We then consider a more permissive
setting, in which the aggregator has access to the prior. We show that by
averaging the experts' forecasts and then \emph{extremizing} the average by
moving it away from the prior by a constant factor, the aggregator's
performance guarantee is substantially better than is possible without
knowledge of the prior. Our results give a theoretical grounding to past

simplified by boundary estimation, that is, providing tight boundaries of cost
functions. By feeding a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model with data
composed of known boundaries and extracted features of COPs, it is possible to
train the model to estimate boundaries of a new COP instance. In this paper, we
first give an overview of the existing body of knowledge on ML for Constraint
Programming (CP) which learns from problem instances. Second, we introduce a
boundary estimation framework that is applied as a tool to support a CP solver.
Within this framework, different ML models are discussed and evaluated
regarding their suitability for boundary estimation, and countermeasures to
avoid unfeasible estimations that avoid the solver to find an optimal solution
are shown. Third, we present an experimental study with distinct CP solvers on
seven COPs. Our results show that near-optimal boundaries can be learned for
these COPs with only little overhead. These estimated boundaries reduce the
objective domain size by 60-88% and can help the solver to find near-optimal
solutions early during search.

manifold $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}\times\mathbb{T}^2$ and with momentum operator in the
compact spatial dimension coupled through a purely imaginary chemical potential
is computed. It is modular covariant and admits a simple expression in terms of
a real analytic SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Eisenstein series with $s=(d+1)/2$.
Different techniques for computing the partition function illustrate
complementary aspects of the Eisenstein series: the functional approach gives
its series representation, the operator approach yields its Fourier series,
while the proper time/heat kernel/world-line approach shows that it is the
Mellin transform of a Riemann theta function. High/low temperature duality is
generalized to the case of a non-vanishing chemical potential. By clarifying
the dependence of the partition function on the geometry of the torus, we
discuss how modular covariance is a consequence of full SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$
invariance. When the spacetime manifold is
$\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{T}^{q+1}$, the partition function is given in terms
of a SL$(q+1,\mathbb{Z})$ Eisenstein series again with $s=(d+1)/2$. In this
case, we obtain the high/low temperature duality through a suitably adapted
dual parametrization of the lattice defining the torus. On $\mathbb{T}^{d+1}$,
the computation is more subtle. An additional divergence leads to an harmonic

methods for producing approximate solutions for the maximum cut problem and its
weighted version, which are based on relaxations to local quantum Hamiltonians.
These relaxations are defined through commutative maps, which in turn are
constructed borrowing ideas from quantum random access codes. We establish
relations between the spectra of the relaxed Hamiltonians and optimal cuts of
the original problems, via two quantum rounding protocols. The first one is
based on projections to random magic states. It produces average cuts that
approximate the optimal one by a factor of least 0.555 or 0.625, depending on
the relaxation chosen, if given access to a quantum state with energy between
the optimal classical cut and the maximal relaxed energy. The second rounding
protocol is deterministic and it is based on estimation of Pauli observables.
The proposed quantum relaxations inherit memory compression from quantum random
access codes, which allowed us to test the performances of the methods
presented for 3-regular random graphs and a design problem motivated by
industry for sizes up to 40 nodes, on superconducting quantum processors.

  $\bullet$ Matrix Spencer for Low-Rank Matrices. If the matrices satisfy

efficiently find a coloring $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ with $\|\sum_{i=1}^n x_i A_i

structure. Besides, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to exactly recover
the community structure up to the threshold. The proposed algorithm consists of
a spectral algorithm plus a refinement step. It is also interesting to study
whether a single spectral algorithm without refinement achieves the threshold.
To this end, we also explore the semi-definite relaxation algorithm and analyze
its performance.

Here, we propose EditGAN, a novel method for high quality, high precision

detailed part segmentation masks, e.g., drawing a new mask for the headlight of

a scalable tool for editing. Specifically, we embed an image into the GAN
latent space and perform conditional latent code optimization according to the
segmentation edit, which effectively also modifies the image. To amortize
optimization, we find editing vectors in latent space that realize the edits.
The framework allows us to learn an arbitrary number of editing vectors, which
can then be directly applied on other images at interactive rates. We
experimentally show that EditGAN can manipulate images with an unprecedented
level of detail and freedom, while preserving full image quality.We can also
easily combine multiple edits and perform plausible edits beyond EditGAN

assistance from a human can provide the required input for the vehicle to
continue its operation. Typical sensors used in autonomous vehicles include
camera and lidar sensors. Due to the massive volume of sensor data that must be
sent in real-time, highly efficient data compression is elementary to prevent
an overload of network infrastructure. Sensor data compression using deep
generative neural networks has been shown to outperform traditional compression
approaches for both image and lidar data, regarding compression rate as well as
reconstruction quality. However, there is a lack of research about the
performance of generative-neural-network-based compression algorithms for
remote assistance. In order to gain insights into the feasibility of deep
generative models for usage in remote assistance, we evaluate state-of-the-art
algorithms regarding their applicability and identify potential weaknesses.
Further, we implement an online pipeline for processing sensor data and
demonstrate its performance for remote assistance using the CARLA simulator.

  Relocation and Pricing Decisions","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2105.13461",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale ride-hailing systems often combine real-time routing at the
individual request level with a macroscopic Model Predictive Control (MPC)
optimization for dynamic pricing and vehicle relocation. The MPC relies on a
demand forecast and optimizes over a longer time horizon to compensate for the
myopic nature of the routing optimization. However, the longer horizon
increases computational complexity and forces the MPC to operate at coarser
spatial-temporal granularity, degrading the quality of its decisions. This
paper addresses these computational challenges by learning the MPC
optimization. The resulting machine-learning model then serves as the
optimization proxy and predicts its optimal solutions. This makes it possible
to use the MPC at higher spatial-temporal fidelity, since the optimizations can
be solved and learned offline. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach improves quality of service on challenging instances from the New York

providing discrete language inputs, humans are given a low-dimensional
controller $-$ e.g., a 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) joystick that can move
left/right and up/down $-$ for operating the robot. LILA learns to use language
to modulate this controller, providing users with a language-informed control
space: given an instruction like ""place the cereal bowl on the tray,"" LILA may
learn a 2-DoF space where one dimension controls the distance from the robot's
end-effector to the bowl, and the other dimension controls the robot's
end-effector pose relative to the grasp point on the bowl. We evaluate LILA
with real-world user studies, where users can provide a language instruction
while operating a 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda Arm to complete a series of complex

The linear controller such as PI or PID is matured and extensively used by the
power electronics industry, but their performance is not optimal as system
parameters are changed. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) based
voltage control strategy is proposed for the DC-DC boost converter. In this
paper, the model predictive control (MPC) is used as an expert, which provides
the data to train the proposed ANN. As ANN is tuned finely, then it is utilized
directly to control the step-up DC converter. The main advantage of the ANN is
that the neural network system identification decreases the inaccuracy of the
system model even with inaccurate parameters and has less computational burden
compared to MPC due to its parallel structure. To validate the performance of
the proposed ANN, extensive MATLAB/Simulink simulations are carried out. The
simulation results show that the ANN-based control strategy has better
performance under different loading conditions comparison to the PI controller.
The accuracy of the trained ANN model is about 97%, which makes it suitable to
be used for DC microgrid applications.

From identification of flux patches and magnetofrictional simulations, we show

features. They also live longer and carry more flux per feature. Both types of
flux concentrations appear uniformly over the solar surface. However, we argue
that bipolar features truly represent the emergence of new flux on the solar
surface, while unipolar features seem to be formed by coalescence of background
flux. Magnetic bipoles appear at a faster rate than unipolar features (68 as
opposed to 55 Mx cm$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$), and provide about 70% of the total

baselines on three COD datasets and five medical image segmentation datasets.
Especially, compared with the existing top-1 model SINet, ERRNet significantly

  Flaws & Towards Better Practices","8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted WebConf 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised graph representation learning is critical to a wide range of
applications where labels may be scarce or expensive to procure. Contrastive
learning (CL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for such settings and the
state-of-the-art in unsupervised visual representation learning. Recent work
attributes the success of visual CL to use of task-relevant augmentations and
large, diverse datasets. Interestingly, graph CL frameworks report strong
performance despite using orders of magnitude smaller datasets and employing
domain-agnostic graph augmentations (DAGAs). Motivated by this discrepancy, we
probe the quality of representations learnt by popular graph CL frameworks
using DAGAs. We find that DAGAs can destroy task-relevant information and harm
the model's ability to learn discriminative representations. On small benchmark
datasets, we show the inductive bias of graph neural networks can significantly
compensate for this weak discriminability. Based on our findings, we propose
several sanity checks that enable practitioners to quickly assess the quality
of their model's learned representations. We further propose a broad strategy
for designing task-aware augmentations that are amenable to graph CL and
demonstrate its efficacy on two large-scale, complex graph applications. For
example, in graph-based document classification, we show task-aware
augmentations improve accuracy up to 20%.

Part parsing, where a part-parsing model is proposed to recognize human parts
from detected person images; and 3) Action parsing, where a multi-modal action

formulating a new scattering approach, we show that the topology of both the
QSH and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TAIs can be manifested by the accumulated spin rotations

illustrate the trivialization of a disordered QSH phase with an even integer

received great attention in the last few years. Various constructions have been
proposed in literatures. The main focus of this topic is to construct MR LRCs
over small fields. An $(N=nr,r,h,\Gd)$-MR LRC is a linear code over finite
field $\F_\ell$ of length $N$, whose codeword symbols are partitioned into $n$
local groups each of size $r$. Each local group can repair any $\Gd$ erasure
errors and there are further $h$ global parity checks to provide fault
tolerance from more global erasure patterns.
  MR LRCs deployed in practice have a small number of global parities such as
$h=O(1)$. In this parameter setting, all previous constructions require the
field size $\ell =\Omega_h (N^{h-1-o(1)})$. It remains challenging to improve
this bound. In this paper, via subspace direct sum systems, we present a
construction of MR LRC with the field size $\ell= O(N^{h-2+\frac1{h-1}-o(1)})$.
In particular, for the most interesting cases where $h=2,3$, we improve
previous constructions by either reducing field size or removing constraints.
In addition, we also offer some constructions of MR LRCs for larger global
parity $h$ that have field size incomparable with known upper bounds. The main
techniques used in this paper is through subspace direct sum systems that we
introduce. Interestingly, subspace direct sum systems are actually equivalent
to $\F_q$-linear codes over extension fields. Based on various constructions of
subspace direct sum systems, we are able to construct several classes of MR
LRCs.

transmission delays and zero packet loss emerge, e.g., AR, industrial
automation, and smart grid. In this circumstance, time-sensitive networking
(TSN) is proposed, which addresses the deterministic transmission in the local
area networks. Nevertheless, TSN is essentially a Layer 2 technique, which
cannot provide deterministic transmission on a large geographic area. To solve
this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical network for the end-to-end
deterministic transmission. In the proposed network, we leverage CQF (i.e., one
of the most efficient TSN mechanisms) in the access networks which aggregates
the traffic from end-devices. Meanwhile, in the core network, we exploit the
DIP (i.e., a well-known deterministic networking mechanism for backbone
networks) for long-distance deterministic transmission. We design the cycle
alignment mechanism to enable seamless and deterministic transmission among
hierarchical networks. A joint schedule is also formulated, which introduces
the traffic shaping at the network edge to maximize the network throughput.
Experimental simulations show that the proposed network can achieve end-to-end
deterministic transmission, even in the highly-load scenarios.

based on what we call restricted modified log-Sobolev inequalities. Modified
log-Sobolev inequalities (MLSI) quantify the rate of relative entropy
contraction for the Markov operator, and are notoriously difficult to
establish. However, infinitesimally close to stationarity, entropy contraction
becomes equivalent to variance contraction, a.k.a. a Poincare inequality, which
is significantly easier to establish through, e.g., spectral analysis.
Motivated by this observation, we study restricted modified log-Sobolev
inequalities that guarantee entropy contraction not for all starting
distributions, but for those in a large neighborhood of the stationary
distribution. We show how to sample from the hardcore and Ising models on
$n$-node graphs that have a constant $\delta$ relative gap to the
tree-uniqueness threshold, in nearly-linear time $\widetilde O_{\delta}(n)$.
Notably, our bound does not depend on the maximum degree $\Delta$, and is
therefore optimal even for high-degree graphs. This improves on prior mixing
time bounds of $\widetilde O_{\delta, \Delta}(n)$ and $\widetilde
O_{\delta}(n^2)$, established via (non-restricted) modified log-Sobolev and
Poincare inequalities respectively. We further show that optimal concentration
inequalities can still be achieved from the restricted form of modified
log-Sobolev inequalities. To establish restricted entropy contraction, we
extend the entropic independence framework of Anari, Jain, Koehler, Pham, and
Vuong to the setting of distributions that are spectrally independent under a
restricted set of external fields. We also develop an orthogonal trick that
might be of independent interest: utilizing Bernoulli factories we show how to
implement Glauber dynamics updates on high-degree graphs in $O(1)$ time,
assuming standard adjacency array representation of the graph.

achieving resolution below the array's diffraction limit, known as
super-resolution imaging. To this end, we have developed a new learning-based
approach for radio interferometric imaging, leveraging recent advances in the
classical computer vision problems of single-image super-resolution (SISR) and
deconvolution. We have developed and trained a high dynamic range residual

Super-resolution on DSA-2000 will allow us to measure the shapes and

long been studied and its profound and complicated results appear in different
forms in a wide range of literatures. As a result, characterizing the known and
unknown results can sometimes be difficult. The aim of this article is to
provide a unified and geometric view of strong duality of COPs for the known
results. For our framework, we employ a COP minimizing a linear function in a
vector variable $x$ subject to a single hyperplane constraint $x \in H$ and two
cone constraints $x \in K_1$, $x \in K_2$. It can be identically reformulated
as a simpler COP with the single hyperplane constraint $x \in H$ and the single
cone constraint $x \in K_1 \cap K_2$. This simple COP and its dual as well as
their duality relation can be represented geometrically, and they have no
duality gap without any constraint qualification. The dual of the original
target COP is equivalent to the dual of the reformulated COP if the Minkowski
sum of the duals of the two cones $K_1$ and $K_2$ is closed or if the dual of
the reformulated COP satisfies a certain Slater condition. Thus, these two
conditions make it possible to transfer all duality results, including the
existence and/or boundedness of optimal solutions, on the reformulated COP to
the ones on the original target COP, and further to the ones on a standard

we propose a novel collaborative graph neural networks contrastive learning

Features observed from different views act as the graph augmentation for
contrastive learning between graph encoders, avoiding any perturbation to
guarantee the invariance. CGCL is capable of handling both graph-level and

These mainly involve the use of anti-seizure drugs for controlling seizures.
But in 70% of cases, these drugs are not effective, and surgery is the only
solution when the condition worsens. So patients need to take care of
themselves while having a seizure and be safe. Wearable electroencephalogram

it can predict any seizure in advance on-site. This has resulted in a sudden
increase in demand for effective and efficient seizure prediction and diagnosis
systems. A novel approach to epileptic seizure prediction and diagnosis system
EpilNet is proposed in the present paper. It is a one-dimensional (1D)

form analysis is carried out for the newly developed equation, which results in
the Benney-Roskes-Davey-Stewartson (BRDS) system governing the coupled
evolution of the envelope of a carrier wave and the wave-induced mean flow.
Numerical results show three types of free solitary waves in the
Benney-Luke-type equation: plane solitary wave, lump (i.e., fully localized
traveling waves in three dimensions), and transversally periodic solitary wave,
and they are counterparts of the BRDS solutions. They are linked together by a
dimension-breaking bifurcation where plane solitary waves and lumps can be
viewed as two limiting cases, and transversally periodic solitary waves serve
as intermediate states. The stability and interaction of solitary waves are
investigated via a numerical time integration of the Benney-Luke-type equation.
For a localized load moving on the elastic sheet with a constant speed, it is
found that there exists a transcritical regime of forcing speed for which there
are no steady solutions. Instead, periodic shedding of lumps can be observed if
the forcing moves at speed in this range.

unknown states $\rho,\sigma$ (acting on $\mathbb{C}^{d}$) respectively. Their
goal is to estimate $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho\sigma)$ up to additive error
$\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, using local quantum operations and classical
communication. In the weakest setting where only non-adaptive single-copy
measurements and simultaneous message passing are allowed, we show that
$k=O(\max\{1/\varepsilon^2,\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\})$ copies suffice. This
achieves a savings compared to full tomography which takes $\Omega(d^3)$ copies

complexity must be at least
$\Omega(\max\{1/\varepsilon^2,\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\})$, even in the strongest
setting where adaptive multi-copy measurements and arbitrary rounds of

tomography, for sample-efficiently learning the properties of a single system,

contrasts with single system quantum property testing, which often demonstrate
exponential separations in sample complexity with single and multi-copy

negative) if the top face of the resulting gadget seen from the front side lies
above (resp. below) the ambient paper. For any possible set of angle
parameters, we obtained an infinite number of positive 3D gadgets in our second
paper, while we obtained a unique negative 3D gadget by our third construction
in our third paper. In this paper we present a geometric (ruler and compass)
construction of our third negative 3D gadgets, while the construction presented
in our third paper was a numerical one using a rather complicated formula.
Also, we prove that there exists a unique positive 3D gadget corresponding to
each of our third negative ones. Thus we obtain a canonical pair of a positive
and a negative 3D gadget. The proof is based on a geometric redefinition of the
critical angles which we introduced in constructing our positive 3D gadgets.
This redefinition also enables us to give a simplified proof of the existence
theorem of our positive 3D gadgets in our second paper. As an application, we
can construct a positive and a negative extrusion from a common crease pattern
by using the canonical counterparts, as long as there arise no interferences.

graphics. In contrast to raster graphics which are widely used in image
recognition, vector graphics can be scaled up or down into any resolution
without aliasing or information loss, due to the analytic representation of the
primitives in the document. Furthermore, vector graphics are able to give extra
structural information on how low-level elements group together to form high
level shapes or structures. These merits of graphic vectors have not been fully
leveraged in existing methods. To explore this data format, we target on the
fundamental recognition tasks: object localization and classification. We
propose an efficient CNN-free pipeline that does not render the graphic into
pixels (i.e. rasterization), and takes textual document of the vector graphics
as input, called YOLaT (You Only Look at Text). YOLaT builds multi-graphs to
model the structural and spatial information in vector graphics, and a
dual-stream graph neural network is proposed to detect objects from the graph.
Our experiments show that by directly operating on vector graphics, YOLaT
out-performs raster-graphic based object detection baselines in terms of both
average precision and efficiency.

powerful tools to model sequential data. In the mechanism, a forget gate, which
was introduced to control information flow in a hidden state in the RNN, has
recently been re-interpreted as a representative of the time scale of the
state, i.e., a measure how long the RNN retains information on inputs. On the
basis of this interpretation, several parameter initialization methods to
exploit prior knowledge on temporal dependencies in data have been proposed to
improve learnability. However, the interpretation relies on various unrealistic
assumptions, such as that there are no inputs after a certain time point. In
this work, we reconsider this interpretation of the forget gate in a more
realistic setting. We first generalize the existing theory on gated RNNs so
that we can consider the case where inputs are successively given. We then
argue that the interpretation of a forget gate as a temporal representation is
valid when the gradient of loss with respect to the state decreases
exponentially as time goes back. We empirically demonstrate that existing RNNs
satisfy this gradient condition at the initial training phase on several tasks,
which is in good agreement with previous initialization methods. On the basis
of this finding, we propose an approach to construct new RNNs that can
represent a longer time scale than conventional models, which will improve the
learnability for long-term sequential data. We verify the effectiveness of our
method by experiments with real-world datasets.

due to its success in autonomous driving systems. However, the poor performance
of concerned foreground targets, e.g., traffic lights and poles, still limits
its further practical applications. In urban scenes, foreground targets are
always concealed in their surrounding stuff because of the special camera
position and 3D perspective projection. What's worse, it exacerbates the
unbalance between foreground and background classes in high-level features due
to the continuous expansion of the reception field. We call it Feature
Camouflage. In this paper, we present a novel add-on module, named Feature
Balance Network (FBNet), to eliminate the feature camouflage in urban-scene
segmentation. FBNet consists of two key components, i.e., Block-wise BCE(BwBCE)
and Dual Feature Modulator(DFM). BwBCE serves as an auxiliary loss to ensure
uniform gradients for foreground classes and their surroundings during
backpropagation. At the same time, DFM intends to enhance the deep
representation of foreground classes in high-level features adaptively under
the supervision of BwBCE. These two modules facilitate each other as a whole to
ease feature camouflage effectively. Our proposed method achieves a new

systems to benefit from higher performance of SSDs while minimizing the overall
cost. While conventional caching algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU)
provide high hit ratio in processors, due to the highly random behavior of
Input/Output (I/O) workloads, they hardly provide the required performance
level for storage systems. In addition to poor performance, inefficient
algorithms also shorten SSD lifetime with unnecessary cache replacements. Such
shortcomings motivate us to benefit from more complex non-linear algorithms to

propose RC-RNN, the first reconfigurable SSD-based cache architecture for

higher cache performance while improving SSD lifetime. RC-RNN attempts to learn
characteristics of the running workload to predict its behavior and then uses
the collected information to identify performance-critical data pages to fetch
into the cache. Experimental results show that RC-RNN characterizes workloads
with an accuracy up to 94.6% for SNIA I/O workloads. RC-RNN can perform
similarly to the optimal cache algorithm by an accuracy of 95% on average, and

processes consider applying blur, noise, and downsampling (typicallybicubic
downsampling) on high-resolution (HR) images to synthesize low-resolution (LR)
counterparts. However, few works on degradation modelling have taken the
physical aspects of the optical imaging system intoconsideration. In this
paper, we analyze the imaging system optically andexploit the characteristics
of the real-world LR-HR pairs in the spatial frequency domain. We formulate a
real-world physics-inspired degradationmodel by considering
bothopticsandsensordegradation; The physical degradation of an imaging system
is modelled as a low-pass filter, whose cut-off frequency is dictated by the
object distance, the focal length of thelens, and the pixel size of the image
sensor. In particular, we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to learn the cutoff frequency of real-world degradation process. The learned
network is then applied to synthesize LR images from unpaired HR images. The
synthetic HR-LR image pairs are later used to train an SISR network. We
evaluatethe effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed
degradation model on real-world images captured by different imaging systems.
Experimental results showcase that the SISR network trained by using our
synthetic data performs favorably against the network using the traditional
degradation model. Moreover, our results are comparable to that obtained by the
same network trained by using real-world LR-HR pairs, which are challenging to
obtain in real scenes.

\sigma^k(u)dw_t^k,\quad (t,x)\in(0,\infty)\times\bR^d; \quad u(0,\cdot) = u_0,
$$ where $\lambda>0$, the set $\{ w_t^k,k=1,2,\dots \}$ is a set of
one-dimensional independent Wiener processes, and the function $u_0 =
u_0(\omega,x)$ is a nonnegative random initial data. The coefficients
$a^{ij},b^i,c$ depend on $(\omega,t,x)$, and $\bar b^i$ depends on
$(\omega,t,x^1,\dots,x^{i-1},x^{i+1},\dots,x^d)$. The coefficients
$a^{ij},b^i,c,\bar{b}^i$ are uniformly bounded and twice continuous

Depending on the diffusion coefficient $\sigma^k(u)$, we consider two different

  (i) $\lambda\in(0,\infty)$ and $\sigma^k(u)$ has Lipschitz continuity and
linear growth in $u$,
  (ii) $\lambda,\lambda_0\in(0,1/d)$ and $\sigma^k(u) = \mu^k

\varepsilon}_{t,x}([0,T]\times\bR^d)\quad \forall T<\infty, $$ almost surely.
On the other hand, in the case of $(ii)$, if $\lambda,\lambda_0\in(0,1/d)$, for
$\varepsilon>0$ $$ u \in C^{\frac{1-(\lambda d) \vee (\lambda_0 d)}{2} -
\varepsilon,1-(\lambda d) \vee (\lambda_0 d) -
\varepsilon}_{t,x}([0,T]\times\bR^d)\quad \forall T<\infty $$ almost surely. It
should be noted that $\lambda$ can be any positive number and the solution
regularity is independent of nonlinear terms in case $(i)$. In case $(ii)$,
however, $\lambda,\lambda_0$ should satisfy $\lambda,\lambda_0\in(0,1/d)$ and
the regularities of the solution are affected by $\lambda,\lambda_0$ and $d$.

Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet
challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key
element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks
are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures
consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data

for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for

ineffective compared to a dynamic warden. However, dynamic wardens rely on
periodically changing rule sets and have their own limitations, since they do
not consider traffic specifics. We propose a novel adaptive warden strategy,
capable of selecting active normalization rules by taking into account the

increasing the number of packets required to perform a successful covert data

formed in the outskirt of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, left the star
as a stellar wind, and joined the presolar molecular cloud from which the solar
system formed. The Ru isotopes formed inside the star, moved to the stellar
surface during the AGB phase, and were locked into the SiC grains. Following
this scenario, we analyze the NuGrid data which provide the abundances of the
Ru isotopes in the stellar wind for a set of stars in a wide range of initial
masses and metallicities. We apply the C>O (carbon abundance larger than the
oxygen abundance) condition which is commonly adopted for the condition of the
SiC formation in the stellar wind. The NuGrid data confirm that SiC grains do
not form in the winds of massive stars. The isotopic compositions of Ru in the
winds of low-mass stars can explain measurements. We find that lower-mass stars
($1.65~M_\odot$ and $2~M_\odot$) with low metallicity (Z=0.0001) can explain
most of the measured isotopic compositions of Ru. We confirm that the abundance
of ${^{99}}$Ru inside the presolar grain includes the contribution from the
in-situ decay of ${^{99}}$Tc. We also verify our conclusion by comparing the

matters; radiation, dust, and dark matter, we study the massive scalar
superradiant scattering and the stability in the Kiselev spacetime.
Superradiance behavior is dependent on the intensity parameter of the
anisotropic matter $K$ in the Kiselev spacetime. By adopting the manifest of
low-frequency and low-mass for the scalar perturbation, we find $K<0$ enhances
the superradiance scattering within the broader frequency range, compared to
$K=0$ while $K>0$ suppresses within the narrower frequency range. As a result,
the radiation and dark matter around the rotating BH act as amplifier and
attenuator for the massive scalar superradiance, respectively. This is while
the dust has a twofold role because of admitting both signs of $K$. Through
stability analysis in the light of the BH bomb mechanism, we show in the
presence of dark matter, the instability regime of standard Kerr BH ($K=0$)
gets improved in favor of stabilization while the radiation and dust do not
affect it. In other words, by taking the dark matter fluid around BH into
account, we obtain a broader regime that allows the massive scalar field

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.11235",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Feature embedding learning and feature interaction modeling are two crucial
components of deep models for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. Most
existing deep CTR models suffer from the following three problems. First,
feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. Second,
all the feature interactions are modeled with an identical interaction
function. Third, in most existing models, different features share the same
embedding size which leads to memory inefficiency. To address these three
issues mentioned above, we propose Automatic Interaction Machine (AIM) with
three core components, namely, Feature Interaction Search (FIS), Interaction
Function Search (IFS) and Embedding Dimension Search (EDS), to select
significant feature interactions, appropriate interaction functions and
necessary embedding dimensions automatically in a unified framework.
Specifically, FIS component automatically identifies different orders of
essential feature interactions with useless ones pruned; IFS component selects
appropriate interaction functions for each individual feature interaction in a
learnable way; EDS component automatically searches proper embedding size for
each feature. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets validate the
superior performance of AIM. A three-week online A/B test in the recommendation
service of a mainstream app market shows that AIM improves DeepFM model by 4.4%
in terms of CTR.

  Action Localization","7 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-time and online action localization in a video is a critical yet highly
challenging problem. Accurate action localization requires the utilization of
both temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using
computationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream
architectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time,
online applications. To accomplish activity localization under highly
challenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient
key-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then
introduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action
tubes temporally in the presence of occlusions. Further, we eliminate the need
for a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information
into a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from
both types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using
a structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive
optical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight
end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP of 74.7% on the
challenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of 6.4% over
the previous best online methods. We also achieve state-of-the-art video-mAP
results compared to both online and offline methods. Moreover, our model
achieves a frame rate of 41.8 FPS, which is a 10.7% improvement over
contemporary real-time methods.

core - meaning and their contextual meaning using metaphor classifiers based on
neural networks. However, metaphorical expressions evolve over time due to
various reasons, such as cultural and societal impact. Metaphorical expressions
are known to co-evolve with language and literal word meanings, and even drive,
to some extent, this evolution. This poses the question of whether different,
possibly time-specific, representations of literal meanings may impact the
metaphor detection task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that examines the metaphor detection task with a detailed exploratory analysis
where different temporal and static word embeddings are used to account for
different representations of literal meanings. Our experimental analysis is
based on three popular benchmarks used for metaphor detection and word
embeddings extracted from different corpora and temporally aligned using
different state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that the usage of
different static word embedding methods does impact the metaphor detection task
and some temporal word embeddings slightly outperform static methods. However,
the results also suggest that temporal word embeddings may provide
representations of the core meaning of the metaphor even too close to their
contextual meaning, thus confusing the classifier. Overall, the interaction
between temporal language evolution and metaphor detection appears tiny in the
benchmark datasets used in our experiments. This suggests that future work for
the computational analysis of this important linguistic phenomenon should first
start by creating a new dataset where this interaction is better represented.

Adding an attractive component shifts the balance in favor of superconductivity
and the interplay of two flat bands further yields a remarkable enhancement of
superconductivity, well outside of known paradigms for 1D fermions.

of outflows from red supergiants are not well characterised. We used the Onsala
20m telescope to perform a spectral survey at 3mm and 4mm (68 - 116 GHz) of the
red supergiant NML Cyg, alongside the yellow hypergiant IRC+10420. Our
observations of NML Cyg were combined with complementary archival data to
enable a search for signatures of morphological complexity in the circumstellar
environment, using emission lines from 15 molecular species. The recovered
parameters imply the presence of three distinct, coherent and persistent
components, comprised of blue-shifted and red-shifted components, in addition
to an underlying outflow centred at the stellar systemic velocity. Furthermore,
to reproduce CO emission with three-dimensional radiative transfer models
required a spherical outflow with three superposed conical outflows, one
towards and one away from the observer, and one in the plane of the sky. These
components are higher in density than the spherical outflow by up to an order
of magnitude. We hence propose that NML Cyg's circumstellar environment
consists of a small number of high-density large-scale coherent outflows
embedded in a spherical wind. This would make the mass-loss history similar to
that of VY CMa, and distinct from mu Cep, where the outflow contains many
randomly distributed smaller clumps. A possible correlation between stellar
properties, outflow structures and content is critical in understanding the
evolution of massive stars and their environmental impact.

(EDL) buildup in a sodium chloride solution was measured experimentally
[Janssen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 166002 (2017)] and matched with
theoretical predictions from density functional theory and molecular dynamics
simulations [Glatzel et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 064901 (2021)]. In the latter,
it was found that steric interactions of ions with the electrode's walls, which
result in the so-called Stern layer, are sufficient to explain the experimental
results. As only symmetric ion sizes in a restricted primitive model were
examined, it is instructive to investigate systems of unequal ion sizes that
lead to modified Stern layers. In this work, we explore the impact of ion
asymmetry on the reversible heat production for each electrode separately. In
this context, we further study an extension of the primitive model where
hydration shells of ions can evade in the vicinity of electrode's walls. We
find a strong dependence on system parameters such as the particle sizes and
the total volume taken by particles. Here, we even found situations where one
electrode was heated and the other electrode was cooled at the same time during
charging, while, in sum, both electrodes together behaved very similarly to the
already mentioned experimental results. Thus, heat production should also be
measured in experiments for each electrode separately. By this, the importance
of certain ingredients that we proposed to model electrolytes could be
confirmed or ruled out experimentally, finally leading to a deeper
understanding of the physics of EDLs.

4.7 +/- 1.3% increase in the light yield compared to that at room temperature.
A significantly increased decay time is also observed at the low temperature.
The responses to nuclear recoil events are measured using neutrons from a 252Cf
source and compared to those to electron recoil events. The measured pulse
shape discrimination (PSD) power of the NaI(Tl) crystal at the low temperature
is found to be improved in the entire energy range studied because of the
increased light yield and the different scintillation characteristics. We also
find an approximately 9% increased quenching factor of alpha-induced events,
which is the light yield ratio of alpha recoil to electron recoil, at the low
temperature. This supports the possibility of an increased quenching factor of
the nuclear recoil events that are known to have similar processes of dark

stars burn hydrogen at their cores, first on the thermal and then on the
nuclear timescale. The nuclear timescale mass transfer leads to observable
counterparts: the semi-detached so-called massive Algol binaries. However,
comprehensive model predictions for these systems are sparse. We study them
using a large grid of ~10,000 detailed binary evolution models calculated with
the stellar evolution code MESA, covering initial donor masses between 10-40
M$_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods above 1.4 d, at a metallicity suitable
for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our models imply ~30, or ~3% of the
~1,000 core hydrogen burning O-star binaries in the LMC to be currently in the
semi-detached phase. Our donor models are up to 25-times more luminous than
single stars of identical mass and effective temperature, which agrees with the
observed Algols. A comparison of our models with the observed orbital periods
and mass ratios implies rather conservative mass transfer in some systems,
while very inefficient one in others. This is generally well reproduced by our
spin-dependent mass transfer algorithm, except for the lowest considered
masses. The observations reflect the slow increase of the surface nitrogen
enrichment of the donors during the semi-detached phase all the way to CNO
equilibrium. We also investigate the properties of our models after core
hydrogen depletion of the donor star, when these models correspond to
Wolf-Rayet/helium+OB star binaries. A dedicated spectroscopic survey of massive
Algol systems may allow to derive the dependence of the efficiency of thermal
timescale mass transfer on the binary parameters, as well as the efficiency of
semiconvective mixing in the stellar interior. This would be a crucial step
towards reliable binary models up to the formation of supernovae and compact
objects.

(ASR) of conversational speech. Furthermore, a novel audio-fusion mechanism is
introduced, which manages to fuse and utilize the acoustic embeddings of a
current utterance and the semantic content of its corresponding conversation
history in a cooperative way. To flesh out our ideas, we frame the ASR N-best
hypothesis rescoring task as a prediction problem, leveraging BERT, an iconic
pre-trained LM, as the ingredient vehicle to facilitate selection of the oracle
hypothesis from a given N-best hypothesis list. Empirical experiments conducted

the monolayers allows for two different types of alignment, in which the
momentum-direct interlayer transitions are either valley-conserving (R-type
alignment) or changing the valley index (H-type anti-alignment). Here, we study
the valley polarization dynamics of ILE in magnetic fields up to 30~Tesla by
time-resolved photoluminescence (PL). For all ILE types, we find a finite
initial PL circular degree of polarization ($DoP$) after unpolarized excitation
in applied magnetic fields. For ILE in H-type HS, we observe a systematic
increase of the PL $DoP$ with time in applied magnetic fields, which saturates
at values close to unity for the largest fields. By contrast, for ILE in R-type
HS, the PL $DoP$ shows a decrease and a zero crossing before saturating with
opposite polarization. This unintuitive behavior can be explained by a model
considering the different ILE states in H- and R-type HS and their selection
rules coupling PL helicity and valley polarization.

interactions between users and an online marketplace. The users are
sequentially presented with both recommendations and search results in the form
of ranked lists of items, called slates, from the marketplace. The dataset
includes the presented slates at each round, whether the user clicked on any of
these items and which item the user clicked on. Although the usage of exposure
data in recommender systems is growing, to our knowledge there is no open
large-scale recommender systems dataset that includes the slates of items
presented to the users at each interaction. As a result, most articles on
recommender systems do not utilize this exposure information. Instead, the
proposed models only depend on the user's click responses, and assume that the
user is exposed to all the items in the item universe at each step, often
called uniform candidate sampling. This is an incomplete assumption, as it
takes into account items the user might not have been exposed to. This way
items might be incorrectly considered as not of interest to the user. Taking
into account the actually shown slates allows the models to use a more natural
likelihood, based on the click probability given the exposure set of items, as
is prevalent in the bandit and reinforcement learning literature.
\cite{Eide2021DynamicSampling} shows that likelihoods based on uniform
candidate sampling (and similar assumptions) are implicitly assuming that the
platform only shows the most relevant items to the user. This causes the
recommender system to implicitly reinforce feedback loops and to be biased
towards previously exposed items to the user.

multiple computational devices into a decentralized system, has become a
promising paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning. This paper studies
vertical federated learning (VFL), which tackles the scenarios where
collaborating organizations share the same set of users but disjoint features.
Contemporary VFL methods are mainly used in static scenarios where the active
party and the passive party have all the data from the beginning and will not
change. However, the data in real life often changes dynamically. To alleviate
this problem, we propose a new vertical federation learning method, DVFL, which
adapts to dynamic data distribution changes through knowledge distillation. In
DVFL, most of the computations are held locally to improve data security and
model efficiency. Our extensive experimental results show that DVFL can not
only obtain results close to existing VFL methods in static scenes, but also
adapt to changes in data distribution in dynamic scenarios.

benefit hugely from stutter-insensitivity, using a diverse set of reduction

due to the use of the neXt operator of LTL or to some form of counting in the
logic, are not covered by these techniques in general. We propose in this paper
to study a weaker property than stutter-insensitivity. In a stutter insensitive
language both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change its
acceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this
equivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We
define a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than
a word in the language must also belong to the language. A lengthening
insensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then
introduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny
lengthening insensitive properties while working with a reduction of a system.
A reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton's
transaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible
structural reduction strategies. An implementation and experimental evidence is
provided showing most nonrandom properties sensitive to stutter are actually
shortening or lengthening insensitive. Performance of experiments on a large
(random) benchmark from the model-checking competition indicate that despite
being a semi-decision procedure, the approach can still improve state of the
art verification tools.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Incorporating social relations into the recommendation system, i.e. social
recommendation, has been widely studied in academic and industrial communities.
While many promising results have been achieved, existing methods mostly assume
that the social relations can be homogeneously applied to all the items, which
is not practical for users' actually diverse preferences. In this paper, we
argue that the effect of the social relations should be inhomogeneous, that is,
two socially-related users may only share the same preference on some specific
items, while for the other products, their preferences can be inconsistent or
even contradictory. Inspired by this idea, we build a novel social
recommendation model, where the traditional pair-wise ""user-user'' relation is
extended to the triple relation of ""user-item-user''. To well handle such
high-order relations, we base our framework on the hypergraph. More
specifically, each hyperedge connects a user-user-item triplet, representing
that the two users share similar preferences on the item. We develop a Social
HyperGraph Convolutional Network (short for SHGCN) to learn from the complex
triplet social relations. With the hypergraph convolutional networks, the
social relations can be modeled in a more fine-grained manner, which more
accurately depicts real users' preferences, and benefits the recommendation
performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our
model's effectiveness. Studies on data sparsity and hyper-parameter studies
further validate our model's rationality. Our codes and dataset are available
at https://github.com/ziruizhu/SHGCN.

and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We present a global model of
the system, based on the most precise photometry from space, ground, and
archival radial velocity data. Using the homogenized data set and modeled light
curves, we measure the mid-transit times for WASP-43 b. Our analysis agrees
with a linear ephemeris for which we refine the light elements for future
observations of the system. However, there is a negative difference between the
transit timings derived from TESS data in two sectors (9 and 35) and a hint of
an orbital period decrease in the entire data set. Both findings are
statistically insignificant due to the short baseline of observations, which
prevents us from drawing firm conclusions about the orbital decay of this
ultra-short-period planet. However, assuming the effect of this decrease of the
period in the planet's orbit, we derive a lower limit for the reduced tidal
quality factor as Q'_* > (4.01 +_ 1.15). 10^5 from the best-fitting quadratic
function. Finally, we calculate a probable rotational period for this system as

of strongly correlated localized $f$ electrons and itinerant conduction $c$

the quasiparticle lifetimes at different sublattices are distinct, leading to
the emergence of Weyl exceptional rings in the complex pole of the Green's
function at finite temperatures; such rings lead to the appearance of bounded
Fermi surfaces (bulk Fermi disks). As temperatures rise, two pairs of Weyl
exceptional rings merge into two exceptional rings with one bounded bulk Fermi
surface (bulk Fermi tube), which are experimentally measurable by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Finally, we use the dynamical mean
field theory to calculate the spectral functions which illustrate the emergence
of bulk Fermi tubes. Our work thus opens the door for studying exceptional

Hence, we desire an LR estimator for low- and zero-frequency N-grams. One way
to achieve this is to decompose the N-grams into discrete values, such as
letters and words, and take the product of the LRs for the values. However,
because this method deals with a large number of discrete values, the running
time and memory usage for estimation are problematic. Moreover, use of

branching and pattern matching to function overloading and type-cases-very

design of languages that use these types. I start by defining a theoretical
framework that covers all the examples given in the first part of the

implemented, I then describe three effective restrictions of this system: (i) a
polymorphic language with explicitly-typed functions, (ii) an implicitly-typed
polymorphic language \`a la Hindley-Milner, and (iii) a monomorphic language
that, by implementing classic union-elimination, precisely reconstructs
intersection types for functions and implements a very general form of
occurrence typing. I conclude the presentation with a short overview of other
aspects of these languages, such as pattern matching, gradual typing, and

nuclei at millimeter wavelengths have the power to reveal the launching and
initial collimation region of extragalactic radio jets, down to $10-100$
gravitational radii ($r_g=GM/c^2$) scales in nearby sources. Centaurus A is the
closest radio-loud source to Earth. It bridges the gap in mass and accretion
rate between the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Messier 87 and our
galactic center. A large southern declination of $-43^{\circ}$ has however
prevented VLBI imaging of Centaurus A below ${\lambda}1$cm thus far. Here, we
show the millimeter VLBI image of the source, which we obtained with the Event
Horizon Telescope at $228$GHz. Compared to previous observations, we image
Centaurus A's jet at a tenfold higher frequency and sixteen times sharper
resolution and thereby probe sub-lightday structures. We reveal a
highly-collimated, asymmetrically edge-brightened jet as well as the fainter
counterjet. We find that Centaurus A's source structure resembles the jet in
Messier 87 on ${\sim}500r_g$ scales remarkably well. Furthermore, we identify
the location of Centaurus A's SMBH with respect to its resolved jet core at
${\lambda}1.3$mm and conclude that the source's event horizon shadow should be
visible at THz frequencies. This location further supports the universal scale
invariance of black holes over a wide range of masses.

observation of electron neutrino appearance in short-baseline experiments, such
as the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and the Mini Booster
Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE). In light of these unexpected results, a
campaign using natural and anthropogenic sources to find light --
mass-squared-difference around 1 eV$^{2}$ -- sterile neutrinos is underway.
Among the natural sources, atmospheric neutrinos provide a unique gateway to
search for sterile neutrinos due to the broad range of baseline-to-energy
ratios, $L/E$, and the presence of significant matter effects. Since the
atmospheric neutrino flux rapidly falls with energy, studying its highest
energy component requires gigaton-scale neutrino detectors. These detectors --
often known as neutrino telescopes since they are designed to observe tiny
astrophysical neutrino fluxes -- have performed searches for light sterile
neutrinos and have found no significant signal to date. This brief review
summarizes the current status of searches for light sterile neutrinos with
neutrino telescopes deployed in solid and liquid water.

  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm for maintaining
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $st$-distance with worst-case update time
$O(n^{1.407})$ (for the current best known bound on the matrix multiplication
exponent $\omega$). This even improves upon the fastest known randomized
algorithm for this problem. Similar to several other well-studied dynamic
problems whose state-of-the-art worst-case update time is $O(n^{1.407})$, this
matches a conditional lower bound [BNS, FOCS 2019]. We further give a
deterministic algorithm for maintaining $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
single-source distances with worst-case update time $O(n^{1.529})$, which also
matches a conditional lower bound.
  At the core, our approach is to combine algebraic distance maintenance data
structures with near-additive emulator constructions. This also leads to novel
dynamic algorithms for maintaining $(1+\epsilon, \beta)$-emulators that improve
upon the state of the art, which might be of independent interest. Our
techniques also lead to improved randomized algorithms for several problems

propose attacks that can manipulate the model and disclose information about
the training data in FL. As a result, there has been a growing belief in the
research community that FL is highly vulnerable to a variety of severe attacks.
Although these attacks do indeed highlight security and privacy risks in FL,
some of them may not be as effective in production deployment because they are
feasible only under special -- sometimes impractical -- assumptions.
Furthermore, some attacks are evaluated under limited setups that may not match

systematic mapping study of attacks against FL, covering 48 relevant papers
from 2016 to the third quarter of 2021. On the basis of this study, we provide

This analysis reveals several research gaps with regard to the type of target

assumptions in the problem settings of some attacks, related to the
hyper-parameters of the ML model and data distribution among clients.
Furthermore, we identify and discuss several fallacies in the evaluation of
attacks, which open up questions on the generalizability of the conclusions. As
a remedy, we propose a set of recommendations to avoid these fallacies and to
promote adequate evaluations.

to surgical planning and aroused broad range of interests in the medical image
analysis community. Due to the complex structure and low contrast background,
automatic liver vessel segmentation remains particularly challenging. Most of
the related researches adopt FCN, U-net, and V-net variants as a backbone.
However, these methods mainly focus on capturing multi-scale local features
which may produce misclassified voxels due to the convolutional operator's
limited locality reception field.
  Methods: We propose a robust end-to-end vessel segmentation network called
Inductive BIased Multi-Head Attention Vessel Net(IBIMHAV-Net) by expanding swin
transformer to 3D and employing an effective combination of convolution and
self-attention. In practice, we introduce the voxel-wise embedding rather than
patch-wise embedding to locate precise liver vessel voxels, and adopt
multi-scale convolutional operators to gain local spatial information. On the
other hand, we propose the inductive biased multi-head self-attention which
learns inductive biased relative positional embedding from initialized absolute
position embedding. Based on this, we can gain a more reliable query and key
matrix. To validate the generalization of our model, we test on samples which
have different structural complexity.
  Results: We conducted experiments on the 3DIRCADb datasets. The average dice
and sensitivity of the four tested cases were 74.8% and 77.5%, which exceed
results of existing deep learning methods and improved graph cuts method.
  Conclusion: The proposed model IBIMHAV-Net provides an automatic, accurate 3D
liver vessel segmentation with an interleaved architecture that better utilizes
both global and local spatial features in CT volumes. It can be further
extended for other clinical data.

sample of Ap stars for which fundamental parameters have additionally been
derived by means of interferometry. This enables a cross-comparison of results
derived by direct and indirect methods. For all investigated stars, we
determined fundamental parameters and derived chemical abundances that are
typical for Ap stars. The abundances are mainly characterised by a gradual
increase of heavy element atmospheric abundances from an order of magnitude for
iron peak elements up to very significant excesses of 3-4 dex of the rare-earth
elements relative to the solar values. The only exception is Ba, whose
abundance is close to the solar abundance. There is also a significant He
deficiency in the atmospheres of HD 120198 and HD 220825, whereas the He
abundance in HD 4778 is close to the solar abundance. We do not find
significant Fe and Cr stratification. Using these abundances, we constructed
self-consistent atmospheric models for each star. The effect of the surface
chemical inhomogeneity on the derived fundamental parameters did not exceed
+/-100 K in effective temperature, which lies within the range of errors in
similar self-consistent analyses of Ap stars. Finally, we compared
spectroscopically derived effective temperatures, radii, and luminosity for 13
out of 14 Ap stars in a benchmark sample with the interferometric results.
While radii and luminosity agree within the quoted errors of both
determinations, the spectroscopic effective temperatures are higher than the
interferometric temperatures for stars with temperatures $T_{eff} >$ 9000 K.
The observed hydrogen line profiles favour the spectroscopically derived
temperatures.

that zero-sum games admit an essentially unique equilibrium solution. Classical
learning results build on this theorem to show that online no-regret dynamics
converge to an equilibrium in a time-average sense in zero-sum games. In the
past several years, a key research direction has focused on characterizing the
day-to-day behavior of such dynamics. General results in this direction show
that broad classes of online learning dynamics are cyclic, and formally
Poincar\'{e} recurrent, in zero-sum games. We analyze the robustness of these
online learning behaviors in the case of periodic zero-sum games with a
time-invariant equilibrium. This model generalizes the usual repeated game
formulation while also being a realistic and natural model of a repeated
competition between players that depends on exogenous environmental variations
such as time-of-day effects, week-to-week trends, and seasonality.
Interestingly, time-average convergence may fail even in the simplest such
settings, in spite of the equilibrium being fixed. In contrast, using novel
analysis methods, we show that Poincar\'{e} recurrence provably generalizes
despite the complex, non-autonomous nature of these dynamical systems.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.04325",,,,"math.PR math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  After a general introduction about the regularization by noise phenomenon in
the degenerate setting, the first part of this PhD thesis focuses at
establishing the Schauder estimates, a useful analytical tool to prove also the
well-posedness of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), for two different
classes of Kolmogorov equations under a weak H\""ormander-like condition, whose
coefficients lie in suitable anisotropic H\""older spaces with multi-indices of
regularity. The first class considers a nonlinear system controlled by a
symmetric stable operator acting only on some components. Our method of proof
relies on a perturbative approach based on forward parametrix expansions
through Duhamel-type formulas. Due to the low regularizing properties given by
the degenerate setting, we also exploit some controls on Besov norms, in order
to deal with the non-linear perturbation. As an extension of the first one, we
also present Schauder estimates associated with a degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
operator driven by a larger class of stable-like operators, like the
relativistic or the Lamperti stable one. Exploiting a backward parametrix
approach, the second part of this work aims at establishing the weak
well-posedness for a degenerate chain of SDEs driven by the same class of
stable-like processes, under the assumptions of the minimal H\""older regularity
on the coefficients. As a by-product of our method, we also present Krylov-type
estimates of independent interest for the associated canonical process.
Finally, we show through suitable counter-examples the existence of an (almost)
sharp threshold on the regularity exponents ensuring the weak well-posedness
for the SDE. In connection with some possible applications to kinetic dynamics
with friction, we conclude by investigating the stability of second-order
perturbations for degenerate Kolmogorov operators in Lp and H\""older norms.

for the same version of a program and mislead developers who spend time and

failing tests hoping that they would pass and manifest as false alerts.
Nonetheless, completely filtering out false alerts may require a
disproportionate number of reruns, and thus incurs important costs both
computation and time-wise. As an alternative to reruns, we propose Fair, a
novel, lightweight approach that classifies test failures into false alerts and
legitimate failures. Fair relies on a classifier and a set of features from the
failures and test artefacts. To build and evaluate our machine learning
classifier, we use the continuous integration of the Chromium project. In
particular, we collect the properties and artefacts of more than 1 million test
failures from 2,000 builds. Our results show that Fair can accurately
distinguish legitimate failures from false alerts, with an MCC up to 95%.
Moreover, by studying different test categories: GUI, integration and unit
tests, we show that Fair classifies failures accurately even when the number of
failures is limited. Finally, we compare the costs of our approach to reruns
and show that Fair could save up to 20 minutes of computation time per build.

up with traditional video codecs in their rate-distortion (R-D) performance.
However, existing learned video compression schemes are limited by the binding
of the prediction mode and the fixed network framework. They are unable to
support various inter prediction modes and thus inapplicable for various
scenarios. In this paper, to break this limitation, we propose a versatile
learned video compression (VLVC) framework that uses one model to support all
possible prediction modes. Specifically, to realize versatile compression, we
first build a motion compensation module that applies multiple 3D motion vector
fields (i.e., voxel flows) for weighted trilinear warping in spatial-temporal
space. The voxel flows convey the information of temporal reference position
that helps to decouple inter prediction modes away from framework designing.
Secondly, in case of multiple-reference-frame prediction, we apply a flow
prediction module to predict accurate motion trajectories with unified
polynomial functions. We show that the flow prediction module can largely
reduce the transmission cost of voxel flows. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed VLVC not only supports versatile compression in various
settings, but also is the first end-to-end learned video compression method
that outperforms the latest VVC/H.266 standard reference software in terms of

leaf images in an automatized way. We aim to dispose of a source of training
samples for AI applications for modern crop management. Such applications
require large amounts of data and, while leaf images are not truly scarce,
image collection and annotation remains a very time--consuming process. Data
scarcity can be addressed by augmentation techniques consisting in simple
transformations of samples belonging to a small dataset, but the richness of
the augmented data is limited: this motivates the search for alternative
approaches. Methods. Pursuing an approach based on DL generative models, we
propose a Leaf-to-Leaf Translation (L2L) procedure structured in two steps:
first, a residual variational autoencoder architecture generates synthetic leaf
skeletons (leaf profile and veins) starting from companions binarized skeletons
of real images. In a second step, we perform translation via a Pix2pix
framework, which uses conditional generator adversarial networks to reproduce
the colorization of leaf blades, preserving the shape and the venation pattern.
Results. The L2L procedure generates synthetic images of leaves with a
realistic appearance. We address the performance measurement both in a
qualitative and a quantitative way; for this latter evaluation, we employ a DL
anomaly detection strategy which quantifies the degree of anomaly of synthetic
leaves with respect to real samples. Conclusions. Generative DL approaches have
the potential to be a new paradigm to provide low-cost meaningful synthetic
samples for computer-aided applications. The present L2L approach represents a
step towards this goal, being able to generate synthetic samples with a
relevant qualitative and quantitative resemblance to real leaves.

clinical trials can be leveraged for designing more powerful, or smaller yet
equally powerful, clinical trials becomes increasingly important in the era of
digitalisation. Today, the traditional statistical analyses approaches may seem
questionable to practitioners in light of ubiquitous historical covariate
information.
  Several methodological developments aim at incorporating historical
information in the design and analysis of future clinical trials, most
importantly Bayesian information borrowing, propensity score methods,
stratification, and covariate adjustment. Recently, adjusting the analysis with
respect to a prognostic score, which was obtained from some machine learning
procedure applied to historical data, has been suggested and we study the
potential of this approach for randomised clinical trials.
  In an idealised situation of a normal outcome in a two-arm trial with 1:1
allocation, we derive a simple sample size reduction formula as a function of
two criteria characterising the prognostic score: (1) The coefficient of
determination $R^2$ on historical data and (2) the correlation $\rho$ between
the estimated and the true unknown prognostic scores. While maintaining the
same power, the original total sample size $n$ planned for the unadjusted
analysis reduces to $(1 - R^2 \rho^2) \times n$ in an adjusted analysis.
Robustness in less ideal situations was assessed empirically. We conclude that
there is potential for substantially more powerful or smaller trials, but only
when prognostic scores can be accurately estimated.

use Class Attention Maps (CAM) to generate pseudo masks as ground-truth.
However, the existing methods typically depend on the painstaking training
modules, which may bring in grinding computational overhead and complex
training procedures. In this work, the semantic structure aware inference (SSA)
is proposed to explore the semantic structure information hidden in different
stages of the CNN-based network to generate high-quality CAM in the model
inference. Specifically, the semantic structure modeling module (SSM) is first
proposed to generate the class-agnostic semantic correlation representation,
where each item denotes the affinity degree between one category of objects and
all the others. Then the structured feature representation is explored to
polish an immature CAM via the dot product operation. Finally, the polished
CAMs from different backbone stages are fused as the output. The proposed
method has the advantage of no parameters and does not need to be trained.
Therefore, it can be applied to a wide range of weakly-supervised pixel-wise
dense prediction tasks. Experimental results on both weakly-supervised object
localization and weakly-supervised semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves the new state-of-the-art
results on these two tasks.

to the client, the systems need to predict both client movement and pauses in
data consumption.
  In this paper, we present variations of Markov model algorithms that can run
on clients to increase the data availability while minimizing excess data. In a
simulation, we find the availability of data at the closest node can be
improved by 35% without incurring the storage and communication overheads of

training data to be collected and processed at a central server which is often
challenging in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. Towards this, a new
learning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed that brings
the potential of DL to these domains while addressing privacy and data
ownership issues. FL enables remote clients to learn a shared ML model while
keeping the data local. However, conventional FL systems face several
challenges such as scalability, complex infrastructure management, and wasted
compute and incurred costs due to idle clients. These challenges of FL systems
closely align with the core problems that serverless computing and
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms aim to solve. These include rapid
scalability, no infrastructure management, automatic scaling to zero for idle
clients, and a pay-per-use billing model. To this end, we present a novel
system and framework for serverless FL, called FedLess. Our system supports
multiple commercial and self-hosted FaaS providers and can be deployed in the
cloud, on-premise in institutional data centers, and on edge devices. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to enable FL across a large fabric of
heterogeneous FaaS providers while providing important features like security
and Differential Privacy. We demonstrate with comprehensive experiments that
the successful training of DNNs for different tasks across up to 200 client
functions and more is easily possible using our system. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the practical viability of our methodology by comparing it against
a traditional FL system and show that it can be cheaper and more
resource-efficient.

young massive stars using analytic theory. We do this in order to determine why
there is a discrepancy between theoretical models that predict that winds
should play a secondary role to photoionisation in the dynamics of HII regions,
and observations of young HII regions that seem to suggest a driving role for
winds. In particular, regions such as M42 in Orion have neutral hydrogen
shells, suggesting that the ionising radiation is trapped closer to the star.
We first derive formulae for wind bubble evolution in non-uniform density
fields, focusing on singular isothermal sphere density fields with a power law
index of -2. We find that a classical ""Weaver""-like expansion velocity becomes
constant in such a density distribution. We then calculate the structure of the
photoionised shell around such wind bubbles, and determine at what point the
mass in the shell cannot absorb all of the ionising photons emitted by the
star, causing an ""overflow"" of ionising radiation. We also estimate
perturbations from cooling, gravity, magnetic fields and instabilities, all of
which we argue are secondary effects for the conditions studied here. Our
wind-driven model provides a consistent explanation for the behaviour of M42 to
within the errors given by observational studies. We find that in relatively
denser molecular cloud environments \around single young stellar sources,
champagne flows are unlikely until the wind shell breaks up due to turbulence
or clumping in the cloud.

saturation momentum during the glasma stage. Furthermore, we observe an
interesting anisotropy in transverse momentum broadening of partons with larger
broadening in the rapidity than in the azimuthal direction. Its origin can be
related to correlations among the longitudinal color-electric and
color-magnetic flux tubes in the initial state of the glasma. We compare these

diquark are equal for all allowed pairs of quarks. The latter effective diquark
can form either from two valence, one valence and one sea, or from two sea
quarks. Consequently we calculate the probabilities for different color
configurations involving diquarks of valence-valence, valence-sea and sea-sea
type. These probabilities appear to depend on the number of exchanged gluons,
which results in increasing baryon stopping as a function of the number of
proton-nucleon collisions in the nucleus. As such, the nuclear stopping power
appears to be governed by the emergence of new color configurations as a
function of N rather than by the energy loss of the original valence diquark.
  The advantage of our approach lies in its high predictive power which makes
it verifiable by the new, precise data on proton and neutron production from

Detecting pulmonary abnormalities like COVID-19 may become difficult due to
that they are obscured by the presence of bony structures like the ribs and the

Automated bone suppression methods would help suppress these bony structures
and increase soft tissue visibility. In this study, we propose to build an
ensemble of convolutional neural network models to suppress bones in frontal
CXRs, improve classification performance, and reduce interpretation errors
related to COVID-19 detection. The ensemble is constructed by (i) measuring the
multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) score between the sub-blocks
of the bone-suppressed image predicted by each of the top-3 performing
bone-suppression models and the corresponding sub-blocks of its respective
ground truth soft-tissue image, and (ii) performing a majority voting of the
MS-SSIM score computed in each sub-block to identify the sub-block with the
maximum MS-SSIM score and use it in constructing the final bone-suppressed
image. We empirically determine the sub-block size that delivers superior bone
suppression performance. It is observed that the bone suppression model
ensemble outperformed the individual models in terms of MS-SSIM and other
metrics. A CXR modality-specific classification model is retrained and
evaluated on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed images to classify
them as showing normal lungs or other COVID-19-like manifestations. We observed

to be the result of curvature radiation due to primary particles in the pulsar
magnetosphere and current sheet. We present phase-resolved spectra and
energy-dependent light curves using an extended slot gap and current sheet
model, invoking a step function for the accelerating electric field as
motivated by kinetic simulations. We include a refined calculation of the
curvature radius of particle trajectories in the lab frame, impacting the
particle transport, predicted light curves, and spectra. Our model reproduces
the decrease of the flux of the first peak relative to the second one,
evolution of the bridge emission, near-constant phase positions of peaks, and
narrowing of pulses with increasing energy. We can explain the first of these
trends because we find that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in
regions where the second $\gamma$-ray light curve peak originates are
systematically larger than those associated with the first peak, implying that
the spectral cutoff of the second peak is correspondingly larger. However, an
unknown azimuthal dependence of the $E$-field as well as uncertainty in the
precise spatial origin of the GeV emission, precludes a simplistic
discrimination of emission mechanisms.

Manhattan axes of the scene. Within our approach, these structural constraints
are initially used to estimate accurately the 3D position of the extracted

axes and the reprojection errors of points and lines to refine the camera pose
by means of local map optimization. Such a combination enables our approach to
operate even in the absence of the aforementioned constraints, allowing the

our current understanding of the mechanisms leading to Arnold diffusion.
Emphasis is placed upon the identification of those invariant objects in phase
space which drive chaotic diffusion, such as the stable and unstable manifolds
emanating from (partially) hyperbolic invariant objects. Besides a qualitative
understanding of the diffusion mechanisms, a precise quantification of the
speed of Arnold diffusion can be achieved by methods based on canonical
perturbation theory, i.e. by the construction of a suitable normal form at
optimal order. As an example of such methods, we discuss the
(quasi-)stationary-phase approximation for the selection of remainder terms
acting as driving terms for the diffusion. Finally, we discuss the efficiency

attention in classical wave systems. However, little work has been done on
topological interface states in one-dimensional (1D) elastic wave systems,
especially in the case of oblique incidence. This paper theoretically
demonstrates the realization of topological interface states of elastic waves
in a 1D composite plate structure composed of two phononic crystals (PCs) with
different topological characteristics, which can be regulated by the incident
angle. For the out-of-plane SH mode, multiple topological interface states can
coexist in different common bandgaps. For the in-plane complex P-SV coupled
mode, topological interface states can exist in both ""partial-polarization"" and
""omni-polarization"" bandgaps. All these interface states are in the wide
frequency and incident angle regions. We also discuss the polarization and the
mode conversion of the interface states. Our results provide an innovative
method to excite and tune topologically protected interface states for elastic
waves, which may have potential applications in obtaining strong local
vibration for different polarized elastic wave modes.

than in typical images, so detection is more difficult. Convolutional neural
networks use a variety of frequency- and orientation-specific kernels to
identify objects subject to different transformations; these require many
parameters. Sampling equivariant networks can adjust sampling from input
feature maps according to the transformation of the object, allowing a kernel
to extract features of an object under different transformations. Doing so
requires fewer parameters, and makes the network more suitable for representing
deformable objects, like those in aerial images. However, methods like
deformable convolutional networks can only provide sampling equivariance under
certain circumstances, because of the locations used for sampling. We propose
sampling equivariant self-attention networks which consider self-attention
restricted to a local image patch as convolution sampling with masks instead of
locations, and design a transformation embedding module to further improve the
equivariant sampling ability. We also use a novel randomized normalization
module to tackle overfitting due to limited aerial image data. We show that our

adaptation mainly follow the paradigm designed for the static data, which
cannot handle domain-specific complex conditional dependencies raised by data
offset, time lags, and variant data distributions. In order to address these

further raise the causal conditional shift assumption. Enlightened by this

propose an end-to-end model for the semi-supervised domain adaptation problem

empirical risks and by the discrepancy between the causal structures from
different domains. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the semi-supervised domain

interacting repulsively to show up chimera patterns. The dynamics of individual
oscillators is governed by the superconducting Josephson junction.
Surprisingly, the repulsive interactions establish a symmetry of compelete
synchrony in the ring, which is broken with increasing interactions when the
junctions pass through serials of asynchronous states (periodic and chaotic),
but finally emerge into chimera states. The chimera pattern appears in chaotic
rotational motion of the three junctions when two junctions evolve coherently
while the third junction is incoherent. For larger repulsive coupling, the
junctions evolves into another chimera pattern in a periodic state when two
junctions remain coherent in rotational motion and one transits to incoherent
librational motion. This chimera pattern is sensitive to initial conditions, in
the sense, that the chimera state flips to another pattern when two junctions
switch to coherent librational motion and the third junction remains in
rotational motion, but incoherent. The chimera patterns are detected by using
partial and global error functions of the junctions while the librational and
rotational motions are identified by a libration index. All the collective
states, complete synchrony, desynchronization and two chimera patterns, are
delineated in a parameter plane of the ring of junctions, where the boundaries
of complete synchrony are demarcated by using the master stability function.

universal computations performed by the neocortex. The Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) algorithm realizes these forms of computation. It learns sequences
in an unsupervised and continuous manner using local learning rules, permits a
context specific prediction of future sequence elements, and generates mismatch
signals in case the predictions are not met. While the HTM algorithm accounts
for a number of biological features such as topographic receptive fields,
nonlinear dendritic processing, and sparse connectivity, it is based on
abstract discrete-time neuron and synapse dynamics, as well as on plasticity
mechanisms that can only partly be related to known biological mechanisms.
Here, we devise a continuous-time implementation of the temporal-memory (TM)
component of the HTM algorithm, which is based on a recurrent network of
spiking neurons with biophysically interpretable variables and parameters. The
model learns high-order sequences by means of a structural Hebbian synaptic
plasticity mechanism supplemented with a rate-based homeostatic control. In
combination with nonlinear dendritic input integration and local inhibitory
feedback, this type of plasticity leads to the dynamic self-organization of
narrow sequence-specific subnetworks. These subnetworks provide the substrate
for a faithful propagation of sparse, synchronous activity, and, thereby, for a
robust, context specific prediction of future sequence elements as well as for
the autonomous replay of previously learned sequences. By strengthening the
link to biology, our implementation facilitates the evaluation of the TM
hypothesis based on electrophysiological and behavioral data.

nonnegative orthogonal constraint, in which the objective function is
$L$-smooth on an open set containing the Stiefel manifold ${\rm St}(n,r)$. We
derive a locally Lipschitzian error bound for the feasible points without zero
rows when $n>r>1$, and when $n>r=1$ or $n=r$ achieve a global Lipschitzian
error bound. Then, we show that the penalty problem induced by the elementwise
$\ell_1$-norm distance to the nonnegative cone is a global exact penalty, and
so is the one induced by its Moreau envelope under a lower second-order
calmness of the objective function. A practical penalty algorithm is developed
by solving approximately a series of smooth penalty problems with a
retraction-based nonmonotone line-search proximal gradient method, and any
cluster point of the generated sequence is shown to be a stationary point of
the original problem. Numerical comparisons with the ALM \citep{Wen13} and the
exact penalty method \citep{JiangM22} indicate that our penalty method has an
advantage in terms of the quality of solutions despite taking a little more
time.

  Types","52 pages, 18 figures",,,,"math.CT cs.LO gr-qc hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  How do spaces emerge from pregeometric discrete building blocks governed by
computational rules? To address this, we investigate non-deterministic
rewriting systems (multiway systems) of the Wolfram model. We express these
rewriting systems as homotopy types. Using this new formulation, we outline how
spatial structures can be functorially inherited from pregeometric
type-theoretic constructions. We show how higher homotopy types are constructed
from rewriting rules. These correspond to morphisms of an $n$-fold category.
Subsequently, the $n \to \infty$ limit of the Wolfram model rulial multiway
system is identified as an $\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant
given Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then go on to show how this
construction extends to the classifying space of rulial multiway systems, which
forms a multiverse of multiway systems and carries the formal structure of an
${\left(\infty, 1\right)}$-topos. This correspondence to higher categorical
structures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may
arise from pregeometric combinatorial models. A key issue we have addressed
here is to relate abstract non-deterministic rewriting systems to higher
homotopy spaces. A consequence of constructing spaces and geometry
synthetically is that it eliminates ad hoc assumptions about geometric
attributes of a model such as an a priori background or pre-assigned geometric
data. Instead, geometry is inherited functorially by higher structures. This is
relevant for formally justifying different choices of underlying spacetime
discretization adopted by models of quantum gravity. We conclude with comments
on how our framework of higher category-theoretic combinatorial constructions,
corroborates with other approaches investigating higher categorical structures
relevant to the foundations of physics.

to the tabular setting or linear models due to the difficulty in dealing with
function approximation in high dimensional space with an uncertain environment.
This work offers a fresh perspective into this challenge by analyzing RL in a
general reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We consider a family of Markov
decision processes $\mathcal{M}$ of which the reward functions lie in the unit
ball of an RKHS and transition probabilities lie in a given arbitrary set. We
define a quantity called perturbational complexity by distribution mismatch
$\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(\epsilon)$ to characterize the complexity of the
admissible state-action distribution space in response to a perturbation in the
RKHS with scale $\epsilon$. We show that $\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(\epsilon)$ gives
both the lower bound of the error of all possible algorithms and the upper
bound of two specific algorithms (fitted reward and fitted Q-iteration) for the
RL problem. Hence, the decay of $\Delta_\mathcal{M}(\epsilon)$ with respect to
$\epsilon$ measures the difficulty of the RL problem on $\mathcal{M}$. We
further provide some concrete examples and discuss whether
$\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(\epsilon)$ decays fast or not in these examples. As a
byproduct, we show that when the reward functions lie in a high dimensional
RKHS, even if the transition probability is known and the action space is
finite, it is still possible for RL problems to suffer from the curse of
dimensionality.

(RL) through reward signals is a promising research direction towards
recommender systems (RS) that maximize cumulative profits. However, the direct
use of RL algorithms in the RS setting is impractical due to challenges like
off-policy training, huge action spaces and lack of sufficient reward signals.
Recent RL approaches for RS attempt to tackle these challenges by combining RL
and (self-)supervised sequential learning, but still suffer from certain
limitations. For example, the estimation of Q-values tends to be biased toward
positive values due to the lack of negative reward signals. Moreover, the
Q-values also depend heavily on the specific timestamp of a sequence.
  To address the above problems, we propose negative sampling strategy for
training the RL component and combine it with supervised sequential learning.
We call this method Supervised Negative Q-learning (SNQN). Based on sampled
(negative) actions (items), we can calculate the ""advantage"" of a positive
action over the average case, which can be further utilized as a normalized
weight for learning the supervised sequential part. This leads to another
learning framework: Supervised Advantage Actor-Critic (SA2C). We instantiate
SNQN and SA2C with four state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models and
conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that
the proposed approaches achieve significantly better performance than
state-of-the-art supervised methods and existing self-supervised RL methods .

mathematical and engineering literature. In this work, we analyze a sparse
version of the problem: The filter $h\in \mathbb{R}^\mu$ is assumed to be
$s$-sparse, and the signal $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is taken to be $\sigma$-sparse,
both supports being unknown. We observe a convolution between the filter and a
linear transformation of the signal. Motivated by practically important
multi-user communication applications, we derive a recovery guarantee for the
simultaneous demixing and deconvolution setting. We achieve efficient recovery
by relaxing the problem to a hierarchical sparse recovery for which we can
build on a flexible framework. At the same time, for this we pay the price of
some sub-optimal guarantees compared to the number of free parameters of the
problem. The signal model we consider is sufficiently general to capture many
applications in a number of engineering fields. Despite their practical
importance, we provide first rigorous performance guarantees for efficient and
simple algorithms for the bi-sparse and generalized demixing setting. We
complement our analytical results by presenting results of numerical
simulations. We find evidence that the sub-optimal scaling $s^2\sigma
\log(\mu)\log(n)$ of our derived sufficient condition is likely overly
pessimistic and that the observed performance is better described by a scaling
proportional to $ s\sigma$ up to log-factors.

violations. The job scheduling plays a critical role in servicing cloud demands
by allocating appropriate resources to execute client jobs. The response to
such jobs is optimized by the cloud provider on a multi-tier cloud computing
environment. Typically, the complex and dynamic nature of multi-tier
environments incurs difficulties in meeting such demands, because tiers are
dependent on each other which in turn makes bottlenecks of a tier shift to
escalate in subsequent tiers. However, the optimization process of existing
approaches produces single-tier-driven schedules that do not employ the
differential impact of SLA violations in executing client jobs. Furthermore,
the impact of schedules optimized at the tier level on the performance of
schedules formulated in subsequent tiers tends to be ignored, resulting in a
less than optimal performance when measured at the multi-tier level. Thus,
failing in committing job obligations incurs SLA penalties that often take the
form of either financial compensations, or losing future interests and
motivations of unsatisfied clients in the service provided. In this paper, a
scheduling and allocation approach is proposed to formulate schedules that
account for differential impacts of SLA violation penalties and, thus, produce
schedules that are optimal in financial performance. A queue virtualization
scheme is designed to facilitate the formulation of optimal schedules at the
tier and multi-tier levels of the cloud environment. Because the scheduling
problem is NP-hard, a biologically inspired approach is proposed to mitigate
the complexity of finding optimal schedules.

dissipation is bounded away from zero as viscosity is decreased (Reynolds
number increased). This phenomenon - anomalous dissipation - is sometimes
called the `zeroth law of turbulence' as it underpins many celebrated
theoretical predictions. Another robust feature observed in turbulence is that
velocity structure functions $S_p(\ell) :=\langle |\delta_\ell u|^p\rangle$
exhibit persistent power-law scaling in the inertial range, namely $S_p(\ell)
\sim |\ell|^{\zeta_p}$ for exponents $\zeta_p>0$ over an ever-increasing (with
Reynolds) range of scales. This behavior indicates that the velocity field
retains some fractional differentiability uniformly in the Reynolds number. The
Kolmogorov 1941 theory of turbulence predicts that $\zeta_p=p/3$ for all $p$
and Onsager's 1949 theory establishes the requirement that $\zeta_p\leq p/3$
for $p\geq 3$ for consistency with the zeroth law. Empirically, $\zeta_2
\gtrapprox 2/3$ and $\zeta_3 \lessapprox 1$, suggesting that turbulent
Navier-Stokes solutions approximate dissipative weak solutions of the Euler
equations possessing (nearly) the minimal degree of singularity required to
sustain anomalous dissipation. In this note, we adopt an experimentally
supported hypothesis on the anti-alignment of velocity increments with their
separation vectors and demonstrate that the inertial dissipation provides a
regularization mechanism via the Kolmogorov 4/5-law.

on deep learning, is proposed. In the offline training phase, a deep neural
network learns the optimal solution on a set of MIMO channel matrices. This
allows the reduction of the computational complexity of the precoder
optimization in the online inference phase. Numerical results demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed solution vis-\`a-vis existing precoding algorithms
in terms of significantly reduced complexity and close-to-optimal performance.

learning algorithms. Many real-world domains are, by definition, class
imbalanced by virtue of having a majority class that naturally has many more
instances than its minority class (e.g. genuine bank transactions occur much
more often than fraudulent ones). Many methods have been proposed to solve the
class imbalance problem, among the most popular being oversampling techniques
(such as SMOTE). These methods generate synthetic instances in the minority
class, to balance the dataset, performing data augmentations that improve the
performance of predictive machine learning (ML) models. In this paper we
advance a novel data augmentation method (adapted from eXplainable AI), that
generates synthetic, counterfactual instances in the minority class. Unlike
other oversampling techniques, this method adaptively combines exist-ing
instances from the dataset, using actual feature-values rather than
interpolating values between instances. Several experiments using four
different classifiers and 25 datasets are reported, which show that this
Counterfactual Augmentation method (CFA) generates useful synthetic data points
in the minority class. The experiments also show that CFA is competitive with
many other oversampling methods many of which are variants of SMOTE. The basis
for CFAs performance is discussed, along with the conditions under which it is
likely to perform better or worse in future tests.

density of states or Raman spectrum of each topological insulator (TI),
respectively. In (BiSb)2Te3, the comparison revealed that the noise peaks track
the van Hove singularities in the phonon density of states. It resulted that
bulk atomic oscillators are responsible for the noise peaks. The most intense
noise peak observed in (BiSb)2Te3 at 50 K is attributed to the thermal motion
of the Bi atoms. Other less intense noise peaks are assigned to either a single
phonon mode or multi-phonon combinations. We found that thermal motions of Bi
and Te2 atoms in different symmetry directions are involved in most of the
phonon combinations, which stand for the signature of the lattice
anharmonicity. The noise increase observed in both (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and BiSbTeSe1.6
above a specific temperature threshold is attributed to the
anharmonicity-induced strengthening of the carrier-phonon coupling. In the case
of BiSbTeSe1.6, we show that all noise singularities are mirrored in the Raman
spectrum of a structurally close TI (BiSbTeSe2) in the whole temperature range.
This indicates that although transport can be at the surface or in the bulk or
both of them, the carrier-phonon interaction is the only source of 1/f
fluctuations in TIs. Inherently, these results imply that microscopic origin of
1/f noise in solid is in the perpetual thermal motion of the atoms.

Some features, like gaps, rings and spirals, suggest they may host young
planets, which can excite the orbits of nearby leftover planetesimals.
Energetic collisions among these bodies can lead to the production of
second-generation dust. Grains produced by collisions may have a dynamical
behaviour different from that of first-generation, primordial dust out of which
planetesimals and planets formed. We aim to study these differences for the HD
163296 system and determine whether dynamical signatures in the mixture of the
two dust populations can help separate their contributions. We use
three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic models to describe the gaseous disc with
three, Saturn- to Jupiter-mass, embedded planets. Dust grains, of sizes
1um-1mm, are treated as Lagrangean particles with resolved thermodynamics and
mass loss. Initial disc and planet configurations are derived from
observation-based work, which indicates low gas viscosity. The 3-D approach
also allows us to detect the formation of vortices induced by Rossby waves,
where dust becomes concentrated and may contribute to planetesimal formation.
We find that the main differences in the dynamical behaviour of first- and
second-generation dust occur in the vertical distribution. The two populations
have similar distributions around the disc mid-plane, although
second-generation dust shows longer residence times close to the radial
locations of the planets' gas gaps. Sedimentation rates of um-size grains are
comparable to or lower than the production rates by planetesimals' collisions,
making this population potentially observable. These outcomes can be extended
to similar systems harbouring giant planets.

Past research often focuses on factors affecting movement, rather than
locations of interest that animals return to or habitat. We explore the use of
clustering to identify locations of interest to African Elephants in regions of
Sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis was performed using publicly available
datasets for tracking African elephants at Kruger National Park (KNP), South
Africa; Etosha National Park, Namibia; as well as areas in Burkina Faso and the
Congo. Using the DBSCAN and KMeans clustering algorithms, we calculate clusters
and centroids to simplify elephant movement data and highlight important
locations of interest. Through a comparison of feature spaces with and without
temperature, we show that temperature is an important feature to explain
movement clustering. Recognizing the importance of temperature, we develop a
technique to add external temperature data from an API to other geospatial
datasets that would otherwise not have temperature data. After addressing the
hurdles of using external data with marginally different timestamps, we
consider the quality of this data, and the quality of the centroids of the
clusters calculated based on this external temperature data. Finally, we
overlay these centroids onto satellite imagery and locations of human
settlements to validate the real-life applications of the calculated centroids
to identify locations of interest for elephants. As expected, we confirmed that
elephants tend to cluster their movement around sources of water as well as
some human settlements, especially those with water holes. Identifying key
locations of interest for elephants is beneficial in predicting the movement of
elephants and preventing poaching. These methods may in the future be applied
to other animals beyond elephants to identify locations of interests for them.

  Floorplan Design","accepted to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics",,,,"cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We present a novel two-stage approach for automated floorplan design in
residential buildings with a given exterior wall boundary. Our approach has the
unique advantage of being human-centric, that is, the generated floorplans can
be geometrically plausible, as well as topologically reasonable to enhance
resident interaction with the environment. From the input boundary, we first
synthesize a human-activity map that reflects both the spatial configuration
and human-environment interaction in an architectural space. We propose to
produce the human-activity map either automatically by a pre-trained generative
adversarial network (GAN) model, or semi-automatically by synthesizing it with
user manipulation of the furniture. Second, we feed the human-activity map into
our deep framework ActFloor-GAN to guide a pixel-wise prediction of room types.
We adopt a re-formulated cycle-consistency constraint in ActFloor-GAN to
maximize the overall prediction performance, so that we can produce
high-quality room layouts that are readily convertible to vectorized
floorplans. Experimental results show several benefits of our approach. First,
a quantitative comparison with prior methods shows superior performance of
leveraging the human-activity map in predicting piecewise room types. Second, a
subjective evaluation by architects shows that our results have compelling
quality as professionally-designed floorplans and much better than those
generated by existing methods in terms of the room layout topology. Last, our
approach allows manipulating the furniture placement, considers the human
activities in the environment, and enables the incorporation of user-design
preferences.

in this previous analysis, the aeroacoustic predictions had to employ
incomplete FWH surfaces. In the present study, a discussion on the closed
surface requirement is provided for the frequency domain FWH formulation,
although we believe that the approach presented here can also be applied for
the time-domain methodology. We show that all sources computed on the closed
permeable surface may play an important role if the acoustic prediction is
sought at observer positions distributed along the entire circular arc.
However, results obtained for 2D and 3D model problems show that, if wisely
designed, a permeable FWH surface composed only by a finite patch, i.e., an
incomplete surface, can be employed to accurately predict the noise at specific
observer positions. In this case, the surface must be placed between the line
of sight from the sources to the observers, for example, in flyover or sideline
locations. In the current applications, results from finite surfaces agree with
the expected values as long as the source magnitudes decay on elements distant
from the true incident source, i.e., the airframe. Hence, in order for this
approach to be valid, the sources cannot be truncated. The planar setup is
beneficial in airframe noise applications since it avoids contamination by
quadrupole sources crossing the boundaries and also may simplify the surface
design.

feature in biology and hold significant potential for a range of technological
applications, from micro-muscles to shape-morphing optical devices. Here, we
demonstrate both experimentally and computationally that the shape-morphing of
highly-ordered 2D networks constructed of thermoresponsive mesoscale polymeric
fibers strongly depends on the physical attributes of the single fiber, in
particular on its diameter, as well as on the network's density. We show that
based on these parameters, such fiber-networks exhibit one of two thermally
driven morphing behaviors: (i) the fibers stay straight, and the network
preserves its ordered morphology, exhibiting a bulk-like behavior; or (ii) the
fibers buckle and the network becomes messy and highly disordered. Notably, in
both cases, the networks display memory and regain their original ordered
morphology upon shrinking. This hierarchical principle, demonstrated here on a
range of networks, offers a new way for controlling the shape morphing of
materials with mesoscale resolutions and elucidates that minute changes in the
mesoscale structural attributes can translate to a dramatic change in the
morphing behaviors at the macroscale.

good part due to the use of larger models. However, widespread use is
constrained by device hardware limitations, resulting in a substantial
performance gap between state-of-the-art models and those that can be
effectively deployed on small devices. While Knowledge Distillation (KD)
theoretically enables small student models to emulate larger teacher models, in
practice selecting a good student architecture requires considerable human
expertise. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) appears as a natural solution to
this problem but most approaches can be inefficient, as most of the computation
is spent comparing architectures sampled from the same distribution, with
negligible differences in performance. In this paper, we propose to instead
search for a family of student architectures sharing the property of being good
at learning from a given teacher. Our approach AutoKD, powered by Bayesian
Optimization, explores a flexible graph-based search space, enabling us to
automatically learn the optimal student architecture distribution and KD
parameters, while being 20x more sample efficient compared to existing
state-of-the-art. We evaluate our method on 3 datasets; on large images
specifically, we reach the teacher performance while using 3x less memory and
10x less parameters. Finally, while AutoKD uses the traditional KD loss, it
outperforms more advanced KD variants using hand-designed students.

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Dragonfly Wide Field Survey

control of systematics, reaching surface brightness levels of $\mu_r \sim 30$

profiles to $\mu_{r} \sim 28.5$ mag/arcsec$^{2}$ reaching $R=100 - 150$ kpc.
DECaLS surface brightness profiles show good agreement with HSC but are noisier
at large radii. The median profiles of galaxy ensembles in both HSC and DECaLS
reach $R > 200$ kpc without significant bias. At $0.19<z<0.50$, DECaLS and HSC
measurements of the stellar mass contained within 100 kpc agree within 0.05

outer light with DECaLS at $0.19<z<0.50$ show a similar promise as HSC as a low
scatter proxy of halo mass. The tests and results from this paper represent an
important step forward for accurate measurements of the outer light of massive

dynamical perturbations from the environment. Analyzing i-band images from the
Pan-STARRS1 Survey, we study the optical morphological asymmetry of the host
galaxies of a large, well-defined sample of nearby active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) to investigate the role of mergers and interactions in triggering
nuclear activity. The AGNs, comprising 245 type 1 and 4514 type 2 objects, are
compared with 4537 star-forming galaxies matched in redshift and stellar mass.
We develop a comprehensive masking strategy to isolate the emission of the
target from foreground stars and other contaminating sources, all the while
retaining projected companions of comparable brightness that may be major
mergers. Among three variants of nonparametric indices, both the popular CAS
asymmetry parameter and the outer asymmetry parameter (A_outer) yield robust
measures of morphological distortion for star-forming galaxies and type 2 AGNs,
while only A_outer is effective for type 1 AGNs. The shape asymmetry, by
comparison, is affected more adversely by background noise. Asymmetry indices >
0.4 effectively trace systems that are candidate ongoing mergers. Contrary to
theoretical expectations, galaxy interactions and mergers are not the main
drivers of nuclear activity, at least not in our sample of low-redshift,
relatively low-luminosity AGNs, whose host galaxies are significantly less
asymmetric than the control sample of star-forming galaxies. Moreover, type 2
AGNs are morphologically indistinguishable from their type 1 counterparts. The
level of AGN activity does not correlate with asymmetry, not even among the
major merger candidates. As a by-product, we find, consistent with previous
studies, that the average asymmetry of star-forming galaxies increases above
the main sequence, although not all major mergers exhibit enhanced star
formation.

solutions of the Euler equations in Euclidean space, of Beltrami type, that can
simulate a universal Turing machine. In particular, these solutions possess
undecidable trajectories. Heretofore, the known Turing complete constructions
of steady Euler flows in dimension 3 or higher were not associated to a
prescribed metric. Our solutions do not have finite energy, and their
construction makes crucial use of the non-compactness of $\mathbb R^3$, however
they can be employed to show that an arbitrary tape-bounded Turing machine can
be robustly simulated by a Beltrami flow on $\mathbb T^3$ (with the standard
flat metric). This shows that there exist steady solutions to the Euler
equations on the flat torus exhibiting dynamical phenomena of (robust)
computational complexity as high as desired. We also quantify the energetic
cost for a Beltrami field on $\mathbb T^3$ to simulate a tape-bounded Turing
machine, thus providing additional support for the space-bounded Church-Turing
thesis. Another implication of our construction is that a Gaussian random
Beltrami field on Euclidean space exhibits arbitrarily high computational
complexity with probability $1$. Finally, our proof also yields Turing complete
flows and diffeomorphisms on $\mathbb{S}^2$ with zero topological entropy, thus
disclosing a certain degree of independence within different hierarchies of

data structure that returns an approximate shortest path distance between any
two query vertices up to a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor. Thorup (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004)
and Klein (SODA 2002) independently constructed a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
distance oracle with $O(n\log n)$ space, measured in number of words, and
$O(1)$ query time when $G$ is an undirected planar graph with $n$ vertices and
$\epsilon$ is a fixed constant. Many follow-up works gave
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distance oracles with various trade-offs between
space and query time. However, improving $O(n\log n)$ space bound without
sacrificing query time remains an open problem for almost two decades. In this
work, we resolve this problem affirmatively by constructing a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distance oracle with optimal $O(n)$ space and $O(1)$
query time for undirected planar graphs and fixed $\epsilon$.
  We also make substantial progress for planar digraphs with non-negative edge
weights. For fixed $\epsilon > 0$, we give a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
distance oracle with space $o(n\log(Nn))$ and $O(\log\log(Nn)$ query time; here
$N$ is the ratio between the largest and smallest positive edge weight. This
improves Thorup's (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004) $O(n\log(Nn)\log n)$ space bound by
more than a logarithmic factor while matching the query time of his structure.
This is the first improvement for planar digraphs in two decades, both in the
weighted and unweighted setting.

accuracy as quantified by the root-mean-squared difference $(\sim 0.003)$ and
the $R^2$ $(\sim 0.99)$ between the reference QCT and predictions of the STD
model is high for the test set and off-grid state specific initial conditions
and for initial conditions drawn from reactant state distributions
characterized by translational, rotational and vibrational temperatures.
Compared with a more coarse grained distribution-to-distribution (DTD) model
evaluated on the same initial state distributions, the STD model shows
comparable performance with the additional benefit of the state resolution in
the reactant preparation. Starting from specific initial states also leads to a
more diverse range of final state distributions which requires a more
expressive neural network to be used compared with DTD. Direct comparison
between explicit QCT simulations, the STD model, and the widely used
Larsen-Borgnakke (LB) model shows that the STD model is quantitative whereas
the LB model is qualitative at best for rotational distributions $P(j')$ and
fails for vibrational distributions $P(v')$. As such the STD model can be
well-suited for simulating nonequilibrium high-speed flows, e.g., using the

Fish are poikilothermic animals, so feed intake, digestion, metabolism and
ultimately growth are affected by water temperature. This study aimed to
evaluate growth performance, feed utilisation, nutrient apparent digestibility,
and N losses to the environment in seabream juveniles reared under low
temperature (13 degrees Celsius). Three isolipid and isoenergetic diets were
formulated: a commercial-like diet (COM) with 44% crude protein and 27.5%
fishmeal; and 2 diets with 42% CP (ECO and ECOSup), reduced FM inclusion, and
15% poultry meal. ECOSup diet was supplemented with a mix of feed additives
intended to promote fish growth and feed intake. The ECO diets presented lower
production costs than the COM diet and included more sustainable ingredients.
Seabream juveniles (154.5 g) were randomly assigned to triplicate tanks and fed
the diets for 84 days. Fish fed the ECOSup and COM diets attained a similar
final body weight. ECOSup fed fish presented significantly higher HSI than COM
fed fish, probably due to higher hepatic glycogen reserves. The VSI of ECOSup
fed fish were significantly lower compared to COM fed fish, which is a positive
achievement from a consumer point of view. Nutrient digestibility was similar
in ECOSup and COM diets. Feeding fish with the ECO diets resulted in lower
faecal N losses when compared to COM fed fish. Feeding seabream with an
eco-friendly diet with a mix of feed additives promoted growth, improved fish
nutritional status and minimised N losses to the environment whilst lowering
production costs. Nutritional strategies that ultimately promote feed intake
and diet utilisation are valuable tools that may help conditioning fish to
sustain growth even under adverse conditions.

amount of phenomenology in the quantum Hall regime. However it has remained
challenging to formulate this concept properly within a single Landau level.
Recently a low-energy noncommutative field theory for bosons at Landau-level
filling factor $\nu=1$ has been formulated by Dong and Senthil. In the limit of
long-wavelength and small-amplitude gauge fluctuation, they found it reduces to
the celebrated Halperin-Lee-Read theory of composite fermion liquid. In this
work we consider a Bose-Fermi mixture at total filling factor $\nu=1$.
Different from previous work, the number density of composite fermions in the
mixture and corresponding Fermi momentum can be tuned by changing the filling
factor of bosons, $\nu_b = 1 -\nu_f$. This tunability enables us to study the
dilute limit $\nu_b\ll 1$, which allows for a controlled and asymptotically
exact calculation of the energy dispersion and effective mass of composite
fermions. Furthermore, the approximation of the low-energy description by a
commutative field theory is manifestly justified. Most importantly, we
demonstrate gauge fluctuations acquire a Higgs mass due to the presence of a
composite boson condensate, as a result of which the system behaves like a
genuine Landau Fermi liquid. Combined with the irrelevance of four-fermion
interaction in the dilute limit, we are able to obtain asymptotically exact
properties of this composite fermion Fermi liquid. In the opposite limit of
$\nu_f\ll 1$, the Higgs mass goes to zero and we find crossover between Fermi
liquid and non-Fermi liquid as temperature increases. Observing these
properties either experimentally or numerically provides unambiguous evidence
of not only the composite fermions and the Fermi surface they form, but also
the presence of emergent gauge fields and their fluctuations due to strong
correlation.

MoO3 acts as a medium for hydrogen storage via hydrogen spillover (H atom
donation from proton and electron sources to a support), for which the
energetics of H atoms on MoO3 are of importance. Despite the seeming simplicity
of hydrogen spillover, previously reported ab initio results for the H
adsorption on MoO3 contradict both experimental work and other ab initio
results. In the present study, we resolve these discrepancies and provide a
comprehensive ab initio understanding of H adsorption for MoO3 in the bulk and
on the surface. To this end, we systematically investigate various
exchange-correlation functionals and various H concentrations, and we carefully
track the various relevant H positions. For a dilute H concentration, the
asymmetric oxygen site (Oa) is found to be energetically the most favorable.
With increasing H content, the difference of the H adsorption energies between
the terminal (Ot) and the Oa sites becomes smaller. Previous contradictions are
ascribed mostly to the disregard of the H position along the Oa-Oa zig-zag
chains in the intrabilayer region. Using the modern non-empirical
strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient
approximation (GGA), the dilute-limit H adsorption energies are obtained as
-2.89 eV/(H atom) and -2.97 eV/(H atom) in the bulk and on the surface,
respectively, and the activation energy of H diffusion between the Oa sites as
0.11-0.15 eV/(H atom), consistent with previous experiments.

load and electricity pricing in the $L_2$ space and its isomorphic vector
space, which also yields the general algebraic model of load and pricing

and load associated with time course and necessity of pricing to sufficiently
convey information on how load results in supply cost. It describes classic
paradigm of modeling in a general algebraic form and formally proves the
ineffectiveness of classic integral-based pricing in modeling. It consequently
introduces to: describe electricity supply cost by a mapping defined on an
isomorphic space of the original space of load constituted by orthonormal basis
that quantifies the dynamism of load, named the space of dynamism; a pricing
model defined on the space of dynamism that sufficiently conveys the
information; a further derived computational model of pricing based on the
Fourier series; simple examples to demonstrate use of the proposed pricing and
its effectiveness in distinguishing loads and reflecting supply cost associated
with time course, which theoretically completes the incentive to reshape loads.

H\""older regularity of the solution to semilinear stochastic partial
differential equation driven by a multiplicative space-time white noise: $$ u_t
= au_{xx} + bu_{x} + cu + \bar b|u|^\lambda u_{x} + \sigma(u)\dot W,\quad
(t,x)\in(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}; \quad u(0,\cdot) = u_0, $$ where $\lambda >
0$. The function $\sigma(u)$ is either bounded Lipschitz or super-linear in
$u$. The noise $\dot W$ is a space-time white noise. The coefficients $a,b,c$
depend on $(\omega,t,x)$, and $\bar b$ depends on $(\omega,t)$. The
coefficients $a,b,c,\bar{b}$ are uniformly bounded, and $a$ satisfies
ellipticity condition. The random initial data $u_0 = u_0(\omega,x)$ is
nonnegative.
  We have the maximal H\""older regularity by employing the H\""older embedding
theorem. For example, if $\lambda \in(0,1]$ and $\sigma(u)$ has Lipschitz
continuity, linear growth, and boundedness in $u$, for $T<\infty$ and
$\varepsilon>0$, $$u \in C^{1/4 - \varepsilon,1/2 -
\varepsilon}_{t,x}([0,T]\times\mathbb{R})\quad(a.s.). $$ On the other hand, if
$\lambda\in(0,1)$ and $\sigma(u) = |u|^{1+\lambda_0}$ with
$\lambda_0\in[0,1/2)$, for $T<\infty$ and $\varepsilon>0$, $$u \in
C^{\frac{1/2-(\lambda -1/2) \vee \lambda_0}{2} - \varepsilon,1/2-(\lambda -1/2)
\vee \lambda_0 - \varepsilon}_{t,x}([0,T]\times\mathbb{R})\quad (a.s.).$$ It
should be noted that if $\sigma(u)$ is bounded Lipschitz in $u$, the H\""older
regularity of the solution is independent of $\lambda$. However, if $\sigma(u)$
is super-linear in $u$, the H\""older regularities of the solution are affected
by nonlinearities, $\lambda$ and $\lambda_0.$

compression, aims at transferring the knowledge of a bigger network (teacher)
to a much smaller network (student). Conventional KD methods usually employ the
teacher model trained in a supervised manner, where output labels are treated
only as targets. Extending this supervised scheme further, we introduce a new
type of teacher model for connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based
sequence models, namely Oracle Teacher, that leverages both the source inputs

learns a more accurate CTC alignment by referring to the target information, it
can provide the student with more optimal guidance. One potential risk for the
proposed approach is a trivial solution that the model's output directly copies
the target input. Based on a many-to-one mapping property of the CTC algorithm,
we present a training strategy that can effectively prevent the trivial
solution and thus enables utilizing both source and target inputs for model
training. Extensive experiments are conducted on two sequence learning tasks:
speech recognition and scene text recognition. From the experimental results,
we empirically show that the proposed model improves the students across these
tasks while achieving a considerable speed-up in the teacher model's training
time.

a decision trust region using the convex hull of the observations, to ensure
credible recommendations and avoid extrapolation. We efficiently incorporate
this representation using column generation and propose a more flexible

Then, we propose an ensemble learning approach that enforces constraint
satisfaction over multiple bootstrapped estimators or multiple algorithms. In
combination with domain-driven components, the embedded models and trust region
define a mixed-integer optimization problem for prescription generation. We
implement this framework as a Python package (OptiCL) for practitioners. We
demonstrate the method in both World Food Programme planning and chemotherapy

use of ensembles to control model robustness, the consideration of multiple

Transformer (TFT) was proposed to predict departure and arrival delays
simultaneously for multiple airports at once. This approach can capture complex

forecast selected delay metrics up to four hours into the future. When dealing

naval reactor fuel while it is on-board an operational nuclear submarine.
Proposals to extend existing safeguards technologies and practices are
complicated by the need for civilian international inspectors to gain access to
the interior of the submarine and the reactor compartment, which raises
national security concerns. In this paper we show that implementing safeguards
on submarine propulsion reactors using a low-energy antineutrino reactor-off

together. We find that, using inverse beta decay (IBD), detectors can achieve a

measures with compass fidelity. Whilst electronic coherence is found to be an

demonstrate the importance of realistic models, and appropriate choice of

a tremendous challenge to healthcare workers globally. Healthcare personnel
(HCP) is facing a consistent risk of hospital-acquired infections, and
subsequently higher rates of morbidity and mortality. We proposed a domain
knowledge-driven infection risk model to quantify the individual HCP and the
population-level healthcare facility risks. For individual-level risk
estimation, a time-variant infection risk model is proposed to capture the
transmission dynamics of CVDs. At the population-level, the infection risk is
estimated using a Bayesian network model constructed from three feature sets
including individual-level factors, engineering control factors, and
administrative control factors. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the
uncertainty in the individual infection risk can be attributed to two
variables: the number of close contacts and the viral transmission probability.
The model validation was implemented in the transmission probability model,
individual level risk model, and population-level risk model using a
Coronavirus disease case study. Regarding the first, multivariate logistic
regression was applied for a cross-sectional data in the UK with an AIC value
of 7317.70 and a 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 78.23%. For the second
model, we collected laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases of HCP in different
occupations. The occupation-specific risk evaluation suggested the highest-risk
occupations were registered nurses, medical assistants, and respiratory
therapists, with estimated risks of 0.0189, 0.0188, and 0.0176, respectively.
To validate the population-level risk model, the infection risk in Texas and

make progress in our society. The study of income inequality is well received
through the Gini coefficient, which is used to measure degrees of inequality in
general. While this method is effective in several aspects, the Gini
coefficient alone inevitably overlooks minority subpopulations (e.g.
occupations) which results in missing undetected patterns of inequality in
minority.
  In this study, the surveys of incomes and occupations from more than 12
millions households across Thailand have been analyzed by using both Gini
coefficient and network densities of income domination networks to get insight
regarding the degrees of general and occupational income inequality issues. The
results show that, in agricultural provinces, there are less issues in both
types of inequality (low Gini coefficients and network densities), while some
non-agricultural provinces face an issue of occupational income inequality
(high network densities) without any symptom of general income inequality (low
Gini coefficients). Moreover, the results also illustrate the gaps of income
inequality using estimation statistics, which not only support whether income
inequality exists, but that we are also able to tell the magnitudes of income
gaps among occupations. These results cannot be obtained via Gini coefficients
alone. This work serves as a use case of analyzing income inequality from both
general population and subpopulations perspectives that can be utilized in
studies of other countries.

capacity-based tariffs will become more relevant with the increasing

where consumers are financially penalised for exceeding their subscribed
capacity, or alternatively their demand is limited to the subscribed level. The
penalty or limitation can either be static (always active) or dynamic, meaning
that it is only activated when there are active grid constraints. We
investigate the cost impact for static and dynamic capacity subscription
tariffs, for 84 consumers based on six years of historical load data. We use
several approaches for finding the optimal subscription level ex ante. The
results show that annual costs remain both stable and similar for most
consumers, with a few exceptions for those that have high peak demand. In the
case of a physical limitation, it is important to use a stochastic approach for
the optimal subscription level to avoid excessive demand limitations. Facing
increased peak loads due to electrification, regulators should consider a move
to capacity-based tariffs in order to reduce cross-subsidisation between
consumers and increase cost reflectivity without impacting the DSO cost

Dirichlet boundary conditions for computational models defined by point clouds.
Point cloud models often stem from laser or structured-light scanners which are
used to scan existing mechanical structures for which CAD models either do not
exist or from which the artifact under investigation deviates in shape or
topology. Instead of reconstructing a CAD model from point clouds via surface
reconstruction and a subsequent boundary conforming mesh generation, a direct
analysis without pre-processing is possible using embedded domain finite
element methods. These methods use non-boundary conforming meshes which calls
for a weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions. For point cloud based
models, Dirichlet boundary conditions are usually imposed using a diffuse
interface approach. This leads to a significant computational overhead due to
the necessary computation of domain integrals. Additionally, undesired side
effects on the gradients of the solution arise which can only be controlled to
some extent. This paper develops a new sharp interface approach for point cloud
based models which avoids both issues. The computation of domain integrals is
circumvented by an implicit approximation of corresponding Voronoi diagrams of
higher order and the resulting sharp approximation avoids the side-effects of
diffuse approaches. Benchmark examples from the graphics as well as the
computational mechanics community are used to verify the algorithm. All
algorithms are implemented in the FCMLab framework and provided at

influences human attention, and conversly attention offers a cue to determine
sound source on multi-face video. Guided by these findings, a visual-audio
multi-task network (VAM-Net) is introduced to predict saliency and locate sound
source. VAM-Net consists of three branches corresponding to visual, audio and
face modalities. Visual branch has a two-stream architecture to capture spatial

faces, respectively. Finally, a spatio-temporal multi-modal graph (STMG) is
constructed to model the interaction among multiple faces. With joint
optimization of these branches, the intrinsic correlation of the tasks of

protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top
of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. DeFi compositions may impact the
development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web
technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a
dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum
accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart
contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchanges and
lending protocols have high degree and centrality values, that interactions
among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and
that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols.
Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested
set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. With a ground
truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm's capability
by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building
blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations
of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of
DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block
structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the
practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the
recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the
hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a
similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would
be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better
understanding of a new family of financial products.

  Tidal Energy Conference, 5-9th Sept 2021, Plymouth, UK. 10 pages, 11 figures.

coastal protection against erosion and clean, renewable electrical power
production. In this work, the principle of an artificial canopy is explored,
which consists of vertical structures, arranged in rows parallel to the
coastline. Sea waves, which propagate towards the shore, interact with the
obstacle rows. A part of the wave energy is reflected back towards the ocean,
another part is transmitted to the shoreline, while the rest of the energy is,
in theory, available for energy production (although losses, due to viscous
effects within the fluid, or imperfect efficiency of the power conversion
mechanism, will unavoidably take place). First, a simple geometric
representation of the reflection/transmission properties of individual, fixed
rows is presented. In the case of moving rows, relationships are drawn between
the internal stiffness and damping parameters of the devices, on the one hand,
and their reflection, transmission and absorption characteristics, on the other
hand. Array properties are then examined, depending on both individual row
design parameters and row-to-row spacing values, using the wide-spacing
approximation. A numerical case study illustrates the capabilities of the
proposed modelling framework, with arrays of vertical, oscillating rectangular
plates. The transmitted, reflected and absorbed wave spectra are examined,
along with their dependencies on individual oscillator control tuning and array
design parameters.

  and education 2021, p-ISSN: 1892-0713",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Facility management, which concerns the administration, operations, and
mainte-nance of buildings, is a sector undergoing significant changes while
becoming digitalized and data driven. In facility management sector, companies
seek to ex-tract value from data about their buildings. As a consequence,
craftsmen, such as janitors, are becoming involved in data curation. Data
curation refers to activities related to cleaning, assembling, setting up, and
stewarding data to make them fit existing templates. Craftsmen in facility
management, despite holding a pivotal role for successful data curation in the
domain, are understudied and disregarded. To remedy this, our holistic case
study investigates how janitors' data curation practices shape the data being
produced in three facility management organiza-tions. Our findings illustrate
the unfortunate that janitors are treated more like a sensor than a human data
curator. This treatment makes them less engaged in data curation, and hence do
not engage in a much necessary correction of essential fa-cility data. We apply
the conceptual lens of invisible work - work that blends into the background
and is taken for granted - to explain why this happens and how data comes to
be. The findings also confirm the usefulness of a previously pro-posed
analytical framework by using it to interpret data curation practices within
facility management. The paper contributes to practitioners by proposing
training and education in data curation.

systems to improve the efficiency of the main disciplines of such systems.
Formal techniques, such as graphs, are a common way of describing Digital Twin
models, allowing broad types of tools to provide Digital Twin based services
such as fault detection in production lines. Obtaining correct and complete
formal Digital Twins of physical systems can be a complicated and time
consuming process, particularly for manufacturing systems with plenty of
physical objects and the associated manufacturing processes. Automatic
generation of Digital Twins is an emerging research field and can reduce time
and costs. In this paper, we focus on the generation of Digital Twins for
flexible manufacturing systems with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) on the
factory floor. In particular, we propose an architectural framework and the
associated design choices and software development tools that facilitate
automatic generation of Digital Twins for AGVs. Specifically, the scope of the
generated digital twins is controlling AGVs in the factory floor. To this end,
we focus on different control levels of AGVs and utilize graph theory to
generate the graph-based Digital Twin of the factory floor.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the multi-task sentiment classification problem in
the continual learning setting, i.e., a model is sequentially trained to
classifier the sentiment of reviews of products in a particular category. The
use of common sentiment words in reviews of different product categories leads
to large cross-task similarity, which differentiates it from continual learning
in other domains. This knowledge sharing nature renders forgetting reduction
focused approaches less effective for the problem under consideration. Unlike
existing approaches, where task-specific masks are learned with specifically
presumed training objectives, we propose an approach called Task-aware Dropout
(TaskDrop) to generate masks in a random way. While the standard dropout
generates and applies random masks for each training instance per epoch for
effective regularization, TaskDrop applies random masking for task-wise
capacity allocation and reuse. We conducted experimental studies on three
multi-task review datasets and made comparison to various baselines and
state-of-the-art approaches. Our empirical results show that regardless of
simplicity, TaskDrop overall achieved competitive performances for all the
three datasets, especially after relative long term learning. This demonstrates
that the proposed random capacity allocation mechanism works well for continual
sentiment classification.

  Beaming the Answer?","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As Covid-19 has increased the need for connectivity around the world,
researchers are targeting new technologies that could improve coverage and
connect the unconnected in order to make progress toward the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, drones are seen as one of the
key features of 6G wireless networks that could extend the coverage of previous
wireless network generations. That said, limited on-board energy seems to be
the main drawback that hinders the use of drones for wireless coverage.
Therefore, different wireless and wired charging techniques, such as laser
beaming, charging stations, and tether stations are proposed. In this paper, we
analyze and compare these different charging techniques by performing extensive
simulations for the scenario of drone-assisted data collection from
ground-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We analyze the strengths and
weaknesses of each charging technique, and finally show that laser-powered
drones strongly compete with, and outperform in some scenarios other charging
techniques.
