most of the cell's processes, and essential for applications, e.g. drug design
or protein engineering. We tackle rigid body protein-protein docking, i.e.,
computationally predicting the 3D structure of a protein-protein complex from
the individual unbound structures, assuming no conformational change within the
proteins happens during binding. We design a novel pairwise-independent
SE(3)-equivariant graph matching network to predict the rotation and
translation to place one of the proteins at the right docked position relative
to the second protein. We mathematically guarantee a basic principle: the
predicted complex is always identical regardless of the initial locations and
orientations of the two structures. Our model, named EquiDock, approximates the
binding pockets and predicts the docking poses using keypoint matching and
alignment, achieved through optimal transport and a differentiable Kabsch
algorithm. Empirically, we achieve significant running time improvements and
often outperform existing docking software despite not relying on heavy
candidate sampling, structure refinement, or templates.

momentum on the standardization discussions for 5G advanced and beyond. One of
the biggest challenges for real world ML deployment is the need for labeled
signals and big measurement campaigns. To overcome those problems, we propose
the use of untrained neural networks (UNNs) for MIMO channel
recreation/estimation and low overhead reporting. The UNNs learn the
propagation environment by fitting a few channel measurements and we exploit
their learned prior to provide higher channel estimation gains. Moreover, we
present a UNN for simultaneous channel recreation for multiple users, or
multiple user equipment (UE) positions, in which we have a trade-off between
the estimated channel gain and the number of parameters. Our results show that
transfer learning techniques are effective in accessing the learned prior on
the environment structure as they provide higher channel gain for neighbouring
users. Moreover, we indicate how the under-parameterization of UNNs can further
enable low-overhead channel state information (CSI) reporting.

puzzle and have a discrete spectrum, whilst retaining a semiclassical
description. A novelty of these models is that they contain non-trivially
correlated spacetime branes or, equivalently, nonlocal interactions in their
action. Such nonlocal correlations are motivated in the low-energy gravity
theory by integrating out UV degrees of freedom. Demanding factorization fixes
almost all brane correlators, and the exact geometric expansion of the
partition function collapses to only two terms: the black hole saddle and a
subleading ``half-wormhole'' geometry, whose sum yields the desired discrete
spectrum. By mapping the insertion of correlated branes to a certain
double-trace deformation in the dual matrix integral, we show that
factorization and discreteness also persist non-perturbatively. While in our
model all wormholes completely cancel, they are still computationally relevant:
self-averaging quantities, like the Page curve, computed in the original theory
with wormholes, accurately approximate observables in our theory, which
accounts for UV corrections. Our models emphasize the importance of
correlations between different disconnected components of spacetime, providing
a possible resolution to the factorization puzzle in any number of dimensions.

bias in word or sentence embeddings to evaluate debiasing methods or compare

Another example is ad discontinuity, where existing ads may appear and
disappear from the market for non negligible amounts of time due to a variety
of reasons (e.g., depletion of budget, pausing by the advertiser, flagging by
the system, and more). These behaviors sometimes cause the model's loss surface
to change dramatically over short periods of time. To address these behaviors,
fresh models are highly important, and to achieve this (and for several other
reasons) incremental training on small chunks of past events is often employed.
These behaviors and algorithmic optimizations occasionally cause model
parameters to grow uncontrollably large, or \emph{diverge}. In this work
present a systematic method to prevent model parameters from diverging by
imposing a carefully chosen set of constraints on the model's latent vectors.
We then devise a method inspired by primal-dual optimization algorithms to
fulfill these constraints in a manner which both aligns well with incremental
model training, and does not require any major modifications to the underlying
model training algorithm.

past approaches which employ 2D representations, we focus on using 3D
representations of people, located in three-dimensional space. To this end, we
develop a method, Human Mesh and Appearance Recovery (HMAR) which in addition
to extracting the 3D geometry of the person as a SMPL mesh, also extracts
appearance as a texture map on the triangles of the mesh. This serves as a 3D
representation for appearance that is robust to viewpoint and pose changes.
Given a video clip, we first detect bounding boxes corresponding to people, and
for each one, we extract 3D appearance, pose, and location information using
HMAR. These embedding vectors are then sent to a transformer, which performs
spatio-temporal aggregation of the representations over the duration of the
sequence. The similarity of the resulting representations is used to solve for
associations that assigns each person to a tracklet. We evaluate our approach
on the Posetrack, MuPoTs and AVA datasets. We find that 3D representations are
more effective than 2D representations for tracking in these settings, and we

of the predictors are truly associated with a multivariate response. It is more
accurate to model multiple responses as one vector rather than separating each
component one by one. This is particularly true for complex traits having
multiple correlated components. A Bayesian multivariate variable selection
(BMVS) approach is proposed to select important predictors influencing the
multivariate response from a candidate pool with an ultrahigh dimension. By
applying the sample-size-dependent spike and slab priors, the BMVS approach
satisfies the strong selection consistency property under certain conditions,
which represents the advantages of BMVS over other existing Bayesian
multivariate regression-based approaches. The proposed approach considers the
covariance structure of multiple responses without assuming independence and
integrates the estimation of covariance-related parameters together with all
regression parameters into one framework through a fast updating MCMC
procedure. It is demonstrated through simulations that the BMVS approach
outperforms some other relevant frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The
proposed BMVS approach possesses the flexibility of wide applications,
including genome-wide association studies with multiple correlated phenotypes
and a large scale of genetic variants and/or environmental variables, as
demonstrated in the real data analyses section. The computer code and test data

in smooth areas more accurately point toward the objective function's minimizer
than those in variable areas. Motivated by this observation, two SDPs have been
designed to increase iteration step-sizes in the smooth areas and reduce
iteration step-sizes in the variable areas relative to a conventional
expectation maximization preconditioner. The momentum technique used for
convergence acceleration can be viewed as a special case of SDP. We have proved
the global convergence of SDP-BSREM algorithms by assuming certain
characteristics of the preconditioner. By means of numerical experiments using
both simulated and clinical PET data, we have shown that the SDP-BSREM
algorithms substantially improve the convergence rate, as compared to
conventional BSREM and a vendor's implementation as Q.Clear. Specifically,
SDP-BSREM algorithms converge 35\%-50\% faster in reaching the same objective
function value than conventional BSREM and commercial Q.Clear algorithms.
Moreover, we showed in phantoms with hot, cold and background regions that the
SDP-BSREM algorithms approached the values of a highly converged reference
image faster than conventional BSREM and commercial Q.Clear algorithms.

their cheap fabrication, superior performance in both solar cell and light

quasi two-dimensional(2D) halide perovskite has more intriguing spin related
physics than its 3D counterpart. For instance, the detection and brightening of
dark exciton (DX) in 2D halide perovskite attracts much attention since these
species can be used in opto-spintronic and quantum computing devices. Here, we
report the gradually brightened emission of the DX at 2.33 eV with the
thickness decreases in (PEA)2PbI4 single crystalline nanoflake, which hitherto
has not been reported. By coupling with in-plane (IP) magnetic field in Voigt
configuration, the DX emission can be sharply enhanced, while for the
out-of-plane (OP) magnetic field in Faraday configuration, the DX emission has
no noticeable change, which can be reconciled with the theory interpretation of
magnetic field dependent wave function mixing between the four exciton states
fi1, fi2, fi3- , fi3+. The emission of DX fi2 at 2.335 eV and the fine
splitting of all the four states are observed in static PL spectroscopy for the
first time. Our work thus clarifies the debating questions regarding to
previous research on DX behavior in 2D halide perovskite material and sheds
light on the road of realizing opto-spintronic or quantum computing devices

orthounimodality (OU) and its use in shape-constrained distributionally robust
optimization (DRO). As a key motivation, we argue how such type of DRO is
well-suited to tackle multivariate extreme event estimation by giving
statistically valid confidence bounds on target extremal probabilities. In
particular, we explain how DRO can be used as a nonparametric alternative to
conventional extreme value theory that extrapolates tails based on theoretical
limiting distributions, which could face challenges in bias-variance control
and other technical complications. We also explain how OU resolves the
challenges in interpretability and robustness faced by existing distributional
shape notions used in the DRO literature. Methodologically, we characterize the
extreme points of the OU distribution class in terms of what we call OU sets
and build a corresponding Choquet representation, which subsequently allows us
to reduce OU-DRO into moment problems over infinite-dimensional random
variables. We then develop, in the bivariate setting, a geometric approach to
reduce such moment problems into finite dimension via a specially constructed
variational problem designed to eliminate suboptimal solutions. Numerical
results illustrate how our approach gives rise to valid and competitive
confidence bounds for extremal probabilities.

High-frame rate dynamic images were reconstructed from sparse (k,t)-space data
acquired along a stack-of-stars trajectory using a subspace-based method for

Simulations showed that accuracy and precision of T1 mapping can be improved

non-colinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in this compound remains an open

helimagnetic state appears as a consequence of the long-range magnetic exchange
interactions, featuring sizable magnetic moments in the iodine atoms. We
demonstrate that the electronic density reconstruction accounting for the

spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate that the ferroelectric order is controlled
by the iodine spin-orbit coupling, and leads to an associated
electronically-driven distortion in the lattice. Our results establish the
microscopic origin of the multiferroic behavior in monolayer NiI$_2$, putting
forward the coexistence of helical magnetic order and ligand spin-orbit

  Communications 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deploying federated learning (FL) over wireless networks with
resource-constrained devices requires balancing between accuracy, energy
efficiency, and precision. Prior art on FL often requires devices to train deep
neural networks (DNNs) using a 32-bit precision level for data representation
to improve accuracy. However, such algorithms are impractical for
resource-constrained devices since DNNs could require execution of millions of
operations. Thus, training DNNs with a high precision level incurs a high
energy cost for FL. In this paper, a quantized FL framework, that represents
data with a finite level of precision in both local training and uplink
transmission, is proposed. Here, the finite level of precision is captured
through the use of quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and
activations in fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device
trains its QNN and transmits a quantized training result to the base station.
Energy models for the local training and the transmission with the quantization
are rigorously derived. An energy minimization problem is formulated with
respect to the level of precision while ensuring convergence. To solve the
problem, we first analytically derive the FL convergence rate and use a line
search method. Simulation results show that our FL framework can reduce energy
consumption by up to 53% compared to a standard FL model. The results also shed
light on the tradeoff between precision, energy, and accuracy in FL over
wireless networks.

flow equations are examined using the high-order flux reconstruction method.
The established artificial compressibility method (ACM) of \citet{Chorin1967}
is compared to the alternative entropically damped (EDAC) method of
\citet{Clausen2013}, as well as an ACM formulation with hyperbolised diffusion.
While the former requires the solution to be converged to a divergence free
state at each physical time step through pseudo iterations, the latter can be
applied explicitly. We examine the sensitivity of both methods to the
parameterisation for a series of test cases over a range of Reynolds numbers.
As the compressibility is reduced, EDAC is found to give linear improvements in
divergence whereas ACM yields diminishing returns. For the Taylor--Green
vortex, EDAC is found to perform well; however on the more challenging circular
cylinder at $Re=3900$, EDAC gives rise to early transition of the free
shear-layer and over-production of the turbulence kinetic energy. This is
attributed to the spatial pressure fluctuations of the method. Similar
behaviour is observed for an aerofoil at $Re=60,000$ with an attached
transitional boundary layer. It is concluded that hyperbolic diffusion of ACM
can be beneficial but at the cost of case setup time, and EDAC can be an
efficient method for incompressible flow. However, care must be taken as
pressure fluctuations can have a significant impact on physics and the remedy
causes the governing equation to become overly stiff.

different timescales, fast neural activity and slower synaptic weight updates.
Exploiting this timescale separation, we derive the long-time limits of a
single synaptic weight subject to STDP. We show that the pairing model of
presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes controls the synaptic weight dynamics for
small external input, on an excitatory synapse. This result implies in
particular that mean-field analysis of plasticity may miss some important
properties of STDP. Anti-Hebbian STDP seems to favor the emergence of a stable
synaptic weight, but only for high external input. In the case of inhibitory
synapse the pairing schemes matter less, and we observe convergence of the
synaptic weight to a non-null value only for Hebbian STDP. We extensively study
different asymptotic regimes for STDP rules, raising interesting questions for
future works on adaptative neural networks and, more generally, on adaptive
systems.

orbital period -- density relation for Roche lobe-filling stars: the star's
density, as constrained by the observed ellipsoidal variability, is too low for
its mass to exceed $\approx 1.5\,M_{\odot}$. This lower mass significantly
reduces the implied mass of the unseen companion and qualitative interpretation
of the system, such that a normal main-sequence companion with mass
$(2.5-5)\,M_{\odot}$ is fully consistent with the data. We explore evolutionary
scenarios that could produce the binary using MESA and find that its properties
can be matched by models in which a $\sim5\,M_{\odot}$ primary loses most of
its envelope to a companion and is observed in a bloated state before
contracting to become a core helium burning sdOB star. This is similar to the

aspects of massive stars that are largely inaccessible with optical or longer
wavelength observations. This is especially true for the rapidly-rotating Be
and Bn stars, owing to their high temperatures, geometric asymmetries, binary
properties, and evolutionary history. UV spectropolarimetric observations are
extremely sensitive to the photospheric consequences of rapid rotation (i.e.
oblateness, temperature, and surface gravity gradients). Our polarized
radiative-transfer modelling predicts that with low-resolution UV
spectropolarimetry covering 120 -- 300 nm the inclination angle of a rapid
rotator can be determined to within 5 degrees, and the rotation rate to within
1%. The origin of rapid rotation in Be/n stars can be explained by either
single-star or binary evolution, but their relative importance is largely
unknown. Some Be stars have hot sub-luminous (sdO) companions, which at an
earlier phase transferred their envelope (and with it mass and angular
momentum) to the present-day rapid rotator. Through spectral modelling of a
wide range of simulated Be/n+sdO configurations, we demonstrate that
high-resolution high-SNR UV spectroscopy can detect an sdO star even when
$\sim$1,000 times fainter in the UV than its Be/n star companion. This degree
of sensitivity is needed to more fully explore the parameter space of Be/n+sdO

in many relevant quantum algorithms, especially in the field of quantum machine
learning. Therefore, the inefficiency of this loading process means a major
bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we introduce two
approximate quantum-state preparation methods inspired by the Grover-Rudolph
algorithm, which partially solve the problem of loading real functions. Indeed,
by allowing for an infidelity $\epsilon$ and under certain smoothness
conditions, we prove that the complexity of Grover-Rudolph algorithm can be
reduced from $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(2^{k_0(\epsilon)})$, with $n$
the number of qubits and $k_0(\epsilon)$ asymptotically independent of $n$.
This leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of required two-qubit gates.
Aroused by this result, we also propose a variational algorithm capable of
loading functions beyond the aforementioned smoothness conditions. Our
variational ansatz is explicitly tailored to the landscape of the function,
leading to a quasi-optimized number of hyperparameters. This allows us to
achieve high fidelity in the loaded state with high speed convergence for the
studied examples.

Near-optimal thinning procedures achieve this goal by sampling $n$ points from

$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{n})$ discrepancy to $\mathbb{P}$.
Unfortunately, these algorithms suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic
runtime in the sample size $n$. To address this deficiency, we introduce
Compress++, a simple meta-procedure for speeding up any thinning algorithm
while suffering at most a factor of $4$ in error. When combined with the

\sqrt{n} \log^2 n )$ space. Moreover, Compress++ enjoys the same near-linear
runtime given any quadratic-time input and reduces the runtime of
super-quadratic algorithms by a square-root factor. In our benchmarks with
high-dimensional Monte Carlo samples and Markov chains targeting challenging
differential equation posteriors, Compress++ matches or nearly matches the

application to large-scale hyperspectral data. To circumvent these problems, we
present a scalable deep online clustering model, named Spectral-Spatial
Contrastive Clustering (SSCC), based on self-supervised learning. Specifically,
we exploit a symmetric twin neural network comprised of a projection head with
a dimensionality of the cluster number to conduct dual contrastive learning
from a spectral-spatial augmentation pool. We define the objective function by
implicitly encouraging within-cluster similarity and reducing between-cluster
redundancy. The resulting approach is trained in an end-to-end fashion by
batch-wise optimization, making it robust in large-scale data and resulting in
good generalization ability for unseen data. Extensive experiments on three
hyperspectral image benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach

strain tensor of elasticity theory, and thus rather remarkably provides a
unifying description of photons and phonons. Upon a general Double Field Theory
background, which consists of Riemannian and non-Riemannian subspaces, the dual
photon-phonon pair becomes fractonic over the non-Riemannian subspace. When the
elasticity displacement vector condenses, minimally coupled charged particles
acquire an effective mass even in the purely Riemannian case, yielding
predictions for polaron physics and time crystals. Furthermore, the immobility
of neutral particles along the non-Riemannian directions is lifted to a
saturation velocity for charged particles. Utilising the differential geometry
of Double Field Theory we also present curved spacetime extensions which
exhibit general covariance.

this paper shows that the number of parameters that need to be learned can be
significantly smaller than people typically expect. First, we theoretically
design ReLU networks with a few learnable parameters to achieve an attractive
approximation. We prove by construction that, for any Lipschitz continuous
function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with a Lipschitz constant $\lambda>0$, a ReLU network
with $n+2$ intrinsic parameters (those depending on $f$) can approximate $f$
with an exponentially small error $5\lambda \sqrt{d}\,2^{-n}$. Such a result is
generalized to generic continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that the idea
of learning a small number of parameters to achieve a good approximation can be
numerically observed. We conduct several experiments to verify that training a
small part of parameters can also achieve good results for classification
problems if other parameters are pre-specified or pre-trained from a related

spicules in the chromosphere and their signatures in the EUV corona. Here, we
address one important issue, as to why there is not always a one-to-one
correspondence, between Type II spicules and hot coronal plasma signatures,
i.e. beyond TR temperatures. We do not detect any difference in their spectral
properties in a quiet Sun region compared to a region dominated by coronal
loops. On the other hand, the number density close to the foot-points in the
active region is found to be an order of magnitude higher than in the quiet Sun
case. A differential emission measure analysis reveals a peak at $\sim 5 \times
10^5$ K on the order of 10$^{22}$~cm$^{-5}$~K$^{-1}$. Using this result as a
constraint, we conduct numerical simulations and show that with an energy input
of $1.25 \times 10^{24}$ erg (corresponding to $\sim$10 RBEs contributing to
the burst) we manage to reproduce the observation very closely. However,
simulation runs with lower thermal energy input do not reproduce the synthetic
AIA $171 {\AA}$ signatures, indicating that there is a critical number of
spicules required in order to account for the AIA $171{\AA}$ signatures in the
simulation. Furthermore, the higher energy ($1.25 \times 10^{24}$ ergs)
simulations reproduce catastrophic cooling with a cycle duration of $\sim$5

A standard strategy to
construct poisoned data in backdoor attacks is to insert triggers (e.g., rare
words) into selected sentences and alter the original label to a target label.
This strategy comes with a severe flaw of being easily detected from both the
trigger and the label perspectives: the trigger injected, which is usually a
rare word, leads to an abnormal natural language expression, and thus can be
easily detected by a defense model; the changed target label leads the example
to be mistakenly labeled and thus can be easily detected by manual inspections.
To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to perform
textual backdoor attacks which do not require an external trigger, and the
poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The core idea of the proposed strategy
is to construct clean-labeled examples, whose labels are correct but can lead
to test label changes when fused with the training set. To generate poisoned
clean-labeled examples, we propose a sentence generation model based on the
genetic algorithm to cater to the non-differentiable characteristic of text
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy is
not only effective, but more importantly, hard to defend due to its triggerless
and clean-labeled nature. Our work marks the first step towards developing
triggerless attacking strategies in NLP.

thermodynamics (NEQT) that is based on the concept of internal equilibrium
(IEQ) in an enlarged state space involving internal variables as additional
state variables. The IEQ-macrostates are unique in the enlarged state space and
have no memory just as EQ macrostates are in the EQ state space. The approach
provides a clear strategy to identify the internal variables for any model
through several examples. The MNEQT deals directly with system-intrinsic
quantities, which are very useful as they fully describe irreversibility.
Because of this, MNEQT solves a long-standing problem in NEQT of identifying a
unique global temperature T of a system, thus fulfilling Planck's dream of a
global temperature for any system, even if it is not uniform such as when it is
driven between two heat baths; T has the conventional interpretation of
satisfying the Clausius statement that the exchange macroheat flows from hot to
cold, and other sensible criteria expected of a temperature. The concept of the
generalized macroheat dQ converts the Clausius inequality into the Clausius
equality dS=dQ/T, which also covers macrostates with memory, and follows from
the extensivity property. The equality also holds for a NEQ isolated system.
The novel approach is extremely useful as it also works when no internal state
variables are used to study nonunique macrostates in the EQ state space at the
expense of explicit time dependence in the entropy that gives rise to memory
effects. To show the usefulness of the novel approach, we give several examples
such as irreversible Carnot cycle, friction and Brownian motion, the free
expansion, etc.

performance of several divide \& conquer algorithms, and has been extensively
studied for various classes of undirected graphs. It has been shown by Linial,
London and Rabinovich and by Aumann and Rabani that for general $n$-vertex
graphs it is bounded by $O(\log n)$ and the Gupta-Newman-Rabinovich-Sinclair
conjecture asserts that it is $O(1)$ for any family of graphs that excludes
some fixed minor.
  We show that the multicommodity flow-cut gap on \emph{directed} planar graphs
is $O(\log^3 n)$. This is the first \emph{sub-polynomial} bound for any family
of directed graphs of super-constant treewidth. We remark that for general
directed graphs, it has been shown by Chuzhoy and Khanna that the gap is
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/7})$, even for directed acyclic graphs.
  As a direct consequence of our result, we also obtain the first
polynomial-time polylogarithmic-approximation algorithms for the Directed
Non-Bipartite Sparsest-Cut, and the Directed Multicut problems for directed
planar graphs, which extends the long-standing result for undirectd planar

$O(\log^2 n)$-Lipschitz quasipartitions for the shortest-path quasimetric

A key outstanding challenge is the accurate inference of matches between
objects in front of a robot, and those seen in a provided goal image, where
recent works have struggled in the absence of object-specific training data. In
this work, we explore the deterioration of existing methods' ability to infer
matches between objects as the visual shift between observed and goal scenes
increases. We find that a fundamental limitation of the current setting is that
source and target images must contain the same $\textit{instance}$ of every
object, which restricts practical deployment. We present a novel approach to
object matching that uses a large pre-trained vision-language model to match
objects in a cross-instance setting by leveraging semantics together with
visual features as a more robust, and much more general, measure of similarity.
We demonstrate that this provides considerably improved matching performance in
cross-instance settings, and can be used to guide multi-object rearrangement
with a robot manipulator from an image that shares no object
$\textit{instances}$ with the robot's scene.

  We give a family of shifting strategies for the Hessenberg shifted QR
algorithm with provably rapid global convergence on nonsymmetric matrices of
bounded nonnormality, quantified in terms of the condition number of the
eigenvector matrix -- the convergence is linear with a constant rate, and for a
well-chosen strategy from this family, the computational cost of each QR step
scales roughly logarithmically in the eigenvector condition number. The key
ideas in the analysis are: (1) to use certain higher degree shifts to dampen
transient effects due to nonnormality (2) to characterize and detect slowly
converging trajectories with respect to such shifts in terms of certain
symmetry considerations, and to break this symmetry explicitly in the shifting
strategy.

creates a 3D object-level recomposed model of the real scene where we can
simulate the effect of different trajectories. We produce a closed-loop
controller to reactively push objects in a continuous action space. We evaluate
the performance of our RMPC approach by conducting experiments on a real robot

observe that RMPC is robust in cluttered as well as occluded environments and
outperforms the baselines.

Diminishing Returns (DR) property, which implies that they are concave along

DR-submodular maximization subject to a convex constraint and have proposed
efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees. However, in many
applications, e.g., computing the stability number of a graph and mean-field
inference for probabilistic log-submodular models, the DR-submodular function
has the additional property of being \emph{strongly} concave along non-negative
directions that could be utilized for obtaining faster convergence rates. In
this paper, we first introduce and characterize the class of \emph{strongly
DR-submodular} functions and show how such a property implies strong concavity
along non-negative directions. Then, we study $L$-smooth monotone strongly
DR-submodular functions that have bounded curvature, and we show how to exploit
such additional structure to obtain algorithms with improved approximation
guarantees and faster convergence rates for the maximization problem. In
particular, we propose the SDRFW algorithm that matches the provably optimal
$1-\frac{c}{e}$ approximation ratio after only $\lceil\frac{L}{\mu}\rceil$
iterations, where $c\in[0,1]$ and $\mu\geq 0$ are the curvature and the strong
DR-submodularity parameter. Furthermore, we study the Projected Gradient Ascent

as well as a scaling factor for this vector, so that the adjustment is only
applied when needed. Unlike traditional few-shot learning, the model does not

problem in general. Especially when the projection angles are limited and the
measurements are taken in a photon-limited condition, reconstructions from
classical algorithms such as filtered backprojection may lose fidelity and
acquire artifacts due to the missing-cone problem. To obtain satisfactory
reconstruction results, prior assumptions, such as total variation minimization
and nonlocal image similarity, are usually incorporated within the
reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we introduce deep neural networks to
determine and apply a prior distribution in the reconstruction process. Our
neural networks learn the prior directly from synthetic training samples. The
neural nets thus obtain a prior distribution that is specific to the class of
objects we are interested in reconstructing. In particular, we used deep
generative models with 3D convolutional layers and 3D attention layers which
are trained on 3D synthetic integrated circuit (IC) data from a model dubbed
CircuitFaker. We demonstrate that, when the projection angles and photon
budgets are limited, the priors from our deep generative models can
dramatically improve the IC reconstruction quality on synthetic data compared
with maximum likelihood estimation. Training the deep generative models with
synthetic IC data from CircuitFaker illustrates the capabilities of the learned
prior from machine learning. We expect that if the process were reproduced with
experimental data, the advantage of the machine learning would persist. The
advantages of machine learning in limited angle X-ray tomography may further
enable applications in low-photon nanoscale imaging.

and high cadence. Here, we evaluate the capacity of VRO, in tandem with various
current and upcoming neutrino telescopes, to establish AGN as HEAN emitters. To
do so, we assume that the neutrino luminosity from any given AGN at any given
time is proportional to the electromagnetic luminosity. We then estimate the
error with which this fraction can be measured through spatial and temporal
cross-correlation of VRO light curves with IceCube, KM3NeT, and Bakail-GVD. We
find that it may be possible to detect AGN contributions at the $\sim3 \sigma$
level to the HEAN flux even if these AGN contribute only $\sim10\%$ of the HEAN
flux. The bulk of this information comes from spatial correlations, although
the temporal information improves the sensitivity a bit. The results also imply
that if an angular correlation is detected with high signal-to-noise, there may
be prospects to detect a correlation between AGN variability and neutrino
arrival times. The small HEAN fraction estimated here to be accessible to the
entirety of the VRO AGN sample suggests that valuable information on the
character of the emitting AGN may be obtained through similar analyses on

star-forming regions (MSFRs) to determine whether the magnetic field and
outflows are aligned. In 2012, we started a large VLBI campaign with the EVN to
measure the magnetic field orientation and strength toward a sample of 31 MSFRs
(the flux-limited sample) by analyzing the polarized emission of 6.7GHz CH3OH
masers. In the previous papers of the series, we have presented 80% of the
sample. Here, we report the linearly and circularly polarized emission of
6.7GHz CH3OH masers toward the last five MSFRs of the flux-limited sample. The
sources are G30.70-0.07, G30.76-0.05, G31.28+0.06, G32.03+0.06, and
G69.52-0.97. We detected a total of 209 masers, 15% of which show linearly
polarized emission (0.07%-16.7%), and 2% of which show circularly polarized
emission (0.2%-4.2%). Zeeman splitting was measured toward G30.70-0.07,
G32.03+0.06, and G69.52-0.97. The statistical analysis of the entire
flux-limited sample shows that the observations are consistent with a bimodal
distribution in the difference between the 3D magnetic field direction and the
outflow axis, with half the magnetic field directions being perpendicular and
the other half being parallel to the outflow. In addition, we determined that
typical values of the linear and circular polarization fractions for 6.7 GHz
CH3OH masers are Pl=1.0%-2.5% and Pv=0.5%-0.75%, respectively. We found that a
typical Zeeman splitting is in the range between 0.5 m/s and 2.0 m/s. This

currents with spins $s_i,s_j,s_k$, when triangle inequality $s_i\le s_j+s_k$ is
violated. We also show that even for parity even correlation functions the
properties are different inside and outside the triangle inequality. It was
previously shown that if we allow for weakly broken higher spin symmetry,
parity-odd correlators can exist even when triangle inequality is violated. In
this paper we establish a relation between non-conservation Ward-Takahashi (WT)
identities for weakly broken currents using known WT identities for exactly
conserved currents. This allows us to calculate the parity violating results
outside the triangle inequality using parity-even free bosonic and free
fermionic results. In general, there is one parity-odd structure and two
parity-even structures for three-point functions. It can be shown that the
coefficient of one of the parity-even and odd parts can be combined into a
complex parameter $c$ when correlators are expressed in spinor-helicity
variables. When this complex parameter takes real value $c=\pm 1$ it
corresponds to either the free boson or free fermion theory. When $c$ is a pure
phase, it corresponds to Chern-Simons matter theories. Furthermore,
re-expressing known results for conformal collider bounds we see that $\lvert
c\rvert\le 1$ for generic 3d CFTs and $\lvert c\rvert\le f(\Delta_{gap})$ for

relatively pristine systems and have ultra-low gas cooling rates. This makes
them very sensitive to heat injection by annihilation or decay of dark matter

energies 1$-$100 MeV or photons with energies 13.6 eV$-1$ keV, because these
products can be efficiently thermalized in the neutral hydrogen gas of the
dwarfs. Following the methodology of Wadekar and Farrar (2021), we require the
rate of heat injection by DM to not exceed the ultra-low radiative cooling rate
of gas in the Leo T dwarf galaxy. This gives model-independent bounds on $(i)$
the decay lifetime of DM to $e^\pm$ (photons) which are stronger than all the
previous literature for $m_\mathrm{DM}\sim$ 1$-$10 MeV

observables that are defined as the ratios of neutral $B$-meson charged-current
decays into a charged $D$-meson, a charged lepton and a neutrino final state in
the tau and muon channels. A well-studied and simple solution to this charged
current anomaly is to introduce a scalar leptoquark $S_1$ that couples to the
second and third generation of fermions. We investigate how $S_1$ can also
serve as a mediator between the Standard Model and a dark sector. We study this
scenario in detail and estimate the constraints arising from collider searches
for leptoquarks, collider searches for missing energy signals, direct detection
experiments and the dark matter relic abundance. We stress that the production
of a pair of leptoquarks that decays into different final states (i.e. the
commonly called ""mixed"" channels) provides critical information for identifying
the underlying dynamics, and we exemplify this by studying the $t \tau b \nu$
and the resonant $S_1$ plus missing energy channels. We find that direct
detection data provides non-negligible constraints on the leptoquark coupling
to the dark sector, which in turn affects the relic abundance. We also show
that the correct relic abundance can not only arise via standard freeze-out,
but also through conversion-driven freeze-out. We illustrate the rich
phenomenology of the model with a few selected benchmark points, providing a
broad stroke of the interesting connection between lepton flavour violation and

first develop a coupled-mode theory formalism for the modes of a finite lattice

expressions for the bulk and the surface eigenmodes of the system. The
coupled-mode theory formalism is based on a decomposition of the supermodes
into sublattice modes. In the case of the two zero sublattice surface modes,
this leads to periodic oscillations between them without the involvement of the
bulk modes. We analytically show that launching light only on the waveguide
that is located at either edge of the array, can be very effective in
successfully exciting the respective surface mode. We extend our analysis, in
the case of Kerr nonlinearity, and develop a simplified model that accounts
only for the surface modes. By direct numerical simulations, we find that this
model can very accurately capture the dynamics of the surface modes when the
nonlinearity is small or moderate. On the other hand, in the case of strong
nonlinearity, wave mixing leads to the quasi-periodic excitation of the bulk
modes, or even to a chaotic behavior where all the modes of the systems are
excited, and no prominent signature of the surface modes can be detected.

independent of the number of nuisance parameters. In addition, a property
called \emph{local amortization} allows the performance of rigorous statistical
consistency checks that are not accessible to sampling-based methods. TMNRE
promises to become a powerful tool for cosmological data analysis, particularly

from severe to mild/no barren plateaus in the classical optimization. Our work
paves an avenue for greatly improving the trainability of quantum circuits by
incorporating intermediate measurement protocols in currently available quantum

seemingly at odds with this established view. Here, we performed biased and
unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to analyse and characterise the
pathways to crystalline phases from solutions far into the metastable region.
We find that large liquid-like NaCl clusters emerge as the solution
concentration is increased and two-step nucleation pathways are more dominant
than one-step pathways to phase separation. Analyses of cluster size
populations and the ion pair association constant show that these clusters are
transient, unlike the thermodynamically stable prenulceation cluster solute
species that were suggested in other mineralising systems. A Markov State Model
was developed to analyse the mechanisms and timescales for nucleation from
unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories in a reaction coordinate space
characterising the dense regions in clusters and crystalline order. This
allowed calculation of the committor probabilities for the system to relax to
the solution or crystal states, and to estimate the rate of nucleation, which
shows excellent agreement with literature values. From a fundamental nucleation
perspective, our work highlights the need to extend the attribute 'critical' to
an ensemble of clusters which can display a broad range of structures and
include sizeable disordered domains depending upon the reaction
conditions.Moreover, our recent simulation studies demonstrated that carbon
surfaces catalyse the formation of liquid-like NaCl networks which, combined
with the observations here, suggests that alternative pathways beyond the

timescales. We apply our methods to study the phenomenon of Floquet
prethermalization, i.e., exponentially slow heating in quantum spin chains
subject to high-frequency periodic driving. We simulate the dynamics of L=34
qubits for over $10^5$ Floquet periods, corresponding to circuits with millions
of two-qubit gates. The circuits simulated have no additional symmetries and
represent a pure-state evolution in the full $2^L$-dimensional Hilbert space.
This is achieved by distributing the computation over 128 TPU cores. On that
size TPU cluster, we find speedups in wall-clock runtime of 230x and 15x when
compared to reference CPU and single-GPU simulations, respectively, for shorter
30-qubit simulations that can be handled by all three platforms. We study the
computational cost of the simulations, as a function of both the number of
qubits and the number of TPU cores used, up to our maximum capacity of L=40
qubits, which requires a ``full pod"" of 2048 TPU cores with tens of terabytes
of memory in total. For these simulations, an 8-TPU-core machine is comparable
to a single A100 GPU, and thus the full TPU pod is comparable to a machine with
hundreds of GPUs. However, the TPU pod is more energy and cost efficient, and
readily accessible (via Google Cloud), unlike such large many-GPU
configurations. We also study the accumulation of numerical error as a function
of circuit depth in very deep circuits. Our work demonstrates that TPUs can
offer significant advantages for state-of-the-art simulations of quantum

audio has become the preferred choice in common devices. To obtain the same
impact as binaural audio, recent efforts have been directed towards lifting
mono audio to binaural audio conditioned on the visual input from the scene.
Such approaches have not used an important cue for the task: the distance of
different sound producing objects from the microphones. In this work, we argue
that depth map of the scene can act as a proxy for inducing distance
information of different objects in the scene, for the task of audio
binauralization. We propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture with a

While linear optimization is easy [Brand, Kouteck\'y, Ordyniak, AAAI 2021], we
prove that separable convex optimization IS much harder. Moreover, in the pure

parameterized complexity. We show that they yet behave quite differently in the

of the CIRS-observed High Altitude South Polar (HASP) ice cloud observed in
Titan's mid stratosphere during late southern fall. Titan's stratosphere
exhibits significant seasonal changes with temperatures that spatially vary
with seasons. A quantitative analysis of the chemical composition of infrared

detailed laboratory transmittance spectra obtained at numerous temperatures.
However, there is a substantial lack of experimental data on the spectroscopic

especially at Titan-relevant stratospheric conditions. We have therefore
analyzed in laboratory the spectral characteristics and evolution of benzene
ice's vibrational modes at deposition temperatures ranging from 15 K to 130 K,
from the far- to mid-IR spectral region (50 - 8000 cm^{-1}). We have determined
the amorphous to crystalline phase transition of benzene ice and identified
that a complete crystallization is achieved for deposition temperatures between
120 K and 130 K. We have also measured the real and imaginary parts of the ice
complex refractive index of benzene ice from 15 K to 130 K. Our experimental
results significantly extend the current state of knowledge on the deposition
temperature dependence of benzene ice over a broad infrared spectral range, and
provide useful new data for the analysis and interpretation of Titan-observed

does not enable goal-oriented communications in which the effectiveness of the
transmitted information must be considered along with the semantics so as to
execute a certain task. In this paper, a comprehensive semantic communications
framework is proposed for enabling goal-oriented task execution. To capture the
semantics between a speaker and a listener, a common language is defined using
the concept of beliefs to enable the speaker to describe the environment
observations to the listener. Then, an optimization problem is posed to choose
the minimum set of beliefs that perfectly describes the observation while
minimizing the task execution time and transmission cost. A novel top-down
framework that combines curriculum learning (CL) and reinforcement learning
(RL) is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the
proposed CL method outperforms traditional RL in terms of convergence time,
task execution time, and transmission cost during training.

iconoclastic philosopher and polymath who is among the greatest of American
minds. (ii) Abductive inference -- a term coined by C. S. Peirce, which he
defined as ""the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only
logical operation which introduces any new idea.""
  Abductive inference and quantitative economics: Abductive inference plays a
fundamental role in empirical scientific research as a tool for discovery and
data analysis. Heckman and Singer (2017) strongly advocated ""Economists should
abduct."" Arnold Zellner (2007) stressed that ""much greater emphasis on
reductive [abductive] inference in teaching econometrics, statistics, and
economics would be desirable."" But currently, there are no established theory
or practical tools that can allow an empirical analyst to abduct. This paper
attempts to fill this gap by introducing new principles and concrete procedures
to the Economics and Statistics community. I termed the proposed approach as
Abductive Inference Machine (AIM).
  The historical Peirce's experiment: In 1872, Peirce conducted a series of
experiments to determine the distribution of response times to an auditory
stimulus, which is widely regarded as one of the most significant statistical
investigations in the history of nineteenth-century American mathematical
research (Stigler, 1978). On the 150th anniversary of this historical
experiment, we look back at the Peircean-style abductive inference through a
modern statistical lens. Using Peirce's data, it is shown how empirical
analysts can abduct in a systematic and automated manner using AIM.

single polymer chain, represented by the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model, in a

strength between the polymer and solvent is varied. Results show that when the
polymer-solvent interaction is unfavorable, the chain collapses as one would
expect in a poor solvent. For more attractive polymer-solvent interactions, the
solvent quality improves and the chain is increasingly solvated and exhibits
ideal and then swollen conformations. However, as the polymer-solvent
interaction strength is increased further to be more than about twice of the
strength of the polymer-polymer and solvent-solvent interactions, the chain
exhibits an unexpected collapsing behavior. Correspondingly, for strong
polymer-solvent attractions, phase separation is observed in the solutions of
multiple chains. These results indicate that the solvent becomes effectively
poor again with very attractive polymer-solvent interactions. Nonetheless, the
mechanism of chain collapsing and phase separation in this limit differs from
the case with a poor solvent rendered by unfavorable polymer-solvent
interactions. In the latter, the solvent is excluded from the domain of the
collapsed chains while in the former, the solvent is still present in the
pervaded volume of a collapsed chain or in the polymer-rich domain that phase
separates from the pure solvent. In the limit of strong polymer-solvent
attractions, the solvent behaves as a glue to stick monomers together, causing
a single chain to collapse and multiple chains to aggregate and phase separate.

Intuitively, the more an OSR system explores the possibilities of unknowns, the

multi-channel input image and outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each
pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. We
utilize radar data acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites, while the on-ground
data correspond to a set of six raster features: nitrogen rate applied,
precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), and aspect.
We use data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season
(March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August). We present
experiments over four fields of winter wheat and show that our proposed
methodology yields better results than five compared methods, including
multiple linear regression, an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost,

instruments to Cuban physicists; a process that continues today. Doing science
in such `High Tropicallity' scenario has been challenging. Many Cuban

$120^{o}$ spin orientation. In addition to the antiferromagnetic exchange
interaction $J_{\perp}$ between the localized (impurity) and conduction
(itinerant) electrons, our model includes the local repulsion $U$ of the
conduction electrons and the Heisenberg interaction $J_H$ between the
impurities. At half-filling, we obtain the quantum phase diagrams in both
planes $(J_{\perp}, U J_{\perp})$ and $(J_{\perp}, J_{H})$. We identify a
long-range, three-sublattice, spiral magnetic order which dominates the phase
diagrams for small $J_{\perp}$ and moderate $U$, while a Kondo singlet phase
becomes more stable at large $J_{\perp}$. The transition from the spiral
magnetic order to the Kondo singlet phase is a second-order phase transition.
In the $(J_{\perp}, J_{H})$ plane, we observe that the effect of $J_H$ is to
reduce the Kondo singlet phase, giving more room to the spiral magnetic order
phase. It also introduces some small magnetic oscillations of the spiral
magnetic order parameter. At finite doping and when spiral magnetism is
ignored, we find superconductivity with symmetry order parameter $d+id$, which
breaks time reversal symmetry. The superconducting order parameter has a dome
centered at around $5\%$ hole doping, and its amplitude decreases with
increasing $J_{\perp}$. We show that spiral magnetism can coexist with $d+id$
state and that superconductivity is suppressed, indicating that these two
phases are in competition.

relation (KS-relation), depend on the viewing angle. We derive the probability
distributions of the projected areas and masses for nine clouds within 400 pc
from the Sun using 3D dust distribution data from the literature. We find that
the viewing angle can have a dramatic effect on the observed areas and masses
of individual clouds. The joint probability distributions of the areas and
masses are strongly correlated, relatively flat, and can show multiple peaks.
The typical ranges and 50% quartiles of the distributions are roughly 100-200%
and 20-80% of the median value, respectively, making viewing angle effects
important for all individual clouds. The threshold value used to define the
cloud areas is also important; our analysis suggests that the clouds become
more anisotropic for smaller thresholds (larger scales). On average, the areas
and masses of the plane-of-the-sky and face-on projections agree, albeit with a
large scatter. This suggests that sample averages of areas and masses are
relatively free of viewing angle effects, which is important to facilitate
comparisons of extragalactic and galactic data. Ultimately, our results
demonstrate that a cloud's location in the KS-relation is affected by viewing
angle in a non-trivial manner. However, the KS-relation of our sample as a
whole is not strongly affected by these effects, because the co-variance of the
areas and masses causes the observed mean column density to remain relatively
constant.

algorithms given the stringent time requirements. This problem is even more
pronounced in MU-MIMO scheduling where the scheduler can assign multiple users
to the same time-frequency physical resources. Traditional approaches thus
resort to designing heuristics that trade optimality in favor of feasibility of
execution. In this work we treat the MU-MIMO scheduling problem as a
tree-structured combinatorial problem and, borrowing from the recent successes
of AlphaGo Zero, we investigate the feasibility of searching for the best
performing solutions using a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search and

lack of an intrinsic ordering of the users as well as the importance of

representation of the $f\left(R,T\right)$ gravity theory in the presence of a
Cuscuton term in the source field matter Lagrangian. We start by deriving the
scalar-tensor representation of the theory and obtaining its respective
equations of motion. We then introduce the standard metric for a flat
braneworld model with one extra dimension for the general case of a
$f\left(R,T\right)$ theory and study two different models for the source field.
Given the complexity of the field equations, these solutions are obtained
numerically. In these cases, the Cuscuton term effectively amplifies the
effect, by increasing the height of the stability potential barrier and,
consequently, the depth of the minimum of the graviton zero-mode on the brane.
Finally, we study the particular cases of $F(R)+T$ and $R+G\left(T\right)$, for
which only the scalar fields $\varphi$ or $\psi$ are present, respectively, and
we prove that the presence of the scalar field $\varphi$ is essential in the
development of internal structure on the brane.

on their performances. Here we detail three algorithms that produce approximate
ground states for many-body and electronic structure problems, generalizing
some previously known results for 2-local Hamiltonians. Each method comes with
asymptotic bounds on the energies produced. The first one produces a separable
state which improves on random product states. We test it on a spinless Hubbard
model, validating numerically the theoretical result. The other two algorithms
produce entangled states via shallow or deep circuits, improving on the
energies of given initial states. We demonstrate their performance via
numerical experiments on a 2-dimensional Hubbard model, starting from a
checkerboard product state, as well as on some chemistry Hamiltonians, using
the Hartree-Fock state as reference. In both cases, we show that the
approximate energies produced are close to the exact ones. These algorithms
provide a way to systematically improve the estimation of ground state energies
and can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with existing quantum algorithms
for ground states.

class of optimization, saddle point and variational inequality (VI) problems
under a single framework. Given $A: \mathcal{H} \rightrightarrows \mathcal{H}$
that is maximal monotone, we propose a closed-loop control system that is
governed by the operator $I - (I + \lambda(t)A)^{-1}$, where a feedback law
$\lambda(\cdot)$ is tuned by the resolution of the algebraic equation
$\lambda(t)\|(I + \lambda(t)A)^{-1}x(t) - x(t)\|^{p-1} = \theta$ for some
$\theta > 0$. Our first contribution is to prove the existence and uniqueness
of a global solution via the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem. We present a simple
Lyapunov function for establishing the weak convergence of trajectories via the
Opial lemma and strong convergence results under additional conditions. We then
prove a global ergodic convergence rate of $O(t^{-(p+1)/2})$ in terms of a gap
function and a global pointwise convergence rate of $O(t^{-p/2})$ in terms of a
residue function. Local linear convergence is established in terms of a
distance function under an error bound condition. Further, we provide an
algorithmic framework based on the implicit discretization of our system in a
Euclidean setting, generalizing the large-step HPE framework. Although the
discrete-time analysis is a simplification and generalization of existing
analyses for a bounded domain, it is largely motivated by the above
continuous-time analysis, illustrating the fundamental role that the
closed-loop control plays in acceleration in monotone inclusion. A highlight of
our analysis is a new result concerning $p^{th}$-order tensor algorithms for

sizes of training data to measure the impact of data availability on generation
quality for our VAE method as well as several state-of-the-art data generation

consistently meets or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art data generation
methods. While noise reduction may cause the generated data to deviate from

improve performance for next-step prediction using generated data. Finally, the
proposed architecture can incorporate domain-specific time-patterns such as
polynomial trends and seasonalities to provide interpretable outputs. Such
interpretability can be highly advantageous in applications requiring
transparency of model outputs or where users desire to inject prior knowledge
of time-series patterns into the generative model.

supports the generation of polymorphic code and, more importantly the analysis
of polymorphic code via pattern matching.
  Moebius has two main ingredients: 1) we exploit contextual modal types to
describe open code together with the context in which it is meaningful. In
Moebius, open code can depend on type and term variables (level 0) whose values
are supplied at a later stage, as well as code variables (level 1) that stand
for code templates supplied at a later stage. This leads to a multi-level modal
lambda-calculus that supports System-F style polymorphism and forms the basis
for polymorphic code generation. 2) we extend the multi-level modal
lambda-calculus to support pattern matching on code. As pattern matching on
polymorphic code may refine polymorphic type variables, we extend our
type-theoretic foundation to generate and track typing constraints that arise.
We also give an operational semantics and prove type preservation.
  Our multi-level modal foundation for Moebius provides the appropriate
abstractions for both generating and pattern matching on open code without
committing to a concrete representation of variable binding and contexts.
Hence, our work is a step towards building a general type-theoretic foundation
for multi-staged metaprogramming that, on the one hand, enforces strong type
guarantees and, on the other hand, makes it easy to generate and manipulate
code. This will allow us to exploit the full potential of metaprogramming
without sacrificing the reliability of and trust in the code we are producing
and running.

generally interpreted as signatures of micro- or nanoflares occurring at the
transition region or coronal temperatures. Recent observations with the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter have revealed the smallest of
such brightenings (termed campfires) in the quiet-Sun corona. Analyzing EUI 174
{\AA} data at a resolution of about 400 km on the Sun with a cadence of 5 s
from 30-May-2020, we report here a number of cases where these campfires
exhibit propagating signatures along their apparent small (3-5 Mm) loop-like
structures. Measured propagation speeds are generally between 25 km s$^{-1}$
and 60 km s$^{-1}$. These apparent motions would be slower than the local sound
speed if the loop plasma is assumed to be at a million Kelvin. Furthermore,
these brightenings exhibit non-trivial propagation characteristics such as
bifurcation, merging, reflection and repeated plasma ejections. We suggest that
these features are manifestations of the internal dynamics of these small-scale
magnetic structures and could provide important insights into the dynamic
response ($\sim$40 s) of the loop plasma to the heating events as well as into
the locations of the heating events themselves.

Understanding the origin of this universal width has become a topic of central

depend on the distance from the observer, by using previously published results
from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. Methods: We obtained updated estimates on
the distances to nearby molecular clouds observed with Herschel by using recent
results based on 3D dust extinction mapping and Gaia. We examined the widths of
filaments from individual clouds separately, as opposed to treating them as a
single population. We used these per-cloud filament widths to search for signs
of variation amongst the clouds of the previously published study. Results: We
find a significant dependence of the mean per-cloud filament width with
distance. The distribution of mean filament widths for nearby clouds is
incompatible with that of farther away clouds. The mean per-cloud widths scale
with distance approximately as 4--5 times the beam size. We examine the effects
of resolution by performing a convergence study of a filament profile in the

Although both the Hamiltonian and the order parameter are composed of spatially

logarithmically in equal time intervals. This result implies a breakdown of an
inequality that claims the absence of time-crystalline long-range order in the
ground states, unless the upper-bound constant is set to be infinity. This

$r$ of the quasiperiodic system and not on its symmetry. The distribution as a
function of the free path length $l$ appears to be a combination of exponential
decay and a power-law behavior. The latter seems to become important only for
probabilities less than $(2^{r-2} r (r+1))^{-1}$, showing an exponential
decaying free-path length distribution for $r \rightarrow \infty$, similar to
what is observed in disordered systems.

computing for difficult molecular problems. However, the accumulation of
quantum logic errors on real devices represents a major challenge, particularly
in the pursuit of chemical accuracy requiring the inclusion of dynamical
effects. In this work we implement the quantum computed moments (QCM) approach
for hydrogen chain molecular systems up to H$_6$. On a superconducting quantum
processor, Hamiltonian moments, $\langle \mathcal{H}^p\rangle$ are computed
with respect to the Hartree-Fock state, which are then employed in Lanczos
expansion theory to determine an estimate for the ground-state energy which
incorporates electronic correlations and manifestly improves on the variational
result. Post-processing purification of the raw QCM data takes the estimate
through the Hartree-Fock variational limit to within 99.9% of the exact
electronic ground-state energy for the largest system studied, H$_6$.
Calculated dissociation curves indicate precision at about 10mH for this system
and as low as 0.1mH for molecular hydrogen, H$_2$, over a range of bond
lengths. In the context of stringent precision requirements for chemical
problems, these results provide strong evidence for the error suppression
capability of the QCM method, particularly when coupled with post-processing
error mitigation. Greater emphasis on more efficient representations of the
Hamiltonian and classical preprocessing steps may enable the solution of larger
systems on near-term quantum processors.

paper, we implement inference under the whole-history rating model using Markov
chain Monte Carlo and apply the method to a curated data set made up of

conform to assumptions that the climbing grade scale is a logarithmic scale of
difficulty, like decibels or stellar magnitude. We estimate that an increment
in Ewbank, French and UIAA climbing grade systems corresponds to 2.1, 2.09 and
2.13 times increase in difficulty respectively, assuming a logistic model of
probability of success as a function of grade. Whereas we find that the Vermin

In the case of mental task classification, the availability of training samples
to features are minimal. Very often, feature selection is used to increase the
ratio for the mental task classification by getting rid of irrelevant and
superfluous features. This paper proposes an approach to select relevant and
non-redundant spectral features for the mental task classification. This can be
done by using four very known multivariate feature selection methods viz,
Bhattacharya's Distance, Ratio of Scatter Matrices, Linear Regression and
Minimum Redundancy & Maximum Relevance. This work also deals with a comparative

classification. After applying the above-stated method, the findings
demonstrate substantial improvements in the performance of the learning model
for mental task classification. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed approach

microscopy/spectroscopy to investigate the (001) surface of the Kondo lattice
antiferromagnet USb2. Temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra from 4.7 K up to 140
K reveal several peak structures around the Fermi level. Two pronounced peaks
are originated from the hybridization between the conduction and 5f electrons.
We did not observe the mysteriously abrupt change of the electronic state at 45
K, which is previously reported by another STM group and attributed to a novel
first-order like transition. Instead, we only observe continuous evolution of
the dI/dV spectra with temperature. Furthermore, in some scanning regions, we
find significant Sb atoms missing from the top layer, which gives us the
opportunity to investigate the electronic structure of the U-terminated
surface. For the U-terminated surface, an additional sharp peak emerges, which
is closely related to the magnetic order.

simplified form for the gradient. The off-policy setting, however, has been
less clear due to the existence of multiple objectives and the lack of an
explicit off-policy policy gradient theorem. In this work, we unify these
objectives into one off-policy objective, and provide a policy gradient theorem
for this unified objective. The derivation involves emphatic weightings and
interest functions. We show multiple strategies to approximate the gradients,
in an algorithm called Actor Critic with Emphatic weightings (ACE). We prove in
a counterexample that previous (semi-gradient) off-policy actor-critic
methods--particularly Off-Policy Actor-Critic (OffPAC) and Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DPG)--converge to the wrong solution whereas ACE finds the optimal
solution. We also highlight why these semi-gradient approaches can still
perform well in practice, suggesting strategies for variance reduction in ACE.
We empirically study several variants of ACE on two classic control
environments and an image-based environment designed to illustrate the
tradeoffs made by each gradient approximation. We find that by approximating
the emphatic weightings directly, ACE performs as well as or better than OffPAC
in all settings tested.

maximum likelihood does not directly optimize these criteria. Directly
optimizing criteria like BS requires inverse-weighting by the censoring

introduce Inverse-Weighted Survival Games. In these games, objectives for each

meshes with a parametric SMAL model. This is because the low-dimensional pose
and shape parameters of the SMAL model makes it easier for deep networks to
learn the high-dimensional animal meshes. However, the SMAL model is learned
from scans of toy animals with limited pose and shape variations, and thus may
not be able to represent highly varying real animals well. This may result in
poor fittings of the estimated meshes to the 2D evidences, e.g. 2D keypoints or
silhouettes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine approach to
reconstruct 3D animal mesh from a single image. The coarse estimation stage
first estimates the pose, shape and translation parameters of the SMAL model.
The estimated meshes are then used as a starting point by a graph convolutional
network (GCN) to predict a per-vertex deformation in the refinement stage. This
combination of SMAL-based and vertex-based representations benefits from both
parametric and non-parametric representations. We design our mesh refinement
GCN (MRGCN) as an encoder-decoder structure with hierarchical feature
representations to overcome the limited receptive field of traditional GCNs.
Moreover, we observe that the global image feature used by existing animal mesh
reconstruction works is unable to capture detailed shape information for mesh
refinement. We thus introduce a local feature extractor to retrieve a
vertex-level feature and use it together with the global feature as the input
of the MRGCN. We test our approach on the StanfordExtra dataset and achieve
state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we test the generalization capacity of

find that AFLite indeed selects more challenging examples, lowering the
performance of evaluated models more as stronger adversary models are used.
However, the resulting ranking of models can also be unstable and highly
sensitive to the choice of adversary model used. Moreover, AFLite oversamples
examples with low annotator agreement, meaning that model comparisons hinge on

broadly lowering performance with stronger adversaries while disproportionately

describing accumulations of mutations in a population of stem cells
distinguished by their ability for long-term self-renewal. Our outcome of
interest is the appearance of a double-mutant cell, which carries a high
potential for leukemic transformation. In our model, a single-hit mutation
carries a slight proliferative advantage over a wild-type stem cells. We
compute marginalized transition probabilities that allow us to capture
important quantitative aspects of our model, including the probability of
observing a double-hit mutant and relevant moments of a single-hit mutation
population over time. We thoroughly explore the model behavior numerically,
varying birth rates across the initial sizes and populations of wild type stem
cells and single-hit mutants, and compare the probability of observing a
double-hit mutant under these conditions. We find that increasing the number of
single-mutants over wild-type particles initially present has a large effect on
the occurrence of a double-mutant, and that it is relatively safe for
single-mutants to be quite proliferative, provided the lentiviral gene addition
avoids creating single mutants in the original insertion process. Our approach
is broadly applicable to an important set of questions in cancer modeling and

single-crystal calcium fluoride (CaF2) to the magneto-plastic effect. The
influence of magneto-plasticity on CaF2 was confirmed in micro-deformation
tests under a weak magnetic field of 20 mT. The surface pile-up effect was
weakened by 10-15 nm along with an enlarged plastic zone and suppressed crack
propagation under the influence of the magnetic field. Micro-cutting tests
along different crystal orientations on the (111) plane of CaF2 revealed an
increase in the ductile-brittle transition of the machined surface with the aid
of magneto-plasticity where the largest increase in ductile-brittle transition
occurred along the [11-2] orientation from 512 nm to a range of 664-806 nm.
Meanwhile, the subsurface damage layer was concurrently thinner under magnetic
influence. An anisotropic influence of the magnetic field relative to the
single-crystal orientation and the cutting direction was also observed. An
analytical model was derived to determine an orientation factor M that
successfully describes the anisotropy while considering the single-crystal
dislocation behaviour, material fracture toughness, and the orientation of the
magnetic field. Previously suggested theoretical mechanism of
magneto-plasticity via formation of non-singlet electronic states in defected
configurations was confirmed with density functional theory calculations. The

present an opportunity for the adoption of magnetic-assisted micro-cutting of

modern wireless and mobile communications. For robust and high-quality delivery
of video content over wireless and mobile networks, the main challenge is
sending image and video signals to single and multiple users over unstable and
diverse channel environments. To this end, many studies have designed
digital-based video delivery schemes, which mainly consist of a sequence of
digital-based coding and transmission schemes. Although digital-based schemes
perform well when the channel characteristics are known in advance, significant
quality degradation, known as cliff and leveling effects, often occurs owing to
the fluctuating channel characteristics. To prevent cliff and leveling effects
irrespective of the channel characteristics of each user, a new paradigm for
wireless and mobile video streaming has been proposed. Soft delivery schemes
skip the digital operations of quantization and entropy and channel coding
while directly mapping the power-assigned frequency--domain coefficients onto
the transmission symbols. This modification is based on the fact that the pixel
distortion due to communication noise is proportional to the magnitude of the
noise, resulting in graceful quality improvement, wherein quality is improved
gradually, according to the wireless channel quality without any cliff and
leveling effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive summary of soft delivery
schemes.

Invariances can be built into the learning process by architecture design, or

expensive and time-consuming tuning. To address this problem, we propose a new
approach to learn distributions of augmentation transforms, in a new
\emph{Transformed Risk Minimization} (TRM) framework. In addition to predictive
models, we also optimize over transformations chosen from a hypothesis space.
As an algorithmic framework, our TRM method is (1) efficient (jointly learns
augmentations and models in a \emph{single training loop}), (2) modular (works
with \emph{any} training algorithm), and (3) general (handles \emph{both
discrete and continuous} augmentations). We theoretically compare TRM with
standard risk minimization, and give a PAC-Bayes upper bound on its
generalization error. We propose to optimize this bound over a rich

requires entire speech utterances as input context, which leads to significant
time latency especially for long paragraphs. We propose a streaming e2e MDD
model called CoCA-MDD. We utilize conv-transformer structure to encode input
speech in a streaming manner. A coupled cross-attention (CoCA) mechanism is
proposed to integrate frame-level acoustic features with encoded reference
linguistic features. CoCA also enables our model to perform mispronunciation
classification with whole utterances. The proposed model allows system fusion
between the streaming output and mispronunciation classification output for
further performance enhancement. We evaluate CoCA-MDD on publicly available
corpora. CoCA-MDD achieves F1 scores of 57.03% and 60.78% for streaming and
fusion modes respectively on L2-ARCTIC. For phone-level pronunciation scoring,
CoCA-MDD achieves 0.58 Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) value on

applications in acoustic sensing and monitoring. However, the development of
real-time SELD has been limited by the demanding computational requirement of
most recent SELD systems. In this work, we introduce SALSA-Lite, a fast and
effective feature for polyphonic SELD using microphone array inputs. SALSA-Lite
is a lightweight variation of a previously proposed SALSA feature for
polyphonic SELD. SALSA, which stands for Spatial Cue-Augmented Log-Spectrogram,
consists of multichannel log-spectrograms stacked channelwise with the
normalized principal eigenvectors of the spectrotemporally corresponding
spatial covariance matrices. In contrast to SALSA, which uses eigenvector-based
spatial features, SALSA-Lite uses normalized inter-channel phase differences as
spatial features, allowing a 30-fold speedup compared to the original SALSA
feature. Experimental results on the TAU-NIGENS Spatial Sound Events 2021
dataset showed that the SALSA-Lite feature achieved competitive performance
compared to the full SALSA feature, and significantly outperformed the
traditional feature set of multichannel log-mel spectrograms with generalized
cross-correlation spectra. Specifically, using SALSA-Lite features increased
localization-dependent F1 score and class-dependent localization recall by 15%

generalized cross-correlation spectra.

HyperNAT, which leverages smartNICs to improve the server's processing

designs mostly require human subjects to remain static, largely confining their
adoptions in everyday environments where body movements are inevitable.
Fortunately, radio-frequency (RF) enabled contact-free sensing, though
suffering motion interference inseparable by conventional filtering, may offer
a potential to distill respiratory waveform with the help of deep learning. To
realize this potential, we introduce MoRe-Fi to conduct fine-grained
respiration monitoring under body movements. MoRe-Fi leverages an IR-UWB radar
to achieve contact-free sensing, and it fully exploits the complex radar signal
for data augmentation. The core of MoRe-Fi is a novel variational
encoder-decoder network; it aims to single out the respiratory waveforms that
are modulated by body movements in a non-linear manner. Our experiments with 12
subjects and 66-hour data demonstrate that MoRe-Fi accurately recovers
respiratory waveform despite the interference caused by body movements. We also
discuss potential applications of MoRe-Fi for pulmonary disease diagnoses.

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for TS. However,
ASR errors directly affect the quality of the output summary in the cascade

errors and that exploits multiple hypotheses generated by ASR to attenuate the
effect of ASR errors on the summary. We investigate several schemes to combine
ASR hypotheses. First, we propose using the sum of sub-word embedding vectors
weighted by their posterior values provided by an ASR system as an input to a
BERT-based TS system. Then, we introduce a more general scheme that uses an
attention-based fusion module added to a pre-trained BERT module to align and
combine several ASR hypotheses. Finally, we perform speech summarization
experiments on the How2 dataset and a newly assembled TED-based dataset that we
will release with this paper. These experiments show that retraining the

large graphs remains challenging. The limited resource capacities of the

concern due to the centralized storage and model learning have spurred the need
to design an effective distributed algorithm for GNN training. However,
existing distributed GNN training methods impose either excessive communication
costs or large memory overheads that hinders their scalability. To overcome
these issues, we propose a communication-efficient distributed GNN training
technique named $\text{{Learn Locally, Correct Globally}}$ (LLCG). To reduce
the communication and memory overhead, each local machine in LLCG first trains
a GNN on its local data by ignoring the dependency between nodes among
different machines, then sends the locally trained model to the server for
periodic model averaging. However, ignoring node dependency could result in
significant performance degradation. To solve the performance degradation, we
propose to apply $\text{{Global Server Corrections}}$ on the server to refine
the locally learned models. We rigorously analyze the convergence of
distributed methods with periodic model averaging for training GNNs and show
that naively applying periodic model averaging but ignoring the dependency
between nodes will suffer from an irreducible residual error. However, this
residual error can be eliminated by utilizing the proposed global corrections
to entail fast convergence rate. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show that LLCG can significantly improve the efficiency without hurting the
performance.

to gradient-based privacy attacks and, consequently, a variety of
privacy-preserving methods have been adopted to thwart such attacks. However,
these defensive methods either introduce orders of magnitudes more
computational and communication overheads (e.g., with homomorphic encryption)
or incur substantial model performance losses in terms of prediction accuracy
(e.g., with differential privacy). In this work, we propose $\textsc{FedCG}$, a
novel federated learning method that leverages conditional generative
adversarial networks to achieve high-level privacy protection while still
maintaining competitive model performance. $\textsc{FedCG}$ decomposes each
client's local network into a private extractor and a public classifier and
keeps the extractor local to protect privacy. Instead of exposing extractors,
$\textsc{FedCG}$ shares clients' generators with the server for aggregating
clients' shared knowledge aiming to enhance the performance of each client's
local networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textsc{FedCG}$ can
achieve competitive model performance compared with FL baselines, and privacy
analysis shows that $\textsc{FedCG}$ has a high-level privacy-preserving
capability.

  Models","33pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Price discrimination, which refers to the strategy of setting different
prices for different customer groups, has been widely used in online retailing.
Although it helps boost the collected revenue for online retailers, it might
create serious concern in fairness, which even violates the regulation and law.
This paper studies the problem of dynamic discriminatory pricing under fairness
constraints. In particular, we consider a finite selling horizon of length $T$
for a single product with two groups of customers. Each group of customers has
its unknown demand function that needs to be learned. For each selling period,
the seller determines the price for each group and observes their purchase
behavior. While existing literature mainly focuses on maximizing revenue,
ensuring fairness among different customers has not been fully explored in the
dynamic pricing literature. In this work, we adopt the fairness notion from
(Cohen et al. 2021a). For price fairness, we propose an optimal dynamic pricing
policy in terms of regret, which enforces the strict price fairness constraint.
In contrast to the standard $\sqrt{T}$-type regret in online learning, we show
that the optimal regret in our case is $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{4/5})$. We further
extend our algorithm to a more general notion of fairness, which includes
demand fairness as a special case. To handle this general class, we propose a
soft fairness constraint and develop the dynamic pricing policy that achieves
$\tilde{O}(T^{4/5})$ regret.

this proposition with a novel experiment in which we use an interactive

on trust in AI and on human performance in AI-assisted prediction tasks. We
find that interpretability led to no robust improvements in trust, while
outcome feedback had a significantly greater and more reliable effect. However,
both factors had modest effects on participants' task performance. Our findings
suggest that (1) factors receiving significant attention, such as
interpretability, may be less effective at increasing trust than factors like
outcome feedback, and (2) augmenting human performance via AI systems may not
be a simple matter of increasing trust in AI, as increased trust is not always
associated with equally sizable improvements in performance. These findings
invite the research community to focus not only on methods for generating
interpretations but also on techniques for ensuring that interpretations impact

storage servers. Such a scale, combined with ever-growing system complexity, is
causing a key challenge to failure and resource management for dependable cloud
computing. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding
emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for
system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor
the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are
usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in
production clouds. In this paper, we present a \emph{self-evolving anomaly
detection} (SEAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. Our framework
self-evolves by recursively exploring newly verified anomaly records and
continuously updating the anomaly detector online. As a distinct advantage of
our framework, cloud system administrators only need to check a small number of
detected anomalies, and their decisions are leveraged to update the detector.
Thus, the detector evolves following the upgrade of system hardware, update of
the software stack, and change of user workloads. Moreover, we design two types
of detectors, one for general anomaly detection and the other for type-specific
anomaly detection. With the help of self-evolving techniques, our detectors can
achieve 88.94\% in sensitivity and 94.60\% in specificity on average, which
makes them suitable for real-world deployment.

communication systems that require quasi-balanced data rates in uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL), as well as users' heterogeneous traffic. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly investigate joint UL-DL
optimization for UAV assisted systems under heterogeneous requirements. A
hybrid-mode multiple access (HMMA) scheme is proposed toward heterogeneous
traffic, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) targets high average data
rate, while orthogonal multiple access (OMA) aims to meet users' instantaneous
rate demands by compensating for their rates. HMMA enables a higher degree of
freedom in multiple access and achieves a superior minimum average rate among
users than the UAV assisted NOMA or OMA schemes. Under HMMA, a joint UL-DL
resource allocation algorithm is proposed with a closed-form optimal solution
for UL/DL power allocation to achieve quasi-balanced average rates for UL and
DL. Furthermore, considering the error propagation in successive interference
cancellation (SIC) of NOMA, an enhanced-HMMA scheme is proposed, which
demonstrates high robustness against SIC error and a higher minimum average
rate than the HMMA scheme.

using the softmax function. Since softmax yields a vector whose elements all
fall in the interval (0, 1) and sum to 1, it suggests a probabilistic
interpretation to the DNN's outcome. Using synthetic and real-world datasets,
we look into the impact of various factors, e.g., probability density f(x) and
inter-categorical sparsity, on the precision of DNNs' estimations of p(y|x),

multiple-connectivity, which under-utilizes the network resources, or on (ii)
the use of out-of-band and non-RF sensors to predict link blockages, which is

a novel solution that relies only on in-band mmWave wireless measurements to
proactively predict future dynamic line-of-sight (LOS) link blockages. The
proposed solution utilizes deep neural networks and special patterns of
received signal power, that we call pre-blockage wireless signatures to infer
future blockages. Specifically, the developed machine learning models attempt
to predict: (i) If a future blockage will occur? (ii) When will this blockage
happen? (iii) What is the type of the blockage? And (iv) what is the direction
of the moving blockage? To evaluate our proposed approach, we build a
large-scale real-world dataset comprising nearly $0.5$ million data points
(mmWave measurements) for both indoor and outdoor blockage scenarios. The
results, using this dataset, show that the proposed approach can successfully
predict the occurrence of future dynamic blockages with more than 85\%
accuracy. Further, for the outdoor scenario with highly-mobile vehicular
blockages, the proposed model can predict the exact time of the future blockage
with less than $80$ms error for blockages happening within the future $500$ms.

decoders based on noise samples is considered. For uncoded communication
systems, the problem of choosing a codebook and possibly also a generalized
minimal distance decoder (which is parameterized by a covariance matrix) is
addressed. High probability generalization bounds for the error probability
loss function, as well as for a hinge-type surrogate loss function are
provided. A stochastic-gradient based alternating-minimization algorithm for
the latter loss function is proposed. In addition, a Gibbs-based algorithm that
gradually expurgates an initial codebook from codewords in order to obtain a
smaller codebook with improved error probability is proposed, and bounds on its
average empirical error and generalization error, as well as a high probability
generalization bound, are stated. Various experiments demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithms. For coded systems, the problem of
maximizing the mutual information between the input and the output with respect
to the input distribution is addressed, and uniform convergence bounds for two
different classes of input distributions are obtained.

physical system of free boundary problem, the spatiotemporal evolution of the
solid/liquid interface not only origins from phase transformation but also from
permeation flow in front of ice. Physical models have been proposed in previous
efforts to describe the interface dynamic behaviors in unidirectional freezing
of particle suspensions. However, there are several physical parameters
difficult to be determined in previous investigations dedicated to describing
the spatiotemporal evolution in unidirectional freezing of particle
suspensions. Here, based on the fundamental momentum theorem, we propose a
consistent theoretical framework to address the unidirectional freezing process
in the particle suspensions coupled with the effect of water permeation. An
interface undercooling-dependent pushing force exerted on the compacted layer
with a specific formula is derived based on the surface tension. Then a dynamic
compacted layer is considered and analyzed. Numerical solutions of the
nonlinear models reveal the dependence of system dynamics on some typical
physical parameters, particle radius, initial particle concentration in the
suspensions, freezing velocity and so on. The system dynamics are characterized
by interface velocity, interface undercooling and interface recoil as functions
of time. The models allow us to reconsider the formation mechanism of ice
spears in freezing of particle suspensions in a simpler but novel way, with
potential implications for both understanding and controlling not only ice
formation in porous media but also crystallization processes in other complex
systems.

behavior patterns and use predictions to guide decision-making. Predictive
analytics is human involved, thus the machine learning model is preferred to be
interpretable. In literature, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is a standard
for interpretability. However, due to the one-to-many and many-to-one phenomena
which appear commonly in real-world scenarios, existing GAMs have limitations
to serve predictive analytics in terms of both accuracy and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose FXAM (Fast and eXplainable Additive
Model), a unified and fast interpretable model for predictive analytics. FXAM
extends GAM's modeling capability with a unified additive model for numerical,
categorical, and temporal features. FXAM conducts a novel training procedure
called Three-Stage Iteration (TSI). TSI corresponds to learning over numerical,
categorical, and temporal features respectively. Each stage learns a local
optimum by fixing the parameters of other stages. We design joint learning over
categorical features and partial learning over temporal features to achieve
high accuracy and training efficiency. We prove that TSI is guaranteed to
converge to the global optimum. We further propose a set of optimization
techniques to speed up FXAM's training algorithm to meet the needs of
interactive analysis. Thorough evaluations conducted on diverse data sets
verify that FXAM significantly outperforms existing GAMs in terms of training
speed, and modeling categorical and temporal features. In terms of
interpretability, we compare FXAM with the typical post-hoc approach
XGBoost+SHAP on two real-world scenarios, which shows the superiority of FXAM's
inherent interpretability for predictive analytics.

(LIC) based on deep neural networks: variable-rate learning where separate
networks are required to generate compressed images with varying qualities, and
the train-test mismatch between differentiable approximate quantization and
true hard quantization. We introduce an online meta-learning (OML) setting for
LIC, which combines ideas from meta learning and online learning in the
conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) framework. By treating the
conditional variables as meta parameters and treating the generated conditional
features as meta priors, the desired reconstruction can be controlled by the
meta parameters to accommodate compression with variable qualities. The online
learning framework is used to update the meta parameters so that the
conditional reconstruction is adaptively tuned for the current image. Through
the OML mechanism, the meta parameters can be effectively updated through SGD.
The conditional reconstruction is directly based on the quantized latent
representation in the decoder network, and therefore helps to bridge the gap
between the training estimation and true quantized latent distribution.
Experiments demonstrate that our OML approach can be flexibly applied to
different state-of-the-art LIC methods to achieve additional performance
improvements with little computation and transmission overhead.

application in biology, zoology, and aquaculture. Deep learning methods have
effectively been applied to human pose estimation. However, the major
bottleneck to the application of these methods to animal pose estimation is the
unavailability of sufficient quantities of labeled data. Though there are ample
quantities of unlabelled data publicly available, it is economically
impractical to label large quantities of data for each animal. In addition, due
to the wide variety of body shapes in the animal kingdom, the transfer of
knowledge across domains is ineffective. Given the fact that the human brain is
able to recognize animal pose without requiring large amounts of labeled data,
it is only reasonable that we exploit unsupervised learning to tackle the
problem of animal pose recognition from the available, unlabelled data. In this
paper, we introduce a novel architecture that is able to recognize the pose of
multiple animals fromunlabelled data. We do this by (1) removing background
information from each image and employing an edge detection algorithm on the
body of the animal, (2) Tracking motion of the edge pixels and performing
agglomerative clustering to segment body parts, (3) employing contrastive
learning to discourage grouping of distant body parts together. Hence we are
able to distinguish between body parts of the animal, based on their visual
behavior, instead of the underlying anatomy. Thus, we are able to achieve a
more effective classification of the data than their human-labeled
counterparts. We test our model on the TigDog and WLD (WildLife Documentary)
datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches by a significant
margin. We also study the performance of our model on other public data to
demonstrate the generalization ability of our model.

important objective of structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes in
structural behaviors are usually manifested as the feature changes in monitored
structural responses; thus, developing effective methods for automatically
detecting such changes is of considerable significance. Existing methods for
change detection in SHM are mainly used for scalar or vector data, thus
incapable of detecting the changes of the features represented by complex data,
e.g., the probability density functions (PDFs). Detecting the abrupt changes
occurred in the distributions (represented by PDFs) associated with the
damage-sensitive features extracted from SHM data are usually of crucial
interest for structural condition assessment; however, the SHM community still
lacks effective diagnostic tools for detecting such changes. In this study, a
change-point detection method is developed in the functional data-analytic
framework for PDF-valued sequence, and it is leveraged to diagnose the
distributional information break encountered in structural condition
assessment. A major challenge in PDF-valued data modeling or analysis is that
the PDFs are special functional data subjecting to nonlinear constraints. To
tackle this issue, the PDFs are embedded into the Bayes space, and the
associated change-point model is constructed by using the linear structure of
the Bayes space; then, a hypothesis testing procedure is presented for
distributional change-point detection based on the isomorphic mapping between
the Bayes space and a functional linear space. Comprehensive simulation studies
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as
demonstrate its superiority over the competing method. Finally, an application
to real SHM data illustrates its practical utility in structural condition
assessment.

the corner problem studied in the context of multiparty communication
complexity in the Number On the Forehead (NOF) model. Versions of this problem
and the NOF connection have seen much interest (and progress) in recent works

  We introduce and study a general algebraic method for lower bounding the
Shannon capacity of directed hypergraphs via combinatorial degenerations, a
combinatorial kind of ""approximation"" of subgraphs that originates from the
study of matrix multiplication in algebraic complexity theory (and which play
an important role there) but which we use in a novel way.
  Using the combinatorial degeneration method, we make progress on the corner
problem by explicitly constructing a corner-free subset in $F_2^n \times F_2^n$
of size $\Omega(3.39^n/poly(n))$, which improves the previous lower bound
$\Omega(2.82^n)$ of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman (ITCS 2019) and which gets us
closer to the best upper bound $4^{n - o(n)}$. Our new construction of
corner-free sets implies an improved NOF protocol for the Eval problem. In the
Eval problem over a group $G$, three players need to determine whether their
inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in G$ sum to zero. We find that the NOF communication
complexity of the Eval problem over $F_2^n$ is at most $0.24n + O(\log n)$,
which improves the previous upper bound $0.5n + O(\log n)$.

of holding patients in the ED after they have been admitted to hospital wards,
usually resulting from insufficient inpatient resources. Boarded patients may
compete with new patients for medical resources in the ED, compromising the
quality of emergency care. A common expedient for mitigating boarding is
patient overflowing, i.e., sending patients to beds in other specialties or
accommodation classes, which may compromise the quality of inpatient care and
bring on operational challenges. We study inpatient bed assignment to shorten
boarding times without excessive patient overflowing.
  Methodology: We use a queue with multiple customer classes and multiple
server pools to model hospital wards. Exploiting patient flow data from a
hospital, we propose a computationally tractable approach to formulating the
bed assignment problem, where the joint probability of all waiting patients
meeting their respective delay targets is maximized.
  Results: By dynamically adjusting the overflow rate, the proposed approach is
capable not only of reducing patients' waiting times, but also of mitigating
the time-of-day effect on boarding times. In numerical experiments, our
approach greatly outperforms both early discharge policies and threshold-based
overflowing policies, which are commonly used in practice.
  Managerial implications: We provide a practicable approach to solving the bed
assignment problem. This data-driven approach captures critical features of
patient flow management, while the resulting optimization problem is
practically solvable. The proposed approach is a useful tool for the control of
queueing systems with time-sensitive service requirements.

2017-2018 with a peak in June 2018. We triggered AstroSat observations of NGC
1566 twice in August and October 2018 during its declining phase. Using the
AstroSat observations along-with two XMM-Newton observations in 2015
(pre-outburst) and June 2018 (peak-outburst), we found that the X-ray
power-law, the soft X-ray excess, and the disk components showed extreme
variability during the outburst. Especially, the soft excess was negligible in
2015 before the outburst, it increased to a maximum level by a factor of $>200$
in June 2018, and reduced dramatically by a factor of $\sim7.4$ in August 2018
and become undetectable in October 2018. The Eddington fraction ($L/L_{Edd})$
increased from $\sim0.1\%$ (2015) to $\sim 5\%$ (June 2018), then decreased to
$\sim 1.5\%$ (August 2018) and $0.3\%$ (October 2018). Thus, NGC 1566 made a
spectral transition from a high soft-excess state to a negligible soft-excess
state at a few $\%$ of the Eddington rate. The soft-excess is consistent with
warm Comptonization in the inner disk that appears to have developed during the
outburst and disappeared towards the end of the outburst over a timescale
comparable to the sound crossing time. The multi-wavelength spectral evolution
of NGC 1566 during the outburst is most likely caused by the radiation pressure
instability in the inner regions of the accretion disk in NGC 1566.

training is the current mainstream solution. Ring AllReduce is widely used as a
data parallel decentralized algorithm. However, in a heterogeneous environment,
each worker calculates the same amount of data, so that there is a lot of
waiting time loss among different workers, which makes the algorithm unable to
adapt well to heterogeneous clusters. Resources are not used as they should be.
In this paper, we design an implementation of static allocation algorithm. The
dataset is artificially allocated to each worker, and samples are drawn
proportionally for training, thereby speeding up the training speed of the
network in a heterogeneous environment. We verify the convergence and influence
on training speed of the network model under this algorithm on one machine with
multi-card and multi-machine with multi-card. On this basis of feasibility, we
propose a self-adaptive allocation algorithm that allows each machine to find
the data it needs to adapt to the current environment. The self-adaptive
allocation algorithm can reduce the training time by nearly one-third to half
compared to the same proportional allocation.In order to better show the
applicability of the algorithm in heterogeneous clusters, We replace a poorly
performing worker with a good performing worker or add a poorly performing
worker to the heterogeneous cluster. Experimental results show that training
time will decrease as the overall performance improves. Therefore, it means
that resources are fully used. Further, this algorithm is not only suitable for
straggler problems, but also for most heterogeneous situations. It can be used
as a plug-in for AllReduce and its variant algorithms.

the observed fast orbital decay attributed to tidal dissipation. The measured

orb}\,=\,-\,29\pm3\;\mbox{ms/yr}\;$=$\;(9.2\pm1.0)\times10^{-10}\;\mbox{s/s}$.
In the literature heretofore, all attempts to explain this high rate were based
on the assumption that the orbital evolution is dominated by the tides in the
star. Since the modified tidal quality factor in yellow dwarfs is insufficient
to warrant such a decay rate, a hypothesis was put forward that the star may
actually be a subgiant. Using the latest data from the Gaia mission, we deduce
that WASP-12a at $1.36\,{M_{Sun}}$ is an evolving dwarf at an early stage of
post-turn-off evolution that has not yet depleted hydrogen in its core. Its
unremarkable position in the color-magnitude diagram and the existence of close
planets orbiting red giants of similar mass contradict the hypothesis of an
abrupt boost of tidal quality due to structural internal changes. On the other
hand, the previous research neglected the tidal dissipation in the planet
assuming it to be negligible due to the likely synchronisation of its rotation
and a presumed high quality factor. We critically reassess this assumption in
the light of recent astrometric results for Jupiter and Saturn. Assuming that
the structure of WASP-12b is similar to that of our Jupiter and Saturn, we find
that the observed orbital decay is well explained by the tides in the planet.
The estimated value of the planet's modified quality factor coincides almost
precisely with that of our Jupiter.

them to explain and solve novel problems. The most powerful artificial
intelligence systems lack explainability and symbolic reasoning ability, and
have therefore not achieved supremacy in domains requiring human understanding,

machine learning method that learns patterns from data using explainable deep
learning and then condenses it into concise, executable computer code. The
code, which can contain loops, nested logical statements, and useful
intermediate variables, is equivalent to the neural network but is generally
orders of magnitude more compact and human-comprehensible. On a diverse set of
problems involving arithmetic, computer vision, and optimization, we show that
deep distilling generates concise code that generalizes out-of-distribution to
solve problems orders-of-magnitude larger and more complex than the training

discovers the rule set exactly with scalable guarantees. For problems that are
ambiguous or computationally intractable, the distilled rules are similar to
existing human-derived algorithms and perform at par or better. Our approach
demonstrates that unassisted machine intelligence can build generalizable and
intuitive rules explaining patterns in large datasets that would otherwise

fission fragments decreases when the excitation energy of the fissioning
systems increases as indicated by experimental data for the neutron-induced
fission events. To explore this problem, we used a method based on the
four-dimensional Langevin equations we have developed. We have calculated the
TKE of fission fragments for fissioning systems $^{236}$U$^{*}$ and
$^{240}$Pu$^{*}$ excited above respective fission barriers, and compared the
results with experimental data for n + $^{235}$U and n + $^{239}$Pu reactions,
respectively. From the Langevin-model analysis, we have found that the shape of
the abundant heavy fragments changes from almost spherical for low excitation
domain to highly prolate shape for high excitation energy, while that of the
light fragments does not change noticeably. The change of the ""shape"" of the
heavy fragments causes an increase of a distance between the charge centers of
the nascent fragments just after scission as excitation energy increases.
Accordingly, the Coulomb repulsion between the two fragments decreases with an
increase of the excitation energy, which causes the decrease of the average
TKE. In this manner, we found that the change of the shape of the heavy
fragment as a function of the excitation energy is the key issue for the TKE of
fission fragments to decrease as the excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei
increases. In other words, washing out of the shell effects which affect the
shape of the heavy fragments is the key reason for the decreasing energy
dependence of the average TKE of the fission fragments.

challenging task due to the lack of complete face information and the domain
gap between the 3D face and 2D image. Further, obtaining re-renderable 3D faces
has become a strongly desired property in many applications, where the term
're-renderable' demands the facial texture to be spatially complete and
disentangled with environmental illumination. In this paper, we propose a new

is to first utilize a prior generation module based on the 3DMM proxy model to
produce an unwrapped texture and a globally parameterized prior albedo. Then we
apply a detail refinement module to synthesize the final texture with both
high-frequency details and completeness. To further make facial textures
disentangled with illumination, we propose a novel detailed illumination
representation which is reconstructed with the detailed albedo together. We
also design several novel regularization losses on both the albedo and
illumination maps to facilitate the disentanglement of these two factors.
Finally, by leveraging a differentiable renderer, each face attribute can be
jointly trained in a self-supervised manner without requiring ground-truth
facial reflectance. Extensive comparisons and ablation studies on challenging

capacity of structural members and do not account for the influence of the
ground motion duration or the hysteretic behavior characteristics. The
energy-based approach serves as a supplemental index to response quantities and
includes the effect of repeated loads in seismic performance. The design
philosophy suggests that the seismic demands are met by the energy dissipation
capacity of the structural members. Therefore, the energy dissipation behavior
of the structural members should be well understood to achieve an effective
energy-based design approach. This study focuses on the energy dissipation
capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls that are widely used in high
seismic regions as they provide significant stiffness and strength to resist
lateral forces. A machine learning (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR))-based
predictive model for energy dissipation capacity of shear walls is developed as
a function of wall design parameters. Eighteen design parameters are shown to
influence energy dissipation, whereas the most important ones are determined by
applying sequential backward elimination and by using feature selection methods
to reduce the complexity of the predictive model. The ability of the proposed
model to make robust and accurate predictions is validated based on novel data
with a prediction accuracy (the ratio of predicted/actual values) of around
1.00 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.93. The outcomes of this
study are believed to contribute to the energy-based approach by (i) defining
the most influential wall properties on the seismic energy dissipation capacity
of shear walls and (ii) providing predictive models that can enable comparisons
of different wall design configurations to achieve higher energy dissipation
capacity.

limited number of neighboring nodes for the transmission of the signals. Each
relay stores in its buffer the messages that were successfully decoded, in
order to forward them through the appropriate channel links, based on its

that models the evolution of the buffers and the transitions at the operations

introduce PROBO as a generalization of BO that aims at rendering the method

explicitly accounting for GP imprecision via a prior near-ignorance model. At
the heart of this is a novel acquisition function, the generalized lower

criterion, the data is said to dominate another data. When a data item is not
dominated by any other data item, this data is said to be a member of the
skyline. However, as the number of criteria increases, the possibility that a
data dominates another data decreases, resulting in too many members of the
skyline set. To solve this kind of problem, the concept of the k-dominant
skyline was proposed, which reduces the number of skyline members by relaxing
the limit. The uncertainty of the data makes each data have a probability of
appearing, so each data has the probability of becoming a member of the
k-dominant skyline. When a new data item is added, the probability of other
data becoming members of the k-dominant skyline may change. How to quickly
update the k-dominant skyline for real-time applications is a serious problem.
This paper proposes an effective method, Middle Indexing (MI), which filters
out a large amount of irrelevant data in the uncertain data stream by sorting
data specifically, so as to improve the efficiency of updating the k-dominant
skyline. Experiments show that the proposed MI outperforms the existing method
by approximately 13% in terms of computation time.

optical networks. This means that the transmission system needs to support a
variety of hardware with different components, leading to system uncertainties
throughout the network. For example, uncertainties in signal-to-noise ratio and
laser linewidth can negatively affect the quality of transmission within an
optical network due to e.g. mis-parametrization of the transceiver signal
processing algorithms. In this paper, we propose to geometrically optimize a
constellation shape that is robust to uncertainties in the channel conditions
by utilizing end-to-end learning. In the optimization step, the channel model
includes additive noise and residual phase noise. In the testing step, the
channel model consists of laser phase noise, additive noise and blind phase
search as the carrier phase recovery algorithm. Two noise models are considered
for the additive noise: white Gaussian noise and nonlinear interference noise
model for fiber nonlinearities. The latter models the behavior of an optical
fiber channel more accurately because it considers the nonlinear effects of the
optical fiber. For this model, the uncertainty in the signal-to-noise ratio can
be divided between amplifier noise figures and launch power variations. For
both noise models, our results indicate that the learned constellations are
more robust to uncertainties in channel conditions compared to a standard
constellation scheme such as quadrature amplitude modulation and standard
geometric constellation shaping techniques.

applications. Here, we report the thermal properties of SnS2 measured using the
optothermal method and supported by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Our experiments suggest very low in-plane lattice thermal
conductivity (\k{appa} = 3.20 +- 0.57 W m-1 K-1) and cross-plane interfacial
thermal conductance per unit area (g = 0.53 +- 0.09 MW m-2 K-1) for monolayer
SnS2 supported on a SiO2/Si substrate. The thermal properties show a dependence
on the thickness of the SnS2 flake. Based on the findings of our DFT
calculations, the very low value of the lattice thermal conductivity can be
attributed to low group velocity, a shorter lifetime of the phonons, and strong
anharmonicity in the crystal. Materials with low thermal conductivity are
important for thermoelectric applications as the thermoelectric power
coefficient goes inversely with the thermal conductivity.

advertising tends to substitute more and more to traditional advertising by
offering the opportunity to companies to target the consumers/users that are

for the study of optimal bidding strategies associated to different types of
advertising, namely, commercial advertising for triggering purchases or
subscriptions, and social marketing for alerting population about unhealthy
behaviours (anti-drug, vaccination, road-safety campaigns). Our continuoustime
models are based on a common framework encoding users online behaviours via
their web-browsing at random times, and the targeted advertising auction
mechanism widely used on Internet, the objective being to efficiently diffuse
advertising information by means of digital channels. Our main results are to
provide semi-explicit formulas for the optimal value and bidding policy for
each of these problems. We show some sensitivity properties of the solution
with respect to model parameters, and analyse how the different sources of
digital information accessible to users including the social interactions
affect the optimal bid for advertising auctions. We also study how to
efficiently combine targeted advertising and non-targeted advertising
mechanisms. Finally, some classes of examples with fully explicit formulas are
derived.

existing methods tend to exhibit asymmetric errors, which might open up a new
direction for accurate and robust depth estimation. We carefully investigate
into the phenomenon, and construct a two-level ensemble scheme, NENet, to
integrate multiple predictions from diverse base predictors. The NENet forms a
more reliable depth estimator, which substantially boosts the performance over
base predictors. Notably, this is the first attempt to introduce ensemble
learning and evaluate its utility for monocular depth estimation to the best of
our knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed NENet
achieves better results than previous state-of-the-art approaches on the
NYU-Depth-v2 and KITTI datasets. In particular, our method improves previous
state-of-the-art methods from 0.365 to 0.349 on the metric RMSE on the NYU

models trained on the NYU dataset to the SUN RGB-D dataset without any

promising network for global context modeling by self-attention mechanism, but
one of the main shortcomings, when applied to recognition, is the efficiency.
We propose a 1-D split to address the challenges of complexity and replace the
CNN with the transformer encoder to reduce the need for a context modeling
module. Furthermore, recent methods use a frozen initial embedding to guide the
decoder to decode the features to text, leading to a loss of accuracy. We
propose to use a learnable initial embedding learned from the transformer
encoder to make it adaptive to different input images. Above all, we introduce
a novel architecture for text recognition, named TRansformer-based text

Compared to analytical methods which tend to require techniques specific to

numerical methods are carried out based on some assumptions such as working in

work in progress. We explore the nature of 19 new GC candidates in the Galactic
bulge, based on the analysis of their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the
near-IR, using the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Survey (VVV) database.
We estimate their main astrophysical parameters: reddening and extinction,
distance, total luminosity, mean cluster proper motions (PMs), metallicity and
age. We obtain the cluster catalogues including the likely cluster members by
applying a decontamination procedure on the observed CMDs, based upon the
vector PM diagrams from VIRAC2. We estimate a wide reddening range of the $0.25
\leqslant E(J-K_s) \leqslant 2.0$ mag and extinction $0.11 \leqslant A_{Ks}
\leqslant 0.86$ mag for the sample clusters as expected in the bulge regions.
The range of heliocentric distances is $6.8\leqslant D\leqslant 11.4$ kpc. This
allows us to place these clusters between 0.56 and 3.25 kpc from the Galactic
centre, assuming $R_{\odot}=8.2$ kpc. Also, their PMs are kinematically similar
to the typical motion of the Galactic bulge, apart from VVV-CL160, which shows
different PMs. We also derive their metallicities and ages, finding $-1.40
\leqslant$ [Fe/H] $\leqslant 0.0$ dex and $t\approx 8-13$ Gyr respectively. The
luminosities are calculated both in $K_{s}-$ and V-bands, recovering $-3.4
\leqslant M_V \leqslant -7.5$. We also examine the possible RR Lyrae members
found in the cluster fields. Based on their positions, kinematics,
metallicities and ages and comparing our results with the literature, we
conclude that 9 candidates are real GCs, 7 need more observations to be fully
confirmed as GCs, whereas 3 candidates are discarded for being younger open
clusters.

cannot be scheduled independently one of another, we consider the setting where
the edges are grouped into certain walks (called trips) in the digraph and
where assigning the appearing time to the first edge of a trip forces the
appearing times of the subsequent edges. In this setting, we show that, quite
surprisingly, it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists an assignment of
times connecting a given pair of nodes. This result allows us to prove that the
problem of maximising the temporal reachability cannot be approximated within a
factor better than some polynomial term in the size of the graph. We thus focus
on the case where, for each pair of nodes, there exists an assignment of times
such that one node is reachable from the other. We call this property strong
temporalisability. It is a very natural assumption for the application to
public transit networks. On the negative side, the problem of maximising the
temporal reachability remains hard to approximate within a factor $\sqrt$ n/12
in that setting. Moreover, we show the existence of collections of trips that
are strongly temporalisable but for which any assignment of starting times to
the trips connects at most an O(1/ $\sqrt$ n) fraction of all pairs of nodes.
On the positive side, we show that there must exist an assignment of times that
connects a constant fraction of all pairs in the strongly temporalisable and

multistage decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider a type of
multistage decision-making process called a cascade process. A cascade process
is a multistage process in which the output of one stage is used as an input
for the subsequent stage. When the cost of each stage is expensive, it is
difficult to search for the optimal controllable parameters for each stage
exhaustively. To address this problem, we formulate the optimization of the
cascade process as an extension of the Bayesian optimization framework and
propose two types of acquisition functions based on credible intervals and
expected improvement. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed
acquisition functions and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical
experiments. In addition, we consider an extension called suspension setting in
which we are allowed to suspend the cascade process at the middle of the
multistage decision-making process that often arises in practical problems. We
apply the proposed method in a test problem involving a solar cell simulator,
which was the motivation for this study.

included 2,200 people in Qatar, and it was clustered into two consumer
categories: high and low. In particular, the study focused on exploring human
indoor comfort perception dependencies with building features. Financial
drivers, such as demand programs and energy subsidies, were explored in
relation to behavioral patterns. Subsequently, the data analysis resulted in
implications for energy policies regarding interventions, social well-being,

findings of this study demonstrated how human factors impact comfort perception

pansharpening. Thus far, research has mainly focused on architectures.
Nonetheless, model training is an equally important issue. A first problem is
the absence of ground truths, unavoidable in pansharpening. This is often
addressed by training networks in a reduced resolution domain and using the
original data as ground truth, relying on an implicit scale invariance
assumption. However, on full resolution images results are often disappointing,
suggesting such invariance not to hold. A further problem is the scarcity of
training data, which causes a limited generalization ability and a poor
performance on off-training test images. In this paper, we propose a
full-resolution training framework for deep learning-based pansharpening. The
framework is fully general and can be used for any deep learning-based
pansharpening model. Training takes place in the high-resolution domain,
relying only on the original data, thus avoiding any loss of information. To
ensure spectral and spatial fidelity, a suitable two-component loss is defined.
The spectral component enforces consistency between the pansharpened output and
the low-resolution multispectral input. The spatial component, computed at
high-resolution, maximizes the local correlation between each pansharpened band
and the panchromatic input. At testing time, the target-adaptive operating
modality is adopted, achieving good generalization with a limited computational
overhead. Experiments carried out on WorldView-3, WorldView-2, and GeoEye-1
images show that methods trained with the proposed framework guarantee a pretty
good performance in terms of both full-resolution numerical indexes and visual
quality.

radio sources is important for using radio emission as a tracer of
star-formation in high redshift ($z$) star-forming galaxies (SFGs). Using deep
uGMRT observations of the ELAIS-N1 field in the 0.3--0.5\,GHz range, we study
the statistical properties of the radio--IR relations and the variation of the
`$q$-parameter' up to $z=2$ after broadly classifying the faint sources as SFGs
and AGN. We find the dust temperature ($\tdust$) to increase with $z$. This
gives rise to $\qmir$, measured at $24\,\upmu$m, to increase with $z$ as the
peak of IR emission shifts towards shorter wavelengths, resulting in the
largest scatter among different measures of $q$-parameters. $\qfir$ measured at
$70\,\upmu$m, and $q_{\rm TIR}$ using total-IR (TIR) emission are largely
unaffected by $\tdust$. We observe strong, non-linear correlations between the
radio luminosities at 0.4 and 1.4\,GHz with $70\,\upmu$m luminosity and TIR
luminosity($\ltir$). To assess the possible role of the radio-continuum
spectrum in making the relations non-linear, for the first time we study them
at high $z$ using integrated radio luminosity ($\lrc$) in the range
0.1--2\,GHz. In SFGs, the $\lrc$--$\ltir$ relation remains non-linear with a
slope of $1.07\pm0.02$, has a factor of 2 lower scatter compared to
monochromatic radio luminosities, and $\qtirbol$ decreases with $z$ as
$\qtirbol = (2.27 \pm 0.03)\,(1+z)^{-0.12 \pm 0.03}$. A redshift variation of
$q$ is a natural consequence of non-linearity. We suggest that a redshift
evolution of magnetic field strengths and/or cosmic ray acceleration efficiency
in high-$z$ SFGs could give rise to non-linear radio--IR relations.

lens mass. Therefore, long-lasting events are important candidates for massive
lenses, including black holes.
  Aims: Here we present the analysis of the Gaia18cbf microlensing event
reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system. It exhibited a long timescale and
features that are common for the annual microlensing parallax effect. We deduce
the parameters of the lens based on the derived best fitting model.
  Methods: We used photometric data collected by the Gaia satellite as well as
the follow-up data gathered by the ground-based observatories. We investigated
the range of microlensing models and used them to derive the most probable mass
and distance to the lens using a Galactic model as a prior. Using known
mass-brightness relation we determined how likely it is that the lens is a
main-sequence (MS) star.
  Results: This event is one of the longest ever detected, with the Einstein
timescale of $t_\mathrm{E}=491.41^{+128.31}_{-84.94}$ days for the best
solution and $t_\mathrm{E}=453.74^{+178.69}_{-105.74}$ days for the
second-best. Assuming Galaxy priors, this translates to the most probable lens
mass of $M_\mathrm{L} = 2.65^{+5.09}_{-1.48} M_\odot$ and $M_\mathrm{L} =
1.71^{+3.78}_{-1.06} M_\odot$, respectively.
  The limits on the blended light suggest that this event was most likely not
caused by a MS star, but rather by a dark remnant of stellar evolution.

case of a single quantum dot with either a doubly-degenerate level or two
non-degenerate levels. In the sequential tunneling regime we analyze the
behaviour of heat currents and rectification as functions of the position of
the energy levels and of the temperature bias. In particular, we derive an
upper bound for rectification in the closed-circuit setup with the
doubly-degenerate level. We also prove the absence of a bound for the case of
two non-degenerate levels and identify the ideal system parameters to achieve
nearly perfect rectification. The second part of the paper deals with the
effect of second-order cotunneling contributions, including both elastic and
inelastic processes. In all cases we find that there exists ranges of values of
parameters (such as the levels' position) where rectification is enhanced by
cotunneling. In particular, in the doubly-degenerate level case we find that
cotunneling corrections can enhance rectification when they reduce the
magnitude of the heat currents. For the four-terminal configuration, we analyze
the non-local situation of two Coulomb-coupled quantum dots, each connected to
two terminals: the temperature bias is applied to the two terminals connected
to one quantum dot, while the heat currents of interest are the ones flowing in
the other quantum dot. Remarkably, in this situation we find that non-local
rectification can be perfect as a consequence of the fact that the heat
currents vanish for properly tuned parameters.

algorithm of Wang, Magron and Lasserre [SIAM J. Optim., 31(1):30-58, 2021] with
existing infinite dimensional linear program representations of those sets.
This leads to iterative schemes in the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy which
allows less expensive computations while keeping convergence guarantees.
Finally this procedure is closely related to sign symmetries of the dynamical
system as was already revealed for polynomial optimization. Numerical examples
demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in the presence of appropriate
sparsity.

  Byzantine nodes can prevent nodes close to them from taking part in the

less of Byzantine nodes, and excluding some of the nodes at distance 2. As far
as we know, we present the first algorithm tolerating both transient and
Byzantine faults under the fair distributed daemon. We prove that this

fact that the remote sensing community has access to data taken with a hugely

undertaken separately for different sensors, which limits the performance of
deep learning models, given their need for huge training sets to perform
optimally. Sensor independence can enable deep learning models to utilise
multiple datasets for training simultaneously, boosting performance and making
them much more widely applicable. This may lead to deep learning approaches

the ocean due to their ability to transport material, heat, salt, and other
tracers across large distances. They exhibit at least two timescales; an
Eulerian lifetime associated with persistent identifiable signatures in gridded
fields such as vorticity or sea-surface height, and multiple Lagrangian or
material coherence timescales that are typically much shorter. We propose a
method to study the multi-timescale material transport, leakage, and
entrainment by eddies with their surroundings by constructing sequences of
finite-time coherent sets, computed as superlevel sets of dominant
eigenfunctions of dynamic Laplace operators. The dominant eigenvalues of
dynamic Laplace operators defined on time intervals of varying length allows us
to identify a maximal coherence timescale that minimizes the rate of mass loss
over a domain, per unit flow time. We apply the method to examine the
persistence and material coherence of an Agulhas ring, an ocean eddy in the
South Atlantic ocean, using particle trajectories derived from a $0.1^\circ$
global numerical ocean simulation. Using a sequence of sliding windows, the
method is able to identify and track a persistent eddy feature for a time much
longer than the maximal coherence timescale, and with considerably larger
material transport than the corresponding eddy feature identified from purely
Eulerian information. Furthermore, the median residence times of fluid in the
identified feature far exceed the timescale over which fully material motion is
guaranteed. Through residence time calculations, we find that this particular
eddy does not exhibit a long-lived coherent inner core and that the bulk of
material transport is performed by the quasi-coherent outer ring of the eddy.

number of physical parameters that are related to various oscillation modes,
quasi-linear combination tones or non-linear features that appear in the
post-merger phase. The time evolution of the main post-merger frequency peak is
taken into account and it is described by a two-segment linear expression. The
effectiveness of the model, in terms of the fitting factor or, equivalently,
the reduction in the detection rate, is evaluated along a sequence of
equal-mass simulations of varying mass. We find that all parameters of the
analytic model correlate with the total binary mass of the system. For high
masses, we identify new spectral features originating from the non-linear
coupling between the quasi-radial oscillation and the antipodal tidal
deformation, the inclusion of which significantly improves the fitting factors
achieved by the model. We can thus model the post-merger gravitational-wave
emission with an analytic model that achieves high fitting factors for a wide
range of total binary masses. Our model can be used for the detection and

ideas and cites' geometry, to a hierarchical organization and socio-network
properties. We also investigate scenarios in which these different fundamental

We explore how well one can detect fights from just a single still image. We

real-world images of fight actions. Results of the extensive experiments on the
proposed dataset show that fight actions can be recognized successfully from

possible to detect fights with high accuracy by utilizing appearance only. We
also perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate the representation capacity
of the collected dataset. These experiments indicate that, as in the other
computer vision problems, there exists a dataset bias for the fight recognition
problem. Although the methods achieve close to 100% accuracy when trained and
tested on the same fight dataset, the cross-dataset accuracies are
significantly lower, i.e., around 70% when more representative datasets are
used for training. SMFI dataset is found to be one of the two most

displacement of the ferromagnet, which is proportional to the magnon
population. By further coupling the mechanical displacement to an optical
cavity that is resonantly driven by a weak laser, the magnetostrictively
induced displacement can be sensed by measuring the phase quadrature of the
optical field. The phase shows an excellent linear dependence on the magnon
population for a not very large population, and can thus be used as a
`magnometer' to measure the magnon population. We further study the effect of
thermal noises, and find a high signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature.
At cryogenic temperatures, the resolution of magnon excitation numbers is
essentially limited by the vacuum fluctuations of the phase, which can be
significantly improved by using a squeezed light.

suppressed by inverse powers of the momentum, so that the symmetry is sensibly
restored in the infrared region. In the ultraviolet region, the singular

Several generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods have been proposed
to tackle the problem usually with the assumption that the targeted time series
data are well-formatted and complete. However, real-world time series (RTS)
data are far away from this utopia, e.g., long sequences with variable lengths
and informative missing data raise intractable challenges for designing
powerful generation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel generative
framework for RTS data - RTSGAN to tackle the aforementioned challenges. RTSGAN
first learns an encoder-decoder module which provides a mapping between a time
series instance and a fixed-dimension latent vector and then learns a
generation module to generate vectors in the same latent space. By combining
the generator and the decoder, RTSGAN is able to generate RTS which respect the
original feature distributions and the temporal dynamics. To generate time
series with missing values, we further equip RTSGAN with an observation
embedding layer and a decide-and-generate decoder to better utilize the
informative missing patterns. Experiments on the four RTS datasets show that
the proposed framework outperforms the previous generation methods in terms of
synthetic data utility for downstream classification and prediction tasks.

due to their effectiveness in processing complex-valued spectrum. Most of the
recent speech enhancement approaches mainly focus on wide-band signal with a
sampling rate of 16K Hz. However, research on super wide band (e.g., 32K Hz) or
even full-band (48K) denoising is still lacked due to the difficulty of
modeling more frequency bands and particularly high frequency components. In
this paper, we extend our previous deep complex convolution recurrent neural
network (DCCRN) substantially to a super wide band version -- S-DCCRN, to
perform speech denoising on speech of 32K Hz sampling rate. We first employ a
cascaded sub-band and full-band processing module, which consists of two
small-footprint DCCRNs -- one operates on sub-band signal and one operates on
full-band signal, aiming at benefiting from both local and global frequency
information. Moreover, instead of simply adopting the STFT feature as input, we
use a complex feature encoder trained in an end-to-end manner to refine the
information of different frequency bands. We also use a complex feature decoder
to revert the feature to time-frequency domain. Finally, a learnable spectrum
compression method is adopted to adjust the energy of different frequency
bands, which is beneficial for neural network learning. The proposed model,
S-DCCRN, has surpassed PercepNet as well as several competitive models and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality and

systems under Rayleigh fading channel. Conventional MIMO communication
techniques require transmitting a considerable amount of training symbols as
pilots in each data block to obtain the channel state information (CSI) such
that the transmitted signals can be successfully recovered. However, the pilot
overhead and contamination become a bottleneck for the practical application of
MIMO systems with the increase of the number of antennas. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose a blind channel estimation framework, where we introduce
an auxiliary posterior distribution of CSI and the transmitted signals given
the received signals to derive a lower bound to the intractable likelihood
function of the received signal. Meanwhile, we generate this auxiliary
distribution by a neural network based variational inference framework, which
is trained by maximizing the lower bound. The optimal auxiliary distribution
which approaches real prior distribution is then leveraged to obtain the
maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of channel matrix and transmitted data.
The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed blind
channel estimation method closely approaches that of the conventional
pilot-aided methods in terms of the channel estimation error and symbol error
rate (SER) of the detected signals even without the help of pilots.

light-matter interaction is ruled by collective effects, plasmonic

  In this paper, we present the first memory compression attacks exploiting

differences transmitting on average 643.25 bit/h over 14 hops over the

First, we show that an attacker can disclose secrets co-located and compressed

mapping between perceptual inputs (pixels of grayscale line drawings) and a
recently proposed psychological similarity space for the shape domain. We
investigate different network architectures (classification network vs.
autoencoder) and different training regimes (transfer learning vs. multi-task
learning). Our results indicate that a classification-based multi-task learning
scenario yields the best results, but that its performance is relatively
sensitive to the dimensionality of the similarity space.

may behave differently. To investigate the reliability of ViT, this paper
studies the behavior and robustness of ViT. We compared the robustness of CNN
and ViT by assuming various image corruptions that may appear in practical
vision tasks. We confirmed that for most image transformations, ViT showed
robustness comparable to CNN or more improved. However, for contrast
enhancement, severe performance degradations were consistently observed in ViT.
From a detailed analysis, we identified a potential problem: positional
embedding in ViT's patch embedding could work improperly when the color scale
changes. Here we claim the use of PreLayerNorm, a modified patch embedding
structure to ensure scale-invariant behavior of ViT. ViT with PreLayerNorm
showed improved robustness in various corruptions including contrast-varying

decay as power laws along certain velocities, determined by the flux Jacobian.
Such correlations are obtained by hydrodynamic projections, and physically,
they are due to propagating ""sound waves"" or generalisation thereof,
transporting conserved quantities between the observables. However, some
observables do not emit sound waves, such as order parameters associated to
symmetry breaking. In these cases correlation functions decay exponentially
everywhere, a behaviour not captured by the hydrodynamic linear response
theory. Focussing on spin-spin correlation functions in the XX quantum chain,
we first review how hydrodynamic linear response works, emphasising that the
necessary fluid cell averaging washes out oscillatory effects. We then show
how, beyond linear response, Euler hydrodynamics can still predict the
exponential decay of correlation functions of order parameters. This is done by
accounting for the large-scale fluctuations of domain walls, via the recently
developed ballistic fluctuation theory. We use the framework of generalised
hydrodynamics, which is particularly simple in this model due to its free
fermion description. In particular, this reproduces, by elementary
calculations, the exponential decay in the celebrated formulae by A.R. Its,
A.G. Izergin, V.E. Korepin, N.A. Slavnov (1993) and by X. Jie (1998), which
were originally obtained by intricate Fredholm determinant analysis; and gives

technology based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is bringing increasing security
concerns. While attacks operating at test time have monopolised the initial
attention of researchers, backdoor attacks, exploiting the possibility of
corrupting DNN models by interfering with the training process, represents a
further serious threat undermining the dependability of AI techniques. In a
backdoor attack, the attacker corrupts the training data so to induce an
erroneous behaviour at test time. Test time errors, however, are activated only
in the presence of a triggering event corresponding to a properly crafted input
sample. In this way, the corrupted network continues to work as expected for
regular inputs, and the malicious behaviour occurs only when the attacker
decides to activate the backdoor hidden within the network. In the last few
years, backdoor attacks have been the subject of an intense research activity
focusing on both the development of new classes of attacks, and the proposal of
possible countermeasures. The goal of this overview paper is to review the
works published until now, classifying the different types of attacks and
defences proposed so far. The classification guiding the analysis is based on
the amount of control that the attacker has on the training process, and the
capability of the defender to verify the integrity of the data used for
training, and to monitor the operations of the DNN at training and test time.
As such, the proposed analysis is particularly suited to highlight the
strengths and weaknesses of both attacks and defences with reference to the
application scenarios they are operating in.

a learnable attention-based network to fuse these segments based on their

eddy viscosity, using a nonlinear constitutive relation for the Reynolds
stresses to capture correctly secondary motions. Linearised equations,
describing the steady flow response to arbitrary surface modulations, are
derived by assuming that surface modulations are shallow. Since the equations
are linear, the superposition principle holds and the flow response induced by
an arbitrary modulation can be obtained by combining appropriately the
elementary responses obtained over sinusoidal modulations at multiple spanwise
length scales. The tool permits a rapid exploration of large parameter spaces
characterising structured surface topographies previously examined in the
literature. Here, channels with sinusoidal walls and with longitudinal
rectangular ridges are considered. For sinusoidal walls, a large response is
observed at two spanwise wavelengths scaling in inner and outer units
respectively, mirroring the amplification mechanisms in turbulent shear flows
observed from transient growth analysis. For longitudinal rectangular ridges,
the model suggests that the analysis of the response and the interpretation of
the topology of secondary structures is facilitated when the ridge width and
the gap between ridges are used instead of other combinations proposed in the

from the engineering perspective of real-time detection and wearable devices
design. It requires new solutions that allow continuous unobstructed monitoring
and reliable detection and prediction of seizures. A high variability in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns exists among people, brain states, and time
instances during seizures, but also during non-seizure periods. This makes
epileptic seizure detection very challenging, especially if data is grouped
under only seizure and non-seizure labels.
  Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, a novel machine learning approach, comes in
as a promising tool. However, it has certain limitations when the data shows a
high intra-class variability. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel
semi-supervised learning approach based on a multi-centroid HD computing. The
multi-centroid approach allows to have several prototype vectors representing
seizure and non-seizure states, which leads to significantly improved
performance when compared to a simple 2-class HD model.
  Further, real-life data imbalance poses an additional challenge and the
performance reported on balanced subsets of data is likely to be overestimated.
Thus, we test our multi-centroid approach with three different dataset
balancing scenarios, showing that performance improvement is higher for the
less balanced dataset. More specifically, up to 14% improvement is achieved on
an unbalanced test set with 10 times more non-seizure than seizure data. At the
same time, the total number of sub-classes is not significantly increased
compared to the balanced dataset. Thus, the proposed multi-centroid approach
can be an important element in achieving a high performance of epilepsy
detection with real-life data balance or during online learning, where seizures
are infrequent.

present a model in which inflectional systems reduce in disorder through the
action of an attraction-only dynamic, in which lexemes only ever grow more
similar to one another over time. Here we emphasise that: (1) Attraction-only
models cannot evolve the structured diversity which characterises true
inflectional systems, because they inevitably remove all variation; and (2)
Models with both attraction and repulsion enable the emergence of systems that
are strikingly reminiscent of morphomic structure such as inflection classes.
Thus, just one small ingredient -- change based on dissimilarity -- separates
models that tend inexorably to uniformity, and which therefore are implausible
for inflectional morphology, from those which evolve stable, morphome-like
structure. These models have the potential to alter how we attempt to account

classification parity: equality of opportunity and equalized odds. Column
generation (CG) is used to efficiently search over an exponential number of
candidate clauses (conjunctions or disjunctions) without the need for heuristic
rule mining. This approach also bounds the gap between the selected rule set
and the best possible rule set on the training data. To handle large datasets,
we propose an approximate CG algorithm using randomization. Compared to three
recently proposed alternatives, the CG algorithm dominates the
accuracy-simplicity trade-off in 8 out of 16 datasets. When maximized for
accuracy, CG is competitive with rule learners designed for this purpose,
sometimes finding significantly simpler solutions that are no less accurate.
Compared to other fair and interpretable classifiers, our method is able to
find rule sets that meet stricter notions of fairness with a modest trade-off
in accuracy.

  Different Scales through Mixture Modelling",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although most models for rainfall extremes focus on point-wise values, it is
aggregated precipitation over areas up to river catchment scale that is of the
most interest. To capture the joint behaviour of precipitation aggregates
evaluated at different spatial scales, parsimonious and effective models must
be built with knowledge of the underlying spatial process. Precipitation is
driven by a mixture of processes acting at different scales and intensities,
e.g., convective and frontal, with extremes of aggregates for typical catchment
sizes arising from extremes of only one of these processes, rather than a
combination of them. High-intensity convective events cause extreme spatial
aggregates at small scales but the contribution of lower-intensity large-scale
fronts is likely to increase as the area aggregated increases. Thus, to capture
small to large scale spatial aggregates within a single approach requires a
model that can accurately capture the extremal properties of both convective
and frontal events. Previous extreme value methods have ignored this mixture
structure; we propose a spatial extreme value model which is a mixture of two
components with different marginal and dependence models that are able to
capture the extremal behaviour of convective and frontal rainfall and more
faithfully reproduces spatial aggregates for a wide range of scales. Modelling
extremes of the frontal component raises new challenges due to it exhibiting
strong long-range extremal spatial dependence. Our modelling approach is
applied to fine-scale, high-dimensional, gridded precipitation data. We show
that accounting for the mixture structure improves the joint inference on
extremes of spatial aggregates over regions of different sizes.

noisy channels are a promising resource to realize commitment in an
information-theoretically secure manner. However, oftentimes, channel behaviour
may be poorly characterized thereby limiting the commitment throughput and/or
degrading the security guarantees; particularly problematic is when a dishonest
party, unbeknown to the honest one, can maliciously alter the channel
characteristics. Reverse elastic channels (RECs) are an interesting class of
such unreliable channels, where only a dishonest committer, say, Alice can
maliciously alter the channel. RECs have attracted recent interest in the study
of several cryptographic primitives.
  Our principal contribution is the REC commitment capacity characterization;
this proves a recent related conjecture. A key result is our tight converse
which analyses a specific cheating strategy by Alice. RECs are closely related
to the classic unfair noisy channels (UNCs); elastic channels (ECs), where only
a dishonest receiver Bob can alter the channel, are similarly related. In stark
contrast to UNCs, both RECs and ECs always exhibit positive commitment
throughput for all non-trivial parameters. Interestingly, our results show that
channels with exclusive one-sided elasticity for dishonest parties, exhibit a
fundamental asymmetry where a committer with one-sided elasticity has a more
debilitating effect on the commitment throughput than a receiver.

non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically
faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty
in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's
exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and
the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear

assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the

SequentialPointNet maximizes the appearance encoding ability and extracts

emerge from wave-pinning? We show that wave pinning senses the cell's long
axis. Simulating wave-pinning on a curved surface, we find that high-activity
domains migrate to peaks and troughs of the surface. For smooth surfaces, a
simple rule of minimizing the domain perimeter while keeping its area fixed
predicts the final position of the domain and its shape. However, when we
introduce roughness to our surfaces, shape sensing can be disrupted, and
high-activity domains can become localized to locations other than the global
peaks and valleys of the surface. On rough surfaces, the domains of the
wave-pinning model are more robust in finding the peaks and troughs than the
minimization rule, though both can become trapped in steady states away from
the peaks and valleys. We can control the robustness of shape sensing by
altering the Rho GTPase diffusivity and the domain size. We also find that the
shape sensing properties of cell polarity models can explain how domains
localize to curved regions of deformed cells. Our results help to understand
the factors that allow cells to sense their shape - and the limits that
membrane roughness can place on this process.

adaptive honest confidence sets with radius measured in Wasserstein distance
$W_p$, $p\geq1$, and for densities with unknown regularity measured on a Besov
scale. As sampling domains, we focus on the $d-$dimensional torus
$\mathbb{T}^d$, in which case $1\leq p\leq 2$, and $\mathbb{R}^d$, for which
$p=1$. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of
adaptive confidence sets with diameters of the order of the
regularity-dependent $W_p$-minimax estimation rate. Interestingly, it appears
that the possibility of such adaptation of the diameter depends on the
dimension of the underlying space. In low dimensions, $d\leq 4$, adaptation to
any regularity is possible. In higher dimensions, adaptation is possible if and
only if the underlying regularities belong to some interval of width at least
$d/(d-4)$. This contrasts with the usual $L_p-$theory where, independently of
the dimension, adaptation requires regularities to lie in a small fixed-width
window. For configurations allowing these adaptive sets to exist, we explicitly
construct confidence regions via the method of risk estimation, centred at
adaptive estimators. Those are the first results in a statistical approach to
adaptive uncertainty quantification with Wasserstein distances. Our analysis

and investigators often express interest in treatment effects that suitably
take account of these events. A naive conditioning on intercurrent events does
not have a straight-forward causal interpretation, and the practical relevance
of other commonly used approaches is debated. In this work, we discuss how to
formulate and choose an estimand, beyond the marginal intention to treat
effect, from the point of view of a decision maker and drug developer. In
particular, we argue that careful articulation of a practically useful research
question should either reflect decision making at this point in time or future
drug development. Indeed, a substantially interesting estimand is a
formalization of the (plain English) description of a research question. A
common feature of estimands that are practically useful is that they correspond
to possibly hypothetical but well-defined interventions in identifiable
(sub)populations. To illustrate our points, we consider five examples that were
recently used to motivate consideration of principal stratum estimands in
clinical trials. In all of these examples, we propose alternative causal
estimands, such as conditional effects, sequential regime effects and separable
effects, that correspond to explicit research questions of substantial
interest. Certain questions require stronger assumptions for identification.
However, we highlight that our proposed estimands require less stringent
assumptions than estimands commonly targeted in these settings, including
principal stratum effects.

determine the value of the metrics of the CVSS vector with high accuracy. The
severity score computed from the predicted CVSS vector is also very close to

Specifically, the first DNN is built to extract the information from the radar

considering completeness only as a function of either input or output magnitude

bias in the bright end of the UVLFs is on par with other systematic effects

the Galerkin projection (G) and the other one based on Artificial Neural
Network (ANN). We aim at comparing POD-G and POD-ANN in terms of relevant
features including errors and computational efficiency. In this context, both
physical and geometrical parametrization are considered. We also carry out a
validation of the Full Order Model (FOM) based on customized benchmarks in
order to provide a complete computational pipeline. The framework proposed is
applied to a relevant industrial problem related to the investigation of
thermomechanical phenomena arising in blast furnace hearth walls.

the problem of identifying the largest community within the population via
sequential, random sampling of individuals. There are multiple sampling
domains, referred to as \emph{boxes}, which also partition the population. Each
box may consist of individuals of different communities, and each community may
in turn be spread across multiple boxes. The learning agent can, at any time,
sample (with replacement) a random individual from any chosen box; when this is
done, the agent learns the community the sampled individual belongs to, and
also whether or not this individual has been sampled before. The goal of the
agent is to minimize the probability of mis-identifying the largest community
in a \emph{fixed budget} setting, by optimizing both the sampling strategy as
well as the decision rule. We propose and analyse novel algorithms for this

probability of error under any algorithm. In several cases of interest, the
exponential decay rates of the probability of error under our algorithms are
shown to be optimal up to constant factors. The proposed algorithms are further
validated via simulations on real-world datasets.

$f(z)$, from the evolution of the cosmic homogeneity scale, $R_{\text{H}}(z)$.
Our methodology needs two ingredients in a specific functional form:
$R_{\text{H}}(z)$ data and the matter two-point correlation function today,
i.e., $\xi(r, z=0)$. We use a Gaussian Process approach to reconstruct the
function $R_{\text{H}}$. In the absence of suitable observational information
of the matter correlation function in the local Universe, $z \simeq 0$, we
assume a fiducial cosmology to obtain $\xi(r, z=0)$. For this reason, our final
result turns out to be a consistency test of the cosmological model assumed.
Our results show a good agreement between: (i) the growth rate
$f^{R_{\text{H}}}(z)$ obtained through our approach, (ii) the
$f^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}(z)$ expected in the fiducial model, and (iii) the
best-fit $f(z)$ from data compiled in the literature. Moreover, using this data
compilation, we perform a Gaussian Process to reconstruct the growth rate
function $f^{\text{data}}(z)$ and compare it with the function
$f^{R_{\text{H}}}(z)$ finding a concordance of $< \!2 \,\sigma$, a good result
considering the few data available for both reconstruction processes. With more
accurate $R_{\text{H}}(z)$ data, from forthcoming surveys, the homogeneity
scale function might be better determined and would have the potential to
discriminate between $\Lambda$CDM and alternative scenarios as a new
cosmological observable.

various levels of service for varying prices such that rational users choose a
level of service that minimizes the total cost to themselves including an
opportunity cost that incorporates users' value of time. In this setting, we
study the sensitivity of the expected occupancy at the facility to
mischaracterizations of user profiles and uncharacterized heterogeneity. For
user profile mischaracterizations, we first provide a fundamental upper bound
for the difference between the expected occupancy under any two different
distributions on a user's impatience (i.e., value of time) that only depends on
the minimum and maximum charging rate offered by the charging facility. Next,
we consider the case when a user's impatience is a discrete random variable and
study the sensitivity of the expected occupancy to the probability masses and
attained values of the random variable. We show that the expected occupancy
varies linearly with respect to the probability masses and is piecewise
constant with respect to the attained values. Furthermore, we study the effects
on the expected occupancy from the occurrence of heterogeneous user
populations. In particular, we quantify the effect on the expected occupancy
from the existence of sub-populations that may only select a subset of the
offered service levels. Lastly, we quantify the variability of early departures
on the expected occupancy. These results demonstrate how the facility operator
might design prices such that the expected occupancy does not vary much under
small changes in the distribution of a user's impatience, variable and limited
user service needs, or uncharacterized early departure, quantities which are
generally difficult to characterize accurately from data. We further
demonstrate our results via examples.

on comparing pairs of sentences or claims, but self-contradiction detection
needs to further reason the semantics of an article and simultaneously learn
the contradiction-aware comparison from all pairs of sentences. Therefore, we
present the first model, Pairwise Contradiction Neural Network (PCNN), to not
only effectively identify self-contradiction articles, but also highlight the
most contradiction pairs of contradiction sentences. The main idea of PCNN is
two-fold. First, to mitigate the effect of data scarcity on self-contradiction
articles, we pre-train the module of pairwise contradiction learning using SNLI
and MNLI benchmarks. Second, we select top-K sentence pairs with the highest
contradiction probability values and model their correlation to determine
whether the corresponding article belongs to self-contradiction. Experiments
conducted on the proposed WikiContradiction dataset exhibit that PCNN can
generate promising performance and comprehensively highlight the sentence pairs

estimate such risks. In this study, we propose how to model airborne

susceptible, exposed, infectious or recovered. Infectious agents exhale
pathogens bound to persistent aerosols, whereas susceptible agents absorb
pathogens when moving through an aerosol cloud left by the infectious agent.
The transmission depends on the pathogen load of the aerosol cloud, which
changes over time. We propose a 'high risk' benchmark scenario to distinguish
critical from non-critical situations. Simulating indoor situations show that
the new model is suitable to evaluate the risk of exposure qualitatively and,
thus, enables scientists or even decision-makers to better assess the spread of

are calculated. It is shown that the general solution of one center Coulomb
Dirac equation contains free parameters. Changing one or more of these
parameters, one can transform one solution of the Dirac equation into any
other. It is shown for the first time that these invariants determine electron
spatial probability amplitude and spin polarization in each quantum state.
Electron probability densities and spin polarizations are explicitly calculated
in the general form for several electron states in the hydrogen-like energy
spectrum. Spatial distributions of these characteristics are shown to depend
essentially on the invariant set, demonstrating, in spite of the accidental
degeneracy of energy levels, physical difference of the states corresponding to
different spin invariants.

copy-on-write mappings. Previous work showed that this so-called memory
deduplication can be exploited in local attacks to break ASLR, spy on other
programs,and determine the presence of data, i.e., website images. All these
attacks exploit memory deduplication across security domains, which in turn was
disabled. However, within a security domain or on an isolated system with no
untrusted local access, memory deduplication is still not considered a security
risk and was recently re-enabled on Windows by default.
  In this paper, we present the first fully remote memorydeduplication attacks.
Unlike previous attacks, our attacks require no local code execution.
Consequently, we can disclose memory contents from a remote server merely by
sending and timing HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 network requests. We demonstrate our
attacks on deduplication both on Windows and Linux and attack widely used
server software such as Memcached and InnoDB. Our side channel leaks up to
34.41 B/h over the internet, making it faster than comparable remote
memory-disclosure channels. We showcase our remote memory-deduplication attack
in three case studies: First, we show that an attacker can disclose the
presence of data in memory on a server running Memcached. We show that this
information disclosure channel can also be used for fingerprinting and detect
the correct libc version over the internet in 166.51 s. Second, in combination
with InnoDB, we present an information disclosure attack to leak MariaDB
database records. Third, we demonstrate a fully remote KASLR break in less than
4 minutes allowing to derandomize the kernel image of a virtual machine over
the Internet, i.e., 14 network hops away. We conclude that memory deduplication
must also be considered a security risk if only applied within a single
security domain.

stakeholders to organize themselves in ``stake-pools'', have emerged as a
compelling paradigm for the deployment of large scale distributed ledgers. A
stake-pool operates a node that engages in the PoS protocol and potentially
represents a large number of smaller stakeholders. While such pooled PoS
operation is attractive from various angles, it also exhibits a significant
shortcoming that, so far and to the best of our knowledge, has not been
sufficiently understood or investigated. Pooled PoS operation, to be effective
and not lead to sub-optimal dictatorial or cartel-like configurations, should
enable the stakeholders to revoke and re-delegate their stake in a way that is
aligned with their incentives. However, given that stake-pool operators are
exactly those entities who determine what transactions are to be recorded in
the ledger, they are quite likely to form a cartel and censor any transaction
they want, such as those that attempt to adjust the current stake-pool lineup.
In this way, a power grab takes place, where the stake-pool cartel perpetuates
its control over the PoS system. We first model and observe formally the
emergence of the above problem in pooled PoS systems, and then we describe an
anti-censorship mechanism that takes advantage of the underlying cryptographic
functions of the ledger and the nature of peer-to-peer networks to diffuse
information without suppression. We provide a thorough game-theoretic analysis
of this mechanism discovering various types of Nash equilibria which
demonstrate that the ``revolution'', i.e., the strategic decision of pool
members to withdraw support from a censoring cartel as well as the pool
operators to step down, can be incentivized, under suitable and plausible
conditions in the utility functions of the involved participants.

set from the database. A recently proposed method is the regret minimization
set (RMS) query. RMS returns a size $r$ subset $S$ of dataset $D$ that
minimizes the regret-ratio (the difference between the score of top-1 in $S$
and the score of top-1 in $D$, for any possible utility function). RMS is not
shift invariant, causing inconsistency in results. Further, existing work
showed that the regret-ratio is often a made-up number and users may mistake
its absolute value. Instead, users do understand the notion of rank. Thus it
considered the problem of finding the minimal set $S$ with a rank-regret (the
rank of top-1 tuple of $S$ in the sorted list of $D$) at most $k$, called the
rank-regret representative (RRR) problem.
  Corresponding to RMS, we focus on the min-error version of RRR, called the
rank-regret minimization (RRM) problem, which finds a size $r$ set to minimize
the maximum rank-regret for all utility functions. Further, we generalize RRM
and propose the restricted RRM (i.e., RRRM) problem to optimize the rank-regret
for functions restricted in a given space. Previous studies on both RMS and RRR
did not consider the restricted function space. The solution for RRRM usually
has a lower regret level and can better serve the specific preferences of some
users. Note that RRM and RRRM are shift invariant. In 2D space, we design a
dynamic programming algorithm 2DRRM to return the optimal solution for RRM. In
HD space, we propose an algorithm HDRRM that introduces a double approximation
guarantee on rank-regret. Both 2DRRM and HDRRM are applicable for RRRM.
Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real datasets verify the efficiency
and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, HDRRM always has the best
output quality in experiments.

is an instantiation of a framework based on convex optimization (related to but

how the flows of a Coflow at individual ports are scheduled, and as a result
suffer two performance drawbacks: (1) The flows of a Coflow may suffer the

to ecologists because most fundamental biological processes, such as protein
synthesis and respiration, are inherently energy-consuming. Microbial
communities are a natural system to decipher this mechanistic basis because
their interactions in the form of substrate consumption, metabolite production,
and cross-feeding can be described explicitly in thermodynamic terms. Previous
work has considered how thermodynamic constraints impact competition between
pairs of species, but restrained from analysing how this manifests in complex
dynamical systems. To address this gap, we develop a thermodynamic microbial
community model with fully reversible reaction kinetics, which allows direct
consideration of free-energy dissipation. This also allows species to interact
via products rather than just substrates, increasing the dynamical complexity,
and allowing a more nuanced classification of interaction types to emerge.
Using this model, we find that community diversity increases with substrate
lability, because greater free-energy availability allows for faster generation
of niches. Thus, more niches are generated in the time frame of community
establishment, leading to higher final species diversity. We also find that
allowing species to make use of near-to-equilibrium reactions increases
diversity in a low free-energy regime. In such a regime, two new thermodynamic
interaction types that we identify here reach comparable strengths to the
conventional (competition and facilitation) types, emphasising the key role
that thermodynamics plays in community dynamics. Our results suggest that
accounting for realistic thermodynamic constraints is vital for understanding
the dynamics of real-world microbial communities.

Much of the existing vision-based research about bolt rotation estimation
relies on traditional computer vision algorithms such as Hough Transform to
assess static images of bolts. This requires careful image preprocessing, and
it may not perform well in the situation of complicated bolt assemblies, or in
the presence of surrounding objects and background noise, thus hindering their
real-world applications. In this study, an integrated real-time detect-track
method, namely RTDT-Bolt, is proposed to monitor the bolt rotation angle.
First, a real-time convolutional-neural-networks-based object detector, named
YOLOv3-tiny, is established and trained to localize structural bolts. Then, the
target-free object tracking algorithm based on optical flow is implemented, to
continuously monitor and quantify the rotation of structural bolts. In order to
enhance the tracking performance against background noise and potential
illumination changes during tracking, the YOLOv3-tiny is integrated with the
optical flow tracking algorithm to re-detect the bolts when the tracking gets
lost. Extensive parameter studies were conducted to identify optimal tracking
performance and examine the potential limitations. The results indicate the
RTDT-Bolt method can greatly enhance the tracking performance of bolt rotation,
which can achieve over 90% accuracy using the recommended range for the
parameters.

increased service quality. These improvements can be achieved by identifying
and understanding the factors that influence urban public transit demand.
Common factors that can influence urban public transit demand can be internal
and/or external factors. Internal factors include policy measures such as
transit fares, service headways, and travel times. External factors can include
geographic, socioeconomic, and highway facility characteristics. There is
inherent simultaneity between transit supply and demand, thus a two-stage least
squares (2SLS) regression modeling procedure should be conducted to forecast
urban transit supply and demand. As such, two multiple linear regression models
should be developed: one to predict transit supply and a second to predict
transit demand. It was found that service area density, total average cost per
trip, and the average number of vehicles operated in maximum service can be
used to forecast transit supply, expressed as vehicle revenue hours.
Furthermore, estimated vehicle revenue hours and total average fares per trip
can be used to forecast transit demand, expressed as unlinked passenger trips.
Additional data such as socioeconomic information of the surrounding areas for

with the synaptic connection, bump states and bump frequency cluster states,
which do not exist in adaptive networks without forcing. In addition the
adaptive network also exhibits partial synchronization patterns such as phase
and frequency clusters, forced entrained, and incoherent states. We introduce
two measures for the strength of incoherence based on the standard deviation of
the temporally averaged (mean) frequency and on the mean frequency in order to
classify the emergent dynamical states as well as their transitions. We provide
a two-parameter phase diagram showing the wealth of dynamical states. We
additionally deduce the stability condition for the frequency-entrained state.

With recent

evaluation are crucial for building owners and policy makers to make informed
risk management decisions. To improve the efficiency of such inspection,
advanced computer vision techniques based on convolution neural networks have
been adopted in recent research to rapidly quantify the damage state of
structures. In this paper, an advanced object detection neural network, named
YOLO-v2, is implemented which achieves 98.2% and 84.5% average precision in
training and testing, respectively. The proposed YOLO-v2 is used in combination
with the classification neural network, which improves the identification
accuracy for critical damage state of reinforced concrete structures by 7.5%.
The improved classification procedures allow engineers to rapidly and more
accurately quantify the damage states of the structure, and also localize the
critical damage features. The identified damage state can then be integrated
with the state-of-the-art performance evaluation framework to quantify the
financial losses of critical reinforced concrete buildings. The results can be
used by the building owners and decision makers to make informed risk
management decisions immediately after the strong earthquake shaking. Hence,
resources can be allocated rapidly to improve the resiliency of the community.

its application. Intermittent computations stem from the erratic energy
patterns caused by energy harvesting: computations unpredictably terminate
whenever energy is insufficient. Existing solutions maintain equivalence to
continuous executions by creating persistent state. The performance penalty is
massive: system throughput reduces while energy consumption increases.
Approximate intermittent computations trade the accuracy of the results for
sparing the entire overhead to maintain equivalence to a continuous execution.
We use approximation to limit the extent of stateful computations to the single
power cycle, enabling the system to shift the energy budget for managing
persistent state towards an immediate approximate result. First, we apply
approximate intermittent computing to human activity recognition. We design an
anytime variation of support vector machines able to improve the accuracy of
the classification as energy is available. We build a hw/sw prototype using
kinetic energy and show a 7x improvement in system throughput compared to state
of the art, while retaining 83% accuracy in a setting where the best attainable
accuracy is 88%. Next, we apply approximate intermittent computing in a sharply
different scenario, that is, embedded image processing, using loop perforation.
Using a different hw/sw prototype we build and diverse energy traces, we show a
5x improvement in system throughput compared to state of the art, while
providing an equivalent output in 84% of the cases.

orthorhombic Pnma and rhombohedral R3c symmetries were found, which coexist
within a broad compositional interval of 0.5 < x < 0.9. This might be a
polar-nonpolar morphotropic phase boundary region, at which strong phase-change
magnetoelectric responses can be expected. A major issue is phase decomposition
at moderate temperatures that highly complicates ceramic processing. This is

their use in devices. We present here the application of Spark Plasma Sintering

intrinsic dielectric permittivity was obtained, and a distinctive enhancement

The current paper proposes a new method to keep the students engaged while
learning by involving neuroscience during the classes of Microcontrollers.
Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards are studied at the course of Microcontrollers
using online simulation environments. The Emotiv Insight headset is used by the
professor during the theoretical and practical hours of the Microcontrollers
course. The analysis performed on the brainwaves generated by the headset
provides numerical values for the mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement,
excitement and interest levels of the professor. The approaches used during
teaching were inquiry-based learning, game-based learning and personalized
learning. In this way, professors can determine how to improve the connection
with their students based on the use of technology and virtual simulation
platforms. The results of the test show that the game-based learning was be
best approach because students had to become problem solves and start to use
the software skills which they will need as future software engineers. The
emphasis is put on mastering the mindset by having to choose their actions and
to experiment along the way. According to their achievement, students receive
