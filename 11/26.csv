Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g.

each novel scene.
  In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method

generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global
information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder
transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene
representation to render novel views. Learning is supervised end-to-end by
minimizing a novel-view reconstruction error.
  We show that this method outperforms recent baselines in terms of PSNR and

research focus has shifted towards developing computationally efficient
designs. Window-based local attention is one of the major techniques being
adopted in recent works. These methods begin with very small patch size and
small embedding dimensions and then perform strided convolution (patch merging)
in order to reduce the feature map size and increase embedding dimensions,
hence, forming a pyramidal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like design. In
this work, we investigate local and global information modelling in
transformers by presenting a novel isotropic architecture that adopts local
windows and special tokens, called Super tokens, for self-attention.
Specifically, a single Super token is assigned to each image window which
captures the rich local details for that window. These tokens are then employed
for cross-window communication and global representation learning. Hence, most
of the learning is independent of the image patches $(N)$ in the higher layers,
and the class embedding is learned solely based on the Super tokens $(N/M^2)$
where $M^2$ is the window size. In standard image classification on
Imagenet-1K, the proposed Super tokens based transformer (STT-S25) achieves
83.5\% accuracy which is equivalent to Swin transformer (Swin-B) with circa
half the number of parameters (49M) and double the inference time throughput.

scale, isotropic active colloidal particles and droplets exploit the non-linear
convective transport of chemical solutes emitted/consumed at their surface by
the surface-driven fluid flows generated by these solutes. Significant progress
was recently made to understand the onset of self-propulsion and non-linear
dynamics. Yet, most models ignore a fundamental experimental feature, namely
the spatial confinement of the colloid, and its effect on propulsion. In this
work, the self-propulsion of an isotropic colloid inside a capillary tube is
investigated numerically. A flexible computational framework is proposed based
on a finite-volume approach on adaptative octree-grids and embedded boundary
methods. This method is able to account for complex geometric confinement, the
nonlinear coupling of chemical transport and flow fields, and the precise
resolution of the surface boundary conditions, that drive the system's
dynamics. Somewhat counter-intuitively, spatial confinement promotes the
colloid's spontaneous motion by reducing the minimum advection-to-diffusion
ratio or P\'clet number, Pe, required to self-propel; furthermore,
self-propulsion velocities are significantly modified as the
colloid-to-capillary size ratio $\kappa$ is increased, reaching a maximum at
fixed Pe for an optimal confinement $0<\kappa<1$. These properties stem from a
fundamental change in the dominant chemical transport mechanism with respect to
the unbounded problem : with diffusion now restricted in most directions by the
confining walls, the excess solute is predominantly convected away downstream
from the colloid, enhancing front-back concentration contrasts. These results
are confirmed quantitatively using conservation arguments and lubrication
analysis of the tightly-confined limit, $\kappa\rightarrow 1$.

complements the target network with view-specific features and thus alleviates
the semantic degradation brought by intensive data augmentations. We execute

multi-messenger technique to address this question by exploiting the inevitable
correlation between gravitational waves and atomic/molecular emission line
signals. For a fiducial probability distribution function $p(t_d)\propto
t_d^{-\kappa}$ of time delays, this method can provide a measurement of the
minimum delay time of $0.5$ Gyr and the power-law index $\kappa=1$ with a
standard deviation $0.12$ (and $0.45$) and $0.06$ (and $0.34$), respectively
from five years of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation in synergy with SPHEREx line
intensity mapping (and DESI emission-line galaxies). Such measurements will
provide data-driven multi-messenger constraints on the delay time distribution
which is currently not well known.

In special, epidemic models have shown to be particularly useful in the
understanding of the course of diseases and in the planning effective control
policies. A particular type of epidemic model considers the individuals divided
into populations. When studied in graphs, it is already known that the graph
topology can play an important role in the evolution of the disease. At the
same time, one may want to study the effect of the presence of an underlying
\emph{attraction landscape} of the vertices, apart from the respectively
underlying topology. In this work, we study metapopulations with small number
of individuals in the presence of an attraction landscape. Individuals move
across populations and get infected according to the SIS compartmental model.
By using a Markov chain approach, we provide a numerical approximation to the
prediction of the long-term prevalence of the disease. More specifically, an
approach that combines two binomial distributions for mobility, with
appropriate assumptions, is proposed to approximate the model. The problem
setting is simulated through Monte-Carlo experiments and the obtained results
are compared to the mathematic-analytical approach. Substantial agreement is
observed between both approaches, which corroborates the effectiveness of the
reported numerical approach. In addition, we also study the impact of different
levels of attraction landscapes, as well as propagation on the local scale of
the entire population. All in all, this study proposes a potentially effective
approach to a mostly unexplored setting of disease transmission.

neural networks generalize well even though they typically contain millions of
parameters. Recently, it has been shown that the trajectories of iterative
optimization algorithms can possess fractal structures, and their
generalization error can be formally linked to the complexity of such fractals.
This complexity is measured by the fractal's intrinsic dimension, a quantity
usually much smaller than the number of parameters in the network. Even though
this perspective provides an explanation for why overparametrized networks
would not overfit, computing the intrinsic dimension (e.g., for monitoring
generalization during training) is a notoriously difficult task, where existing
methods typically fail even in moderate ambient dimensions. In this study, we
consider this problem from the lens of topological data analysis (TDA) and
develop a generic computational tool that is built on rigorous mathematical
foundations. By making a novel connection between learning theory and TDA, we
first illustrate that the generalization error can be equivalently bounded in
terms of a notion called the 'persistent homology dimension' (PHD), where,
compared with prior work, our approach does not require any additional
geometrical or statistical assumptions on the training dynamics. Then, by
utilizing recently established theoretical results and TDA tools, we develop an
efficient algorithm to estimate PHD in the scale of modern deep neural networks
and further provide visualization tools to help understand generalization in
deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently
compute a network's intrinsic dimension in a variety of settings, which is
predictive of the generalization error.

across a range of downstream tasks. The models are controlled by free

is conceptually similar to the estimation of latent-variable models, where
powerful tools such as variational inference (VI) exist. However, in contrast

near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole solutions in ungauged ${\cal N}=2$
supergravity theories at the two-derivative level by recasting them as a
specific first-order deformation in solution space, associated with an
infinitesimal Harrison transformation, of black holes in an $AdS_2$ space-time.
Specifically, we use this link to exhibit how bulk properties, such as mass and
entropy, of four-dimensional near-extremal black holes are holographically
encoded in the one-dimensional boundary theory dual to gravity in an
infinitesimally deformed $AdS_2$ space-time. We do so for the case of
four-dimensional near-extremal black holes that arise as deformations in
solution space of BPS black holes by changing the non-extremality parameter.
For these near-extremal black holes, we further show that the nAdS$_2$
attractor mechanism can be recast as a specific deformation of the BPS flow
equations in four dimensions. Additionally, we also discuss time-dependent
perturbations of the four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom
solutions from a two-dimensional point of view.

spontaneously emerge as a result of local pedestrian interactions. This clear
case of self-organized pattern formation remains to be elucidated. In
counterflows, with a crossing angle of 180{\deg}, alternating lanes of traffic
are commonly observed moving in opposite directions, whereas in crossing flows
at an angle of 90{\deg} diagonal stripes have been reported. Naka (1977)
hypothesized that stripe orientation is perpendicular to the bisector of the
crossing angle. However, studies of crossing flows at acute and obtuse angles
remain underdeveloped. We tested the bisector hypothesis in experiments on
small groups (18-19 participants each) crossing at seven angles (30{\deg}
intervals), and analyzed the geometric properties of stripes. We present two
novel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns in pedestrian data:
(i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes
and allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a
pattern-matching technique, based on the Gabor function, which allows us to
estimate global properties (orientation and wavelength) of the striped pattern
at a time T. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are
parallel and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast,
other properties depend on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength),
stripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe), and crossing time all decrease
as the crossing angle increases from 30{\deg} to 180{\deg}, whereas the number
of stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of
individual stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other.
The findings thus support the bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing
angles, although the theoretical reasons for this invariant remain unclear.

proposed method is planned to be applied during the Cubesats Applied for

localizing gamma-ray bursts with an efficiency and accuracy comparable to large
gamma-ray space observatories.
  In this paper we introduce a simulation model aimed at testing the
applicability of our attitude determination approach. Its first part simulates
the orbit and rotation of a satellite with arbitrary initial conditions while
its second part applies our attitude determination algorithm which is based on
a multiplicative extended Kalman filter. The simulated satellite is assumed to
be equipped with a GPS system, MEMS gyroscopes and the infrasensors. These
instruments provide the required data input for the Kalman filter. We
demonstrate the applicability of our attitude determination algorithm by
simulating the motion of a nano-satellite on Low Earth Orbit. Our results show
that the attitude determination may have a 1$\sigma$ error of $\sim30'$ even
with a large gyroscope drift during the orbital periods when the infrasensors
provide both the direction of the Sun and the Earth (the nadir). This accuracy
is an improvement on the point source detection accuracy of the infrasensors.
However, the attitude determination error can get as high as 25$^{\circ}$
during periods when the Sun is occulted by the Earth. We show that following an
occultation period the attitude information is immediately recovered by the
Kalman filter once the Sun is observed again.

model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features. These feature
extractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and

captioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end
transformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches
directly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of
leveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video
transformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to
variable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame
rates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can
benefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to
previous successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language
understanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the
inherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning
a sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance
improvement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through
extensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT
achieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often
by a large margin. The learned sparse attention masks in addition push the
limit to new state of the arts, and can be transferred between different video

the local stress buildup at cut tip during different stages of drawing. Based
on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC) and
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), we find several key results beyond the
existing knowledge base. (1) The inherent fracture and yield strengths
sigma_F(inh) and sigma_Y(inh) differ little in magnitude from the breaking and
yield stress (sigma_b and sigma_y). (2) Stress intensification (SI) near a
pre-through-cut builds up deviates from the theoretical description of linear
elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) upon approaching the cut tip. (3) SI meets a
natural cutoff below which stress ceases to increase. (4) The stress stip at
cut tip shows a trend of approximate linear increase with the far-field load s0
for all three polymers and different cut size a. (5) A characteristic length
scale P emerges from the linear relation between stip and KI. For these glassy
polymers, P is on the order of 0.1 mm. (6) Fracture toughness of brittle
polymers is characterized by critical stress intensity factor K_Ic =
sigma_F(inh)(2*pi*P)1/2, revealing relevance of the two crucial quantities. (7)
The critical energy release rate GIc for brittle glass polymers such as PMMA is
determined by the product of its work of fracture wF (of uncut specimen) and P.
(8) The elusive fractocohesive length Lfc defined in the literature as G_Ic/w_F

competitive ratio $1-O(\log{k}/k^{1/3})$ for $k=O((\log n)^{3/14})$. Our error
is simultaneously nearly-optimal and with optimal entropy $\Theta(\log\log n)$.
Our result improves in two ways the previous best construction by Kesselheim,
Kleinberg and Niazadeh (KKN) [STOC'15] whose competitive ratio is $1 -
O(1/k^{1/3}) - o(1)$. First, our solution works for an exponentially larger
range of parameters $k$, as in the work of KKN $k=O((\log\log\log

single-threshold algorithm (only drawing a permutation from a stochastic
uniform distribution), while the algorithm in KKN uses additional randomness.
We also prove a new corresponding lower bound for entropy of optimal solutions
to the $k$-secretary problem, matching the entropy of our algorithm. We further
show the strength of our techniques by obtaining fine-grained results for
optimal distributions of permutations for the classic secretary problem. For
optimal entropy $\Theta(\log\log n)$, we precisely characterize the success
probability of uniform distributions that is below, and close to, $1/e$, and
construct such distributions in polynomial time. We prove even higher entropy
$\Theta(\log(n))$ suffices for a success probability above $1/e$, but, no
uniform probability distribution with small support and entropy strictly less
than $\log (n)$ can have success probability above $1/e$. For maximum entropy
$\Theta(n \log(n))$, improving upon a result of Samuels from 1981, we find the
precise formula for the optimal success probability of any secretary algorithm.

There has been an increase in the application of Deep Learning in clinical

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the inclusion of more reliable
saliency-maps to obtain more trustworthy and interpretable metrics using neural
activity features is still insufficiently mature for practical applications in

classifiers that use neural measures to predict viewed facial emotions is
relatively unexplored. Therefore, in this study we propose the evaluation of a

a domain gap between a domain with annotations (source) and a domain of

method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the
pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in
cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and
generates many low-quality pseudo labels (\textit{e.g.,} false positives),
which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain
adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain
gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student
model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share
similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces
domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and
mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain)
and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher
model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the
source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing
approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin. For
example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape (Clipart1K), which is
9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art and Oracle,

more tractable than EP because at each refining step of a factor, the remaining
factors are fixed and do not depend on other datapoints as in EP, which makes
the sensitivity analysis straightforward. We provide a theoretical analysis of
the privacy-accuracy trade-off in the posterior estimates under our method,

to a classical deep learning model that requires all data to be shared for

systematically underestimate sensible and latent heat fluxes, creating an
imbalance in the surface energy budget. Since then, many studies have addressed
this problem and proposed a variety of solutions to the problem, including
improvements to instruments and correction methods applied during data
postprocessing. However, none of these measures have led to the complete
closure of the energy balance gap. The leading hypothesis is that not only
surface-attached turbulent eddies but also sub-mesoscale atmospheric
circulations contribute to the transport of energy in the atmospheric boundary
layer, and the contribution from organized motions has been grossly neglected.
The problem arises because the transport of energy through these secondary
circulations cannot be captured by the standard eddy covariance method given
the relatively short averaging periods of time (~30 minutes) used to compute
statistics. There are various approaches to adjust the measured heat fluxes by
attributing the missing energy to the sensible and latent heat flux in
different proportions. However, few correction methods are based on the
processes causing the energy balance gap. Several studies have shown that the
magnitude of the energy balance gap depends on the atmospheric stability and
the heterogeneity scale of the landscape around the measurement site. Based on
this, the energy balance gap within the surface layer has already been modelled
as a function of a nonlocal atmospheric stability parameter by performing a
large-eddy simulation study with idealized homogeneous surfaces. We have
further developed this approach by including thermal surface heterogeneity in

over latent spaces in a generative model to match a target image, or
adversarially perturbing an input to worsen classifier performance. Performing
such optimization, however, is traditionally quite costly, as it involves a
complete forward and backward pass through the network for each gradient step.
In a separate line of work, a recent thread of research has developed the deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, a class of models that foregoes traditional network
depth and instead computes the output of a network by finding the fixed point
of a single nonlinear layer. In this paper, we show that there is a natural
synergy between these two settings. Although, naively using DEQs for these
optimization problems is expensive (owing to the time needed to compute a fixed
point for each gradient step), we can leverage the fact that gradient-based
optimization can \emph{itself} be cast as a fixed point iteration to
substantially improve the overall speed. That is, we \emph{simultaneously} both
solve for the DEQ fixed point \emph{and} optimize over network inputs, all
within a single ``augmented'' DEQ model that jointly encodes both the original
network and the optimization process. Indeed, the procedure is fast enough that
it allows us to efficiently \emph{train} DEQ models for tasks traditionally
relying on an ``inner'' optimization loop. We demonstrate this strategy on
various tasks such as training generative models while optimizing over latent

subset of edges $H$ taken from the transitive closure of $G$ that, when added
to $G$ guarantees that the diameter of $G \cup H$ is small. Shortcut sets,
introduced by Thorup in 1993, have a wide range of applications in algorithm
design, especially in the context of parallel, distributed and dynamic
computation on directed graphs. A folklore result in this context shows that
every $n$-vertex digraph admits a shortcut set of linear size (i.e., of $O(n)$
edges) that reduces the diameter to $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Despite
extensive research over the years, the question of whether one can reduce the
diameter to $o(\sqrt{n})$ with $\widetilde{O}(n)$ shortcut edges has been left
open.
  We provide the first improved diameter-sparsity tradeoff for this problem,
breaking the $\sqrt{n}$ diameter barrier. Specifically, we show an
$O(n^{\omega})$-time randomized algorithm for computing a linear shortcut set
that reduces the diameter of the digraph to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. This
narrows the gap w.r.t the current diameter lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/6})$ by
[Huang and Pettie, SWAT'18]. Moreover, we show that a diameter of
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ can in fact be achieved with a \emph{sublinear} number
of $O(n^{3/4})$ shortcut edges. Formally, letting $S(n,D)$ be the bound on the
size of the shortcut set required in order to reduce the diameter of any
$n$-vertex digraph to at most $D$, our algorithms yield: \[
S(n,D)=\begin{cases} \widetilde{O}(n^2/D^3), & \text{for~} D\leq n^{1/3},\\
\widetilde{O}((n/D)^{3/2}), & \text{for~} D> n^{1/3}~. \end{cases} \] We also

inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system from noisy output
measurements taken after the initial time. In practical applications, the large
dimension of the dynamical system state poses a computational obstacle to
computing the exact posterior distribution. Model reduction offers a variety of
computational tools that seek to reduce this computational burden. In
particular, balanced truncation is a system-theoretic approach to model
reduction which obtains an efficient reduced-dimension dynamical system by
projecting the system operators onto state directions which trade off the
reachability and observability of state directions as expressed through the
associated Gramians. We introduce Gramian definitions relevant to the inference
setting and propose a balanced truncation approach based on these inference
Gramians that yield a reduced dynamical system that can be used to cheaply
approximate the posterior mean and covariance. Our definitions exploit natural
connections between (i) the reachability Gramian and the prior covariance and
(ii) the observability Gramian and the Fisher information. The resulting
reduced model then inherits stability properties and error bounds from system
theoretic considerations, and in some settings yields an optimal posterior
covariance approximation. Numerical demonstrations on two benchmark problems in

collision avoidance systems on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The proposed
methodology leverages real-time kinematic information broadcast via the
Automatic Information System (AIS) messaging protocol, in order to estimate the
position, speed, and heading of nearby cooperative targets. The state of each
target is recursively estimated in geodetic coordinates using an unscented
Kalman filter (UKF) with kinematic equations derived from the spherical law of
cosines. This improves upon previous approaches, many of which employ the
extended Kalman filter (EKF), and thus require the specification of a local
planar coordinate frame, in order to describe the state kinematics in an easily
differentiable form. The proposed geodetic UKF obviates the need for this local
plane. This feature is particularly advantageous for long-range ASVs, which
must otherwise periodically redefine a new local plane to curtail linearization
error. In real-world operations, this recurring redefinition can introduce
error and complicate mission planning. It is shown through both simulation and
field testing that the proposed geodetic UKF performs as well as, or better
than, the traditional plane-Cartesian EKF, both in terms of estimation error
and stability.

Such discrimination can have great consequences in the applications of

incorrect inferences in applications like online abuse and opinion analysis in
social media platforms can lead to unwanted ramifications, such as wrongful

significant biases in four widely used sentiment analysis tools (TextBlob,

analysis models trained to predict toxic comments on Jigsaw challenges (Toxic
comment classification and Unintended Bias in Toxic comments). The results show
that all exhibit strong negative biases on sentences that mention disability.

can however prove to be computationally expensive especially if the porous
medium is discretized into high-resolution grid blocks. We propose an interwell
simulation model for advection dispersion equations (ISADE) to predict the
concentration of contaminant observed at the pumping well. This method
comprises of two main steps. Initially, the model divides the aquifer or
reservoir into a series of 1D injector-producer pairs and uses the historical
contaminant observation data to estimate five major unknowns in each of these
control volumes: the interwell connectivity, the pore volume, the volumetric
flowrate at the grid face, the dispersion coefficient, and the number of grids
in each control volume. Finally, once the history matching process is complete,
the estimated variables are used to predict the concentration of contaminant
observed at the wells. Five example cases were studied and the results show
that the ISADE model was able to predict with reasonable accuracy the
concentration of contaminant observed. Furthermore, the model can easily handle
changes in input parameters such as the concentration of contaminants released

target category has complex Lie groups as objects and holomorphic symplectic
varieties with Hamiltonian actions of the groups as morphisms. The conjecture
is motivated by string theory, where $\eta_{G_{\mathbb{C}}}$ is obtained by
taking the Higgs branch of some supersymmetric quantum field theories (called
theories of class $S$) depending on $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a Riemann surface. The
goal of this paper is to define a real analogue $\mathrm{MT}_{\mathbb{R}}$ of
the target category $\mathrm{MT}$ and to rigorously prove that it is a
category.

determined by the homomorphism counts $\hom(F, G)$, i.e., the number of
homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$, where $F$ ranges over all graphs. Thus, in
principle, we can answer any query concerning $G$ with only accessing the
$\hom(\cdot,G)$'s instead of $G$ itself. In this paper, we deal with queries
for which there is a hom algorithm, i.e., there are finitely many graphs $F_1,
\ldots, F_k$ such that for any graph $G$ whether it is a Yes-instance of the
query is already determined by the
vector\[\overrightarrow{\hom}_{F_1,\ldots,F_k}(G):=
\big(\hom(F_1,G),\ldots,\hom(F_k,G)\big),\]where the graphs $F_1, \ldots, F_k$
only depend on $\varphi$.
  We observe that planarity of graphs and 3-colorability of graphs, properties
expressible in monadic second-order logic, have no hom algorithm. On the other
hand, queries expressible as a Boolean combination of universal sentences in
first-order logic FO have a hom algorithm. Even though it is not easy to find
FO definable queries without a hom algorithm, we succeed to show this for the
non-existence of an isolated vertex, a property expressible by the FO sentence
$\forall x\exists y Exy$, somehow the ``simplest'' graph property not definable
by a Boolean combination of universal sentences.These results provide a
characterization of the prefix classes of first-order logic with the property
that each query definable by a sentence of the prefix class has a hom
algorithm.
  For adaptive query algorithms, i.e., algorithms that again access
$\overrightarrow{\hom}_{F_1,\ldots,F_k}(G)$ but here $F_{i+1}$ might depend on
$\hom(F_1,G),\ldots,\hom(F_i,G)$, we show that three homomorphism counts
$\hom(\cdot,G)$ are both sufficient and in general necessary to determine the
isomorphism type of $G$.

elucidate the dynamics that govern the interactions between dissipative Kerr

$\left(\mathcal{F}_{m,n}\right)_{n=0}^\infty$ where $\mathcal{F}_{m,n}$ is the
Fibonacci number $F_n$ modulo $m$, has been a well-studied object in
mathematics since the seminal paper by D.~D.~Wall in 1960 exploring a myriad of
properties related to the periods of these sequences. Since the time of
Lagrange it has been known that $\left(\mathcal{F}_{m,n}\right)_{n=0}^\infty$
is periodic for each $m$. We examine this sequence when $m=10$, yielding a
sequence of period length 60. In particular, we explore its subsequences
composed of every $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ term of
$\left(\mathcal{F}_{10,n}\right)_{n=0}^\infty$ starting from the term
$\mathcal{F}_{10,k}$ for some $0 \leq k \leq 59$. More precisely we consider
the subsequences $\left(\mathcal{F}_{10,k+rj}\right)_{j=0}^\infty$, which we
show are themselves periodic and whose lengths divide 60. Many intriguing
properties reveal themselves as we alter the $k$ and $r$ values. For example,
for certain $r$ values the corresponding subsequences surprisingly obey the
Fibonacci recurrence relation; that is, any two consecutive subsequence terms
sum to the next term modulo 10. Moreover, for all $r$ values relatively prime
to 60, the subsequence $\left(\mathcal{F}_{10,k+rj}\right)_{j=0}^\infty$
coincides exactly with the original parent sequence
$\left(\mathcal{F}_{10,n}\right)_{n=0}^\infty$ (or a cyclic shift of it)
running either forward or reverse. We demystify this phenomena and explore many
other tantalizing properties of these subsequences.

play a fundamental role in many important dynamic processes in condensed
phases. Because it is extremely difficult to conduct full quantum dynamics
simulations on such environments due to their many degrees of freedom, here we
treat in detail the environment only around the main system of interest (the
subenvironment), while the other degrees of freedom needed to maintain the
equilibrium temperature are described by a simple harmonic bath, which we call
a quantum thermostat. The noise generated by the subenvironment is spatially
non-local and non-Gaussian and cannot be characterized by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We describe this model by simulating the
dynamics of a two-level system (TLS) that interacts with a subenvironment
consisting of a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin chain. The hierarchical
Schr\""odinger equations of motion are employed to describe the quantum
thermostat, allowing time-irreversible simulations of the dynamics at arbitrary
temperature. To see the effects of a quantum phase transition of the
subenvironment, we investigate the decoherence and relaxation processes of the
TLS at zero and finite temperatures for various values of the spin anisotropy.
We observed the decoherence of the TLS at finite temperature, even when the
anisotropy of the $XXZ$ model is enormous. We also found that the population
relaxation dynamics of the TLS changed in a complex manner with the change of
the anisotropy and the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic orders of the spins.

a set of parameters in the transverse-field Ising model for quantum annealing
appended with a field along the $y$ axis. The method consists of greedy
optimization of the signs of coefficients of the $y$-field term based on the
outputs of short annealing processes. We test the idea in the ferromagnetic
system with all-to-all couplings and spin-glass problems, and find that the
method outperforms the traditional form of quantum annealing and simulated
annealing in terms of the success probability and the time to solution, in
particular in the case of shorter annealing times, achieving the goal of
improved performance while avoiding noise. The non-stoquastic $\sigma^y$ term
can be eliminated by a rotation in the spin space, resulting in a non-trivial
diabatic control of the coefficients in the stoquastic transverse-field Ising
model, which may be feasible for experimental realization.

1947, year of the last accepted linguistic census. During this period, French
penetrated the Dutch-vernacular region of Brussels and started a language shift
that lasts to this day. The available time series are analyzed with a
mathematical model of sociolinguistic dynamics that accounts for cohabitation
of languages along bilingualism. Our equations are compatible with long-term
coexistence of both languages, or with one tongue taking over and extinguishing
the other. A series of model parameters (which we constrain by fitting our
equations to the data) determine which long-term trajectory (cohabitation or
extinction) would be followed. This allows us to estimate whether the empirical
data are compatible with a coexistence of Dutch and French -- in physics terms,
whether both tongues are {\em miscible}. Our results tilt towards
non-coexistence, or coexistence with a starkly-dominated, minority language.
The costs of attempting to sustain such sociolinguistic system are discussed.

spectral coordinates have shown promise for shape representation due to their
ability to incorporate both local and global shape properties in a manner that

such coordinates have thus far typically considered only local surface
positional or derivative information. In the present article, we propose to
equip spectral coordinates with medial (object width) information, so as to
enrich them. The key idea is to couple surface points that share a medial ball,
via the weights of the adjacency matrix. We develop a spectral feature using
this idea, and the algorithms to compute it. The incorporation of object width

embedded devices, embedded deployment for medical segmentation and automatic

attention in natural language processing. It uses pairs of training data
augmentations to build a classification task for an encoder with well
representation ability. However, the construction of learning pairs over
contrastive learning is much harder in NLP tasks. Previous works generate
word-level changes to form pairs, but small transforms may cause notable
changes on the meaning of sentences as the discrete and sparse nature of
natural language. In this paper, adversarial training is performed to generate
challenging and harder learning adversarial examples over the embedding space
of NLP as learning pairs. Using contrastive learning improves the
generalization ability of adversarial training because contrastive loss can
uniform the sample distribution. And at the same time, adversarial training
also enhances the robustness of contrastive learning. Two novel frameworks,
supervised contrastive adversarial learning (SCAL) and unsupervised SCAL
(USCAL), are proposed, which yields learning pairs by utilizing the adversarial
training for contrastive learning. The label-based loss of supervised tasks is
exploited to generate adversarial examples while unsupervised tasks bring
contrastive loss. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we

low mass loss rate and expansion velocity, challenging interpretations in terms
of standard wind models. Recent VLT and ALMA observations have drawn a detailed
picture of the circumstellar envelope within $\sim$20 au from the centre of the
star: a nearly edge-on rotating disc of gas and dust, probably hosting a
planetary companion near the star. However, these observations provide no
direct information on the wind escaping the gravity of the star. The present
article uses ALMA observations of the $^{12,13}$CO(3-2), $^{29}$SiO(8-7),
$^{12}$CO(2-1) and $^{28}$SiO(5-4) line emissions to shed new light on this

distances, up to some 200 au from the centre of the star, the wind
morpho-kinematics is dominated by a disc, or equatorial enhancement, expanding
isotropically and radially with a velocity not exceeding some 5 km s$^{-1}$ ,
inclined in the north-west/south-east direction with respect to the plane of
the sky. In addition, outflows of lower density are observed on both sides of
the disc, covering large solid angles about the disc axis, contributing about
half the flux of the disc. Such morphology is at strong variance with the
expectation of a pair of back-to-back outflows collimated by the central
gas-and-dust disc.

regulations are only triggered with respect to PII/PD, but not anonymous data.
This is not only problematic because determining whether data falls in the
former or latter category is no longer straightforward, but also because
privacy risks associated with data processing may exist whether or not an
individual can be identified. (2) Given sufficient information provided in a
transparent and understandable manner, individuals are able to adequately
assess the privacy implications of their actions and protect their privacy
interests: However, relying on human privacy expectations fails to address
important privacy threats, because those expectations are at odds with the
actual privacy implications of data processing practices, as most people lack
the necessary technical literacy to understand the sophisticated technologies

images, which generally requires unaligned data pairs for training. Recently,
self-supervised methods express great prospects in this task by merging the
disentangled representations for self-reconstruction. However, such methods
fail to exploit the spatial correlation between the disentangled features. In
this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Correlation Mining Network (SCM-Net)
to rearrange the source images in the feature space, in which two collaborative
modules are integrated, Decomposed Style Encoder (DSE) and Correlation Mining
Module (CMM). Specifically, the DSE first creates unaligned pairs at the
feature level. Then, the CMM establishes the spatial correlation field for
feature rearrangement. Eventually, a translation module transforms the
rearranged features to realistic results. Meanwhile, for improving the fidelity
of cross-scale pose transformation, we propose a graph based Body Structure
Retaining Loss (BSR Loss) to preserve reasonable body structures on half body
to full body generation. Extensive experiments conducted on DeepFashion dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with other supervised and
unsupervised approaches. Furthermore, satisfactory results on face generation
show the versatility of our method in other deformation tasks.

  thin film growth of rare earth nickelates electronic transition materials","33 Pages",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Although rare earth nickelates (ReNiO3) exhibit abundant electronic phases
and widely adjustable metal to insulator electronic transition properties,
their practical electronic applications are largely impeded by their intrinsic
meta stability. Apart from elevating oxygen reaction pressures, heterogeneous
nucleation is expected as an alternative strategy that enables the
crystallization of ReNiO3 at low meta stability. In this work, the respective
roles of high oxygen pressure and heterogeneous interface in triggering ReNiO3
thin films growth at metastable state are revealed. The ReNiO3 (Re:Nd, Sm, Eu,
Gd, and Dy) heterogeneous thin films growth on LaAlO3 single crystal substrate
have an effective crystallization at atmosphere without the necessity to apply
high oxygen pressures, suggesting the interfacial bonding between the ReNiO3
and substrates can sufficiently reduce the positive Gibbs formation energy of
ReNiO3, which is further verified by the first principles calculations.
Nevertheless, the abrupt electronic transitions only appear in ReNiO3 thin
films grown at high oxygen pressures, in which cases the oxygen vacancies are
effectively eliminated via high oxygen pressure reactions as indicated by near
edge X ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). This work unveils the
synergistic effects of heterogeneous nucleation and high oxygen pressure on the
growth of high quality ReNiO3 thin films.

equations whose solutions are given by holomorphic or meromorphic functions in
the complex domain. In many cases, only the magnitude of these functions are
observed on various points on the purely imaginary jw-axis since coherent
measurement of their phases is often expensive. However, it is desirable to
retrieve the lost phases from the magnitudes when possible. To this end, we
propose a physics-infused deep neural network based on the Blaschke products
for phase retrieval. Inspired by the Helson and Sarason Theorem, we recover
coefficients of a rational function of Blaschke products using a Blaschke
Product Neural Network (BPNN), based upon the magnitude observations as input.
The resulting rational function is then used for phase retrieval. We compare
the BPNN to conventional deep neural networks (NNs) on several phase retrieval
problems, comprising both synthetic and contemporary real-world problems (e.g.,
metamaterials for which data collection requires substantial expertise and is
time consuming). On each phase retrieval problem, we compare against a
population of conventional NNs of varying size and hyperparameter settings.
Even without any hyper-parameter search, we find that BPNNs consistently
outperform the population of optimized NNs in scarce data scenarios, and do so
despite being much smaller models. The results can in turn be applied to
calculate the refractive index of metamaterials, which is an important problem
in emerging areas of material science.

Here, we propose a new candidate material, KMgBO 3 , which showcase the
co-existence of several multifold and multidimensional topological phonon
excitations, which are protected by spatial and non-spatial symmetries. This
includes zero dimensional double, triple and quadratic Weyl phonon nodes, one
dimensional nodal line/loop and two dimensional doubly degenerate nodal surface
states. Nodal line/loop emerges from the spin- 12 phonon nodes, while the two
dimensional doubly degenerate nodal surface arises from a combination of two
fold screw rotational and time reversal symmetries. Application of strain
breaks the C 3 rotational symmetry, which annihilates the spin-1 double Weyl
nodes, but preserves other topological features. Interestingly, strain helps to
create two extra single Weyl nodes, which in turn preserve the total chirality.
Alloying also breaks certain symmetries, destroying most of the topological
phonon features in the present case. Thus, KMgBO 3 is a promising candidate
which hosts various Weyl points, large Fermi arcs with a very clean phonon
spectra and tunable topological phonon excitations, and hence certainly worth
for future theoretical/experimental investigation of topological phononics.

variants, are time series distances with a wide range of applications. They
minimize the cost of non-linear alignments between series. CDTW and WDTW have
been introduced because DTW is too permissive in its alignments. However, CDTW
uses a crude step function, allowing unconstrained flexibility within the
window, and none beyond it. WDTW's multiplicative weight is relative to the
distances between aligned points along a warped path, rather than being a
direct function of the amount of warping that is introduced. In this paper, we
introduce Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW), a new, intuitive, DTW variant
that penalizes the act of warping by a fixed additive cost. Like CDTW and WDTW,
ADTW constrains the amount of warping. However, it avoids both abrupt
discontinuities in the amount of warping allowed and the limitations of a
multiplicative penalty. We formally introduce ADTW, prove some of its

of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) remains unclear, making it difficult to
constrain the mass of the central compact object. X-ray luminosities of bright
ULXs can be explained with sub-critical accretion ($L<L_{\rm Edd}$) on to an
intermediate-mass BH, with the alternative being super-critical accretion on to
a stellar-mass BH. Broadband X-ray emission in the former scenario can be
explained using the canonical disk plus Comptonizing corona model, whereas in
the latter scenario radiation pressure driven massive winds lead to complex
spectra that are inclination angle dependent. Here we fit the broadband
(optical/UV to X-ray) spectrum of the persistently bright ULX Holmberg IX X-1
with the disk-corona plus irradiated outer disk model in an effort to constrain
the BH mass. We use a one-zone time-dependent numerical code to exactly solve
for the steady-state properties of the optically thick coronal
photon-electron-positron plasma. Our modelling suggests that Holmberg IX X-1
hosts a stellar mass BH, with mass $4\lesssim(\hat M_{\rm BH}\equiv\alpha
M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\lesssim10$ where $1/6\leq\alpha<1$ for a spinning (Kerr)
BH, undergoing super-critical accretion ($L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm
Edd}\sim20\alpha$). In our model, the X-ray spectrum below $10\,$keV is
explained with an absorbed multi-colour disk spectrum having inner disk
temperature $k_BT_{\rm in}\sim(2.2-2.9)\,$keV. An additional cooler thermal
spectral component, as found in many works and not included in our modeling, is
required. The hard excess above $10\,$keV, as seen by NuSTAR, arises in a

DCO$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio is found to be lower in several dense cores than in
starless cores embedded in low-mass star-forming regions. By comparing the
observational results with chemical model calculations, we discuss the origin
of the low DCO$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio in this IRDC clump. The low
DCO$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio can be explained if the temperature of the dense cores
is in the range between the sublimation temperature of N$_2$ ($\sim$20 K) and
CO ($\sim$25 K). The results suggest that the dense cores in G14.492-00.139 are
warmer and denser than the dense cores in low-mass star-forming regions.

are designed to minimize the burden of evacuation on human survivors. However,
the larger the scale of the disaster, the more costly it becomes to operate
shelters. When the number of evacuees decreases, the operation costs can be
reduced by moving the remaining evacuees to other shelters and closing shelters
as quickly as possible. On the other hand, relocation between shelters imposes
a huge emotional burden on evacuees. In this study, we formulate the
""Evacuation Shelter Scheduling Problem,"" which allocates evacuees to shelters
in such a way to minimize the movement costs of the evacuees and the operation
costs of the shelters. Since it is difficult to solve this quadratic
programming problem directly, we show its transformation into a 0-1 integer
programming problem. In addition, such a formulation struggles to calculate the
burden of relocating them from historical data because no payments are actually
made. To solve this issue, we propose a method that estimates movement costs
based on the numbers of evacuees and shelters during an actual disaster.
Simulation experiments with records from the Kobe earthquake (Great
Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake) showed that our proposed method reduced operation
costs by 33.7 million dollars: 32%.

success and have been continuously applied in many application domains.
However, during the practical deployment in the industrial tasks, DNNs are
found to be erroneous-prone due to various reasons such as overfitting, lacking
robustness to real-world corruptions during practical usage. To address these
challenges, many recent attempts have been made to repair DNNs for version
updates under practical operational contexts by updating weights (i.e., network
parameters) through retraining, fine-tuning, or direct weight fixing at a
neural level. In this work, as the first attempt, we initiate to repair DNNs by
jointly optimizing the architecture and weights at a higher (i.e., block)
level.
  We first perform empirical studies to investigate the limitation of whole
network-level and layer-level repairing, which motivates us to explore a novel
repairing direction for DNN repair at the block level. To this end, we first
propose adversarial-aware spectrum analysis for vulnerable block localization
that considers the neurons' status and weights' gradients in blocks during the
forward and backward processes, which enables more accurate candidate block
localization for repairing even under a few examples. Then, we further propose
the architecture-oriented search-based repairing that relaxes the targeted
block to a continuous repairing search space at higher deep feature levels. By
jointly optimizing the architecture and weights in that space, we can identify
a much better block architecture. We implement our proposed repairing
techniques as a tool, named ArchRepair, and conduct extensive experiments to
validate the proposed method. The results show that our method can not only
repair but also enhance accuracy & robustness, outperforming the
state-of-the-art DNN repair techniques.

learning. Random Matrix Theory (RMT) provides an emerging way to this end:
spectral analysis of large random matrices involved in a trained deep neural
network (DNN) such as weight matrices or Hessian matrices with respect to the
stochastic gradient descent algorithm. To have more comprehensive understanding
of weight matrices spectra, we conduct extensive experiments on weight matrices
in different modules, e.g., layers, networks and data sets. Following the
previous work of \cite{martin2018implicit}, we classify the spectra in the
terminal stage into three main types: Light Tail (LT), Bulk Transition period
(BT) and Heavy Tail(HT). These different types, especially HT, implicitly
indicate some regularization in the DNNs. A main contribution from the paper is
that we identify the difficulty of the classification problem as a driving
factor for the appearance of heavy tail in weight matrices spectra. Higher the
classification difficulty, higher the chance for HT to appear. Moreover, the
classification difficulty can be affected by the signal-to-noise ratio of the
dataset, or by the complexity of the classification problem (complex features,
large number of classes) as well. Leveraging on this finding, we further
propose a spectral criterion to detect the appearance of heavy tails and use it
to early stop the training process without testing data. Such early stopped
DNNs have the merit of avoiding overfitting and unnecessary extra training
while preserving a much comparable generalization ability. These findings from
the paper are validated in several NNs, using Gaussian synthetic data and real
data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10).

Search (NAS). However, existing NAS methods for object detection require
hundreds to thousands of GPU hours of searching, making them impractical in

NAS method to address this issue. The proposed method, named MAE-DET,
automatically designs efficient detection backbones via the Maximum Entropy
Principle without training network parameters, reducing the architecture design
cost to nearly zero yet delivering the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
Under the hood, MAE-DET maximizes the differential entropy of detection
backbones, leading to a better feature extractor for object detection under the
same computational budgets. After merely one GPU day of fully automatic design,
MAE-DET innovates SOTA detection backbones on multiple detection benchmark
datasets with little human intervention. Comparing to ResNet-50 backbone,
MAE-DET is $+2.0\%$ better in mAP when using the same amount of

for assessing their kinematic evolution. Furthermore, techniques based on
geometric modelling, such as ELEvoHI, are being developed into forecast tools
for space weather prediction. These models assume that solar wind structure
does not affect the evolution of the CME, which is an unquantified source of
uncertainty. We use a large number of Cone CME simulations with the HUXt solar
wind model to quantify the scale of uncertainty introduced into geometric
modelling and the ELEvoHI CME arrival times by solar wind structure. We produce
a database of simulations, representing an average, a fast, and an extreme CME
scenario, each independently propagating through 100 different ambient solar
wind environments. Synthetic heliospheric imager observations of these
simulations are then used with a range of geometric models to estimate the CME
kinematics. The errors of geometric modelling depend on the location of the
observer, but do not seem to depend on the CME scenario. In general, geometric
models are biased towards predicting CME apex distances that are larger than
the true value. For these CME scenarios, geometric modelling errors are
minimised for an observer in the L5 region. Furthermore, geometric modelling
errors increase with the level of solar wind structure in the path of the CME.
The ELEvoHI arrival time errors are minimised for an observer in the L5 region,
with mean absolute arrival time errors of $8.2\pm1.2$~h, $8.3\pm1.0$~h, and
$5.8\pm0.9$~h for the average, fast, and extreme CME scenarios.

easily derived from the underlying Wright-Fisher model. Unfortunately, the
textbook derivation of diffusion equations as scaling limits requires
evolutionary parameters (selection coefficients, mutation rates) to scale like
the inverse population size -- a severe restriction that does not always
reflect biological reality. Here we note that the Wright-Fisher model can be
approximated by diffusion equations under more general conditions, including in
regimes where selection and/or mutation are strong compared to genetic drift.
As an illustration, we use a diffusion approximation of the Wright-Fisher model
to improve estimates for the expected time to fixation of a strongly
deleterious allele, i.e. the rate of Muller's ratchet.

Understanding the interaction patterns between a particular virus and human

treatment of virus-related diseases. However, the task of predicting
protein-protein interactions between a new virus and human cells is extremely
challenging due to scarce data on virus-human interactions and fast mutation
rates of most viruses.
  We developed a multitask transfer learning approach that exploits the
information of around 24 million protein sequences and the interaction patterns
from the human interactome to counter the problem of small training datasets.
Instead of using hand-crafted protein features, we utilize statistically rich
protein representations learned by a deep language modeling approach from a
massive source of protein sequences. Additionally, we employ an additional
objective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human
protein-protein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a
regularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the
virus-human protein-protein interaction prediction model.
  Our approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets and the
case study for the SAR-CoV-2 virus receptor. Experimental results show that our
proposed model works effectively for both virus-human and bacteria-human

Surprisingly, we can nevertheless predict this information from the second-rank

The planets cannot have interacted with more than ${\sim 5\%}$ of an Earth mass

Earth's Moon -- without disrupting their resonant orbital structure. This
implies an upper limit of ${10^{-4}}$ to ${10^{-2} M_\oplus}$ of late accretion

comparable to or less than the late accretion on Earth after the Moon-forming

exhibit persistently narrow HeI lines, and whose bolometric light curves are
typically fast evolving and overluminous at peak relative to standard Type Ibc
SNe. We explore the interaction scenario of such Type Ibn SNe by performing
radiation-hydrodynamics and radiative-transfer calculations. We find that
standard-energy helium-star explosions within dense wind-like circumstellar
material (CSM) can reach on day timescales a peak luminosity of a few 10^44
erg/s, reminiscent of exceptional events like AT2018cow. Similar interactions
but with weaker winds can lead to Type Ibc SNe with double-peak light curves
and peak luminosities in the range ~10^42.2 to ~10^43 erg/s. In contrast, the
narrow spectral lines and modest peak luminosities of most Type Ibn SNe are
suggestive of a low-energy explosion in an initially <~5 Msun helium star, most
likely arising from interacting binaries, and colliding with a massive
helium-rich, probably ejecta-like, CSM at ~10^15 cm. Nonlocal thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations of a slow-moving dense shell born
out and powered by the interaction compare favorably to Type Ibn SNe like
2006jc, 2011hw, or 2018bcc at late times and suggest a composition made of
about 50% helium, a solar metallicity, and a total ejecta/CSM mass of 1-2Msun.
A lower fractional helium abundance leads to weak or absent HeI lines and thus
excludes more massive configurations for observed Type Ibn SNe. Further, the
dominance of FeII emission below 5500A seen in Type Ibn SNe at late times is
not predicted at low metallicity. Hence, despite their promising properties,
Type Ibn SNe from pulsational-pair instability in very massive stars, which
requires low metallicity, have probably not yet been observed.

thought experiment, we propose a characterization of U-OOD based on the
invariants of the training dataset. We show how this characterization is
unknowingly embodied in the top-scoring MahaAD method, thereby explaining its
quality. Furthermore, our approach can be used to interpret predictions of
U-OOD detectors and provides insights into good practices for evaluating future
U-OOD methods.

differently. We study the supersymmetric partition functions and the

example, confinement appears for $F+k-N=-n=1$ or $N=2F=k=-n=2$. For $F+k-N<0$,
supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, which is in accord with the fact that
the partition function vanishes. In some cases, the theory shows supersymmetry
enhancement to 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$. For $k=0$, we comment on the magnetic
description dual to the so-called ""ugly"" theory, where the usual decoupled
sector is still interacting with others for $n \neq 0$. We argue that the
$SU(N)_0$ ""ugly-good"" duality (which corresponds to the $n \rightarrow \infty$
limit in our setup) is closely related to the S-duality of the 4d

stable and low-error encoders are available for polarization encoding, suitable

for fiber-optic channels, as birefingence does not perturb this kind of states.
Here we present a cross-encoded scheme where high accuracy quantum states are

and transmitted using a polarization-to-time-bin converter. A hybrid receiver
performs both time-of-arrival and polarization measurements to decode the

homogeneous sub-samples. The combination of flood types in a mixture model then
gives classical flood quantiles for given return periods. This higher

particulate materials. Several studies have attempted to correlate the
discharge rate with the rotation speed of the screw via experiments and
particle dynamics simulations. However, a detailed mechanical model that would
assist in the optimal design of screw conveyors has not been attempted. In this
study, we first construct a simple model that assumes the entire granular
medium to move as a rigid body sliding along the surfaces of the screw and
barrel. By enforcing the balances of linear and angular momentum to a suitably
chosen continuum element, we show that under certain limiting conditions, the
discharge rate for a given angular velocity and screw geometry can be obtained.
Further, we show that the discharge can be maximized by setting the ratio of
the pitch to barrel diameter to a particular value. We then study the detailed
flow within the conveyor using the Discrete Element Method, which reveals that
a significant fraction of the material exhibits solid body motion, in agreement
with the simple model. We assess the effect of relaxing the limiting conditions
employed in the model, thereby determining the connection between the friction
at the walls and the kinematics of flow. Finally, the trend in variation of
average axial velocity with the pitch to barrel diameter ratio in the presence
of gravity is compared with that from our model and simulations in the absence
of gravity. We observe that both the trends are qualitatively the same
indicating that the dependence of average axial velocity on the geometry of the
conveyor is not altered by the introduction of gravity.

ribbons were thoroughly investigated by scanning electron microscopy / electron
backscattered diffraction (SEM/EBSD), nanoindentation and 3-points bending
experiments. Through SEM/EBSD analyses, the microstructure and texture of the
as-spun ribbons were studied. A gradient in microstructure exists along the
thickness direction (TD) of the ribbon, which is induced by the temperature
gradient during fast rate solidification, resulting in fine equiaxed grains
along the surface contacted with the rotating wheel in melt spinning process
and elongated grains, respectively. Both equiaxed and elongated grains possess
a strong {001} fiber texture (<001>//TD). Nanoindentation analyses show little
variation of hardness between the two different microstructures. The ductility
index of both Ni-Fe-Mn-Al and Ni-Fe-Mn-In ribbons are within the range of
intermetallic materials. The substitution of In by Al allows to increase very
slightly the ductility index, which can reach 0.75. The fine equiaxed grains
show better tensile resistance than the elongated grains in 3-points bending
test. The substitution of In by Al improves the maximum bending strain by a
factor of 3. The maximum strain for Ni-Fe-Mn-Al as-spun ribbons can reach 3 %
before fracture. Fractography shows that the intergranular fracture is the main

leads to large electric fields above the granular bed. Airborne dielectric
grains are polarized in these electric fields, which leads to attractive forces
between grains. To simulate aggregation under these conditions we carried out
drop tower experiments using tracer particles, mimicking the gas coupling
behavior of small dust grains in terms of high surface to mass ratios and
efficient gas drag. Under microgravity, the particles are released into an
observation chamber in which an alternating electric field up to 80 kV/m is
applied. Without electric field no aggregation can be observed on timescales of
seconds. However, polarization instantly leads to aggregation of particles when
the field is switched on and long chains aligned to the electric field form.
Scaled to dust entrained into planetary atmospheres, fine and coarse grain
fractions might readily form aggregates after being liberated. Under certain
natural conditions, aggregates might therefore start chain-like or at least a
chain-like appearance is favored. If atmospheric influences on their stability

supercells is determining how to eliminate symmetry-equivalent structures from
the large number of substitution patterns. Although the total number of

substitution patterns need to be identified, and their number is far smaller
than the total. A straightforward solution would be to classify them after

however failed to reconcile the goal for fine-grained translation and the goal

simultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to
the desired image with smooth subtle changes with respect to the interested

image and the desired image. Rival preferences refer to the adversarial ranking
process: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the
input image in terms of the desired attributes; (2) the generator fools the
ranker to believe that the desired image changes the attributes over the input
image as desired. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the
ranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only. With an
effective ranker, the generator would ""win"" the adversarial game by producing
high-quality images that present desired changes over the attributes compared

with heavy economic consequences for both farmers and the food industry. The
spread of the virus that causes ASF through Europe raises the issues of
identifying transmission routes and assessing their relative contributions in
order to provide insights to stakeholders for adapted surveillance and control
measures. A simulation model was developed to assess ASF spread over the
commercial swine network in France. The model was designed from raw movement
data and actual farm characteristics. A metapopulation approach was used, with
transmission processes at the herd level potentially leading, through a
reaction-diffusion process, to external spread to epidemiologically connected
herds. Three transmission routes were considered: local transmission (e.g.
fomites, material exchange), movement of animals from infected to susceptible
sites, and transit of trucks without physical animal exchange. Surveillance was
based on prevalence and mortality detection thresholds, which triggered control
measures based on movement ban for detected herds and epidemiologically related
herds. The time from infection to detection varied between 8 and 21 days,
depending on the detection criteria, but was also dependent on the types of
herds in which the infection was introduced. Movement restrictions effectively
reduced the transmission between herds, but local transmission was nevertheless
observed in higher proportions highlighting the need of global awareness of all
actors of the swine industry to mitigate the risk of local spread. Raw movement
data were directly used to build a dynamic network on a realistic time-scale.
This approach allows for a rapid update of input data without any
pre-treatment, which could be important in terms of reactivity, should an
introduction occur.

criterion to mitigate the adverse effect of certain specific confounder, which
require the explicit identification of confounder. However, in real scenarios,
confounders are typically diverse and difficult to be identified. In this
paper, we propose a novel Confounder Identification-free Causal Visual Feature
Learning (CICF) method, which obviates the need for identifying confounders.
CICF models the interventions among different samples based on front-door
criterion, and then approximates the global-scope intervening effect upon the
instance-level interventions from the perspective of optimization. In this way,
we aim to find a reliable optimization direction, which avoids the intervening
effects of confounders, to learn causal features. Furthermore, we uncover the
relation between CICF and the popular meta-learning strategy MAML, and provide
an interpretation of why MAML works from the theoretical perspective of causal
learning for the first time. Thanks to the effective learning of causal
features, our CICF enables models to have superior generalization capability.
Extensive experiments on domain generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our CICF, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

lately trying to mitigate human dependency, among which deep learning (DL)
attacks are the most studied today. DL promise to simplify the procedure by
e.g. evading the need for point of interest selection or the capability of
bypassing noise and desynchronization, among other shortcuts. However,
including DL in the equation comes at a price, since working with neural

that for the deduction of the intrinsic $\tau_\epsilon$ of the material from

several excitable media. Their dynamics are known to be affected by target
waves and external gradients. When the core of two spirals come very close to
each other, they could either repel or attract, depending on their relative
chirality and the distance separating them. Multiple pairs of spiral waves, in
close vicinity, could alter the paths of the individual rotors. A single spiral
core, will be influenced most by the rotor closest to it, or linked to it by a
common wave. If within a limiting distance, they would attract each other, and
annihilate. Else, they will push each other away, until they reach a critical
distance, beyond which, all interactions seem to cease. We have carried out
numerical simulations based on a reaction-diffusion model to show the possible
interactions of multiple spiral rotors. We are able to find a quantitative
measurement of the distances determining the kind of interaction. Some unique

magnetohydrodynamic waves at the base of an isothermal three-dimensional (3D)
plane stratified atmosphere. Together with existing convergent Frobenius series
solutions about $z=\infty$, matchings are numerically calculated that
illuminate the fates of slow and Alfv\'en waves injected from below. An
Alfv\'en wave in a two-dimensional model is 2.5D in the sense that the wave
propagates in the plane of the magnetic field but its polarization is normal to
it in an ignorable horizontal direction, and the wave remains an Alfv\'en wave
throughout. The rotation of the plane of wave propagation away from the
vertical plane of the magnetic field pushes the plasma displacement vector away
from horizontal, thereby coupling it to stratification. It is shown that potent
slow-Alfv\'en coupling occurs in such 3D models. It is found that about 50% of
direction-averaged Alfv\'en wave flux generated in the low atmosphere at
frequencies comparable to or greater than the acoustic cutoff can reach the top
as Alfv\'en flux for small magnetic field inclinations $\theta$, and this
increases to 80% or more with increasing $\theta$. On the other hand,
direction-averaged slow waves can be 40% effective in converting to Alfv\'en
waves at small inclination, but this reduces sharply with increasing $\theta$
and wave frequency. Together with previously explored fast-slow and
fast-Alfv\'en couplings, this provides valuable insights into which injected
transverse waves can reach the upper atmosphere as Alfv\'en waves, with
implications for solar and stellar coronal heating and solar/stellar wind
acceleration.

for implementing the window function in conjunction with a periodic

information in different time windows through the generated waveform via
frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM). A periodic frequency-sweep optical signal is
generated and then modulated at a Mach-Zehnder modulator by the electrical
signal under test (SUT). During different sweep periods, the fixed Brillouin
gain functions as a bandpass filter to select a specific range of the spectrum,
which is equivalent to applying a sliding window function to the corresponding

the same time, after the optical signal is selectively amplified by the SBS
gain and converted back to the electrical domain, SBS also implements the
real-time FTTM, which can be utilized to obtain the frequency domain
information corresponding to different time windows through the generated
waveforms via the FTTM. The frequency domain information corresponding to
different time windows is formed and spliced to analyze the time-frequency

certain way on condition attributes, do not follow the same relation on the
decision attribute. For example, in ordinal classification with monotonicity
constraints, it occurs when an instance dominating another instance on
condition attributes has been assigned to a worse decision class. It typically
appears as a result of perturbation in data caused by incomplete knowledge
(missing attributes) or by random effects that occur during data generation
(instability in the assessment of decision attribute values). Inconsistencies
with respect to a crisp preorder relation (expressing either dominance or
indiscernibility between instances) can be handled using symbolic approaches
like rough set theory and by using statistical/machine learning approaches that
involve optimization methods. Fuzzy rough sets can also be seen as a symbolic
approach to inconsistency handling with respect to a fuzzy relation. In this
article, we introduce a new machine learning method for inconsistency handling
with respect to a fuzzy preorder relation. The novel approach is motivated by
the existing machine learning approach used for crisp relations. We provide
statistical foundations for it and develop optimization procedures that can be
used to eliminate inconsistencies. The article also proves important properties
and contains didactic examples of those procedures.

the fraction of the input power transferred to each output channel. We apply
the method to the analysis of spin-wave scattering on a basic functional block

optimization algorithms. Understanding and optimizing how off-the-shelf
optimization methods perform in this context is important for the future of the
field. In this work, we study the performance of four commonly used
gradient-free optimization methods: SLSQP, COBYLA, CMA-ES, and SPSA, at finding
ground-state energies of a range of small chemistry and material science
problems. We test a telescoping sampling scheme (where the accuracy of the
cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer is increased as the
optimization converges) on all methods, demonstrating mixed results across our
range of optimizers and problems chosen. We further hyperparameter tune two of
the four optimizers (CMA-ES and SPSA) across a large range of models and
demonstrate that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, CMA-ES is competitive
with and sometimes outperforms SPSA (which is not observed in the absence of
hyperparameter tuning). Finally, we investigate the ability of an optimizer to
beat the `sampling noise floor' given by the sampling noise on each
cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer. Our results demonstrate the
necessity for tailoring and hyperparameter-tuning known optimization techniques
for inherently-noisy variational quantum algorithms and that the variational
landscape that one finds in a VQA is highly problem- and system-dependent. This
provides guidance for future implementations of these algorithms in the

because they have to forward the messages received. We address a problem that
captures the main goal, which is to find spanning trees with few internal nodes
in a given network. The Maximum Leaf Spanning Arborescence problem consists of,
given a directed graph D, finding a spanning arborescence of D, if one exists,
with the maximum number of leaves. This problem is known to be NP-hard in
general and MaxSNP-hard on the class of rooted directed acyclic graphs. In this
paper, we explore a relation between Maximum Leaf Spanning Arborescence in
rooted directed acyclic graphs and maximum weight set packing. The latter
problem is related to independent sets on particular classes of intersection
graphs. Exploiting this relation, we derive a 7/5-approximation for Maximum
Leaf Spanning Arborescence on rooted directed acyclic graphs, improving on the
previous 3/2-approximation. The approach used might lead to improvements on the
best approximation ratios for the weighted k-set packing problem.

find music to match the emotion of their story. We focus on text-based stories
that can be auralized (e.g., books), use multiple sentences as input queries,
and automatically retrieve matching music. We formalize this task as a
cross-modal text-to-music retrieval problem. Both the music and text domains
have existing datasets with emotion labels, but mismatched emotion vocabularies
prevent us from using mood or emotion annotations directly for matching. To
address this challenge, we propose and investigate several emotion embedding
spaces, both manually defined (e.g., valence/arousal) and data-driven (e.g.,
Word2Vec and metric learning) to bridge this gap. Our experiments show that by
leveraging these embedding spaces, we are able to successfully bridge the gap
between modalities to facilitate cross modal retrieval. We show that our method
can leverage the well established valence-arousal space, but that it can also
achieve our goal via data-driven embedding spaces. By leveraging data-driven
embeddings, our approach has the potential of being generalized to other
retrieval tasks that require broader or completely different vocabularies.

method to enhance performance on multiple computer-vision tasks. While existing
methods appropriately model channel-, spatial- and self-attention, they
primarily operate in a feedforward bottom-up manner. Consequently, the
attention mechanism strongly depends on the local information of a single input
feature map and does not incorporate relatively semantically-richer contextual
information available at higher layers that can specify ""what and where to
look"" in lower-level feature maps through top-down information flow.
  Accordingly, in this work, we propose a lightweight top-down attention module

spatial modulation of its inputs and outputs more contextually-relevant feature

performance of CNNs across multiple object-recognition benchmarks and
outperforms prominent attention modules while being more parameter and memory

these near-field blocks are replaced with the scaled diagonal block matrix
which reduces the near-field storage memory and the overall matrix vector
product time. Scaled diagonal block matrix is further used as a preconditioner

linear complexity of preconditioner set up and solve times is achieved by
near-field block ordering, using graph bandwidth reduction algorithms and
compressing the fill-in blocks in preconditioner computation. Preconditioner
set up time is reduced to half by using the symmetric property and near-field

  Spotlight)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many practical applications of reinforcement learning require agents to learn
from sparse and delayed rewards. It challenges the ability of agents to
attribute their actions to future outcomes. In this paper, we consider the
problem formulation of episodic reinforcement learning with trajectory
feedback. It refers to an extreme delay of reward signals, in which the agent
can only obtain one reward signal at the end of each trajectory. A popular
paradigm for this problem setting is learning with a designed auxiliary dense
reward function, namely proxy reward, instead of sparse environmental signals.
Based on this framework, this paper proposes a novel reward redistribution
algorithm, randomized return decomposition (RRD), to learn a proxy reward
function for episodic reinforcement learning. We establish a surrogate problem
by Monte-Carlo sampling that scales up least-squares-based reward
redistribution to long-horizon problems. We analyze our surrogate loss function
by connection with existing methods in the literature, which illustrates the
algorithmic properties of our approach. In experiments, we extensively evaluate
our proposed method on a variety of benchmark tasks with episodic rewards and
demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms.

types of novel creations in the expanded horizons of metaverse cyberspace have
been reflected, such as immersive arts, robotic arts, and other user-centric
approaches fuelling contemporary creative outputs. Finally, we propose several
research agendas: democratising computational arts, digital privacy, and safety
for metaverse artists, ownership recognition for digital artworks,
technological challenges, and so on. The survey also serves as introductory

the effective size of the mass density of particles in the superposition, and
is random: this randomness shows up as a diffusion of the particles' motion,
resulting, if charged, in the emission of radiation. Here, we compute the
radiation emission rate, which is faint but detectable. We then report the
results of a dedicated experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory to

reveals, it is becoming increasingly 'centralised' at different levels, just as
its binary counterpart: 1) the Nakamoto coefficient shows that the percentage
of nodes whose degrees/strengths 'enclose' the 51% of the total number of
links/total weight is rapidly decreasing; 2) the Gini coefficient confirms that
several weighted centrality measures are becoming increasingly unevenly
distributed; 3)the weighted BLN topology is becoming increasingly compatible
with a core-periphery structure, with the largest nodes 'by strength'
constituting the core of such a network, whose size keeps shrinking as the BLN
evolves. Further inspection of the resilience of the weighted BLN shows that
removing such hubs leads to the network fragmentation into many components, an
evidence indicating potential security threats - as the ones represented by the
so called 'split attacks'.

quantum computers. The simple and robust transmon qubit has been the leading
platform, achieving multiple milestones. However, fault-tolerant quantum
computing calls for qubit operations at error rates significantly lower than
those exhibited in the state of the art. Consequently, alternative
superconducting qubits with better error protection have attracted increasing
interest. Among them, fluxonium is a particularly promising candidate,
featuring large anharmonicity and long coherence times. Here, we engineer a
fluxonium-based quantum processor that integrates high qubit-coherence, fast
frequency-tunability, and individual-qubit addressability for reset, readout,
and gates. With simple and fast gate schemes, we achieve an average
single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.97% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to
99.72%. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported in the
literature of superconducting circuits. Thus our work, for the first time
within the realm of superconducting qubits, reveals an approach toward
fault-tolerant quantum computing that is alternative and competitive to the
transmon system.

stochastic differential game. The actions of the providers are not observable
by the ISO which faces moral hazard. By using the dynamic programming approach,
we represent the value function of the ISO as the unique viscosity solution to
the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We prove that this solution
is smooth and characterise the optimal controls for the ISO. Numerical
solutions to the problem are presented and discussed. We consider also a
simpler problem for the ISO, with constant production levels, that can be

SuperKEKB collider (KEK, Japan) operating at the Y(4S) resonance. Belle II will
search for new physics beyond the Standard Model by collecting an integrated
luminosity of 50~ab$^{-1}$. The silicon vertex detector (SVD), consisting of
four layers of double-sided silicon strip sensors, is one of the two vertex
sub-detectors. The SVD extrapolates the tracks to the inner pixel detector
(PXD) with enough precision to correctly identify hits in the PXD belonging to
the track. In addition the SVD has standalone tracking capability and utilizes
ionization to enhance particle identification in the low momentum region. The
SVD is operating reliably and with high efficiency, despite exposure to the
harsh beam background of the highest peak-luminosity collider ever built. High
signal-to-noise ratio and hit efficiency have been measured, as well as the
spatial resolution; all these quantities show excellent stability over time.
Data-simulation agreement on cluster properties has recently been improved
through a careful tuning of the simulation. The precise hit-time resolution can
be exploited to reject out-of-time hits induced by beam background, which will
make the SVD more robust against higher levels of background. During the first
three years of running, radiation damage effects on strip noise, sensor
currents and depletion voltage have been observed, as well as some coupling
capacitor failure due to intense radiation bursts. None of these effects cause
significant degradation in the detector performance.

high-quality solution using alternating optimization and semi-definite

design achieves improved sensing performance while ensuring the communication
requirement as compared to benchmarks without such joint optimization. It is
also shown that the use of dedicated sensing beams is beneficial in enhancing
the performance for IRS-assisted ISAC.

(IMBH) forms an overdensity region called DM minispike. We consider the binary
system which consists of an IMBH with DM minispike and a small black hole
inspiralling around the IMBH in eccentric orbits. The factors which affect the
evolution of the orbit include the gravity of the system, the dynamical
friction and accretion of the small black hole caused by the DM minispike, and
the radiation reaction of gravitational waves (GWs). Using the method of
osculating orbit, we find that when the semilatus rectum p<<10^5 Rs (Rs is the
Schwarzschild radius of the IMBH) the dominated factors are the dynamical
friction and accretion from the DM minispike, and the radiation reaction. When
p>>10^5 Rs, the gravity from the DM minispike dominates the orbital evolution.
The existence of DM minispike leads to the deviation from the Keplerian orbit,

waveform. By calculating the signal-to-noise ratio for GWs with and without DM
minispikes and the mismatch between them, we show that the effect of the DM

observations (2019 November - December) of the massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary

this massive binary are broadened (FWHM = 1400 km/s) and marginally blushifted
(~ -100 km/s). A direct modelling of these high-resolution spectra in the
framework of the standard colliding stellar wind (CSW) picture provided a very
good correspondence between the shape of the theoretical and observed spectra.
Also, the theoretical line profiles are in most cases an acceptable
representation of the observed ones. We applied the CSW model to the X-ray
spectra of WR 48a from previous observations: Chandra-HETG (2012 October) and
XMM-Newton (2008 January). From this expanded analysis, we find that the
observed X-ray emission from WR48a is variable on the long timescale (years)
and the same is valid for its intrinsic X-ray emission. This requires variable
mass-loss rates over the binary orbital period. The X-ray absorption (in excess
of that from the stellar winds in the binary) is variable as well. We note that
lower intrinsic X-ray emission is accompanied by higher X-ray absorption. A
qualitative explanation could be that the presence of clumpy and
non-spherically symmetric stellar winds may play a role.

adopting these improvements. In this work, we present CoinPrune, our
block-pruning scheme with full Bitcoin compatibility, to revise this popular
belief. CoinPrune bootstraps joining nodes via snapshots that are periodically
created from Bitcoin's set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set). Our
scheme establishes trust in these snapshots by relying on CoinPrune-supporting
miners to mutually reaffirm a snapshot's correctness on the blockchain. This
way, snapshots remain trustworthy even if adversaries attempt to tamper with
them. Our scheme maintains its retrospective deployability by relying on
positive feedback only, i.e., blocks containing invalid reaffirmations are not
rejected, but invalid reaffirmations are outpaced by the benign ones created by
an honest majority among CoinPrune-supporting miners. Already today, CoinPrune
reduces the storage requirements for Bitcoin nodes by two orders of magnitude,
as joining nodes need to fetch and process only 6 GiB instead of 271 GiB of
data in our evaluation, reducing the synchronization time of powerful devices
from currently 7 h to 51 min, with even larger potential drops for less
powerful devices. CoinPrune is further aware of higher-level application data,
i.e., it conserves otherwise pruned application data and allows nodes to
obfuscate objectionable and potentially illegal blockchain content from their
UTXO set and the snapshots they distribute.

we first present a general FL algorithm, namely GenQSGD, parameterized by the
numbers of global and local iterations, mini-batch size, and step size
sequence. Then, we analyze its convergence for an arbitrary step size sequence
and specify the convergence results under three commonly adopted step size
rules, namely the constant, exponential, and diminishing step size rules. Next,
we optimize the algorithm parameters to minimize the energy cost under the time
constraint and convergence error constraint, with the focus on the overall
implementing process of FL. Specifically, for any given step size sequence
under each considered step size rule, we optimize the numbers of global and
local iterations and mini-batch size to optimally implement FL for applications
with preset step size sequences. We also optimize the step size sequence along
with these algorithm parameters to explore the full potential of FL. The
resulting optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems with
non-differentiable constraint functions. We propose iterative algorithms to
obtain KKT points using general inner approximation (GIA) and tricks for
solving complementary geometric programming (CGP). Finally, we numerically
demonstrate the remarkable gains of GenQSGD with optimized algorithm parameters

flow ($v_2$) of $J/\psi$ mesons in these reactions are not well described by
existing calculations of $J/\psi$ recombination for transverse momenta
$p_T\geq$4 GeV. Here, we revisit these calculations in two main aspects. By
employing the resonance recombination model, we implement distribution
functions of charm quarks transported through the quark-gluon plasma using
state-of-the-art Langevin simulations, and we account for the space-momentum
correlations of the diffusing charm and anti-charm quarks in the
hydrodynamically expanding fireball. These improvements extend the relevance of
the recombination processes to substantially larger momenta than before. In
addition, we revisit the suppression of the primordially produced $J/\psi$
mesons by propagating them through the same hydrodynamic medium, leading to a
marked increase of the $v_2$ of this component over previous estimates.
Combining these developments into a calculation of the $p_T$-dependent nuclear
modification factor and $v_2$ of inclusive $J/\psi$ production in semi-central
Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, we find a good description of the experimental

superallowed $\beta$ decays using the shell model with Hartree-Fock (HF) radial

Coulomb, Charge-Symmetry-Breaking (CSB) and Charge-Independence-Breaking (CIB)
terms. The corrections due to the gradient of charge density, vacuum
polarization, Coulomb spin-orbit and finite size of nucleons are also
considered. To avoid the spurious isospin mixing, the local equivalent
potential is constructed from the solution of a HF calculation for the $Z=N$
nucleus without charge-dependent forces. The obtained mean field is solved
non-iteratively for the parent and daughter nuclei. It turns out that the CIB
term has no significant impact on $\delta_{RO}$. On the other hand, the CSB
term makes $\delta_{RO}$ increasing between 10 and 30%. The gradient density
leads to a further increase of $\delta_{RO}$ between 2 and 14%, while other
electromagnetic corrections are negligible. The effect of the suppression of
isospin spuriosity is somewhat complicated. In general, it produces a larger
$\delta_{RO}$ value, however there are few cases for which $\delta_{RO}$ is
mostly unaffected or even reduced, especially the light even-even emitters. All
these improvements partly explain the long-standing discrepancy between the
correction values obtained with Woods-Saxon (WS) and HF radial wave functions.
Nevertheless, the remaining discrepancy is still significant, except for the
emitters with $A\le 26$. In addition, the staggering presented on the results
obtained with the WS potential are not well reproduced by our calculations.
This subsequently leads to a large difference in the predicted mirror $ft$
ratios. These problems might relate to the errors of the calculated radii as
well as correlation in the data used for constraining the asymptotic radial
wave functions.

is so strong that the nanoparticle magnetization lies along the anisotropy
axis, i.e., the magnetization vector is ""frozen"" into the particle body. With
these assumptions and neglecting inertial effects we derive the torque and

the nanoparticle dynamics in the presence of this component becomes
non-periodic, resulting in the drift motion (directed transport) of

process, but most computational models adopt a storage view. In this work, we
propose a computational model for generative episodic memory. It is based on
the central hypothesis that the hippocampus stores and retrieves selected
aspects of an episode as a memory trace, which is necessarily incomplete. At
recall, the neocortex reasonably fills in the missing information based on
general semantic information in a process we call semantic completion.
  As episodes we use images of digits (MNIST) augmented by different
backgrounds representing context. Our model is based on a VQ-VAE which
generates a compressed latent representation in form of an index matrix, which
still has some spatial resolution. We assume that attention selects some part
of the index matrix while others are discarded, this then represents the gist
of the episode and is stored as a memory trace. At recall the missing parts are
filled in by a PixelCNN, modeling semantic completion, and the completed index
matrix is then decoded into a full image by the VQ-VAE.
  The model is able to complete missing parts of a memory trace in a
semantically plausible way up to the point where it can generate plausible
images from scratch. Due to the combinatorics in the index matrix, the model
generalizes well to images not trained on. Compression as well as semantic
completion contribute to a strong reduction in memory requirements and
robustness to noise. Finally we also model an episodic memory experiment and
can reproduce that semantically congruent contexts are always recalled better
than incongruent ones, high attention levels improve memory accuracy in both
cases, and contexts that are not remembered correctly are more often remembered
semantically congruently than completely wrong.

view. Then, using a Transformer-based attention mechanism and the cascaded cost
volumes, the renderer infers geometry and appearance, and renders detailed
images via classical volume rendering techniques. This architecture, in
particular, allows sophisticated occlusion reasoning, gathering information

determine the redshift of the object, shedding light on ambiguous photometric
redshift associations. We investigated the morphology of this cluster which
shows signs of merging activities in the outskirts and a flat core. We also
measured the radial density profile up to $R_{500}$. With these quantities in
hand, we were able to determine the mass, $M_{500}=5.64^{+0.79}_{-0.62} \times
10^{14}M_{\odot}$, using the YX proxy. This quantity improves previous
measurement of the mass of this object by a factor of $\sim 3.5$. The
characterisation of one cluster at such mass and redshift regime is fundamental

far being less than $\sim 25$. Our study highlights the importance of using

temperatures of Teff > 70,000 K and a surface gravity of 5.0 < log g < 7.0 are
rather rare objects despite recent and ongoing surveys. It is believed that
they are the outcome of either single star evolution (late helium-shell flash
or late helium-core flash) or binary star evolution (double WD merger). Their
study is interesting because the surface elemental abundances reflect the
physics of thermonuclear flashes and merger events. Spectroscopically they are
divided in three different classes, namely PG1159, O(He), or He-sdO. We present
a spectroscopic analysis of five such stars that turned out to have atmospheric
parameters in the range Teff = 70,000-80,000 K and log g = 5.2-6.3. The three
investigated He-sdOs have a relatively high hydrogen mass fraction (10%) that
is unexplained by both single (He core flash) and binary evolution (He-WD
merger) scenarios. The O(He) star JL9 is probably a binary helium-WD merger,
but its hydrogen content (6%) is also at odds with merger models. We found that
RL 104 is the 'coolest' (Teff = 80,000 K) member of the PG1159 class in a
pre-WD stage. Its optical spectrum is remarkable because it exhibits C IV lines
involving Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers up to n = 22. Its
rather low mass (0.48 +0.03/-0.02 Msun) is difficult to reconcile with the
common evolutionary scenario for PG1159 stars due to it being the outcome of a
(very) late He-shell flash. The same mass-problem faces a merger model of a
close He-sdO plus CO WD binary that predicts PG1159-like abundances. Perhaps RL
104 originates from a very late He-shell flash in a CO/He WD formed by a merger
of two low-mass He-WDs.

related to the so-called generalization capabilities of the networks, i.e.
their consistency with the underlying real plants, even in presence of unseen

possibility of providing a clear formal connection between the RNN model and
the plant. In this context, we illustrate how ISS and $\delta$ISS represent a
significant step towards the robustness and verifiability of the RNN models,

deforming the embedding of a general, isoradial graph, w.r.t. a real

induced by the deformation and the Delaunay constraints. Using Kenyon's exact
and asymptotic results for the Green's function on an isoradial graph, we
calculate the leading asymptotics of the first and second order terms in the
perturbative expansion of the log-determinant of the Beltrami-Laplace operator
$\Delta(\epsilon)$, the David-Eynard K\""ahler operator $\mathcal{D}(\epsilon)$,
and the conformal Laplacian $\underline{\Delta}(\epsilon)$ on the deformed
graph. We show that the scaling limits of the second order {\it bi-local} term
for both the Beltrami-Laplace and David-Eynard operators exist and coincide,
with a value independent of the choice of initial isoradial graph. Our results
allow to define a discrete analogue of the stress energy tensor for each of the
three operators. Furthermore we can identify a central charge ($c$) in the case
of both the Beltrami-Laplace and David-Eynard operators. While the scaling
limit is consistent with the stress-energy tensor and value of the central
charge for the Gaussian free field (GFF), the discrete central charge value of
$c=-2$ for the David-Eynard operator is, however, at odds with the value of
$c=-26$ expected by Polyakov's theory of 2D quantum gravity; moreover there are
problems with convergence of the scaling limit of the discrete stress energy
tensor for the David-Eynard operator. The bi-local term for the conformal
Laplacian involves anomalous terms corresponding to the creation of discrete
{\it curvature dipoles} in the deformed Delaunay graph; we examine the
difficulties in defining a convergent scaling limit in this case. Connections
with some discrete statistical models at criticality are explored.

evidence for the monopsony argument is scarce. In this paper, I perform a
comprehensive test of monopsony theory by using labor market concentration as a
proxy for monopsony power. Labor market concentration turns out substantial in
Germany. Absent wage floors, a 10 percent increase in labor market
concentration makes firms reduce wages by 0.5 percent and employment by 1.6
percent, reflecting monopsonistic exploitation. In line with perfect
competition, sectoral minimum wages lead to negative employment effects in
slightly concentrated labor markets. This effect weakens with increasing
concentration and, ultimately, becomes positive in highly concentrated or
monopsonistic markets. Overall, the results lend empirical support to the
monopsony argument, implying that conventional minimum wage effects on
employment conceal heterogeneity across market forms.

email detection methods exist, each of which employs a different algorithm to
detect undesired spam emails. But these models are vulnerable to attacks. Many
attackers exploit the model by polluting the data, which are trained to the
model in various ways. So to act deftly in such situations model needs to
readily unlearn the polluted data without the need for retraining. Retraining
is impractical in most cases as there is already a massive amount of data
trained to the model in the past, which needs to be trained again just for
removing a small amount of polluted data, which is often significantly less
than 1%. This problem can be solved by developing unlearning frameworks for all
spam detection models. In this research, unlearning module is integrated into
spam detection models that are based on Naive Bayes, Decision trees, and Random
Forests algorithms. To assess the benefits of unlearning over retraining, three
spam detection models are polluted and exploited by taking attackers' positions
and proving models' vulnerability. Reduction in accuracy and true positive
rates are shown in each case showing the effect of pollution on models. Then
unlearning modules are integrated into the models, and polluted data is
unlearned; on testing the models after unlearning, restoration of performance
is seen. Also, unlearning and retraining times are compared with different
pollution data sizes on all models. On analyzing the findings, it can be
concluded that unlearning is considerably superior to retraining. Results show
that unlearning is fast, easy to implement, easy to use, and effective.

rationale is that the signal fluctuations caused by humans carry the
information of human behavior which can be extracted from the channel state
information of WiFi. Still, the prior studies mainly focus on single-task
sensing (STS), e.g., gesture recognition, indoor localization, user
identification. Since the fluctuations caused by gestures are highly coupling
with body features and the user's location, we propose a WiFi-based multi-task
sensing model (Wimuse) to perform gesture recognition, indoor localization, and
user identification tasks simultaneously. However, these tasks have different
difficulty levels (i.e., imbalance issue) and need task-specific information
(i.e., discrepancy issue). To address these issues, the knowledge distillation
technique and task-specific residual adaptor are adopted in Wimuse. We first
train the STS model for each task. Then, for solving the imbalance issue, the
extracted common feature in Wimuse is encouraged to get close to the
counterpart features of the STS models. Further, for each task, a task-specific
residual adaptor is applied to extract the task-specific compensation feature
which is fused with the common feature to address the discrepancy issue. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets and evaluation
suggests that Wimuse achieves state-of-the-art performance with the average
accuracy of 85.20%, 98.39%, and 98.725% on the joint task of gesture

non-trivial exercise for large search spaces, even when automated. This poses
an optimization task on a non-convex search space, using an expensive to
evaluate function with unknown derivative. These characteristics make a good
candidate for Bayesian Optimization, which has not been applied to this problem
before. However, the application of Bayesian Optimization to this problem is
challenging. We demonstrate how to deal with the rough, discrete, constrained
search spaces, containing invalid configurations. We introduce a novel
contextual variance exploration factor, as well as new acquisition functions
with improved scalability, combined with an informed acquisition function
selection mechanism. By comparing the performance of our Bayesian Optimization
implementation on various test cases to the existing search strategies in
Kernel Tuner, as well as other Bayesian Optimization implementations, we
demonstrate that our search strategies generalize well and consistently
outperform other search strategies by a wide margin.

  Behaviors",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, phishing scams have posed a significant threat to blockchains.
Phishing detectors direct their efforts in hunting phishing addresses. Most of
the detectors extract target addresses' transaction behavior features by random
walking or constructing static subgraphs. The random walking
methods,unfortunately, usually miss structural information due to limited
sampling sequence length, while the static subgraph methods tend to ignore
temporal features lying in the evolving transaction behaviors. More
importantly, their performance undergoes severe degradation when the malicious
users intentionally hide phishing behaviors. To address these challenges, we
propose TEGDetector, a dynamic graph classifier that learns the evolving
behavior features from transaction evolution graphs (TEGs). First, we cast the
transaction series into multiple time slices, capturing the target address's
transaction behaviors in different periods. Then, we provide a fast
non-parametric phishing detector to narrow down the search space of suspicious
addresses. Finally, TEGDetector considers both the spatial and temporal
evolutions towards a complete characterization of the evolving transaction
behaviors. Moreover, TEGDetector utilizes adaptively learnt time coefficient to
pay distinct attention to different periods, which provides several novel
insights. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Ethereum transaction dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance.

mixing using Fourier Transforms (FNET) to replace the computationally expensive
self-attention mechanism in a full transformer implementation on a long
document summarization task (> 512 tokens). As a baseline, we also carried out
long document summarization using established methods such as Longformer and
Big Bird transformer models that are capable of processing over 8000 tokens and
are currently the state of the art methods for these type of problems. The
original FNET paper implemented this in an encoder only architecture while
abstractive summarization requires both an encoder and a decoder. Since such a
pretrained transformer model does not currently exist in the public domain, we
decided to implement a full transformer based on this Fourier token mixing
approach in an encoder/decoder architecture which we trained starting with
Glove embeddings for the individual words in the corpus. We investigated a
number of different extensions to the original FNET architecture and evaluated
them on their Rouge F1-score performance on a summarization task. All
modifications showed better performance on the summarization task than when
using the original FNET encoder in a transformer architecture.

saturnian satellites Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea have been
derived from Cassini-Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data. The
maps are systematically built from photometric corrected data by applying the
Kaasalainen-Shkuratov model (Kaasalainen et al., 2001, Shkuratov et al., 2011}.
In this work a quadratic function is used to fit phase curves built by
filtering observations taken with incidence angle $i\le70^\circ$, emission
angle $e\le70^\circ$, phase angle $10^\circ \le g \le 120^\circ$, and
Cassini-satellite distance $D \le 100.000$ km. This procedure is systematically
repeated for a subset of 65 VIMS visible and near-infrared wavelengths for each
satellite. The average photometric parameters are used to compare satellites'
properties and to study their variability with illumination conditions changes.
We derive equigonal albedo, extrapolated at g=0$^\circ$, not including the
opposition effect, equal to 0.63$\pm$0.02 for Mimas, 0.89$\pm$0.03 for
Enceladus, 0.74$\pm$0.03 for Tethys, 0.65$\pm$0.03 for Dione, 0.60$\pm$0.05 for
Rhea at 0.55 $\mu$m. The knowledge of photometric spectral response allows to
correct individual VIMS spectra used to build maps through geolocation. Maps
are rendered at a fixed resolution corresponding to a $0.5^\circ \times
0.5^\circ$ bin on a longitude by latitude grid resulting in spatial resolutions
of 1.7 km/bin for Mimas, 2.2 km/bin for Enceladus; 4.7 km/bin for Tethys; 4.5
km/bin for Dione; 6.7 km/bin for Rhea. These spectral maps allow establishing

which the network operates. Many obstacles prevent wireless sensor networks
from being used in a wide range of fields. This includes maintaining network
stability and extending network life. In a wireless network, sensors are the
most essential component. Sensors are powered by a battery that has a finite
amount of power. The battery is prone to power loss, and the sensor is
therefore rendered inoperative as a result. In addition, the growing number of
sensor nodes off-site affects the network's stability. The transmission and
reception of information between the sensors and the base consumes the most
energy in the sensor. An Intelligent Vice Cluster Head Selection Protocol is
proposed in this study (IVC LEACH). In order to achieve the best performance
with the least amount of energy consumption, the proposed hierarchical protocol
relies on a fuzzy logic algorithm using four parameters to calculate the value

topological route to complete polarization conversion (CPC), a unique photonic
phenomenon without an electronic counterpart. Here, we report on the
experimental observation of the topological effect in reflection matrices of a
photonic crystal slab, enabling CPC between two linear polarizations over a
wide range of frequencies. Using angle-resolved reflection measurements, we
observe CPC occurring at vortex singularities of reflection coefficients in
momentum space, verifying the topological nature of CPC. In addition, the
topological effect also guarantees the spin-preserved reflection of a
circularly polarized wave. Remarkably, we experimentally establish a connection
between two seemingly unrelated topological phenomena--CPC and bound states in
the continuum (BICs): BICs lie on the critical coupling curves that define the
condition for CPC. Our work paves the way to exploring the topological
properties in scattering matrices for controlling light polarization and spin

were validated by Schlieren images and acoustic spectra. It was concluded that
the reactant dilution ratio remained below 0.25 through the combustion chamber,

developments in quantum physics which show a synchronic connection between the
parts. In contrast to the principle of local realism, which is the basis of
classical reductionism, I have called the principle of non-locality at the
basis of a new method of scientific investigation ""synchronic principle"". The
synchronic principle introduces a new element in the approach to reality, which
with anthropomorphic terms we could call ""conscious choice"". In a synchronic
paradigm, evolution does not occur in a deterministic way, but is characterized
by a certain intrinsic freedom of choice that we associate with awareness.
Considerations based on the evolution of the universe towards the emergence of
life lead us to think that this ""awareness"" also exists in the vacuum state: in
the model I proposed a definition of the agents of consciousness in terms of
arrays of correlated qu-bit, from the simplest consisting of 6 qu-bits of the
quantum vacuum (which result as a superposition of 64 base states), up to the
most complex organisms consisting of a very large number of correlated quantum
bits. Some of the fundamental vacuum states of consciousness can be related to
known elementary particles (leptons and quarks) and to fundamental
interactions. The rest constitute purely non-local elements of consciousness
with no counterpart in terms of wave or particle within the local observation
limit. In this model, consciousness processes quantum information through logic
gates and collapses as a result of observations, like a quantum computer does.
Synchronicity does not in deny the conclusions reached by traditional science
can be used at the local level, but opens scientific knowledge to new
possibilities, and invites us to look at the world through a different, not
local awareness.

rendered scenes. Traditional methods rely on physics-based simulations to
accurately reproduce the dynamic behavior of soft tissues. Due to the model
complexity and thus the heavy computation, however, they do not directly offer
practical solutions to domains where real-time performance is desirable. The
quality shapes obtained by physics-based simulations are not fully exploited by
example-based or more recent datadriven methods neither, with most of them
having focused on the modeling of static skin shapes by leveraging quality
data. To address these limitations, we present a learningbased method for
dynamic skin deformation. At the core of our work is a recurrent neural network
that learns to predict the nonlinear, dynamics-dependent shape change over time
from pre-existing mesh deformation sequence data. Our network also learns to
predict the variation of skin dynamics across different individuals with
varying body shapes. After training the network delivers realistic,
high-quality skin dynamics that is specific to a person in a real-time course.
We obtain results that significantly saves the computational time, while
maintaining comparable prediction quality compared to state-of-the-art results.
