which can potentially be observed at high-energy colliders like the LHC; the
most recent exclusion limits from the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations corner
excited-fermion masses and the compositeness scale to the multi-TeV range. At
the same time, hypothetical composite Majorana neutrinos would lead to
observable effects in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$)
experiments. In this work, we show that the current composite-neutrino
exclusion limit $M_N>4.6$ TeV, as extracted from direct searches at the LHC,
can indeed be further improved to $M_N>8.8$ TeV by including the bound on the
nuclear transition $^{136}$Xe $\to$ $^{136}$Ba $+2e^-$. Looking ahead, the
forthcoming HL-LHC will allow probing a larger portion of the parameter-space,
nevertheless, it will still benefit from the complementary limit provided by $0
\nu \beta \beta$ future detectors to explore composite-neutrino masses up to
$12.6$ TeV.

process of molecular clouds. Due to the line-of-sight confusion in the Galactic
plane that is associated with its ubiquity, atomic hydrogen emission has been
challenging to study. Employing the high-angular resolution data from the THOR
survey, we identify one of the largest, coherent, mostly atomic HI filaments in
the Milky Way at the line-of-sight velocities around -54 km/s. The giant atomic
filament ""Maggie"", with a total length of 1.2 kpc, is not detected in most
other tracers, and does not show signs of active star formation. At a kinematic
distance of 17 kpc, Maggie is situated below (by 500 pc) but parallel to the
Galactic HI disk and is trailing the predicted location of the Outer Arm by
5-10 km/s in longitude-velocity space. The centroid velocity exhibits a smooth
gradient of less than $\pm$3 km/s /10 pc and a coherent structure to within
$\pm$6 km/s. The line widths of 10 km/s along the spine of the filament are
dominated by non-thermal effects. After correcting for optical depth effects,
the mass of Maggie's dense spine is estimated to be $7.2\times10^5\,M_{\odot}$.
The mean number density of the filament is 4$\rm\,cm^{-3}$, which is best
explained by the filament being a mix of cold and warm neutral gas. In contrast
to molecular filaments, the turbulent Mach number and velocity structure
function suggest that Maggie is driven by transonic to moderately supersonic
velocities that are likely associated with the Galactic potential rather than
being subject to the effects of self-gravity or stellar feedback. The column
density PDF displays a log-normal shape around a mean of $N_{\rm HI} =
4.8\times 10^{20}\rm\,cm^{-2}$, thus reflecting the absence of dominating
effects of gravitational contraction.

  Science (FOCS)",,,,"cs.IT cs.CC math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes for which
individual message symbols can be quickly recovered despite errors in the
codeword. LDCs for Hamming errors have been studied extensively in the past few
decades, where a major goal is to understand the amount of redundancy that is
necessary and sufficient to decode from large amounts of error, with small
query complexity.
  In this work, we study LDCs for insertion and deletion errors, called Insdel
LDCs. Their study was initiated by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky
(Information Theoretic Security, 2015), who gave a reduction from Hamming LDCs
to Insdel LDCs with a small blowup in the code parameters. On the other hand,
the only known lower bounds for Insdel LDCs come from those for Hamming LDCs,
thus there is no separation between them. Here we prove new, strong lower
bounds for the existence of Insdel LDCs. In particular, we show that $2$-query
linear Insdel LDCs do not exist, and give an exponential lower bound for the
length of all $q$-query Insdel LDCs with constant $q$. For $q \ge 3$ our bounds
are exponential in the existing lower bounds for Hamming LDCs. Furthermore, our
exponential lower bounds continue to hold for adaptive decoders, and even in
private-key settings where the encoder and decoder share secret randomness.
This exhibits a strict separation between Hamming LDCs and Insdel LDCs.
  Our strong lower bounds also hold for the related notion of Insdel LCCs
(except in the private-key setting), due to an analogue to the Insdel notions
of a reduction from Hamming LCCs to LDCs.
  Our techniques are based on a delicate design and analysis of hard
distributions of insertion and deletion errors, which depart significantly from
typical techniques used in analyzing Hamming LDCs.

barrier for vortex nucleation and escape. In multicomponent superconductors,
fractional vortices with a winding in the phase of only one of the components
can be stable topological solitons that carry a fraction of the flux quantum.
While the formation of such objects in the bulk costs logarithmically or
linearly divergent energy, these objects were shown to be stable near samples'
boundaries in the two-component London model. Therefore, the conventional
Bean-Livingston picture of magnetic flux entry does not apply to these
superconductors, since the entry process can involve fractionalization of a
vortex. In this paper, we address the nonlinear problem of determining the
potential barrier for fluxoid penetration in a multicomponent superconductor,
including the effects of various intercomponent couplings, by using the
recently developed gauged string method. The method allows numerically exact
(i.e., convergent) calculation of a sphaleron configuration in a gauge theory
and thus the height of the nucleation barrier. We show how the fractionalized
nucleation processes result in multiple sphalerons and intermediate states due
to the complex shape of the energy landscape of multicomponent superconductors.

representation to be scalable to large scenes. However, the regular subdivision
of 3D space employed by these approaches fails to take into account the
sparsity of the surface occupancy and the varying granularities of geometric
details. As a result, its memory footprint grows cubically with the input
volume, leading to a prohibitive computational cost even at a moderately dense
decomposition. In this work, we present a learnable hierarchical implicit
representation for 3D surfaces, coded OctField, that allows high-precision
encoding of intricate surfaces with low memory and computational budget. The
key to our approach is an adaptive decomposition of 3D scenes that only
distributes local implicit functions around the surface of interest. We achieve
this goal by introducing a hierarchical octree structure to adaptively
subdivide the 3D space according to the surface occupancy and the richness of
part geometry. As octree is discrete and non-differentiable, we further propose
a novel hierarchical network that models the subdivision of octree cells as a
probabilistic process and recursively encodes and decodes both octree structure
and surface geometry in a differentiable manner. We demonstrate the value of
OctField for a range of shape modeling and reconstruction tasks, showing
superiority over alternative approaches.

an optical setup that models a target with these characteristics and explore
its detectability in the quantum domain in terms of the Chernoff bound (CB).
For an idler-free setup, we use the coherent state for QI while the two mode
squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state is employed in the signal-idler scheme. In both
the cases, we report an absorption-induced enhancement of the detection
efficiency indicated by a lowering of CB with increasing amounts of absorption.
Interestingly, we show that in the presence of absorption, a more intense
thermal background can lead to target detection with enhanced efficiency.
Moreover, we observe that the quantum advantage persists even for finite
amounts of absorption. However, we find that the quantum advantage offered by
TMSV decreases monotonically with absorption, and becomes vanishingly small in
the high absorption regime. We also demonstrate the optimality of both the
coherent and the TMSV states in their respective setups (idler-free and
signal-idler) in the limit of low reflectivity and absorption.

Additionally, we present a framework OPack that adapts and improves the
performance of BP heuristics by utilizing information in an online setting with

within bounds of robot operations and thus, can be used in real-time.

enables the applicability to unstructured meshes and considerably simplifies
the numerical procedure for applications in three spatial dimensions. We

a true particle-level spectrum from smeared detector-level data. For
computational and practical reasons, these spaces are typically discretized
using histograms, and the smearing is modeled through a response matrix
corresponding to a discretized smearing kernel of the particle detector. This
response matrix depends on the unknown shape of the true spectrum, leading to a
fundamental systematic uncertainty in the unfolding problem. To handle the
ill-posed nature of the problem, common approaches regularize the problem
either directly via methods such as Tikhonov regularization, or implicitly by
using wide-bins in the true space that match the resolution of the detector.
Unfortunately, both of these methods lead to a non-trivial bias in the unfolded
estimator, thereby hampering frequentist coverage guarantees for confidence
intervals constructed from these methods. We propose two new approaches to
addressing the bias in the wide-bin setting through methods called
One-at-a-time Strict Bounds (OSB) and Prior-Optimized (PO) intervals. The OSB
intervals are a bin-wise modification of an existing guaranteed-coverage
procedure, while the PO intervals are based on a decision-theoretic view of the
problem. Importantly, both approaches provide well-calibrated frequentist
confidence intervals even in constrained and rank-deficient settings. These
methods are built upon a more general answer to the wide-bin bias problem,
involving unfolding with fine bins first, followed by constructing confidence
intervals for linear functionals of the fine-bin counts. We test and compare
these methods to other available methodologies in a wide-bin deconvolution
example and a realistic particle physics simulation of unfolding a steeply
falling particle spectrum.

non-zero sum of neutrino masses, even down to the minimum value of 58 meV
inferred from neutrino flavor oscillation. The implications of such a
measurement for the physics of neutrinos have been well documented; in
contrast, the cosmological implications of such a measurement have received
less attention. In this paper, we explore the impact of a neutrino mass
detection consistent with $\sum m_\nu = 58$ meV for our understanding of the
history and contents of the universe. We focus primarily on three key areas:
the thermal history of the universe, clustering of matter on diverse scales,
and the application to dark matter and dark sectors. First we show that a
detection of non-zero neutrino mass would provide a unique connection between
the cosmic neutrino background, which is detected gravitationally, and
neutrinos measured on Earth. We then discuss how the consistency of a detection
between multiple probes will impact our knowledge of structure formation.
Finally, we show how these measurements can be interpreted as sub-percent level
tests of dark sector physics.

differential and algebraic equations (DAEs). To safely operate the system,
operators need to check that the states described by these DAEs stay within
prescribed limits after various potential faults. However, current numerical
solvers of DAEs are often too slow for real-time system operations. In
addition, detailed system parameters are often not exactly known. Machine
learning approaches have been proposed to reduce computational efforts, but
existing methods generally suffer from overfitting and failures to predict
unstable behaviors.
  This paper proposes a novel framework to predict power system transients by
learning in the frequency domain. The intuition is that although the system
behavior is complex in the time domain, there are relatively few dominant modes
in the frequency domain. Therefore, we learn to predict by constructing neural
networks with Fourier transform and filtering layers. System topology and fault
information are encoded by taking a multi-dimensional Fourier transform,
allowing us to leverage the fact that the trajectories are sparse both in time
and spatial frequencies. We show that the proposed approach does not need
detailed system parameters, greatly speeds up prediction computations and is
highly accurate for different fault types.

identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the
non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share
information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator
functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific
Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting
statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional
and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized
Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian
networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks
according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with
the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode
the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is
back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information
between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian
network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We
demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through
analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks
which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.

which conditions a fractional Chern insulator state corresponding to the
Laughlin-like state at filling $\nu=1/2$ can be stabilized and its fractional

6-8 sites. This is a promising result, since such small systems are favorable
with respect to the required adiabatic state preparation. Moreover, we also see
very clear signatures of excitations with fractional charge in response both to
static pinning potentials and dynamical flux insertion. Since the compressible
edges, which are found to feature chiral currents, can serve as a reservoir,
these observations are robust against changes in the total particle number. Our
results suggest that signatures of both a fractional Chern insulator state and
its fractional excitations can be found under realistic experimental

beam models, masking, and other techniques during the production of sky maps
and their corresponding angular power spectra. However, these processes can
generate couplings between multipoles from the same spectrum and from different
spectra, in addition to the typical power attenuation. Within the context of
pseudo-$C_\ell$ based, MASTER-style analyses, the net effect of the time-domain
filtering is commonly approximated by a multiplicative transfer function,
$F_{\ell}$, that can fail to capture mode mixing and is dependent on the
spectrum of the signal. To address these shortcomings, we have developed a
simulation-based spectral correction approach that constructs a two-dimensional
transfer matrix, $J_{\ell\ell'}$, which contains information about mode mixing
in addition to mode attenuation. We demonstrate the application of this
approach on data from the first flight of the SPIDER balloon-borne CMB
experiment.

Using a copper cavity, unaffected by strong magnetic fields, we can solely
probe the magnetic-field effect on the transmons. We present data on a
single-junction and a SQUID transmon, that were cooled down in the same cavity.
As expected, transmon frequencies decrease with increasing fields, due to a
suppression of the superconducting gap and a geometric Fraunhofer-like
contribution. Nevertheless, the thin-film transmons show strong magnetic-field
resilience: both transmons display microsecond coherence up to at least 0.65 T,
and $T_1$ remains above 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$s over the entire measurable range.
SQUID spectroscopy is feasible up to 1 T, the limit of our magnet. We conclude
that thin-film aluminum Josephson junctions are a suitable hardware for

it is widely known that training ACGAN is challenging as the number of classes

samples with a lack of diversity. In this paper, we introduce two cures for
ACGAN. First, we identify that gradient exploding in the classifier can cause
an undesirable collapse in early training, and projecting input vectors onto a

SI framework. It is a SI generalization of the scotogenic model, where the
standard model (SM) is extended by a real singlet, an inert scalar doublet and
three Majorana singlet fermions, where the lightest one ($N_{1}$) could play
the DM candidate role. In addition to the annihilation channels
$N_{1}N_{1}\rightarrow\ell_{\alpha}\ell_{\beta},\nu_{\alpha}\bar{\nu}_{\beta}$,
the DM can be annihilated via few s-channel processes into SM particles, that
are mediated by the Higgs/dilaton. This allows the new Yukawa interactions,
that are responsible for neutrino mass generation, to take small values and
therefore avoid the mass degeneracy between the CP-even and CP-odd inert
scalars unlike the case of the minimal scotogenic model. In contrast to many
Majorana DM models, the DM in the SI-scotogenic model couples to the quarks at
tree-level, and hence the constraint from the direct detection experiments is
very important on the space parameter. The aim of this work is to investigate
the correlation between the DM requirements and the scalar sector in this
model.

develop a self-consistent covariant analytic model of the accretion flow that

is not displaced by it by more than half the ring width. This result is a
consequence of conservation laws and basic thermodynamic considerations and
does not depend on the microphysics of the plasma or the details of the

achieve the state-of-the-art performance of downstream tasks by finetuning a
linear classifier on top of it. However, as adversarial robustness becomes
vital in image classification, it remains unclear whether or not CL is able to
preserve robustness to downstream tasks. The main challenge is that in the
self-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning paradigm, adversarial
robustness is easily forgotten due to a learning task mismatch from pretraining
to finetuning. We call such a challenge 'cross-task robustness
transferability'. To address the above problem, in this paper we revisit and
advance CL principles through the lens of robustness enhancement. We show that
(1) the design of contrastive views matters: High-frequency components of
images are beneficial to improving model robustness; (2) Augmenting CL with
pseudo-supervision stimulus (e.g., resorting to feature clustering) helps
preserve robustness without forgetting. Equipped with our new designs, we
propose AdvCL, a novel adversarial contrastive pretraining framework. We show
that AdvCL is able to enhance cross-task robustness transferability without
loss of model accuracy and finetuning efficiency. With a thorough experimental
study, we demonstrate that AdvCL outperforms the state-of-the-art
self-supervised robust learning methods across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10,

the nondegenerate companions in common proper motions to chemically tag of the

existence of a very large population of low mass haloes, down to planet-size
masses. However, their fate as they are accreted onto haloes many orders of
magnitude more massive remains fundamentally uncertain. A number of numerical
explorations have found subhaloes to be very resilient to tides, but resolution
limits make it difficult to explore tidal evolution at arbitrarily low masses.
What are the structural properties of heavily stripped subhaloes? Do tidal
effects destroy low-mass CDM subhaloes? Here we focus on cosmologically
motivated subhaloes orbiting CDM hosts, and show that subhaloes of any initial
mass can be stripped to arbitrarily small mass fractions. We show that previous
numerical results can be reproduced by a simple model that describes tidal
evolution as a progressive `peeling' in energy space and subsequent
re-virialization. Tidal heating can effectively be neglected at all masses,
because its importance i) does not increase for subhaloes of decreasing mass at
accretion, and ii) it decreases as stripping proceeds. This allows us to
predict analytically the structural properties of subhaloes with any initial
mass and arbitrary degrees of mass loss. Under the hypotheses that CDM haloes
have centrally divergent density profiles and approximately isotropic phase
space distributions, our results prove that subhaloes of very low masses are a
robust prediction of the CDM model: as for haloes, CDM subhalo populations
extend and are abundant down to very low masses.

if the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field. It has
often been motivated in the literature as an era following inflation, taking
place before the radiation era. In this paper, we review instead the
possibility that kination is disconnected from primordial inflation and occurs
much later, inside the Standard Model radiation era. We study the implications
on all main sources of primordial gravitational waves. We show how this leads
to very distinctive peaked spectra in the stochastic background of long-lasting
cosmological sources of gravitational waves, namely the irreducible
gravitational waves from inflation, and gravitational waves from cosmic
strings, both local and global, with promising observational prospects. We
present model-independent signatures and detectability predictions at SKA,

symptomatic in a large class of axion models. We analyse in details the scalar
field dynamics, the working conditions and constraints in the underlying
models. We present the gravitational-wave predictions as a function of particle
physics parameters. We derive the general relation between the

10^{-3} \, {\rm M}_\odot$ of $0.1 \, {\rm \mu m}$ grains in the diffuse X-ray

in the clumps and $92-98 \%$ overall, giving Cas A a final dust yield of
$0.05-0.30 \, {\rm M}_\odot$. If the unshocked ejecta grains are larger than
$0.1 \, {\rm \mu m}$, the dust masses are higher, the destruction efficiencies
are lower, and the final yield may exceed $0.5 \, {\rm M}_\odot$. As Cas A has
a dense circumstellar environment and thus a much stronger reverse shock than

to be lower, and the average dust yield higher. This supports a mostly-stellar
origin for the cosmic dust budget.

free-free and synchrotron emission, as in the prototypical starburst galaxy
M82. We interpret this as a deficit in high-frequency synchrotron emission,
while the level of free-free emission is as expected from M82. We additionally
provide the first constraints on the cosmic star formation history using
free-free emission at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, which are in good agreement

notoriously difficult. Traditionally such information is best extracted from
expensive spectroscopic observations. Here we present the $Painting\,

information content of photometric multi-band images of galaxies. We train a
convolutional neural network on 27,558 galaxy image pairs to establish a

gaseous galaxy property maps. We test our machine learning (ML) algorithm with
SDSS $ugriz$ mock images for which uncertainties and systematics are exactly
known. We show that multi-band galaxy images contain enough information to
reconstruct 2d maps of stellar mass, metallicity, age and gas mass, metallicity
as well as star formation rate. We recover the true stellar properties on a
pixel by pixel basis with only little scatter, $\lesssim20\%$ compared to
$\sim50\%$ statistical uncertainty from traditional mass-to-light-ratio based
methods. We further test for any systematics of our algorithm with image
resolution, training sample size or wavelength coverage. We find that galaxy
morphology alone constrains stellar properties to better than $\sim20\%$ thus
highlighting the benefits of including morphology into the parameter
estimation. The machine learning approach can predict maps of high resolution,
only limited by the resolution of the input bands, thus achieving higher
resolution than IFU observations. The network architecture and all code is

quasiholes proliferate in the steady state which damages the quality of the
state preparation. The motion of quasiholes leading to their separation is
allowed by a repeated process in which a photon is first lost and then quickly
refilled in the vicinity of the quasihole. We develop the theory of this
dissipative quasihole dynamics and show that it has diffusive character. Our
results demonstrate that fractionalization might present an obstacle for both
creation and stabilization of strongly-correlated states with photons.

dark matter and the process of dwarf galaxy formation. In the LCDM scenario,
low mass halos are so numerous that the efficiency of dwarf formation must
decline sharply with decreasing halo mass in order to accommodate the relative
scarcity of observed dwarfs and satellites in the Local Group. The nature of
this decline contains important clues to the mechanisms regulating the onset of
galaxy formation in the faintest systems. We explore here two possible models
for the stellar mass ($M_*$)-halo mass ($M_{200}$) relation at the faint end,
motivated by some of the latest LCDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
One model includes a sharp mass threshold below which no luminous galaxies
form, as expected if galaxy formation proceeds only in systems above the
Hydrogen-cooling limit. In the second model, $M_*$ scales as a steep power-law
of $M_{200}$ with no explicit cutoff, as suggested by recent semianalytic work.
Although both models predict satellite numbers around Milky Way-like galaxies
consistent with current observations, they predict vastly different numbers of
ultra-faint dwarfs and of satellites around isolated dwarf galaxies. Our
results illustrate how the satellite mass function around dwarfs may be used to
probe the $M_*$-$M_{200}$ relation at the faint end and to elucidate the
mechanisms that determine which low-mass halos ""light up"" or remain dark in the
LCDM scenario.

formation within a kpc of the Sun. Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and proper

relative to the cluster center. We find an age gradient with distance to the
stars in the ONC, from 385 pc for the oldest stars, to 395 pc for the younger
stars, indicating that the star forming front is propagating into the cloud. We
find an organized signature of rotation of the central cluster, but it is
present only in stars younger than 2 Myr. We also observe a net infall of young
stars into the center of the ONC's deep gravitational potential well. The
infalling sources lie preferentially along the filament, on the other hand,
outflowing sources are distributed spherically around the cluster, and they
have larger velocity dispersion. We further propose a solution to a
long-standing question of why the ONC shows a weak signature of expansion even
though the cluster is likely bound: much of this expansion may be driven by
unstable N-body interactions among stars, resulting in low-velocity ejections.
Though analyzing signatures imprinted on stellar dynamics across different
spatial scales, these observation shed new light on the signatures of formation

is modelling the high redshift Universe, it contains models for inhomogeneous
hydrogen and helium reionization, baryon relative velocities and massive
neutrinos, as well as supernova and AGN feedback. The black hole model includes
mergers driven by dynamical friction rather than repositioning. We briefly
summarise the implemented models, and the technical choices we took when
developing the simulation code. We validate the model, showing good agreement
with observed UV luminosity functions, galaxy stellar mass functions and
specific star formation rates. We show that the redshift at which a given
galaxy underwent hydrogen reionization has a large effect on the halo gas

dark matter can help it to escape the direct detection limits. In this work, we
focus on the coannihilation scenario in which the annihilation cross section is
dominated by the partner-partner pair annihilation. We pay special interest on
the parameter space where the coannihilation partner is long-lived, which leads
to displaced signatures at the collider. In such case, it opens the heavy mass
parameter space for the coannihilation dark matter, comparing with those
dominated by the partner-dark matter annihilation. Specifically, we propose an
inelastic scalar dark matter model with a broken symmetry, which realizes the
domination of partner-partner pair annihilation. Then, we study two different
realizations of the coannihilation partner decay and the existing constraints

mixing. Hydrodynamic simulations help us understand the dynamics of stellar
convection and convective boundaries. However, the codes used to compute such
simulations are usually tested on extremely simple problems and the reliability
and reproducibility of their predictions for turbulent flows is unclear. We
define a test problem involving turbulent convection in a plane-parallel box,
which leads to mass entrainment from, and internal-wave generation in, a stably
stratified layer. We compare the outputs from the codes FLASH, MUSIC, PPMSTAR,
PROMPI, and SLH, which have been widely employed to study hydrodynamic problems
in stellar interiors. The convection is dominated by the largest scales that
fit into the simulation box. All time-averaged profiles of velocity components,
fluctuation amplitudes, and fluxes of enthalpy and kinetic energy are within
$\lesssim 3\sigma$ of the mean of all simulations on a given grid ($128^3$ and
$256^3$ grid cells), where $\sigma$ describes the statistical variation due to
the flow's time dependence. They also agree well with a $512^3$ reference run.
The $128^3$ and $256^3$ simulations agree within $9\%$ and $4\%$, respectively,
on the total mass entrained into the convective layer. The entrainment rate
appears to be set by the amount of energy that can be converted to work in our
setup and details of the small-scale flows in the boundary layer seem to be
largely irrelevant. Our results lend credence to hydrodynamic simulations of
flows in stellar interiors. We provide in electronic form all outputs of our
simulations as well as all information needed to reproduce or extend our study.

regression that the original $\srel$ reveals a $2-$phase behavior: that their
training proceeds via an initial elastic phase when $\srel$ changes rapidly and
an eventual inelastic phase when $\srel$ remains large. Lastly, we give
multiple examples of learning via gradient flows for which one can get a
closed-form expression of the original $\srel$ function. By studying the plots
of these derived formulas we give theoretical demonstrations of some of the
experimentally detected properties of $\srel$ in the regression setting.

conductance peaks (ZBCPs) as signatures of Majorana modes, confusion remains
about whether Majorana modes have been observed. This is in part due to the
theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial (i.e., non-topological) zero-bias
peaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials.
While many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because
the topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of the ZBCP
associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low
temperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small
normal-state conductance. The key shortcoming of the existing experimental
works is an acute lack of stability of the putative Majorana mode features,
indicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper
suggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative
analysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the
counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength
can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this
end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor $F$ to quantify the robustness
of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state (i.e. above-gap)
conductance (which depends crucially on the tunnel barrier height) over which
the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By
computing this quality factor $F$ together with the topological characteristics
for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are
significantly more robust (i.e., have a higher value of $F$) compared with
non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature
as high as the experimentally used $20$ mK, we find that we can set a threshold
value of $F\sim 2.5$ (for $\epsilon=0.1$) so that ZBCPs associated with a
quality factor $F>2.5$ are likely topological and $F\ll 2.5$ are topologically
trivial. More precisely, the value of $F$ is operationally related to the
degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system, although $F$ uses
only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we
discuss how the quality factor $F$ measured in a transport setup can help
estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes. In
particular, we show that if the induced gap can be enhanced somehow beyond the
currently available $\sim 30$ $\mu$eV in InAs/Al samples, large (small) values
of $F$ could easily distinguish between stable topological (unstable trivial)
ZBCPs with the quantum dot induced quasi-Majorana bound states occasionally
behaving similar to topological Majorana modes in short wires.

coevolution of these sources and their host galaxies. We develop a novel
approach for computing black hole virial masses using measurements of continuum
luminosities and emission line widths from partially overlapping, narrow-band
observations of quasars; we refer to this technique as single-epoch photometry.
This novel method relies on forward-modelling quasar observations for
estimating emission line widths, which enables unbiased measurements even for
lines coarsely resolved by narrow-band data. We assess the performance of this
technique using quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observed by
the miniJPAS survey, a proof-of-concept project of the Javalambre Physics of
the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) collaboration covering
$\simeq1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the northern sky using the 56 J-PAS narrow-band
filters. We find remarkable agreement between black hole masses from
single-epoch SDSS spectra and single-epoch miniJPAS photometry, with no
systematic difference between these and a scatter ranging from 0.4 to 0.07 dex
for masses from $\log(M_\mathrm{BH})\simeq8$ to 9.75, respectively.
Reverberation mapping studies show that single-epoch masses present
approximately 0.4 dex precision, letting us conclude that our novel technique
delivers black hole masses with only mildly lower precision than single-epoch
spectroscopy. The J-PAS survey will soon start observing thousands of square
degrees without any source preselection other than the photometric depth in the
detection band, and thus single-epoch photometry has the potential to provide
details on the physical properties of quasar populations that do not satisfy
the preselection criteria of previous spectroscopic surveys.

and one viscoelastic wall are performed. An Eulerian-Eulerian model is adopted

Focus is placed on the propagation of Rayleigh waves in the compliant material,
whose speed depends on the shear modulus of elasticity and whose dominant
wavelength depends on the thickness of the viscoelastic layer. These parameters
are selected to ensure coupling between the compliant surface and turbulence.
When the phase speed of Rayleigh waves is commensurate with the advection
velocity of near-wall pressure fluctuations, sheets of vorticity are lifted up
and detached near the critical layer and lead to a local pressure minimum.
These events are caused by the inflectional velocity profile near the troughs,
and are controlled by the net vorticity flux at the elastic surface. This
phenomenon is central to understanding the statistical characteristics of the
flow, including the surface deformation-pressure correlation and enhanced
stochastic turbulent shear stresses. The pressure work onto the fluid is
positive at the surface, which increases the turbulent intensity and
wall-normal mixing, without any streamwise momentum gain. Finally, we discuss
the influence of three-dimensionality of the surface topography on the
generation of streamwise vorticity, secondary motions, and lateral turbulent

Imaging with correlations also has the advantage of not requiring any knowledge
about the probing pulse and depends weakly on the emitter positions. We account
for the target's orbital velocity by introducing the necessary Doppler
compensation. To image a fast rotating object we also need to compensate for
the rotation. We show that the rotation parameters can be extracted directly

then investigate and analyze an imaging method that relies on backpropagating
the cross-correlation data structure to two points rather than one, thus
forming an interference matrix. The proposed imaging method consists of
estimating the reflectivity as the top eigenvector of the migrated
cross-correlation data interference matrix. We call this the rank-1 image and
show that it provides superior image resolution compared to the usual
single-point migration scheme for fast moving and rotating objects. Moreover,
we observe a significant improvement in resolution due to the rotation leading

distribution of DM is strongly affected by the astrophysical feedback
processes, which are difficult to fully account for in classical techniques to
derive mass models. In this work, we explore the capability of supervised
learning algorithms to predict the DM content of galaxies from luminous
observational-like parameters, using the public catalog of the TNG100
simulation. In particular, we use Photometric, Structural and Kinematic
parameters to predict the total DM mass, DM half-mass radius, DM mass inside
one and two stellar half-mass radii. We adopt the coefficient of determination,
$R^2$, as a reference metric to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. We
find that the Photometric features alone are able to predict the total DM mass
with fair accuracy, while Structural and Photometric features together are more
effective to determine the DM inside the stellar half mass radius, and the DM
within twice the stellar half mass radius. However, using all observational
quantities together (Photometry, Structural and Kinematics) incredibly improves
the overall accuracy for all DM quantities. This first test shows that Machine
Learning tools are promising approaches to derive predictions of the DM in real
galaxies. The next steps will be to improve observational realism of the
training sets, by closely select samples which accurately reproduce the typical
observed luminous scaling relations. The trained pipelines will be suitable for
real galaxy data collected from the next-generation surveys like Rubin/LSST,

optimizing molecules for drug design using physical lab experiments. Bayesian
optimization (BO) is an efficient framework for solving such problems by
intelligently selecting the inputs with high utility guided by a learned
surrogate model. A recent BO approach for combinatorial spaces is through a
reduction to BO over continuous spaces by learning a latent representation of
structures using deep generative models (DGMs). The selected input from the
continuous space is decoded into a discrete structure for performing function
evaluation. However, the surrogate model over the latent space only uses the
information learned by the DGM, which may not have the desired inductive bias
to approximate the target black-box function. To overcome this drawback, this
paper proposes a principled approach referred as LADDER. The key idea is to
define a novel structure-coupled kernel that explicitly integrates the

moves due to a liquid-solid phase change -- the so-called Stefan model. The
familiar QP design is employed to ensure safety but with CBFs that are
infinite-dimensional (including one control barrier ""functional"") and with safe
sets that are infinite-dimensional as well. Since, in the presence of actuator
dynamics, at the boundary of the Stefan system, this system's main CBF is of
relative degree two, an additional CBF is constructed, by backstepping design,
which ensures the positivity of all the CBFs without any additional
restrictions on the initial conditions. It is shown that the ""safety filter""
designed in the paper guarantees safety in the presence of an arbitrary
operator input. This is similar to an automotive system in which a safety
feedback law overrides -- but only when necessary -- the possibly unsafe

theoretical and observed values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the

a change of the anomalous magnetic moment of charged particles. This arises
from two concurrent effects. Classically, light scalars induce a change of the
cyclotron frequency, complementing the electromagnetic effects coming from the
magnetic and electric fields used experimentally. Light scalars also contribute
to the anomalous magnetic moment quantum mechanically at the one-loop level.
For unscreened scalar fields coupling with a Yukawa interaction to matter,
these contributions are negligible after applying the Cassini bound on
deviations from Newtonian gravity. On the other hand, screened scalars such as
chameleons or symmetrons can couple strongly to matter in the laboratory and
decouple in the Solar System. This allows us to probe branches of their
parameter spaces where the recently measured anomalous magnetic moment of the

investigated solely for groups described by finite presentations. We propose to
use descriptions that be algorithms that perform some given tasks, and that
encode the considered groups. We motivate this by establishing undecidability
results for groups described by recursive presentations, strong enough to
prevent an interesting theory of decision problems based on generic recursive
presentations to be developed. More importantly, we give an algorithmic
characterization of finitely presented groups, in terms of existence of a
""marked quotient algorithm"" which recognizes the quotients of the considered
group. This new point of view leads us to proposing several open questions and
directions of research, and much of this paper consists in exposing problems
that arise from our first results. Finally, note that we set our study in the
category of marked groups, we explain why this is beneficial, and give open
questions that arise from the study of decision problems for marked groups.

structure of Jupiter's deep atmospheric zonal flow. Since this inference is
nonunique, it is important to explore the space of possible solutions. In this
paper, we consider a model in which Jupiter's deep atmospheric zonal flow is
barotropic, or invariant along the direction of the rotation axis, until it is
truncated at depth by some dynamical process (e.g., Reynolds stress, Lorentz or
viscous force). We calculate the density perturbation produced by the
$z$-invariant part of the flow using the thermal wind equation and compare the
associated odd zonal gravitational harmonics ($J_{3}$, $J_{5}$, $J_{7}$,
$J_{9}$) to the Juno-derived values. Most of the antisymmetric gravitational
signal measured by Juno can be explained by extending observed winds between
$20.9^{\circ}\rm{S}-26.4^{\circ}\rm{N}$ to depths of $\sim 1000$ km. Because
the small-scale features of the mid/high latitude zonal flow may not persist to
depth, we allow the zonal flow in this region to differ from the observed
surface winds. We find that the Juno odd zonal gravitational harmonics can be
fully explained by $\sim 1000$ km deep barotropic zonal flows involving the
observed winds between $20.9^{\circ}\rm{S}-26.4^{\circ}$N and a few broad
mid/high latitude jets.

real-valued feature $X$ (e.g., credit score) informed by a ""true"" binary label

receives a binary classification label $\hat{Y}$ (e.g., loan approval) from a

architecture search (NAS) is crucial. A key requirement of efficient
hardware-aware NAS is the fast evaluation of inference latencies in order to
rank different architectures. While building a latency predictor for each
target device has been commonly used in state of the art, this is a very
time-consuming process, lacking scalability in the presence of extremely
diverse devices. In this work, we address the scalability challenge by
exploiting latency monotonicity -- the architecture latency rankings on
different devices are often correlated. When strong latency monotonicity
exists, we can re-use architectures searched for one proxy device on new target
devices, without losing optimality. In the absence of strong latency
monotonicity, we propose an efficient proxy adaptation technique to
significantly boost the latency monotonicity. Finally, we validate our approach
and conduct experiments with devices of different platforms on multiple
mainstream search spaces, including MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3, NAS-Bench-201,
ProxylessNAS and FBNet. Our results highlight that, by using just one proxy

in quantum information theory. Applications range from channel coding to
metrology and cryptography. In this work, we introduce a new variant of this
task: Local Simultaneous State Discrimination (LSSD). While previous
distributed variants of the discrimination problem always allowed some
communication between the parties to come up with a joint answer, the parties
in LSSD cannot communicate and have to simultaneously answer correctly. This
simultaneity implies, e.g., that for classical states, the problem does not
trivialize to a non-distributed distinguishing task. While interesting in its
own right, this problem also arises in quantum cryptography. After introducing
the problem, we give a number of characterization results. We give examples
showing that i) the optimal strategy for local discrimination need not coincide
with the optimal strategy for LSSD, even for classical states, ii) an
additional entangled resource can increase the optimal success probability in
LSSD, and iii) stronger-than-quantum non-signalling resources can allow for a
higher success probability in some cases, compared to strategies using
entanglement. Finally, we show that finding the optimal strategy in (classical)
3-party LSSD is NP-hard.

by NH$_3$ exhibits subsonic motions, with an average temperature of 10.4 K. A
fit of the radial column density profile derived from the ammonia emission
finds a flat inner region of radius $\sim$1,800 au and a central density of
$\sim$6$\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. Virial and density structure analysis reveals
the core is marginally bound ($\alpha_{vir}$= 0.73). The region is entirely
consistent with a young starless core, hence ruling out CB 17 MMS as a FHSC
candidate. Additionally, the core exhibits a velocity gradient aligned with the
major axis, showing an arc-like structure in the p-v diagram and an off-center
region with high-velocity dispersion caused by two distinct velocity peaks.
These features could be due to interaction with the nearby outflow, which
appears to deflect due to the dense gas near the NH$_3$ column density peak. We
investigate the specific angular momentum profile of the starless core, finding
that it aligns closely with previous studies of such radial profiles in Class 0
sources. This similarity to more evolved objects suggests that motions at 1,000
au scales are determined by large-scale dense cloud motions and may be
preserved through the early stages of star formation.

between the slits and the screen at locations of interference minima. The
second modification is to place a converging lens just after the wire grid. The
idea is that the wire grid implies the existence of interference
minima(wave-like behavior), while the lens can simultaneously obtain which-way
information (particle-like behavior). More recently, John G. Cramer [2] argued
that the experiment bolstered the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum
mechanics (TIQM). His argument scrutinizes Bohr's complementarity in favor of
TIQM. We analyze this experiment by simulation using the path integral
formulation of quantum mechanics [3] and find that it agrees with the wave
particle duality relation given by Englert, Greenberg and Yasin (E-G-Y) [4, 5].

applied to focus on tweets with personal and emotional content. A
cause-effect-tweet dataset was manually labeled and used to train 1) a
fine-tuned Bertweet model to detect causal sentences containing a causal
association 2) a CRF model with BERT based features to extract possible
cause-effect associations. Causes and effects were clustered in a

Results: Causal sentences were detected with a recall of 68% in an imbalanced

sp-sp$^2$ hybridization with appealing properties and potential applications.
Recent advances have demonstrated the experimental self-assembly of GDYs on
metal substrates. Here we focus on $\alpha$- and $\beta$-GDYs on Au(111) and
Pt(111), and investigate how their electronic and vibrational properties are
affected by the interaction with a metal substrate. We adopt hydrogenated GDY,
previously characterized experimentally, as a benchmark for density functional
theory simulations, that we apply to show that Au and Pt substrates impose a
different degree of distortion on both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-GDY. By comparing
the adsorbed and the freestanding structures, we evaluate the effect of the
surface interaction on the bandstructure and the simulated Raman spectra.
Different charge transfers result in different energy shift of the Dirac cone
in semi-metallic $\alpha$-GDY and changes from semiconducting to metallic
behavior for $\beta$-GDY. These changes in electronic properties are
accompanied by characteristic frequency shifts and modifications of Raman
active modes. Our results contribute in the understanding of the
metal-interaction effects on GDYs and can open a route to the design of novel
2D materials with tailored properties.

using infeasibility certificates, found by using properties of a relaxed

access to recourses, i.e. suggestions about what features they could change to
receive a more favorable decision from the model. Current approaches try to
optimize for the cost incurred by users when adopting a recourse, but they
assume that all users share the same cost function. This is an unrealistic
assumption because users might have diverse preferences about their willingness
to change certain features. In this work, we introduce a new method for
identifying recourse sets for users which does not assume that users'
preferences are known in advance. We propose an objective function, Expected
Minimum Cost (EMC), based on two key ideas: (1) when presenting a set of
options to a user, there only needs to be one low-cost solution that the user
could adopt; (2) when we do not know the user's true cost function, we can
approximately optimize for user satisfaction by first sampling plausible cost
functions from a distribution, then finding a recourse set that achieves a good
cost for these samples. We optimize EMC with a novel discrete optimization
algorithm, Cost Optimized Local Search (COLS), which is guaranteed to improve
the recourse set quality over iterations. Experimental evaluation on popular
real-world datasets with simulated users demonstrates that our method satisfies
up to 25.89 percentage points more users compared to strong baseline methods,

twice as often as the strongest baseline recourses. Finally, using standard

semantic segmentation to a new level, as our evaluation results on ADE20K and

the crystal structure and superconducting properties of LaIr3Ga2, a previously
unreported material that is based on a Kagome lattice of the heavy atom Ir.
LaIr3Ga2 is a type II superconductor with Tc ~ 5.2 K, mu0Hc1 (0) ~ 7.1 mT and
mu0Hc2 (0) ~ 4.7 T. The normalized heat capacity jump at the superconducting
transition, (deltaC/gammaTc), 1.41, is within error of the value expected for a
weak coupling BCS superconductor (1.43). Strong electron-electron correlation
is inferred from the superconducting coherence length. Calculations show that
the influence of spin orbit coupling on the electronic structure is
significant, that the 5d states of the Ir in the Kagome planes are dominant
near the Fermi energy (EF), that a nearly flat band is calculated to occur at
about 100 meV below EF, and that two Dirac points are close to EF. This
material is of interest for investigating the coupling between topological
physics and superconductivity in a system with significant spin orbit coupling.

transitions leading to the emerging body plan of a mature animal. Understanding
how the collective physical processes drive robust morphological patterning
requires a coarse-grained description of the dynamics and the characterization
of the underlying fields. Here I show that calcium spatial fluctuations serve
as an integrator field of the electrical-mechanical processes of morphogenesis
in whole-body Hydra regeneration and drive the morphological dynamics. We
utilize external electric fields to control the developmental process and study
a critical transition in morphogenesis, from the initial spheroidal shape of
the tissue to an elongated cylindrical shape defining the body plan of a mature
animal. Morphogenesis paused under external voltage is associated with a
significant increase of the calcium activity compared with the activity
supporting normal development. The enhanced calcium activity is characterized
by intensified spatial fluctuations, extended spatial correlations across the
tissue and faster temporal fluctuations. In contrast, the normal morphogenesis
process is characterized by relatively moderate calcium fluctuation activity
and restrained spatial correlations. Our methodology of controlling
morphogenesis by a physical electric field allows us to gain a global
statistical view of the dynamics. It shows that the normalized calcium spatial
fluctuations exhibit a universal shape distribution, across tissue samples and
conditions, suggesting the existence of a global constrain over these
fluctuations. Studying the correlations in space and time of the calcium
fluctuation field at the onset of morphogenesis opens a new vista on this
process and paints a picture of development analogous to a dynamical phase
transition.

runtime optimization in conjunction with a strong prior/regularization penalty.
A prime example of this in computer vision is optical and scene flow.
Supervised learning has largely displaced the need for explicit regularization.
Instead, they rely on large amounts of labeled data to capture prior
statistics, which are not always readily available for many problems. Although
optimization is employed to learn the neural network, the weights of this
network are frozen at runtime. As a result, these learning solutions are
domain-specific and do not generalize well to other statistically different
scenarios. This paper revisits the scene flow problem that relies predominantly
on runtime optimization and strong regularization. A central innovation here is
the inclusion of a neural scene flow prior, which uses the architecture of
neural networks as a new type of implicit regularizer. Unlike learning-based
scene flow methods, optimization occurs at runtime, and our approach needs no
offline datasets -- making it ideal for deployment in new environments such as
autonomous driving. We show that an architecture based exclusively on
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be used as a scene flow prior. Our method
attains competitive -- if not better -- results on scene flow benchmarks. Also,
our neural prior's implicit and continuous scene flow representation allows us
to estimate dense long-term correspondences across a sequence of point clouds.
The dense motion information is represented by scene flow fields where points
can be propagated through time by integrating motion vectors. We demonstrate
such a capability by accumulating a sequence of lidar point clouds.

time-series data, but it remains challenging to understand how they function.
Improving this understanding is of substantial interest to both the machine

trained RNN by linearizing around its fixed points has provided insight, but
the approach has significant challenges. These include difficulty choosing
which fixed point to expand around when studying RNN dynamics and error
accumulation when reconstructing the nonlinear dynamics with the linearized
dynamics. We present a new model that overcomes these limitations by
co-training an RNN with a novel switching linear dynamical system (SLDS)
formulation. A first-order Taylor series expansion of the co-trained RNN and an
auxiliary function trained to pick out the RNN's fixed points govern the SLDS
dynamics. The results are a trained SLDS variant that closely approximates the
RNN, an auxiliary function that can produce a fixed point for each point in
state-space, and a trained nonlinear RNN whose dynamics have been regularized
such that its first-order terms perform the computation, if possible. This
model removes the post-training fixed point optimization and allows us to
unambiguously study the learned dynamics of the SLDS at any point in
state-space. It also generalizes SLDS models to continuous manifolds of
switching points while sharing parameters across switches. We validate the
utility of the model on two synthetic tasks relevant to previous work reverse
engineering RNNs. We then show that our model can be used as a drop-in in more
complex architectures, such as LFADS, and apply this LFADS hybrid to analyze

blockchain. However, the strong generalization across all clients makes these
approaches unsuited for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)
data.
  We propose a unified approach to decentralization and personalization in
federated learning that is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of model
updates. Instead of training a single global model, clients specialize on their
local data while using the model updates from other clients dependent on the
similarity of their respective data. This specialization implicitly emerges
from the DAG-based communication and selection of model updates. Thus, we
enable the evolution of specialized models, which focus on a subset of the data
and therefore cover non-IID data better than federated learning in a
centralized or blockchain-based setup.
  To the best of our knowledge, the proposed solution is the first to unite
personalization and poisoning robustness in fully decentralized federated
learning. Our evaluation shows that the specialization of models emerges
directly from the DAG-based communication of model updates on three different
datasets. Furthermore, we show stable model accuracy and less variance across
clients when compared to federated averaging.

online adapting the optimal gains to meet the time-varying performance index is

  Maximum Network Flow Overlap Problem",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Cities around the world vary in terms of their transportation networks and
travel demand patterns; these variations affect the viability of shared
mobility services. This study proposes metrics to quantify the shareability of
person-trips in a city, as a function of two inputs--the road network structure
and origin-destination (OD) travel demand. The study first conceptualizes a
fundamental shareability unit, 'flow overlap'. Flow overlap denotes, for a
person-trip traversing a given path, the weighted (by link distance) average
number of other trips sharing the links along the original person's path. The
study extends this concept to the network level and formulates the Maximum
Network Flow Overlap Problem (MNFLOP) to assign all OD trips to paths that
maximize network-wide flow overlap. The study utilizes the MNFLOP output to
calculate metrics of shareability at various levels of aggregation: person-trip
level, OD level, origin or destination level, network level, and link level.
The study applies the MNFLOP and associated shareability metrics to different
OD demand scenarios in the Sioux Falls network. The computational results
verify that (i) MNFLOP assigns person-trips to paths such that flow overlaps
significantly increase relative to shortest path assignment, (ii) MNFLOP and
its associated shareability metrics can meaningfully differentiate between
different OD trip matrices in terms of shareability, and (iii) an MNFLOP-based
metric can quantify demand dispersion--a metric of the directionality of
demand--in addition to the magnitude of demand, for trips originating or
terminating from a single node in the network. The paper also includes an
extensive discussion of potential future uses of the MNFLOP and its associated
shareability metrics.

critical points of the background analysis split, corresponding to different
behavior of matter perturbations, and hence to stability properties. From the
combined analysis, we find critical points that describe the non-accelerating
matter-dominated epoch with the correct growth of matter structure, and the
fact that they are saddle provides the natural exit from this phase.
Furthermore, we find stable attractors at late times corresponding to a dark
energy-dominated accelerated solution with constant matter perturbations, as
required by observations. Thus, interacting cosmology can describe the matter

items in working memory. When items take continuous values (e.g., orientation,
contrast, length, loudness) they must be stored in a continuous structure of
appropriate dimensions. We investigate how this structure is represented in
neural circuits by training recurrent networks to report two previously shown
stimulus orientations. We find the activity manifold for the two orientations
resembles a Clifford torus. Although a Clifford and standard torus (the surface
of a donut) are topologically equivalent, they have important functional
differences. A Clifford torus treats the two orientations equally and keeps
them in orthogonal subspaces, as demanded by the task, whereas a standard torus
does not. We find and characterize the connectivity patterns that support the
Clifford torus. Moreover, in addition to attractors that store information via
persistent activity, our networks also use a dynamic code where units change
their tuning to prevent new sensory input from overwriting the previously
stored one. We argue that such dynamic codes are generally required whenever
multiple inputs enter a memory system via shared connections. Finally, we apply
our framework to a human psychophysics experiment in which subjects reported
two remembered orientations. By varying the training conditions of the RNNs, we
test and support the hypothesis that human behavior is a product of both neural
noise and reliance on the more stable and behaviorally relevant memory of the
ordinal relationship between the two orientations. This suggests that suitable
inductive biases in RNNs are important for uncovering how the human brain
implements working memory. Together, these results offer an understanding of
the neural computations underlying a class of visual decoding tasks, bridging
the scales from human behavior to synaptic connectivity.

numerous labeled training samples ($n$) rarely available in many fields. This
paper presents a pre-training method involving graph convolutional/neural

high-level embeddings of an input sample. Many of the recently proposed
pre-training methods pre-train one of many possible networks of an

we take our high-level embeddings from two different networks of a model --a

1) inconsistent definitions of accuracy, 2) a lack of studies validating how
researchers are actually using INLA, and 3) a lack of research into the
reproducibility of INLA's output. We explore the practical impact of each
limitation with simulation studies based on models and data used in COVID-19

INLA technique may not support how COVID-19 researchers are using it. Guided in

  colliding with the Galactic disk","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab3206",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High velocity clouds moving toward the disk will reach the Galactic plane and
will inevitably collide with the disk. In these collisions a system of two
shocks is produced, one propagating through the disk and the other develops
within the cloud. The shocks produced within the clouds in these interactions
have velocities of hundreds of kilometers per second. When these shocks are
radiative they may be inefficient in accelerating fresh particles, however they
can reaccelerate and compress Galactic cosmic rays from the background. In this
work we investigate the interactions of Galactic cosmic rays within a shocked
high velocity cloud, when the shock is induced by the collision with the disk.
This study is focused in the case of radiative shocks. We aim to establish
under which conditions these interactions lead to significant nonthermal
emission, especially gamma rays. We model the interaction of cosmic ray protons
and electrons reaccelerated and further energized by compression in shocks
within the clouds, under very general assumptions. We also consider secondary
electron-positron pairs produced by the cosmic ray protons when colliding with
the material of the cloud. We conclude that nearby clouds reaccelerating
Galactic cosmic rays in local shocks can produce high-energy radiation that
might be detectable with existing and future gamma-ray detectors. The emission
produced by electrons and secondary pairs is important at radio wavelengths,
and in some cases it may be relevant at hard X-rays. Concerning higher
energies, the leptonic contribution to the spectral energy distribution is
significant at soft gamma rays.

which should result in models that can more accurately generalize to real data.
In this work, we classify powder diffraction patterns into all 14 Bravais

conceptually study flow in porous media. Numerical simulations were previously
used to address the effect of particle shape on characteristics, such as pore
space fractal dimension, moisture characteristic curve (MCC) and saturated
hydraulic conductivity (SHC) of grain packs. However, experimental observations
are still required since fractal-based approaches have been extensively
proposed to model various properties in porous media. In this study, 16 angular
sand and 16 spherical glass bead samples with different particle size
distributions (PSDs) from well- to poorly-sorted were packed. The MCC was
measured using the combination of sandbox and pressure plates methods. The pore
space fractal dimension (DMCC), calculated from the measured MCC, ranged from
0.80 to 2.86 in sand and from -0.18 to 2.81 in glass bead packs, which
indicated that DMCC may be negative in homogenous media (e.g., glass bead
packs) consistent with several studies in the literature. Results showed
greater DMCC for the sand packs than the glass bead packs with the same
geometric mean diameter values and PSDs. This clearly demonstrated the effect
of particle shape on DMCC in the studied packs. The critical path analysis
(CPA) approach was used to estimate the SHC measured using the constant-head
method. We found that the CPA estimated the SHC accurately, within a factor of
four of the measurements on average. Although the CPA is theoretically known to
be accurate in media with broad pore size distributions, we experimentally
found that it estimated the SHC in various types of grain packs reasonably
well.

stochastic compressive forcing which is delta-correlated in time. By
considering the nearly Jeans-unstable case, where the scaling of the simulation
is such that a statistical steady state without any irreversible collapses is
obtained, we obtain a randomly varying potential, acting as a second stochastic

and cluster in much the same way as in a case of statistical steady-state
turbulence without self-gravity. Large, high-inertia grains, however, are
accelerated to much higher mean velocities in the presence of self-gravity.
Grains of intermediate size also show an increased degree of clustering. We
conclude that self-gravity effects can play an important role for
aggregation/coagulation of dust even in a turbulent system which is not

interstellar medium can be much higher than predicted by previous work.

problems involving difference of two convex functions (DC functions). Supposing
the first DC component differentiable and the second one possibly
non-differentiable, the main idea of BDCA is to use the point computed by the
DC algorithm (DCA) to define a descent direction and perform a monotone line
search to improve the decreasing the objetive function accelerating the
convergence of the DCA. However, if the first DC component is
non-differentiable, then the direction computed by BDCA can be an ascent
direction and a monotone line search cannot be performed. Our approach uses a
non-monotone line search in the BDCA (nmBDCA) to enable a possible growth in
the objective function values controlled by a parameter. Under suitable
assumptions, we show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by the
nmBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and provide some
iteration-complexity bounds. Furthermore, if the first DC component is

full convergence of the sequence under the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz property of
the objective function. Some numerical experiments show that the nmBDCA

Photonic topological insulators can be crafted in materials that exhibit a
strong nonlinear response, thus opening the door to the exploration of the
interplay between nonlinearity and topological effects. Among the fascinating
new phenomena arising from this interplay is the formation of topological edge
solitons -- hybrid asymmetric states localized across and along the interface
due to different physical mechanisms. Such solitons have so far been studied
only in materials with Kerr-type, or cubic, nonlinearity. Here the first
example of the topological edge soliton supported by parametric interactions in
$\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear media is presented. Such solitons exist in Floquet
topological insulators realized in arrays of helical waveguides made of a
phase-matchable $\chi^{(2)}$ material. Floquet edge solitons bifurcate from
topological edge states in the spectrum of the fundamental frequency wave and
remain localized over propagation distances drastically exceeding the helix
period, while travelling along the edge of the structure. A theory of such
states is developed. It is shown that multicolor solitons in a Floquet system
exists in the vicinity of (formally infinite) set of linear resonances
determined by the Floquet phase matching conditions. Away from resonance,
soliton envelopes can be described by a period-averaged single nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation with an effective cubic nonlinear coefficient whose

check: it is structurally flawed. In agreement with the slightly glib summary

the synapses in the brain; instead, it is the wires in deep neural networks

dwarf novae which show multiple rebrightenings. This phenomenon probably arises
from premature quenching of the superoutburst due to the weak 3:1 resonance
near the stability border of the resonance, resulting in a considerable amount
of disk mass after the superoutburst. We noted that ASASSN-19ax is very similar
to QZ Ser, an SU UMa-type dwarf nova with an orbital period of 0.08316 d and an
anomalously hot, bright secondary star, in that both objects showed multiple
post-superoutburst rebrightenings at least once and that they are bright in
quiescence. We expect that the core of the secondary in ASASSN-19ax may be

using the full array are 1.6% and 1% lower than those observed with the
subarray at [3.6] and [4.5], respectively. Additionally, we found a dependence
on the exposure time such that for [3.6] observations the long frame times are

evolved from the main sequence to the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch
(AGB). These are the first $Z=0.1$ AGB models in the literature. The MESA
models include intermediate-mass models with $Z=0.06$ to $Z=0.09$ evolved to
the onset of the thermally-pulsing phase. Third dredge-up only occurs in
intermediate-mass models $Z \le 0.08$. Hot bottom burning (HBB) shows a weaker
dependence on metallicity, with the minimum mass increasing from 4.5$M_{\odot}$
for $Z=0.014$ to $\approx 5.5 M_{\odot}$ for Z = 0.04, $6M_{\odot}$ for $ 0.05

$Z=0.1$ models is unusual; most do not experience He-shell instabilities owing
to rapid mass-loss on the early part of the AGB. Turning off mass-loss produces
He-shell instabilities, however thermal pulses are weak and result in no third
dredge-up. The minimum mass for carbon ignition is reduced from 8$M_{\odot}$
for $Z=0.04$ to 7$M_{\odot}$ for $Z=0.1$, which implies a reduction in the
minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae. MESA models of similarly high
metallicity ($Z=0.06 - 0.09$) show the same lowering of the minimum mass for
carbon ignition: carbon burning is detected in a $6 M_{\odot}$ model at the
highest metallicity ($Z=0.09$) and in all $7 M_{\odot}$ models with $Z \ge
0.06$. This demonstrates robustness of the lowered carbon burning threshold
across codes.

(41.9 pc) multi-planetary system orbiting a young (204$\pm$50 Myr), bright (K =
7.115 in TIC v8.1). TOI-1807 hosts a single transiting planet, and is similarly
nearby (42.58pc), similarly young (180$\pm$40 Myr), and bright. Both targets
exhibit significant, periodic variability due to star spots, characteristic of
their young ages. Using photometric data collected by TESS we identify three
transiting planets around TOI-2076 with radii of R$_b$=3.3$\pm$0.04$R_\oplus$,
R$_c$=4.4$\pm$0.05$R_\oplus$, and R$_d$=4.1$\pm$0.07$R_\oplus$. Planet
TOI-2076b has a period of P$_b$=10.356 d. For both TOI 2076c and d, TESS
observed only two transits, separated by a 2-year interval in which no data
were collected, preventing a unique period determination. A range of long
periods (>17d) are consistent with the data. We identify a short-period planet
around TOI-1807 with a radius of R$_b$=1.8$\pm$0.04$R_\oplus$ and a period of
P$_b$=0.549 d. Their close proximity, and bright, cool host stars, and young
ages, make these planets excellent candidates for follow-up. TOI-1807b is one
of the best known small ($R<2R_\oplus$) planets for characterization via
eclipse spectroscopy and phase curves with JWST. TOI-1807b is the youngest
ultra-short period planet discovered to date, providing valuable constraints on
formation time-scales of short period planets. Given the rarity of young
planets, particularly in multiple planet systems, these planets present an
unprecedented opportunity to study and compare exoplanet formation, and young
planet atmospheres, at a crucial transition age for formation theory.

led him to construct an affine subspace parametrising regular conjugacy
classes, which he noticed is also a cross section for the conjugation action by
the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup on another affine subspace. Recently,
generalisations of this slice and its cross section property have been obtained
by Sevostyanov in the context of quantum group analogues of W-algebras and by
He-Lusztig in the context of Deligne-Lusztig varieties. Such slices are often
thought of as group analogues of Slodowy slices.
  In this paper we explain their relationship via common generalisations
associated to Weyl group elements and provide a simple criterion for cross
sections in terms of roots. In the most important class of examples this
criterion is equivalent to a statement about the Deligne-Garside factors of
their powers in the braid monoid being maximal in some sense. Moreover, we show
that these subvarieties transversely intersect conjugacy classes and determine
for a large class of factorisable r-matrices when the Semenov-Tian-Shansky
bracket reduces to a Poisson structure on these slices.

word matching or content-based features. However, a recent user study shows
that word matching features are quite obvious to users and thus of slight

not generate the queries themselves as explanations, two query-attention layers

is trained without using any human-generated explanations. Training data are
instead automatically constructed to ensure a tolerable noise level and a

conservation laws in non-periodic domains under arbitrary boundary conditions.
The approach relies on the use of the Fourier Continuation (FC) method for
spectral representation of non-periodic functions in conjunction with smooth
localized artificial viscosity assignments produced by means of a
Shock-Detecting Neural Network (SDNN). Like previous shock capturing schemes
and artificial viscosity techniques, the combined FC-SDNN strategy effectively
controls spurious oscillations in the proximity of discontinuities. Thanks to
its use of a localized but smooth artificial viscosity term, whose support is
restricted to a vicinity of flow-discontinuity points, the algorithm enjoys
spectral accuracy and low dissipation away from flow discontinuities, and, in
such regions, it produces smooth numerical solutions -- as evidenced by an
essential absence of spurious oscillations in level set lines. The FC-SDNN
viscosity assignment, which does not require use of problem-dependent
algorithmic parameters, induces a significantly lower overall dissipation than
other methods, including the Fourier-spectral versions of the previous entropy
viscosity method. The character of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with a
variety of numerical results for the linear advection, Burgers and Euler
equations in one and two-dimensional non-periodic spatial domains.

are antagonistic toward the quantum spin liquid. This is consistent with the
fact the zero magnetic field ground state of these materials is generally

expected to be variable at the dynamical timescale near their horizons. For the
black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, this timescale (5-61 days) is
comparable to the 6-day extent of the 2017 EHT observations. Closure phases
along baseline triangles are robust interferometric observables that are
sensitive to the expected structural changes of the images but are free of
station-based atmospheric and instrumental errors. We explored the day-to-day
variability in closure phase measurements on all six linearly independent
non-trivial baseline triangles that can be formed from the 2017 observations.
We showed that three triangles exhibit very low day-to-day variability, with a
dispersion of $\sim3-5^\circ$. The only triangles that exhibit substantially
higher variability ($\sim90-180^\circ$) are the ones with baselines that cross
visibility amplitude minima on the $u-v$ plane, as expected from theoretical
modeling. We used two sets of General Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations to explore the dependence of the predicted variability on various
black-hole and accretion-flow parameters. We found that changing the magnetic
field configuration, electron temperature model, or black-hole spin has a
marginal effect on the model consistency with the observed level of
variability. On the other hand, the most discriminating image characteristic of
models is the fractional width of the bright ring of emission. Models that best
reproduce the observed small level of variability are characterized by thin
ring-like images with structures dominated by gravitational lensing effects and
thus least affected by turbulence in the accreting plasmas.

paper, we place the semi-supervised video object segmentation problem into a
cyclic workflow and find the defects above can be collectively addressed via
the inherent cyclic property of semi-supervised VOS systems. Firstly, a cyclic
mechanism incorporated to the standard sequential flow can produce more
consistent representations for pixel-wise correspondance. Relying on the
accurate reference mask in the starting frame, we show that the error
propagation problem can be mitigated. Next, a simple gradient correction
module, which naturally extends the offline cyclic pipeline to an online

improve the segmentation quality while keeping feasible computation cost.
Meanwhile such correction can protect the network from severe performance
degration resulted from interference signals. Finally we develop cycle

provide a new perspective into analyzing object-specific regions of interests.
We conduct comprehensive comparison and detailed analysis on challenging

overdamped active particles diffuse on the cavity surface, and rotational
dynamics solely governs the exit process. On the other hand, the escape
kinetics of a very weakly damped active particle is largely dictated by
bouncing effects on the cavity walls irrespective of the amplitude of
self-propulsion persistence lengths. We show that the exit rate can be
maximized for an optimal self-propulsion persistence length, which depends on
the damping strength, self-propulsion velocity, and cavity size. However, the
optimal persistence length is insensitive to the opening windows' size, number,

biometric identification approach, especially in wild environments (for

not be applicable. This paper presents a new deep periocular recognition
framework called attribute-based deep periocular recognition (ADPR), which
predicts soft biometrics and incorporates the prediction into a periocular
recognition algorithm to determine identity from periocular images with high
accuracy. We propose an end-to-end framework, which uses several shared
convolutional neural network (CNN)layers (a common network) whose output feeds
two separate dedicated branches (modality dedicated layers); the first branch
classifies periocular images while the second branch predicts softn biometrics.
Next, the features from these two branches are fused together for a final
periocular recognition. The proposed method is different from existing methods
as it not only uses a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks
jointly, but it also fuses predicted soft biometric features with the
periocular features in the training step to improve the overall periocular
recognition performance. Our proposed model is extensively evaluated using four
different publicly available datasets. Experimental results indicate that our
soft biometric based periocular recognition approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods for periocular recognition in wild environments.

supports significant improvements in the conversion efficiency when compared to

driven, the strong coherence induced by the vacuum of the mediating channel
leads to much stronger enhancements in the intended conversion. The enhancement
is an inalienable artifact of the emergence of a long-lived, dark mode
associated with a quasi-real singularity of the hybrid system. In addition, we
observe considerable asymmetry in the efficiencies of microwave-to-optical and
optical-to-microwave conversions, in spite of the symmetrical structure of the

The nonreciprocity stems from the intrinsic asymmetry in the couplings of the

Here we discuss the properties of wavefronts of OTOCs by focusing on the region
around the main wavefront at $x=v_{B}t$, where $v_{B}$ is the butterfly
velocity. Using a Heisenberg spin model as an example, we find that a
propagating Gaussian with the argument $-m(x)\left( x-v_B t \right)^2 +b(x)t$
gives an excellent fit for both the integrable case and the chaotic case.
However, the scaling in these two regimes is very different: in the integrable
case the coefficients $m(x)$ and $b(x)$ have an inverse power law dependence on
$x$ whereas in the chaotic case they decay exponentially. In fact, the
wavefront in the integrable case is a rainbow caustic and catastrophe theory
can be invoked to assert that power law scaling holds rigorously in that case.

  Task-Agnostic Training","Accepted for NeurIPS 2021",,,,"eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Federated learning, which shares the weights of the neural network across
clients, is gaining attention in the healthcare sector as it enables training
on a large corpus of decentralized data while maintaining data privacy. For
example, this enables neural network training for COVID-19 diagnosis on chest
X-ray (CXR) images without collecting patient CXR data across multiple
hospitals. Unfortunately, the exchange of the weights quickly consumes the
network bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed.
So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural
network into a client and a server part, so that the client part of the network
takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not
clear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network
performance. To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct
strengths, here we show that the Vision Transformer, a recently developed deep
learning architecture with straightforward decomposable configuration, is
ideally suitable for split learning without sacrificing performance. Even under
the non-independent and identically distributed data distribution which
emulates a real collaboration between hospitals using CXR datasets from
multiple sources, the proposed framework was able to attain performance
comparable to data-centralized training. In addition, the proposed framework
along with heterogeneous multi-task clients also improves individual task
performances including the diagnosis of COVID-19, eliminating the need for
sharing large weights with innumerable parameters. Our results affirm the
suitability of Transformer for collaborative learning in medical imaging and
pave the way forward for future real-world implementations.

requiring analysis of large-scale datastreams that comprise multiple
indefinitely long time series. There is an acute need for statistical
methodologies that perform online inference and continuously revise the model
to reflect the current status of the underlying process. In this manuscript, we
propose a dynamic statistical inference framework--named dynamic tracking and
screening (DTS)--that is not only able to provide accurate estimates of the
underlying parameters in a dynamic statistical model, but also capable of
rapidly identifying irregular individual streams whose behavioral patterns
deviate from the majority. Concretely, by fully exploiting the sequential
feature of datastreams, we develop a robust estimation approach under a
framework of varying coefficient model. The procedure naturally accommodates
unequally-spaced design points and updates the coefficient estimates as new
data arrive without the need to store historical data. A data-driven choice of
an optimal smoothing parameter is accordingly proposed. Furthermore, we suggest
a new multiple testing procedure tailored to the streaming environment. The
resulting DTS scheme is able to adapt time-varying structures appropriately,
track changes in the underlying models, and hence maintain high accuracy in
detecting time periods during which individual streams exhibit irregular
behavior. Moreover, we derive rigorous statistical guarantees of the procedure
and investigate its finite-sample performance through simulation studies. We
demonstrate the proposed methods through a mobile health example to estimate
the timings when subjects' sleep and physical activities have unusual influence
upon their mood.

propose an optimization problem that minimizes the sum of the trace of the
covariance operator of the Kalman-Bucy filter and a generic mobility cost of
the mobile sensors, subject to the sensors' motion modeled by linear dynamics.
We establish the existence of a solution to this problem. Moreover, we prove
convergence to the exact optimal solution of the approximate optimal solution.
That is, when evaluating these two solutions using the original cost function,
the difference becomes arbitrarily small as the approximation gets finer. To
compute the approximate solution, we use Pontryagin's minimum principle after
approximating the infinite-dimensional terms originating from the

to analyze how a single mobile sensor's performance depends on two important

  We begin with the Hall equations (without the effect of the fluid part). We
first show the long time behavior of weak solutions and weak-strong uniqueness.
We then proceed to prove the existence of unique strong solutions locally in

model features an ultralight axion with mass $m_a \sim 10^{-29}$ eV, which
couples to the Higgs field such that the Higgs-VEV is driven by the axion
background evolution. Phenomenologically, the axi-Higgs model is equivalent to
$\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$+$\omega_a$ which is defined as $\Lambda$CDM with electron

and curvature such that any elastic energy density constructed from its

corresponding isotropic quadratic energy resolve outstanding issues in thin
structure elasticity, including the natural extension of primitive bending
strains for straight rods to plates, the assurance of a moment linear in the
bending measure, and the avoidance of induced mid-plane strains in response to
pure moments as found in some commonly used analytical plate models. Our
analysis also reveals that some other commonly used numerical models have the
right invariance properties, although they lack full generality at quadratic
order in stretch. We further extend our result to naturally-curved rods and
shells, for which the pure stretching of a curved rest configuration breaks
dilation invariance; the new shell bending measure we provide contrasts with
previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The concept that unifies these
theories is not dilation invariance, but rather through-thickness uniformity of
strain as a definition of pure stretching deformations. Our results provide a
clean basis for simple models of low-dimensional elastic systems, and should
enable more accurate analytical probing of the structure of singularities in

of these methods result in large variance because the experimental sample often
differs substantially from the target population, and estimated sampling

post-residualized weighting in which we use the outcome measured in the

estimator is consistent under the same assumptions required for existing

the predictive model. We demonstrate the efficiency gains from this approach

propose a new outlier-robust Wasserstein distance $\mathsf{W}_p^\varepsilon$

$\mathsf{W}_p^\varepsilon$ is shown to achieve strong robust estimation

of this robust distance amounts to a highly regular optimization problem that
lends itself better for analysis compared to previously considered frameworks.
Leveraging this, we conduct a thorough theoretical study of

characterization of optimal perturbations, regularity, duality, and statistical

at a simple dual form for $\mathsf{W}_p^\varepsilon$ that can be implemented

\emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 090401 (2007)], which is saturable
with celebrated NOON states. We also show that parity detection is a
quasioptimal measurement which can nearly saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao
bound in the aforementioned situation. Moreover, we further clarify the
supersensitive performance observed in the above scheme is due to the
restriction of Boixo \emph{et al}.'s generalized sensitivity limit (BGSL) to
probe states with fixed photon numbers. To conquer this problem, we generalize
the BGSL into the case with probe states of a fluctuating number of photons, to
which our scheme belongs.

near-linear time deterministic algorithm for minimum cut in a simple graph $G =
(V,E)$. A key component is finding the $(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of $G$,
the coarsest partition $\{P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$ of $V$ such that for every
non-trivial $(1+\varepsilon)$-near minimum cut with sides $\{S, \bar{S}\}$ it
holds that $P_i$ is contained in either $S$ or $\bar{S}$, for $i=1, \ldots, k$.
Here we give a near-linear time randomized algorithm to find the
$(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of a weighted graph. Our algorithm is quite
different from that of Kawarabayashi and Thorup and builds on Karger's
framework of tree-respecting cuts (J.~ACM'00).
  We describe applications of the algorithm. (i) The algorithm makes progress
towards a more efficient algorithm for constructing the polygon representation
of the set of near-minimum cuts in a graph. This is a generalization of the
cactus representation initially described by Bencz\'ur (FOCS'95). (ii) We
improve the time complexity of a recent quantum algorithm for minimum cut in a
simple graph in the adjacency list model from $\widetilde O(n^{3/2})$ to
$\widetilde O(\sqrt{mn})$. (iii) We describe a new type of randomized algorithm
for minimum cut in simple graphs with complexity $O(m + n \log^6 n)$. For
slightly dense graphs this matches the complexity of the current best $O(m + n
\log^2 n)$ algorithm which uses a different approach based on random
contractions.
  The key technical contribution of our work is the following. Given a weighted
graph $G$ with $m$ edges and a spanning tree $T$, consider the graph $H$ whose
nodes are the edges of $T$, and where there is an edge between two nodes of $H$
iff the corresponding 2-respecting cut of $T$ is a non-trivial near-minimum cut
of $G$. We give a $O(m \log^4 n)$ time deterministic algorithm to compute a
spanning forest of $H$.

exploited to avoid any unfavorable behavior at the tail of the distribution. We
develop Gaussian approximation theory for VAR model to derive the asymptotic

distributions from data by modeling the target distribution as a function of a

optimized to minimize a chosen distance measure between the generated and
target distributions. One commonly used measure for this purpose is the
Wasserstein distance. However, Wasserstein distance is hard to compute and
optimize, and in practice entropic regularization techniques are used to
improve numerical convergence. The influence of regularization on the learned
solution, however, remains not well-understood. In this paper, we study how
several popular entropic regularizations of Wasserstein distance impact the
solution in a simple benchmark setting where the generator is linear and the
target distribution is high-dimensional Gaussian. We show that entropy
regularization promotes the solution sparsification, while replacing the
Wasserstein distance with the Sinkhorn divergence recovers the unregularized
solution. Both regularization techniques remove the curse of dimensionality
suffered by Wasserstein distance. We show that the optimal generator can be
learned to accuracy $\epsilon$ with $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples from the target
distribution. We thus conclude that these regularization techniques can improve
the quality of the generator learned from empirical data for a large class of

differential equations (PDEs), among which the physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) emerges to be a promising method for solving both forward and inverse
PDE problems. PDEs with a point source that is expressed as a Dirac delta
function in the governing equations are mathematical models of many physical
processes. However, they cannot be solved directly by conventional PINNs method
due to the singularity brought by the Dirac delta function. We propose a
universal solution to tackle this problem with three novel techniques. Firstly
the Dirac delta function is modeled as a continuous probability density
function to eliminate the singularity; secondly a lower bound constrained
uncertainty weighting algorithm is proposed to balance the PINNs losses between
point source area and other areas; and thirdly a multi-scale deep neural
network with periodic activation function is used to improve the accuracy and
convergence speed of the PINNs method. We evaluate the proposed method with
three representative PDEs, and the experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing deep learning-based methods with respect to the accuracy,
the efficiency and the versatility.

safety-critical applications, and popular training algorithms can certify
robustness of a neural network by computing a global bound on its Lipschitz
constant. However, such a bound is often loose: it tends to over-regularize the
neural network and degrade its natural accuracy. A tighter Lipschitz bound may
provide a better tradeoff between natural and certified accuracy, but is
generally hard to compute exactly due to non-convexity of the network. In this
work, we propose an efficient and trainable \emph{local} Lipschitz upper bound
by considering the interactions between activation functions (e.g. ReLU) and
weight matrices. Specifically, when computing the induced norm of a weight
matrix, we eliminate the corresponding rows and columns where the activation
function is guaranteed to be a constant in the neighborhood of each given data
point, which provides a provably tighter bound than the global Lipschitz
constant of the neural network. Our method can be used as a plug-in module to
tighten the Lipschitz bound in many certifiable training algorithms.
Furthermore, we propose to clip activation functions (e.g., ReLU and MaxMin)
with a learnable upper threshold and a sparsity loss to assist the network to
achieve an even tighter local Lipschitz bound. Experimentally, we show that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clean and
certified accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets with various

to support a significant number of robotic manipulators. Depending on the
processes involved, these industrial robots might result in significant volume
of multi-modal traffic that will need to traverse the network all the way to
the (public/private) edge cloud, where advanced processing, control and service
orchestration will be taking place. In this paper, we perform the traffic
engineering by capitalizing on the underlying pseudo-deterministic nature of
the repetitive processes of robotic manipulators in an industrial environment
and propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model to minimize the maximum
aggregate traffic in the network. The task sequence and time gap requirements
are also considered in the proposed model. To tackle the curse of
dimensionality in ILP, we provide a random search algorithm with quadratic time
complexity. Numerical investigations reveal that the proposed scheme can reduce
the peak data rate up to 53.4% compared with the nominal case where robotic
manipulators operate in an uncoordinated fashion, resulting in significant
improvement in the utilization of the underlying network resources.

Different use cases for dialogue systems ranging from task-based systems to

analysis tasks and applications based on them.transfer One of the core
challenges is recognizing targets of indirect calls (i.e., indirect callees).
Existing solutions all have high false positives and negatives, making call
graphs inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new solution Callee combining
transfer learning and contrastive learning. The key insight is that, deep
neural networks (DNNs) can automatically identify patterns concerning indirect
calls, which can be more efficient than designing approximation algorithms or
heuristic rules to handle various cases. Inspired by the advances in
question-answering applications, we utilize contrastive learning to answer the
callsite-callee question. However, one of the toughest challenges is that DNNs
need large datasets to achieve high performance, while collecting large-scale
indirect-call ground-truths can be computational-expensive. Since direct calls
and indirect calls share similar calling conventions, it is possible to
transfer knowledge learned from direct calls to indirect ones. Therefore, we
leverage transfer learning to pre-train DNNs with easy-to-collect direct calls
and further fine-tune the indirect-call DNNs. We evaluate Callee on several
groups of targets, and results show that our solution could match callsites to
callees with an F1-Measure of 94.6%, much better than state-of-the-art
solutions. Further, we apply Callee to binary code similarity detection and
hybrid fuzzing, and found it could greatly improve their performance.

The main result is a comparison between the spectrum of the Robin Laplacian

Born-Oppenheimer approximation. More precisely, the low-lying eigenvalue of the
Robin Laplacian is approximated by the those of the effective operator. When
the curvature has a unique non-degenerate maximum, we estimate the spectral gap

are found to be useful in distinguishing between the $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$

imprint of $f(R)$ gravity on large scale structures by $\sim 40\%$ when
combined with the conventional halo clustering in redshift space. We also find
that the correlation between the axis ratio and orientation of halos becomes
stronger in $f(R)$ gravity than that in $\Lambda$CDM. Our results demonstrate
the usefulness of IA statistics as a probe of gravity beyond a consistency test

strategies to address the above learning task. When only image-level semantic

To address this problem, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, which
predicts pseudo pixel-level segmentation masks from a limited amount of data
and their semantic labels. More importantly, our learning scheme further
exploits the produced pixel-level information for query image inputs with
segmentation guarantees. Thus, our proposed learning model can be viewed as a
pixel-level meta-learner. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,

is one of the core challenges of network optimization. Such routes can be
formalized as $h$-length flows which are defined as flows whose flow paths are
restricted to have length at most $h$. Many well-studied algorithmic primitives
-- such as maximal and maximum length-constrained disjoint paths -- are special
cases of $h$-length flows. Likewise the optimal $h$-length flow is a
fundamental quantity in network optimization, characterizing, up to poly-log
factors, how quickly a network can accomplish numerous distributed primitives.
  In this work, we give the first efficient algorithms for computing $(1 -
\epsilon)$-approximate $h$-length flows. We give deterministic algorithms that
take $\tilde{O}(\text{poly}(h, \frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ parallel time and
$\tilde{O}(\text{poly}(h, \frac{1}{\epsilon}) \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})})$

deterministic CONGEST algorithms for the maximal length-constrained disjoint
paths problem -- settling an open question of Chang and Saranurak (FOCS 2020)

algorithms for maximum length-constrained disjoint paths. The former greatly
simplifies deterministic CONGEST algorithms for computing expander

analytically deriving the system's normal form equations and confirm these
results via extensive numerical simulations. Our model describes a nematic

users and failures. The notion of $(k,t)$-robustness has shown instrumental to
list problems that cannot be solved if $k$ players are rational and $t$ players
are Byzantine or act arbitrarily. What is less clear is whether one can solve
such problems if the faults are benign.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap between games that are robust against
Byzantine players and games that are robust against crash players. Our first
result is an impossibility result:
  We show that no $(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol can solve consensus in the
crash model if $k+2t\geq n$ unless there is a particular punishment strategy,
called the $(k,t)$-baiting strategy. This reveals the need to introduce baiting
as the act of rewarding a colluding node when betraying its coalition, to make
blockchains more secure.
  Our second result is an equivalence relation between crash fault tolerant
games and Byzantine fault tolerant games, which raises an interesting research
question on the power of baiting to solve consensus. To this end, we show, on
the one hand, that a $(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol becomes $(k+t,t)$-robust
in the crash model. We show, on the other hand, that the existence of a
$(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol in the crash model that does not make use of
a baiting strategy implies the existence of a $(k-t,t)$-robust consensus
protocol in the Byzantine model, with the help of cryptography.

electrons only inside fluorinated graphene areas. The two characteristics are
further verified by the real-space distributions of normalized probability

clients aggregate all their submodels and finish the iteration. Inevitably, FSL
introduces two privacy-preserving computation tasks, i.e., Private Submodel
Retrieval (PSR) and Secure Submodel Aggregation (SSA). Existing work fails to
provide a loss-less scheme, or has impractical efficiency. In this work, we
leverage Distributed Point Function (DPF) and cuckoo hashing to construct a
practical and light-weight secure FSL scheme in the two-server setting. More
specifically, we propose two basic protocols with few optimisation techniques,
which ensures our protocol practicality on specific real-world FSL tasks. Our
experiments show that our proposed protocols can finish in less than 1 minute
when weight sizes $\leq 2^{15}$, we also demonstrate protocol efficiency by
comparing with existing work and by handling a real-world FSL task.

electrode of supercapacitors and microbial fuel cells. In addition, the same

mesopores and micropores displaying BETs of 1558 m2/g and 1879 m2/g,

was built displaying specific energy specific power up to 10 Wh/kg and 6.9
kW/kg, respectively. Durability tests showed that the device was able to
maintain a capacitance retention of 84.5% after 15,000 charge-discharge cycles.
The lignin-derived carbons were also studied as electrocatalysts for ORR in a
neutral medium. The LAC-2 showed higher ORR electrocatalytic activity than
LAC-0.5. The interconnected porous network and the high surface area made the
lignin-derived porous carbons suitable electrode materials for dual

emphasized that the uniform estimate on

global regularity of the solution. To do that, the double exponential growth in

applied. This is different from the proof of global well-posedness of the Euler
velocity equations in the Sobolev spaces, in which a Kato-type or

non-linear convective transport of a chemical solute produced at their surface
by the Marangoni and/or phoretic flows generated by this solute's inhomogeneous
distribution, provided the ratio of convective-to-diffusive solute transport,
or P\'eclet number $\mbox{Pe}$ is large enough. As the result of their net
buoyancy, active drops typically evolve at a small finite distance $d$ from
rigid boundaries. Yet, existing models systematically focus on unbounded flows,
ignoring the effect of the wall proximity on the intrisically-nonlinear nature
of their propulsion mechanism. In contrast, we obtain here a critical insight
on the propulsion of active drops near walls by analysing their stability to
non-axisymmetric perturbations and the resulting emergence of self-propulsion
along the wall with no limiting assumption on the wall-distance $d$. Dipolar or
quadrupolar axisymmetric (levitating) base states are identified depending on
$d$ and $\mbox{Pe}$. Perhaps counter-intuitively, a reduction in the drop-wall
separation $d$ is observed to destabilize these modes and to promote
self-propulsion, as a result from the confinement-induced localisation of the
chemical gradients driving the motion. In addition, quadrupolar states are more
unstable than their dipolar counterparts due to the redistribution of the
chemical perturbation by the base flow, favouring the emergence of stronger
slip forcing on the drop surface.

symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality
relation. In quantum physics, orthosets play a central role. In fact, a Hilbert
space gives rise to an orthoset in a canonical way and can be reconstructed
from it.
  A complex Hilbert space can be seen as a real Hilbert space endowed with a
complex structure. This fact motivates us to explore characteristic features of
real Hilbert spaces by means of the abelian groups of rotations of a plane.
Accordingly, we consider orthosets together with the groups of automorphisms
that keep the orthogonal complement of a given pair of distinct elements fixed.
We establish that, under a transitivity and a homogeneity assumption, an
orthoset arises from a projective (anisotropic) Hermitian space.
  To find conditions under which the latter's scalar division ring is $\mathbb
R$ is difficult in the present framework. However, restricting considerations
to divisible automorphisms, we can narrow down the possibilities to positive
definite quadratic spaces over an ordered field. The further requirement that
the action of these automorphisms is quasiprimitive implies that the scalar

Torsional modes of a shaft were excited without the aid of brackets and bending

Furthermore, the electromechanical impedance of the PZT-structure system was
measured from which the natural frequency and quality factor were directly

typically reflect the geometry of the spaces they are defined on, but designing
them is generally non-trivial. Recent work on the Riemannian Mat\'ern kernels,
based on stochastic partial differential equations and spectral theory of the

covering orientation control, manipulability optimization, and motion planning,

coordinate method (PGCM) was recently shown to be a suitable method to tackle

discusses the first realistic results of a novel multi-reference perturbation
theory (PGCM-PT) that can do so within a symmetry-conserving scheme for both
ground and low-lying excited states. First, proof-of-principle calculations in
a small ($e_{\mathrm{max}}=4$) model space demonstrate that exact binding
energies of closed- (\nucl{O}{16}) and open-shell (\nucl{O}{18}, \nucl{Ne}{20})
nuclei are reproduced within $0.5-1.5\%$ at second order, i.e. through
PGCM-PT(2). Moreover, profiting from the pre-processing of the Hamiltonian via
multi-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group transformations,
PGCM-PT(2) can reach converged values within smaller model spaces than with an
unevolved Hamiltonian. Doing so, dynamical correlations captured by PGCM-PT(2)
are shown to bring essential corrections to low-lying excitation energies that
become too dilated at leading order, i.e., at the strict PGCM level. The
present work is laying the foundations for a better understanding of the
optimal way to grasp static and dynamical correlations in a consistent fashion,
with the aim of accurately describing ground and excited states of complex
nuclei via ab initio many-body methods.

with negative cosmological constant. Here, the supersymmetry invariance of the
action requires the addition of topological (boundary) contributions which
generalize at the supersymmetric level the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. Moreover,
one finds that the boundary values of the super field-strengths are dynamically
fixed to constant values, corresponding to the vanishing of the
$\mathrm{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4)$-covariant supercurvatures at the boundary. We
then consider the case of vanishing cosmological constant where, in the
presence of a non-trivial boundary, the inclusion of boundary terms involving
additional fields, which behave as auxiliary fields for the bulk theory, allows
to restore supersymmetry. In all the cases listed above, the full,
supersymmetric Lagrangian can be recast in a MacDowell-Mansouri(-like) form. We
then report on the application of the results to specific problems regarding
cases where the boundary is located asymptotically, relevant for a holographic
analysis.

  turbulence",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the fluid-particle acceleration is intimately related
to the dissipation rate of turbulence, in line with the Kolmogorov assumptions.
On the other hand, various experimental and numerical works have reported as
well its dependence on the kinetic energy, which is generally attributed to
intermittency and non-independence of the small-scale dynamics from large-scale
ones. The analyses given in this paper focus on statistics of the
fluid-particle acceleration conditioned on both the local dissipation rate and
the kinetic energy. It is shown that this quantity presents an exponential
dependence on the kinetic energy with a growth rate independent of the Reynolds
number, in addition to the expected power law behavior with the dissipation
rate. The exponential growth, which clearly departs from the previous
propositions, reflects additional kinematic effects of the flow structures on
the acceleration. Regarding intermittency, to account for the persistence of
the effect of the large-scales on the dissipation rate, it is further proposed
scaling laws for the Reynolds number dependence of the conditional and
unconditional acceleration variance using Barenblatt's incomplete similarity
framework. It is then shown that both these intermittency and kinematic effects
can be combined in a multiplicative cascade process for the acceleration
depending on the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate. On the basis of these
observations, we introduce a vectorial stochastic model for the dynamics of a
tracer in turbulent flows. This model incorporates a fractional log-normal
process for the dissipation rate recently proposed, as well as an additional
hypothesis regarding non-diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor which naturally
leads to the decomposition between tangential and centripetal acceleration.
This model is shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations
and presents the essential characteristics of the Lagrangian turbulence
highlighted in recent years, namely (i) non-Gaussian acceleration, (ii) scale
separation between the norm of the acceleration and its components, (iii)
anomalous scaling law for the Lagrangian velocity spectra, and (iv) negative
skewness of the increments of the mechanical power, reflecting the temporal
irreversibility of the dynamics.

ice line of protoplanetary discs. There, dust coagulation is more efficient and
re-condensation of vapor on pebbles may enhance their growth outside the ice
line. Previous theoretical studies showed that disruption of icy pebbles due to
sublimation increases the growth rate of pebbles inside and outside the ice
line, by freeing small silicate particles back in the dust reservoir of the
disc. However, since planet accretion is dependent on the Stokes number of the
accreting pebbles, the growth of planetesimals could be enhanced downstream of
the ice line if pebbles are not disrupting upon sublimation. We developed two
experimental models of icy pebbles using different silicate dusts, and we
exposed them to low-temperature and low-pressure conditions in a vacuum
chamber. Increasing the temperature inside the chamber, we studied the
conditions for which pebbles are preserved through sublimation without
disrupting. We find that small silicate particles ($<50$um) and a small
quantity of ice (around $15$% pebble mass) are optimal conditions for
preserving pebbles through sublimation. Furthermore, pebbles with coarse dust
distribution ($100-300$um) do not disrupt if a small percentage ($10-20$% mass)
of dust grains are smaller than $50$um. Our findings highlight how sublimation
is not necessarily causing disruption, and that pebbles seem to survive fast
sublimation processes effectively.

actions that break the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field. To
break the conformal invariance, the electromagnetic fields are coupled either
to the inflaton or to the scalar curvature. Also, a parity violating term is
often added to the action in order to enhance the amplitudes of the primordial
electromagnetic fields. In this work, we examine the effects of deviations from
slow roll inflation on the spectra of non-helical as well as helical
electromagnetic fields. We find that, in the case of the coupling to the scalar
curvature, there arise certain challenges in generating electromagnetic fields
of the desired shapes and strengths even in slow roll inflation. When the field
is coupled to the inflaton, it is possible to construct model-dependent
coupling functions which lead to nearly scale invariant magnetic fields in slow
roll inflation. However, we show that sharp features in the scalar power
spectrum generated due to departures from slow roll inflation inevitably lead
to strong features in the power spectra of the electromagnetic fields.
Moreover, we find that such effects can also considerably suppress the
strengths of the generated electromagnetic fields over the scales of
cosmological interest. We illustrate these aspects with the aid of specific
inflationary models that have been considered to produce specific features in
the scalar power spectrum. Further, we find that, in such situations, if the
strong features in the electromagnetic power spectra are to be undone, the
choice of the coupling function requires considerable fine tuning. We discuss
wider implications of the results we obtain.

physics using macroscopic quantum superpositions. It has been proposed to
perform such tests in a dedicated space mission (MAQRO) using matter-wave
interferometry with massive test particles or monitoring how the wave function
of a test particle expands over time. Such experiments could, test quantum
physics with sufficiently high precision to resolve potential deviations from
its unitary evolution due to gravitational decoherence. For example, such
deviations have been predicted by the Di\'{o}si-Penrose (DP) model and the
K\'{a}rolyh\'{a}zy (K) model. The former predicts the collapse of massive or
large superpositions due to a non-linear modification of quantum evolution. The
latter predicts decoherence because of an underlying uncertainty of space time.
Potential advantages of a space environment are (1) long free-fall times, (2)
low noise, and (3) taking a high number of data points over several years in a
dedicated space mission. In contrast to interferometric tests, monitoring wave
function expansion is less complex, but it does face some practical
limitations. Here, we will discuss limitations of such non-interferometric
experiments due to the limited number of data points achievable during a
mission lifetime. Our results show that it will require an interferometric

pandemic in 2020, is predominantly transmitted via airborne aerosols in indoor
environments. This calls for novel strategies when assessing and controlling a
building's indoor air quality (IAQ). IAQ can generally be controlled by
ventilation and/or policies to regulate human-building-interaction. However, in
a building, occupants use rooms in different ways, and it may not be obvious
which measure or combination of measures leads to a cost- and energy-effective
solution ensuring good IAQ across the entire building. Therefore, in this
article, we introduce a novel agent-based simulator, ArchABM, designed to
assist in creating new or adapt existing buildings by estimating adequate room
sizes, ventilation parameters and testing the effect of policies while taking
into account IAQ as a result of complex human-building interaction patterns. A
recently published aerosol model was adapted to calculate time-dependent carbon
dioxide ($CO_2$) and virus quanta concentrations in each room and inhaled
$CO_2$ and virus quanta for each occupant over a day as a measure of
physiological response. ArchABM is flexible regarding the aerosol model and the
building layout due to its modular architecture, which allows implementing
further models, any number and size of rooms, agents, and actions reflecting
human-building interaction patterns. We present a use case based on a real
floor plan and working schedules adopted in our research center. This study
demonstrates how advanced simulation tools can contribute to improving IAQ

intermediate mass black holes. With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an
automated classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable.Aims.
This work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray sources
in the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs into four classes -- AGN, stars, X-ray
binaries (XRBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -- based on their spatial,
spectral and timing properties and their multiwavelength counterparts. An
outlier measure is used to identify objects of other natures. The classifier is
optimized to maximize the classification performance of a chosen class (here
XRBs) and it is adapted to data mining purposes.Methods. We augmented the X-ray
catalogs with multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties.
We then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known nature.
From this sample the distribution of each property was carefully estimated and
taken as reference to assign probabilities of belonging to each class. The
classification was then performed on the whole catalog, combining the
information from each property.Results. Using the algorithm on the Swift
reference sample we retrieved 99%, 98%, 92% and 34% of AGN, stars, XRBs, and
CVs, respectively, and the false positive rates are 3%, 1%, 9% and 15%. Similar
results are obtained on XMM sources. When applied to a carefully selected test
sample, representing 55% of the X-ray catalog, the classification gives
consistent results in terms of distributions of source properties. A
substantial fraction of sources not belonging to any class is efficiently
retrieved using the outlier measure, as well as AGN and stars with properties
deviating from the bulk of their class. Our algorithm is then compared to a
random forest method; the two showed similar performances but the algorithm
presented in this paper improved insight into the grounds of each
classification.Conclusions. This robust classification method can be tailored
to include additional or different source classes and can be applied to other
X-ray catalogs. The transparency of the classification compared to other
methods makes it a useful tool in the search for homogeneous populations or
rare source types, including multi-messenger events. Such a tool will be
increasingly valuable with the development of surveys of unprecedented size,
such as LSST, SKA and Athena, and the search for counterparts of
multi-messenger events.

context of cosmological studies. Indeed this quantity allows to constrain the
universal baryon fraction $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$, as well as other parameters like
the matter density $\Omega_m$, the Hubble parameter $h$ or the Equation of
State of Dark Energy $w$. This gas mass fraction is also sensitive to baryonic
effects that need to be taken into account, and that translate into nuisance
parameters. Two of them are the depletion factor $\Upsilon$, and the
hydrostatic mass bias $B = (1 - b)$. The first one describes how baryons are
depleted in clusters with respect to the universal baryon fraction, while the
other encodes the bias coming from the fact that the mass is deduced from X-ray
observations under the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium. We will show
preliminary results, obtained using the {\it Planck}-ESZ clusters observed by
XMM-{\it Newton}, on both cosmological and cluster parameters. We will notably
discuss the investigation on a possible redshift dependence of the mass bias,
which is considered to be non-existent in hydrodynamic simulations based on
$\Lambda$-CDM, and compare our results with other studies.

computing systems. As applications produce more and more data, I/O becomes the
limiting factor for increasing application performance. I/O congestion caused
by concurrent access to storage devices is one of the main obstacles that cause
I/O performance degradation and, consequently, total performance degradation.
  Although task-based programming models made it possible to achieve higher
levels of parallelism by enabling the execution of tasks in large-scale
distributed platforms, this parallelism only benefited the compute workload of
the application. Previous efforts addressing I/O performance bottlenecks either
focused on optimizing fine-grained I/O access patterns using I/O libraries or
avoiding system-wide I/O congestion by minimizing interference between multiple
applications.
  In this paper, we propose enabling I/O Awareness in task-based programming
models for improving the total performance of applications. An I/O aware
programming model is able to create more parallelism and mitigate the causes of
I/O performance degradation. On the one hand, more parallelism can be created
by supporting special tasks for executing I/O workloads, called I/O tasks, that
can overlap with the execution of compute tasks. On the other hand, I/O
congestion can be mitigated by constraining I/O tasks scheduling. We propose
two approaches for specifying such constraints: explicitly set by the users or
automatically inferred and tuned during application's execution to optimize the
execution of variable I/O workloads on a certain storage infrastructure.
  Our experiments on the MareNostrum 4 Supercomputer demonstrate that using I/O
aware programming model can achieve up to 43% total performance improvement as

represented by temporal (or evolving) networks, where links activate or
deactivate over time. Characterizing temporal networks is crucial to compare
such systems and to study the dynamical processes unfolding on them. A
systematic method to characterize simultaneously the temporal and topological
relations of active links (also called contacts or events), in order to compare
different real-world networks and to detect their common patterns or
differences is still missing. In this paper, we propose a method to
characterize to what extent contacts that happen close in time occur also close
in topology. Specifically, we study the interrelation between temporal and
topological properties of contacts from three perspectives: (1) the
autocorrelation of the time series recording the total number of contacts
happened at each time step in a network; (2) the interplay between the
topological distance and interevent time of two contacts; (3) the temporal
correlation of contacts within local neighborhoods beyond a node pair. By
applying our method on 13 real-world temporal networks, we found that
temporal-topological correlation of contacts is more evident in virtual contact
networks than in physical contact ones. This could be due to the lower cost and
easier access of online communications than physical interactions, allowing and
possibly facilitating social contagion, i.e., interactions of one individual
may influence the activity of its neighbors. We also identify different
patterns between virtual and physical networks and among physical contact
networks at, e.g., school and workplace, in the formation of correlation in
local neighborhoods. Detected patterns and differences may further inspire the
development of more realistic temporal network models, that could reproduce
jointly temporal and topological properties of contacts.

can be delivered by chiral magnonic resonators - soft magnetic elements
chirally coupled, via magneto-dipole interaction, to magnonic media nearby.
Starting from the basic principles of chiral coupling, we outline how they
could be used to construct devices and explore underpinning physics, ranging
from basic logic gates to field programmable gate arrays, in-memory computing,
and artificial neural networks, and extending from one- to two- and
three-dimensional architectures.

Unfortunately, placing the camera behind the screen results in significant

an image-restoration pipeline that is ISP-agnostic, i.e. it can be combined
with any legacy ISP to produce a final image that matches the appearance of
regular cameras using the same ISP. This is achieved with a deep learning
approach that performs a RAW-to-RAW image restoration. To obtain large
quantities of real under-display camera training data with sufficient contrast

restores color and contrast as well as image detail.

typically characterized by relatively frequent mild events and also by rare and
much more destructive major explosions and paroxysms. Detailed analyses of past
major and minor events can help to understand the eruptive behavior of the
volcano and the underlying physical and chemical processes. Catalogs of
volcanic eruptions may be established using continuous seismic recordings at
stations in the proximity of volcanoes. However, in many cases, the analysis of
the recordings relies heavily on the manual picking of events by human experts.
Recently developed Machine Learning-based approaches require large training
data sets which may not be available a priori. Here, we propose an alternative
automated approach: the Adaptive-Window Volcanic Event Selection Analysis
Module (AWESAM). This process of creating event catalogs consists of three main
steps: (i) identification of potential volcanic events based on squared
ground-velocity amplitudes, an adaptive MaxFilter, and a prominence threshold.
(ii) catalog consolidation by comparing and verification of the initial
detections based on recordings from two different seismic stations. (iii)
identification and exclusion of signals from regional tectonic earthquakes. The
software package is applied to publicly accessible continuous seismic
recordings from two almost equidistant stations at Stromboli volcano in Italy.
We tested AWESAM by comparison with a hand-picked catalog and found that around
95 percent of the eruptions with a signal-to-noise ratio above three are
detected. In a first application, we derive a new amplitude-frequency
relationship from over 290.000 volcanic events at Stromboli during 2019-2020.
The module allows for a straightforward generalization and application to other
volcanoes worldwide.

may leave the network during training and need to connect to a different edge
server. This is challenging because the offloaded computations from edge server

large number of different processes. Some of these processes might also cause
vertical heating and flaring. Using a sample of galaxies simulated in their
cosmological context, we study the connection between warping and disc heating.
We analyse the vertical stellar density structure within warped stellar discs,
and monitor the evolution of the scale-heights of the mono-age populations and
the geometrical thin and thick disc during the warp's lifetime. We also compare
the overall thickness and the vertical velocity dispersion in the disc before
and after the warp. We find that for warps made of pre-existing stellar
particles shifted off-plane, the scale-heights do not change within the disc's
warped region: discs tilt rigidly. For warps made of off-plane new stellar
material (either born in-situ or accreted), the warped region of the disc is
not well described by a double $\mathrm{sech^2}$ density profile. Yet, once the
warp is gone, the thin and thick disc structure is recovered, with their
scale-heights following the same trends as in the region that was never warped.
Finally, we find that the overall thickness and vertical velocity dispersion do
not increase during a warp, regardless of the warp's origin. This holds even
for warps triggered by interactions with satellites, which cause disc heating
but before the warp forms. Our findings suggest that the vertical structure of
galaxies does not hold any memory of past warps.

imperceptibility of attacks, which is also essential for practical attackers,
is often left out by previous studies. In consequence, the crafted AEs tend to
have obvious structural and semantic differences from the original

leveraging multi-objectivization to address such issue. Specifically, we
formulate the problem of crafting AEs as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the imperceptibility of attacks is considered as auxiliary
objectives. Then, we propose a simple yet effective evolutionary algorithm,
dubbed HydraText, to solve this problem. To the best of our knowledge,
HydraText is currently the only approach that can be effectively applied to
both score-based and decision-based attack settings. Exhaustive experiments
involving 44237 instances demonstrate that HydraText consistently achieves
competitive attack success rates and better attack imperceptibility than the
recently proposed attack approaches. A human evaluation study also shows that
the AEs crafted by HydraText are more indistinguishable from human-written
texts. Finally, these AEs exhibit good transferability and can bring notable
robustness improvement to the target model by adversarial training.

proposed an open-source physical channel simulator for sub-6 GHz bands where
operating frequency, propagation environment, terminal locations, RIS location
and size can be adjusted. It is demonstrated via extensive computer simulations
that an improved achievable rate performance is obtained in the presence of
RISs for both near-field and far-field conditions.

doublet lines is also correlated with H$\alpha$ activity. We usually find
positive correlation for stars with H$\alpha$ in emission, while early-type M
stars with H$\alpha$ in absorption show anti-correlation. During flares, the
optical doublet lines can exhibit strong fill-in or emission cores for our

This places VCC 615 on the far side of the Virgo Cluster ($d_{\rm Virgo} = 16.5
Mpc$), at a Virgocentric distance of 1.3 Mpc and near the virial radius of the
main body of Virgo. Coupling this distance with the galaxy's observed radial
velocity, we find that VCC 615 is on an outbound trajectory, having survived a
recent passage through the inner parts of the cluster. Indeed, our orbit
modeling gives a 50% chance the galaxy passed inside the Virgo core (r<620 kpc)
within the past Gyr, although very close passages directly through the cluster
center (r<200 kpc) are unlikely. Given VCC 615's undisturbed morphology, we
argue that the galaxy has experienced no recent and sudden transformation into
a UDG due to the cluster potential, but rather is a long-lived UDG whose
relatively wide orbit and large dynamical mass protect it from stripping and
destruction by Virgo cluster tides. Finally, we also describe the serendipitous
discovery of a nearby Virgo dwarf galaxy projected 90 arcseconds (7.2 kpc) away

but neither absolute nor genuine multipartite entanglement is required. Unlike
the previous schemes, which can transmit either even or odd bits of

genuine multipartite entangled GHZ state to send arbitrary information bits.
Expressed in the eigenbasis of different Pauli operators, GHZ state is
characterized by a unique parity pattern which enables us to formulate a
security checking technique to ensure absolute security of the protocol. We
show this method to be equally applicable in a scenario, where the resource
information is distributed among spatially separated parties. Finally,
optimizing the number of qubit(s) sent to Bob, we construct a distributed dense

In contrast, our approach, called MultiplexNet, represents domain knowledge as
a logical formula in disjunctive normal form (DNF) which is easy to encode and
to elicit from human experts. It introduces a Categorical latent variable that
learns to choose which constraint term optimizes the error function of the
network and it compiles the constraints directly into the output of existing
learning algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach empirically
on several classical deep learning tasks, such as density estimation and
classification in both supervised and unsupervised settings where prior
knowledge about the domains was expressed as logical constraints. Our results
show that the MultiplexNet approach learned to approximate unknown
distributions well, often requiring fewer data samples than the alternative
approaches. In some cases, MultiplexNet finds better solutions than the
baselines; or solutions that could not be achieved with the alternative
approaches. Our contribution is in encoding domain knowledge in a way that
facilitates inference that is shown to be both efficient and general; and
critically, our approach guarantees 100% constraint satisfaction in a network's

Lyapunov exponents (or inverse of localization lengths) for systems with purely

density matrix of photons resulting from the Wigner distribution formalism. The
formalism is used to calculate different distributions of the invariant mass,
dilepton transverse momentum and acoplanarity for different regions of

quantum particles in contact with a heat reservoir include the factor $1\mp

$\bar{n}_i$ is the average occupation number of the final state. It is shown
that this factor can be related to the difference of the chemical potential
from that of an ideal classical mixture; this difference is formally equivalent
to the excess chemical potential in a classical system of interacting
particles. Using this analogy, Widom's insertion formula is used in the

quantum statistics from the condition that transition rates depend only on the

a moderate band gap in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. By mechanical exfoliation, we successfully
obtain monolayers of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and confirm that they are stable under

Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ have a magnetic ground state, thus providing opportunities to

generalization ability of model-based agents in comparison to their model-free
counterparts. We focus our analysis on MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), a
powerful model-based agent, and evaluate its performance on both procedural and
task generalization. We identify three factors of procedural generalization --
planning, self-supervised representation learning, and procedural data
diversity -- and show that by combining these techniques, we achieve
state-of-the art generalization performance and data efficiency on Procgen
(Cobbe et al., 2019). However, we find that these factors do not always provide
the same benefits for the task generalization benchmarks in Meta-World (Yu et
al., 2019), indicating that transfer remains a challenge and may require
different approaches than procedural generalization. Overall, we suggest that
building generalizable agents requires moving beyond the single-task,
model-free paradigm and towards self-supervised model-based agents that are

automated driving system, especially in cluttered urban environments. However,
it is highly challenging due to the complex road topology as well as the
uncertain intentions of the other agents. In this paper, we present a
graph-based trajectory prediction network named the Dual Scale Predictor (DSP),
which encodes both the static and dynamical driving context in a hierarchical
manner. Different from methods based on a rasterized map or sparse lane graph,
we consider the driving context as a graph with two layers, focusing on both
geometrical and topological features. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are applied
to extract features with different levels of granularity, and features are
subsequently aggregated with attention-based inter-layer networks, realizing
better local-global feature fusion. Following the recent goal-driven trajectory
prediction pipeline, goal candidates with high likelihood for the target agent
are extracted, and predicted trajectories are generated conditioned on these
goals. Thanks to the proposed dual-scale context fusion network, our DSP is
able to generate accurate and human-like multi-modal trajectories. We evaluate
the proposed method on the large-scale Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark,
and it achieves promising results, outperforming the recent state-of-the-art
methods.

designing a special window called tight window is important because it is known

  Systems: It Works!","42 pages",,,,"cs.PF math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mean field approximation is a powerful technique to study the performance of
large stochastic systems represented as $n$ interacting objects. Applications
include load balancing models, epidemic spreading, cache replacement policies,
or large-scale data centers. Mean field approximation is asymptotically exact
for systems composed of $n$ homogeneous objects under mild conditions. In this
paper, we study what happens when objects are heterogeneous. This can represent
servers with different speeds or contents with different popularities. We
define an interaction model that allows obtaining asymptotic convergence
results for stochastic systems with heterogeneous object behavior, and show
that the error of the mean field approximation is of order $O(1/n)$. More
importantly, we show how to adapt the refined mean field approximation,
developed by Gast et al. 2019, and show that the error of this approximation is
reduced to $O(1/n^2)$. To illustrate the applicability of our result, we
present two examples. The first addresses a list-based cache replacement model
RANDOM($m$), which is an extension of the RANDOM policy. The second is a
heterogeneous supermarket model. These examples show that the proposed
approximations are computationally tractable and very accurate. They also show
that for moderate system sizes ($n\approx30$) the refined mean field
approximation tends to be more accurate than simulations for any reasonable

scalar field impinges on a charged dilatonic black hole. First, we review the
classical analysis to obtain the deflection angle and the differential
scattering cross-section. Then, using the partial wave method, we determine the
total absorption cross-section numerically in terms of the decoupling parameter
called $M\omega$, finding that the amplitude of the dilatonic black hole is
lower than the Reissner-Nordstr\""om one for mild frequencies. In the
high-frequency limit, the absorption cross-section exhibits two different
complex behaviors; the fine structure and the hyperfine structure. For the
differential scattering cross-section, smaller values of $M\omega$ lead to more
significant amplitudes; the opposite scenario is obtained by increasing the
charge-to-mass ratio. To fully grasp the main properties of the charged
dilatonic black hole, we consider a different framework where the compact
object is impinged by a charged massive scalar field. The superradiant effect
is lessened for intermediate frequency concerning the Reissner-Nordstr\""om
case. However, this effect does not necessarily imply the existence of any
dynamical instability. In order to trigger the superradiant instability,
unstable modes must remain trapped outside the event horizon with a mechanism
based on the reflecting-mirror boundary conditions. In this way, a charged
scalar field plus a charged black hole configure a charged black hole bomb. We
provide an analytic formula (lower bound) for the values of the charge field,
which can trigger this superradiant instability. We extend this minimal setup
by considering the dilaton perturbations while freezing the other degree of
freedom. The new perturbation scheme enhances the superradiance scattering and
reduces the lower bound of the charge-to-mass ratio to develop a superradiant
instability.

Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPCII). The recently approved ten-year
extension of data acquisition for BESIII prompted an upgrade program for both
the BEPCII collider that houses the experiment and some of the sub-detectors
that make up the spectrometer. The current inner drift chamber is suffering
from aging and it has been proposed to replace it with a detector based on the
Cylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier (CGEM) technology.
  The CGEM Inner Tracker (CGEM-IT) consists of three coaxial layers of triple
GEM. The lightweight tracker is designed to recover efficiency and improve
z-determination and secondary vertex position reconstruction, resulting in a
better performance and longer lifetime. A novel system has been deeloped for
the readout of the CGEM detector, including a new ASIC, called TIGER (Torino
Integrated GEM Electronics for Readout), designed to amplify and digitize the
CGEM signals. The data output from TIGER are collected and processed by a first
FPGA-based module, GEM Read Out Card, which is responsible for configuring and
controlling the front-end ASICs. A second FPGA-based module, GEM Data
Concentrator (GEM DC), builds the event packets and transmits them to the
BESIII data acquisition system.
  In this thesis I will describe the entire custom electronics chain designed
for the CGEM-IT to achieve the desired performance.

carbon neutrality would require for the national energy system and the role of
the power sector concerning the availability of critical mitigation
technologies. Our scenario-based assessments show that Korea's current policy
falls short of what the nation's carbon-neutrality ambition would require.
Across all technology scenarios examined in this study, extensive and rapid
energy system transition is imperative, requiring the large-scale deployment of
renewables and carbon capture & storage (CCS) early on and negative emission
technologies (NETs) by the mid-century. Importantly, rapid decarbonization of
the power sector that goes with rapid electrification of end-uses seems to be a
robust national decarbonization strategy. Furthermore, we contextualize our
net-zero scenario results using policy costs, requirements for natural
resources, and the expansion rate of zero-carbon technologies. We find that the
availability of nuclear power lowers the required expansion rate of renewables
and CCS, alleviating any stress on terrestrial and geological systems. By
contrast, the limited availability of CCS without nuclear power necessarily
demands a very high penetration of renewables and significantly high policy
compliance costs, which would decrease the feasibility of achieving the carbon
neutrality target.

large burst sample to investigate astrometric accuracy, and find that for

milliarcsecond precision even using single-burst data sets. Sub-arcsecond
precision is still possible for single bursts, even when only $\sim$ six
baselines (four dishes) are available. We explore two methods for determining
the individual burst positions: the peaks of the dirty maps and a Gaussian fit
to the cross fringe pattern on the dirty maps. We found the latter to be more
reliable due to the lower mean and standard deviation in the offsets from the
FRB position. Our VLBI work places FRB 20201124A 705$\pm$26 mas (1-$\sigma$

with multiple ISPs. Each ISP commits to improving the Quality of Service (QoS)
for the end-users through higher investments efforts. The CP agrees to share
the profits due to the resulting higher demand for its content. We first model
non-cooperative interaction between the CP and the ISPs as a two-stage
Stackelberg game. CP is the leader that decides what fraction of its profits
will be shared with the ISPs. Each ISP then simultaneously decides the amount
of effort (investment) to enhance network quality. Here, CP cannot observe
individual effort by the ISPs, which poses a challenge for the CP to decide how
to share the profits with each ISP. Therefore, we also investigate a
cooperative scenario, where the CP only decides the total share it gives to the
ISPs, and each ISP then cooperatively shares the profit among themselves. We
study the effect of such cooperation between the ISPs by building a Nash
Bargaining based model. We show that the collaboration improves total effort by
the ISPs and the payoff of the CP.

observation would indicate baryon number violation that is required for
baryogenesis. Many decades of searching for proton decay have constrained its
rate and ruled out some of the simplest GUT models. Apart from the baryon
number-violating interactions, this rate also depends on transition amplitudes
between the proton and mesons or leptons produced in the decay, which are
matrix elements of three-quark operators. We report nonperturbative calculation
of these matrix elements for the most studied two-body decay channels into a
meson and antilepton done on a lattice with physical light and strange quark
masses and lattice spacings $a\approx0.14$ and 0.20 fm. We perform
nonperturbative renormalization and excited state analysis to control
associated systematic effects. Our results largely agree with previous lattice
calculations done with heavier quark masses and thus remove ambiguity in ruling
out some simple GUT theories due to quark mass dependence of hadron structure.

action, such as QCD at nonzero density. The formal justification relies on the
absence of certain boundary terms, both at infinity and at the unavoidable
poles of the drift force. Here I focus on the boundary terms at these poles for
simple models, which so far have not been discussed in detail. The main result
is that those boundary terms (for the ""un-evolved"" observables) arise after
running the Langevin process for a finite time and vanish again as the Langevin
time goes to infinity. This is in contrast to the boundary terms at infinity,
which can be found to occur in the long time limit (cf. the contribution by
D\'enes Sexty).

space reduced to a charge triplet of the three effective valence centers
[CuO$_4$]$^{7-,6-,5-}$ (nominally Cu$^{1+,2+,3+}$) with different conventional
spin, different orbital symmetry, and different local lattice configuration, we
develop a unified non-BCS spin-pseudospin model to describe the main phase
states of doped cuprates. We argue that antiferromagnetic insulating, charge
ordered, superconducting, and Fermi-liquid phases are possible phase states of
a model parent cuprate, while typical phase state of a doped cuprate, in
particular mysterious pseudogap phase, is a result of a phase separation.
Superconductivity of cuprates is not a consequence of pairing of doped holes,
but the result of quantum transport of on-site composite hole bosons, whereas
main peculiarities of normal state can be related to an electron-hole interplay
for unusual Fermi-liquid phase and features of the phase separation.
Puzzlingly, but it is the electron-lattice interaction, which in the BCS model
determines $s$-wave pairing, in the model of local composite bosons gives
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, thus showing
once again a substantial involvement of the lattice in the cuprate's HTSC.

observations of bright transients, and a review of the XMM-Newton and Chandra
cross-calibration. Results between \nustar\ and \swift\ overall show good
agreement, but issues persist in the overlap region 3--5 keV for bright source

spectrograph of the radio source 3C277.3, located at a redshift of 0.085 and
associated with the galaxy Coma A. An emission line region fully enshrouds the
double-lobed radio source, which is ~60 kpc x 90 kpc in size. Based on the
emission line ratios, we identified five compact knots in which the gas
ionization is powered by young stars located as far as ~60 kpc from the host.
The emission line filaments surrounding the radio emission are compatible with
ionization from fast shocks (with a velocity of 350-500 km/s), but a
contribution from star formation occurring at the edges of the radio source is
likely. Coma A might be a unique example in the local Universe in which the

and provide customized slices for supporting various use cases with
heterogeneous requirements. Online deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown
promising potential in solving network problems and eliminating the
simulation-to-reality discrepancy. Optimizing cross-domain resources with
online DRL is, however, challenging, as the random exploration of DRL violates
the service level agreement (SLA) of slices and resource constraints of
infrastructures. In this paper, we propose OnSlicing, an online end-to-end
network slicing system, to achieve minimal resource usage while satisfying
slices' SLA. OnSlicing allows individualized learning for each slice and
maintains its SLA by using a novel constraint-aware policy update method and
proactive baseline switching mechanism. OnSlicing complies with resource
constraints of infrastructures by using a unique design of action modification
in slices and parameter coordination in infrastructures. OnSlicing further
mitigates the poor performance of online learning during the early learning
stage by offline imitating a rule-based solution. Besides, we design four new
domain managers to enable dynamic resource configuration in radio access,
transport, core, and edge networks, respectively, at a timescale of subseconds.
We implement OnSlicing on an end-to-end slicing testbed designed based on
OpenAirInterface with both 4G LTE and 5G NR, OpenDayLight SDN platform, and
OpenAir-CN core network. The experimental results show that OnSlicing achieves
61.3% usage reduction as compared to the rule-based solution and maintains
nearly zero violation (0.06%) throughout the online learning phase. As online
learning is converged, OnSlicing reduces 12.5% usage without any violations as
compared to the state-of-the-art online DRL solution.

additional galaxies are needed. We present the first part of our

based on ground-layer adaptive optics-assisted Multi-Unit Spectroscopic

we provide a Gaussian parametrisation of the adaptive optics-assisted point

the stellar kinematics and constructed dynamical models. Using an axisymmetric
Schwarzschild technique, we measured an MBH of (3.6+2.7-2.4)\times 10^8 Msun at
3\sigma significance taking kinematical and dynamical systematics
(e.g.,radially-varying mass-to-light ratio) into account. We also added a dark
halo, but our data does not allow to constrain the dark matter fraction. Adding
dark matter with an abundance matching prior results in a 25 per cent more
massive black hole. Jeans anisotropic models return MBH of (4.6+2.5-2.7) \times
10^8 Msun and (8.6+0.8-0.8) \times 10^8 Msun at 3\sigma confidence for
spherical and cylindrical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid, respectively. In
a follow-up study, we will compare the stellar-based MBH with those from cold

structural and functional fatigue as a result of their high intrinsic

design strategy which simultaneously improves cyclic stability and maintains
the excellent magnetocaloric and elastocaloric properties. Our results reveal
that precipitation of a strongly Fe-enriched and In-depleted coherent secondary
gamma-phase at grain boundaries can ensure excellent mechanical stability by
hindering intergranular fracture during cyclic loading. In this way, a large
elastocaloric effect of -4.5 K was achieved for more than 16000 cycles without
structural or functional degradation, which corresponds to an increase of the
cyclic stability by more than three orders of magnitude as compared to
single-phase Ni-Mn-In-(Fe). In addition, we demonstrate that the large
magnetocaloric effect of single-phase Ni-Mn-In-(Fe) can be preserved in the
dual-phase material when the secondary gamma-phase is exclusively formed at
grain boundaries as the martensitic transformation within the Heusler matrix is
barely affected. This way, an adiabatic temperature change of -3 K and an
isothermal entropy change of 15 $Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$ was obtained in 2 T for
dual-phase Ni-Mn-In-Fe. We expect that this concept can be applied to other
single caloric and mutlicaloric materials, therewith paving the way for
solid-state caloric cooling applications.

Considering the correlation between different MR modalities, in this paper, we
propose a multi-modality segmentation network guided by a novel tri-attention
fusion. Our network includes N model-independent encoding paths with N image
sources, a tri-attention fusion block, a dual-attention fusion block, and a
decoding path. The model independent encoding paths can capture
modality-specific features from the N modalities. Considering that not all the
features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to
use dual attention based fusion to re-weight the features along the modality
and space paths, which can suppress less informative features and emphasize the
useful ones for each modality at different positions. Since there exists a
strong correlation between different modalities, based on the dual attention
fusion block, we propose a correlation attention module to form the
tri-attention fusion block. In the correlation attention module, a correlation
description block is first used to learn the correlation between modalities and
then a constraint based on the correlation is used to guide the network to
learn the latent correlated features which are more relevant for segmentation.
Finally, the obtained fused feature representation is projected by the decoder
to obtain the segmentation results. Our experiment results tested on BraTS 2018
dataset for brain tumor segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

on the properties of the omega one, that is the supremum of the possible game
values, of classes of open games; we moreover design the class of

result of this research is the characterization of open stone-placing games in

the omega one of any class of open stone-placing games is at most $\omega$. In

generation WiFi-7 is pitched as the front-runner for ULL applications. We
discuss a few candidate features of WiFi-7 and highlight its major pitfalls
with respect to ULL communication. Further, through a specific implementation
of WiFi-7 (vanilla WiFi-7) in our custom simulator, we demonstrate the impact
of one of the pitfalls - standard practice of using jitter buffer in
conjunction with frame aggregation - on TI communication. To circumvent this,
we propose Non-Buffered Scheme (NoBuS) - a simple MAC layer enhancement for
enabling TI applications on WiFi-7. NoBuS trades off packet loss for latency
enabling swift synchronization between the master and controlled domains. Our
findings reveal that employing NoBuS yields a significant improvement in RMSE
of TI signals. Further, we show that the worst-case WiFi latency with NoBuS is
3.72 ms - an order of magnitude lower than vanilla WiFi-7 even under highly
congested network conditions.

Gibbs-based transfer learning algorithms by focusing on two popular transfer
learning approaches, $\alpha$-weighted-ERM and two-stage-ERM. Our key result is
an exact characterization of the generalization behaviour using the conditional
symmetrized KL information between the output hypothesis and the target
training samples given the source samples. Our results can also be applied to
provide novel distribution-free generalization error upper bounds on these two
aforementioned Gibbs algorithms. Our approach is versatile, as it also
characterizes the generalization errors and excess risks of these two Gibbs
algorithms in the asymptotic regime, where they converge to the
$\alpha$-weighted-ERM and two-stage-ERM, respectively. Based on our theoretical
results, we show that the benefits of transfer learning can be viewed as a
bias-variance trade-off, with the bias induced by the source distribution and
the variance induced by the lack of target samples. We believe this viewpoint
can guide the choice of transfer learning algorithms in practice.

pulse analysis of radio observations from the Lovell and MkII telescopes at
1564 MHz and the Effelsberg telescope at 6 GHz has resulted in the detection of
a total of 91 giant pulses (GPs) between MJDs 58858 and 59117. These GPs appear
to be confined to two specific phase ranges (0.473 <= \phi <= 0.502$ and 0.541
<= \phi <= 0.567). We also observe that the first detection of GP emission
corresponds to a minimum in the spin-down rate. Simultaneous radio and X-ray
observations were performed on MJDs 59009 and 59096. The 0.5-10 keV X-ray
spectrum from NICER is well characterised by a two component blackbody model
that can be interpreted as two hot spots on the polar cap of the neutron star.
The blackbody temperature decreases with time, consistent with the previous
outburst, while the change in the pulsed fraction does not follow the same
trend as was seen in the previous outburst. The radio and X-ray flux of XTE
J1810-197 are correlated during the initial phase of the outburst (MJD 58450 -
MJD 58550) and an increase in the radio flux is observed later that may be
correlated to the onset of GPs. We argue that the disparity in the evolution of
the current outburst compared to the previous one can be attributed to a change
in geometry of the neutron star.

our attention on uni-polar (p-i-p) systems. The calculations employ our
recently established multi-scale simulation framework that connects atomistic

alloy fluctuations, we pay special attention to the impact of quantum
corrections on hole transport. Our calculations indicate that results from a
virtual crystal approximation present an upper limit for the hole transport in
a p-i-p structure in terms of the current-voltage characteristics. Thus we find
that alloy fluctuations can have a detrimental effect on hole transport in
(In,Ga)N quantum well systems, in contrast to uni-polar electron transport.
However, our studies also reveal that the magnitude by which the random alloy
results deviate from virtual crystal approximation data depends on several
factors, e.g. how quantum corrections are treated in the transport
calculations.

individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA), is the misclassification of
binary variables. Misclassification may lead to biased estimates of model
parameters, even when the misclassification is entirely random. We aimed to
develop statistical methods that facilitate unbiased estimation of adjusted and
unadjusted exposure-outcome associations and between-study heterogeneity in
IPD-MA, where the extent and nature of exposure misclassification may vary
across studies.
  We present Bayesian methods that allow misclassification of binary exposure
variables to depend on study- and participant-level characteristics. In an
example of the differential diagnosis of dengue using two variables, where the
gold standard measurement for the exposure variable was unavailable for some
studies which only measured a surrogate prone to misclassification, our methods
yielded more accurate estimates than analyses naive with regard to
misclassification or based on gold standard measurements alone. In a simulation
study, the evaluated misclassification model yielded valid estimates of the
exposure-outcome association, and was more accurate than analyses restricted to
gold standard measurements.
  Our proposed framework can appropriately account for the presence of binary
exposure misclassification in IPD-MA. It requires that some studies supply IPD
for the surrogate and gold standard exposure and misclassification is
exchangeable across studies conditional on observed covariates (and outcome).
The proposed methods are most beneficial when few large studies that measured
the gold standard are available, and when misclassification is frequent.

separated states which are bounded by the third-order phase transition line
$T^{\star}(n)$, which is believed to be responsible for the onset of the
pseudogap phenomenon. With a certain choice of the Hamiltonian parameters the
model phase diagrams can quite reasonably reproduce the main features of
experimental phase diagrams for T- and T$^{\prime}$-cuprates and novel
nickelates. The superconducting phase of cuprates/nickelates is determined by
the on-site composite boson transport, it is not a consequence of pairing of
doped holes/electrons, but represents one of the possible phase states of
parent systems.

automation of the wise men puzzle, can be realized.
  Key to the presented semantical embedding is that evaluation domains are
modeled explicitly and treated as an additional parameter in the encodings of
the constituents of the embedded target logic; in previous related works, e.g.
on the embedding of normal modal logics, evaluation domains were implicitly
shared between meta-logic and target logic.

the Prandtl number ($Pr$) of 0.71, and the aspect ratio ($\Gamma$) of the

vortices interaction. Further investigation on the vorticity production and
transport reveals that, in the RB convection, in addition to the vorticity
production due to wall shear stress, buoyancy produces significant vorticity in
the bulk region. The produced vorticity is transported via advection and
diffusion. An interesting finding is that the main vortices and the corner
vortices can be visualized via the contour of buoyancy-produced vorticity.
Although a vigorous definition of the vortex is still lacking in the community,
our efficient vortex visualization approach in the RB convection may shed light
on further research toward vortex identification. We also found that the
spatial distribution of vorticity flux along the wall is positively correlated
with that of the Nusselt number ($Nu$), suggesting the amount of vorticity that
enters the flow is directly related to the amount of thermal energy that enters
the flow.

thus contaminate the advantage brought by accurate data density estimation. To
eliminate the requirement of saving separate models for different target

generative model and compresses the data batches while adapting the model with
a dynamical system for only one epoch. We formalise this setting as that of
One-Shot Online Adaptation (OSOA) of DGMs for lossless compression and propose
a vanilla algorithm under this setting. Experimental results show that vanilla
OSOA can save significant time versus training bespoke models and space versus
using one model for all targets. With the same adaptation step number or
adaptation time, it is shown vanilla OSOA can exhibit better space efficiency,
e.g., $47\%$ less space, than fine-tuning the pretrained model and saving the
fine-tuned model. Moreover, we showcase the potential of OSOA and motivate more
sophisticated OSOA algorithms by showing further space or time efficiency with
multiple updates per batch and early stopping.

Such models have recently been studied in the passage to the continuum by means

determine thresholds of the boundary condition, which mark a transition from
purely elastic behaviour to the occurrence of a crack. In this article we
provide a notion of fracture in the discrete setting and show that its
continuum limit yields the same threshold as that obtained from the
$\Gamma$-limit. Since the calculation of the fracture threshold is much easier
with the new method, we see a good chance that this new approach will turn out
useful in applications.

the law of a reference branching Brownian motion under density constraints at
an initial and final time. We call this problem the branching Schr\""odinger
problem by analogy with the Schr\""odinger problem, where the reference process
is a Brownian motion. Whereas the Schr\""odinger problem is related to
regularized (a.k.a. entropic) optimal transport, we investigate here the link
of the branching Schr\""odinger problem with regularized unbalanced optimal
transport.
  This link is shown at two levels. First, relying on duality arguments, the
values of these two problems of calculus of variations are linked, in the sense
that the value of the regularized unbalanced optimal transport (seen as a
function of the initial and final measure) is the lower semi-continuous
relaxation of the value of the branching Schr\""odinger problem. Second, we also
explicit a correspondence between the competitors of these two problems, and to
that end we provide a fine description of laws having a finite entropy with
respect to a reference branching Brownian motion.
  We investigate the small noise limit, when the noise intensity of the
branching Brownian motion goes to $0$: in this case we show, at the level of
the optimal transport model, that there is convergence to partial optimal
transport. We also provide formal arguments about why looking at the branching
Brownian motion, and not at other measure-valued branching Markov processes,
like superprocesses, yields the problem closest to optimal transport. Finally,
we explain how this problem can be solved numerically: the dynamical
formulation of regularized unbalanced optimal transport can be discretized and
solved via convex optimization.

generally applicable for long-chain flexible polymers that form viscoelastic

viscoelastic characteristics. They do, however, demonstrate larger viscosities
and a noticeable shear-thinning trend, well approximated by generalized
Newtonian models. The following experimental investigation scrutinized the flow
statistics of an aqueous xanthan gum solution in a turbulent channel flow, with
friction Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\tau}$) between 160 and 680. The amount of DR
varied insignificantly between 28% and 33%. The velocity field was measured
using planar particle image velocimetry and the steady shear rheology was
measured using a torsional rheometer. The results were used to characterize the
flow statistics of the polymer drag-reduced flows at different $Re_{\tau}$ and
with negligible changes in DR; a parametric study only previously considered by
numerical simulations. Changes to the mean velocity and Reynolds stress
profiles with increasing $Re_{\tau}$ were similar to the modifications observed
in Newtonian turbulence. Specifically, the inner-normalized mean velocity
profiles overlapped for different $Re_{\tau}$ and the Reynolds stresses
monotonically grew in magnitude with increasing $Re_{\tau}$. Profiles of mean
viscosity with respect to the wall-normal position demonstrated a thin layer
that consists of a low-viscosity fluid in the immediate vicinity of the wall.
Fluid outside of this thin layer had a significantly larger viscosity. We
surmise that the demarcation in the shear viscosity between the inner
""lubricating"" layer and the outer layer cultivates fluid slippage in the buffer
layer and an upward shift in the logarithmic layer; a hypothesis akin to DR
using wall lubrication and superhydrophobic surfaces.

Ach\'ucarro and P. K. Townsend and also by E. Witten, a
duality between three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories and gravity was
established. In all cases, the results made use of the field equations. In a
previous work, we were capable to generalize Witten's work to the off-shell
cases, as well as to four dimensional Yang-Mills theory with de Sitter gauge
symmetry. The price we paid is that curvature and torsion must obey some
constraints under the action of the interior derivative. These constraints
implied on the partial breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. In the present
work, we, first, formalize our early results in terms of fiber bundle theory by
establishing the formal aspects of the map between a principal bundle (gauge
theory) and a coframe bundle (gravity) with partial breaking of diffeomorphism
invariance. Then, we study the effect of the constraints on the homology
defined by the interior derivative. The main result is the emergence of a
nontrivial homology in Riemann-Cartan manifolds.

neural networks, leading to the advance of deep learning. Recent emergence of
Transformer networks, which replace convolution layers with self-attention
blocks, has revealed the limitation of stationary convolution kernels and
opened the door to the era of dynamic feature transforms. The existing dynamic
transforms, including self-attention, however, are all limited for video
understanding where correspondence relations in space and time, i.e., motion
information, are crucial for effective representation. In this work, we
introduce a relational feature transform, dubbed the relational self-attention
(RSA), that leverages rich structures of spatio-temporal relations in videos by
dynamically generating relational kernels and aggregating relational contexts.
Our experiments and ablation studies show that the RSA network substantially
outperforms convolution and self-attention counterparts, achieving the state of
the art on the standard motion-centric benchmarks for video action recognition,
such as Something-Something-V1 & V2, Diving48, and FineGym.

cosmology and SN physics. However, glSNe detections are rare, owing to the
intrinsic rarity of SN explosions, the necessity of alignment with a foreground
lens, and the relatively short window of detectability. We present the Las
Cumbres Observatory Lensed Supernova Search, LCOLSS, a targeted survey designed
for detecting glSNe in known strong-lensing systems. Using cadenced
$r^\prime$-band imaging, LCOLSS targeted 112 galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with
high expected SN rates, based on estimated star formation rates. No plausible
glSN was detected by LCOLSS over two years of observing. The analysis performed
here measures a detection efficiency for these observations and runs a Monte
Carlo simulation using the predicted supernova rates to determine the expected
number of glSN detections. The results of the simulation suggest an expected
number of detections and $68\%$ Poisson confidence intervals, $N_{SN} = 0.20,
[0,2.1] $, $N_{Ia} = 0.08, [0,2.0]$, $N_{CC} = 0.12, [0,2.0]$, for all SN, Type
Ia, and core-collapse (CC) SNe respectively. These results are broadly
consistent with the absence of a detection in our survey. Analysis of the
survey strategy can provide insights for future efforts to develop targeted
glSN discovery programs. We thereby forecast expected detection rates for the
Rubin observatory for such a targeted survey, finding that a single visit depth
of 24.7 mag with the Rubin observatory will detect $0.63 \pm 0.38$ SNe per

power system stability analysis and control. The thesis proposes a SSSA
approach to determine the Participation Factors (PFs) of algebraic variables in
power system dynamic modes. The thesis also explores SSSA techniques for the
design of power system controllers. The contributions on this topic are
twofold: i) Investigate a promising control approach, that is to synthesize
automatic regulators for power systems based on the theory of fractional
calculus. ii) Propose a novel perspective on the potential impact of time
delays on power system stability. Through SSSA, the thesis systematically
identifies the control parameter settings for which delays in PSSs improve the
damping of a power system. Both analytical and simulation-based results are
presented. Finally, SSSA is utilized in the thesis to systematically propose a
delay-based method to reduce the coupling of the equations of power system
models for transient stability analysis. The method consists in identifying the
variables that, when subjected to a delay equal to the time step of the
numerical integration, leave practically unchanged the system trajectories.
Such an one-step-delay approximation increases the sparsity of the system
Jacobian matrices and can be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art
techniques for the integration of DAEs. The proposed approach is evaluated in
terms of accuracy, convergence and computational burden. Throughout the thesis,
the proposed techniques are duly validated through numerical tests based on
real-world network models.

energy forward elastic $\mathit{pp}$ studies involving transverse spin.
Nonetheless, the effective alteration of the hadronic spin-flip amplitude by
the long distance electromagnetic corrections can be essential for
interpretation of the experimental results.

reduce the memory and compute requirements of neural networks for their
deployment on edge devices. Tensor compression reduces the number of parameters
required to represent a neural network weight by assuming network weights
possess a coarse higher-order structure. This coarse structure assumption has
been applied to compress large neural networks such as VGG and ResNet. However
modern state-of-the-art neural networks for computer vision tasks (i.e.
MobileNet, EfficientNet) already assume a coarse factorized structure through
depthwise separable convolutions, making pure tensor decomposition a less
attractive approach. We propose to combine low-rank tensor decomposition with
sparse pruning in order to take advantage of both coarse and fine structure for
compression. We compress weights in SOTA architectures (MobileNetv3,
EfficientNet, Vision Transformer) and compare this approach to sparse pruning
and tensor decomposition alone.

presence of partisan gerrymandering. A relatively newly proposed method of
identification is ensemble analysis. This is done by generating a large neutral
ensemble of voting plans, then comparing the given voting plan against the
ensemble through the use of a mathematical metric. In this paper, we survey
seven of the most common mathematical metrics used for this identification
process, which are the efficiency gap, weighted efficiency gap with weight 2,
relative efficiency gap with weight 1, relative efficiency gap with weight 2,
mean-median score, partisan bias, and declination. We define and discuss all of
these. The analysis is done by performing ensemble analysis on ten elections
with each metric to determine whether each metric determines each election as
gerrymandered. All ten of these elections have been studied in the literature,
so we compare those results to the results found by the metrics to assess
accuracy. We show that, while the mean-median score and partisan bias are the
most applicable across all seven metrics, they are also the most inaccurate. No
significant difference was detected between the remaining five metrics, so our
final recommendation is to use one of the four variants of the efficiency gap
or the declination if applicable, and the mean-median score if not. The
partisan bias was the least accurate of all the metrics tested.

learn the few causal features of a high-dimensional dataset based on noisy

training set which includes $n$ data samples in $\mathbb{R}^p$ is already
distributed over a large network with $N$ clients connected through extremely
low-bandwidth links. Also, we consider the asymptotic configuration of $1\ll
N\ll n\ll p$. In order to infer the causal dimensions from the whole dataset,
we propose a simple, yet effective method for information sharing in the
network. In this regard, we theoretically show that the true causal features
can be reliably recovered with negligible bandwidth usage of $O\left(N\log
p\right)$ across the network. This yields a significantly lower communication
cost in comparison with the trivial case of transmitting all the samples to a
single node (centralized scenario), which requires $O\left(np\right)$
transmissions. Even more sophisticated schemes such as ADMM still have a
communication complexity of $O\left(Np\right)$. Surprisingly, our sample
complexity bound is proved to be the same (up to a constant factor) as the
optimal centralized approach for a fixed performance measure in each node,
while that of a na\""{i}ve decentralized technique grows linearly with $N$.
Theoretical guarantees in this paper are based on the recent analytic framework
of debiased LASSO in Javanmard et al. (2019), and are supported by several

applications from easing the von-Neumann bottleneck to neuromorphic
applications. Specifically, scalable RRAMs based on Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$
(PCMO) exhibit analog switching have been demonstrated as an integrating
neuron, an analog synapse, and a voltage-controlled oscillator. More recently,
the inherent stochasticity of memristors has been proposed for efficient
hardware implementations of Boltzmann Machines. However, as the problem size
scales, the number of neurons increase and controlling the stochastic
distribution tightly over many iterations is necessary. This requires
parametric control over stochasticity. Here, we characterize the stochastic Set
in PCMO RRAMs. We identify that the Set time distribution depends on the
internal state of the device (i.e., resistance) in addition to external input
(i.e., voltage pulse). This requires the confluence of contradictory properties
like stochastic switching as well as deterministic state control in the same
device. Unlike, ""stochastic-everywhere"" filamentary memristors, in PCMO RRAMs,
we leverage the (i) stochastic Set in negative polarity and (ii) deterministic
analog Reset in positive polarity to demonstrate 100x reduced Set time
distribution drift. The impact on Boltzmann Machines' performance is analyzed
and as opposed to the ""fixed external input stochasticity"", the
""state-monitored stochasticity"" can solve problems 20x larger in size. State
monitoring also tunes out the device-to-device variability effect on
distributions providing 10x better performance. In addition to the physical
insights, this study establishes the use of experimental stochasticity in PCMO
RRAMs in stochastic recurrent neural networks reliably over many iterations.

  Coast, Australia). https://doi.org/10.1145/3469877.3493698",,,,"cs.HC cs.GR cs.MM cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have moved beyond a platform for hobbyists to
enable environmental monitoring, journalism, film industry, search and rescue,
package delivery, and entertainment. This paper describes 3D displays using
swarms of flying light specks, FLSs. An FLS is a small (hundreds of micrometers
in size) UAV with one or more light sources to generate different colors and
textures with adjustable brightness. A synchronized swarm of FLSs renders an
illumination in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. An FLS display
provides true depth, enabling a user to perceive a scene more completely by
analyzing its illumination from different angles.
  An FLS display may either be non-immersive or immersive. Both will support 3D
acoustics. Non-immersive FLS displays may be the size of a 1980's computer
monitor, enabling a surgical team to observe and control micro robots
performing heart surgery inside a patient's body. Immersive FLS displays may be
the size of a room, enabling users to interact with objects, e.g., a rock, a
teapot. An object with behavior will be constructed using FLS-matters.
FLS-matter will enable a user to touch and manipulate an object, e.g., a user
may pick up a teapot or throw a rock. An immersive and interactive FLS display
will approximate Star Trek's Holodeck.
  A successful realization of the research ideas presented in this paper will
provide fundamental insights into implementing a Holodeck using swarms of FLSs.
A Holodeck will transform the future of human communication and perception, and
how we interact with information and data. It will revolutionize the future of
how we work, learn, play and entertain, receive medical care, and socialize.

efficiently be implemented via imperative algorithms and apply this to the
field of graph rewriting. By examples, we show how this paradigm of software
development makes it easy to quickly write correct and performant code. We
provide a modern implementation of graph rewriting techniques at the level of
abstraction of finitely-presented C-sets and clarify the connections between
C-sets and the typed graphs supported in existing rewriting software. We
emphasize that our open-source library is extensible: by taking new categorical
constructions (such as slice categories, structured cospans, and distributed
graphs) and relating their limits and colimits to those of their underlying
categories, users inherit efficient algorithms for pushout complements and
(final) pullback complements. This allows one to perform double-, single-, and
sesqui-pushout rewriting over a broad class of data structures.

pressure profiles from high angular resolution thermal SZ observations. The
code allows the user to take into account various features of millimeter
observations, such as point spread function (PSF) convolution, pipeline
filtering, correlated residual noise, and point source contamination, in a
forward modeling approach. One of the key advantages of the code is the
possibility to use binned, non-parametric pressure profiles, enabling the
detection of pressure features better than smooth functions such as the
traditionally used generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Another major
upside is the performance of the software, enabling the extraction of the
pressure profile and associated confidence intervals via MCMC sampling in times
as short as a few minutes. We present the code and its validation on various
realistic synthetic maps, of ideal spherical clusters, as well as of realistic,
hydrodynamically simulated objects. We plan to publicly release the software in
the coming months.

  Explainable AI Techniques","8 Pages, 7 Figures, Presented at Workshop on Explainable AI in
  Finance at ICAIF 2021",,,,"econ.GN cs.CY q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since the onset of the the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries across the world
have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the
spread of virus, as well as economic support policies (ESPs) to save their
economies. The pandemic and the associated NPIs have triggered unprecedented
waves of economic shocks to the financial markets, including the foreign
exchange (FX) markets. Although there are some studies exploring the impact of
the NPIs and ESPs on FX markets, the relative impact of individual NPIs or ESPs
has not been studied in a combined framework. In this work, we investigate the
relative impact of NPIs and ESPs with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.
Experiments over exchange rate data of G10 currencies during the period from
January 1, 2020 to January 13, 2021 suggest strong impacts on exchange rate
markets by all measures of the strict lockdown, such as stay at home
requirements, workplace closing, international travel control, and restrictions
on internal movement. Yet, the impact of individual NPI and ESP can vary across
different currencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
uses XAI techniques to study the relative impact of NPIs and ESPs on the FX
market. The derived insights can guide governments and policymakers to make
informed decisions when facing with the ongoing pandemic and a similar
situation in the near future.

a novel influence score (I-score) to detect and search for the important

Backward Dropping Algorithm is proposed to handle long-term dependencies in the

""dagger technique"" that fully preserve the relationship between explanatory
variable and response variable. The proposed techniques can be further
generalized into any feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and any neural network. A real-world
application on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) is used and the proposed
methods are applied to improve prediction performance with an 81% error
reduction comparing with other popular peers if I-score and ""dagger technique""

philosophical artificial intelligence studies. The purpose of this paper is
threefold. First and foremost, to show the importance of complexity rather than
computability in philosophical and AI problems. Second, to rephrase the notion
of computability in terms of solvability, i.e. treating computability as
non-sufficient for establishing intelligence. The Church-Turing thesis is
therefore revisited and rephrased in order to capture the ontological
background of spatial and temporal complexity. Third, to emphasize ontological
differences between different time complexities, which seem to provide a solid
base towards better understanding of artificial intelligence in general.
