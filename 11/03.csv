antireflectivity, antifogging, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and/or antimicrobial
activity. To tune these properties however, a good control over features size
and shape is essential. Here, a versatile fabrication process is presented to
achieve tailored silicon nanostructures (thin/thick pillars,
sharp/truncated/re-entrant cones), of pitch down to ~50 nm, and high-aspect
ratio (>10). The approach relies on pre-assembled block copolymer (BCP)
micelles and their direct transfer into a glass hard mask of an arbitrary
thickness, now enabled by our recently reported regenerative secondary mask
lithography. During this pattern transfer, not only the mask diameter can be
decreased but also uniquely increased; constituting the first method to achieve
such tunability without necessitating a different molecular weight BCP.
Consequently, the hard mask modulation (height, diameter) advances the
flexibility in attainable inter-pillar spacing, aspect ratios, and re-entrant
profiles (= glass on silicon). Combined with adjusted silicon etch conditions,
the morphology of nanopatterns can be highly customized. The process control
and scalability enable uniform patterning of a 6-inch wafer which is verified
through cross-wafer excellent antireflectivity (<5%) and water-repellency
(advancing contact angle 158{\deg}; hysteresis 1{\deg}). It is envisioned the
implementation of this approach to silicon nanostructuring to be far-reaching,
facilitating fundamental studies and targeting applications spanning solar
panels, antifogging/antibacterial surfaces, sensing, amongst many others.

critical gravitational acceleration scale, $a_0$, exists. But, beyond its role
in MOND, the question: 'Why should a critical gravitational acceleration scale
exist at all?' remains unanswered. There is no deep understanding about what is
going on.
  Over roughly the same period that MOND has been a topic of controversy,
Baryshev, Sylos Labini, Pietronero and others have been arguing, with equal
controversy in earlier years, that, on medium scales at least, material in the
universe is distributed in a quasi-fractal $D\approx 2$ fashion. There is a
link: if the idea of a quasi-fractal $D \approx 2$ universe on medium scales is
taken seriously then there is an associated characteristic mass surface density
scale, $\Sigma_F$ say, and an associated characteristic gravitational
acceleration scale, $a_F = 4 \pi G \Sigma_F$. If, furthermore, the
quasi-fractal structure is taken to include the inter-galactic medium, then it
is an obvious step to consider the possibility that $a_0$ and $a_F$ are the
same thing.
  Subsequently, via a modern geometric realization of the Leibniz-Mach
worldview, we obtain a detailed theoretical understanding of how galaxy disks
should interact with a $D\approx 2$ quasi-fractal IGM. This understanding takes
the form of a superficially unremarkable scaling relationship which, used with
standard photometric mass-modelling applied to SPARC data, shows that $a_F
\approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}\, mtrs/sec^2$ is explicitly embedded in that data.
Since the scaling relationship also gives rise to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher
Relationship, but with $a_0$ replaced by $a_F$, we are led unambiguously to the
conclusion that $a_0$ and $a_F$ are, in reality, one and the same thing.

SZO method is known to suffer from a large estimation variance and slow
convergence, which seriously limits its practical application. In this work, we
borrow the idea of high-pass and low-pass filters from extremum seeking control
(continuous-time version of SZO) and develop a novel SZO method called HLF-SZO
by integrating these filters. It turns out that the high-pass filter coincides
with the residual feedback method, and the low-pass filter can be interpreted
as the momentum method. As a result, the proposed HLF-SZO achieves a much
smaller variance and much faster convergence than the vanilla SZO method and
empirically outperforms the residual-feedback SZO method, which is verified via
extensive numerical experiments.

like rings, gaps, and spirals that could be caused by interactions between the
disk and forming planets. Aims. We aim to study the young (1-3 Myr) star DR Tau
in the near-infrared and characterize its disk, which was previously resolved
through sub-millimeter interferometry with ALMA, and to search for possible
sub-stellar companions embedded into it. Methods. We observed DR Tau with
VLT/SPHERE both in polarized light (H broad band) and total intensity (in Y, J,
H, and K spectral bands). We also performed L' band observations with
LBTI/LMIRCam on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Results. We found two
previously undetected spirals extending north-east and south of the star,
respectively. We further detected an arc-like structure north of the star.
Finally a bright, compact and elongated structure was detected at separation of
303 +/- 10 mas and position angle 21.2 +/- 3.7 degrees, just at the root of the
north-east spiral arm. Since this feature is visible both in polarized light
and in total intensity and has a flat spectrum it is likely caused by stellar
light scattered by dust. Conclusions. The two spiral arms are at different
separation from the star, have very different pitch angles, and are separated
by an apparent discontinuity, suggesting they might have a different origin.
The very open southern spiral arm might be caused by infalling material from
late encounters with cloudlets into the formation environment of the star
itself. The compact feature could be caused by interaction with a planet in
formation still embedded in its dust envelope and it could be responsible for
launching the north-east spiral. We estimate a mass of the putative embedded
object of the order of few M_Jup .

the machine learning (ML) conference NeurIPS broke new ground by requiring that
all papers include a broader impact statement. This requirement was removed in
2021, in favour of a checklist approach. The 2020 statements therefore provide
a unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to
investigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance
mechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about
the societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and
other venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we
have created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020
papers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location
and subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also
provide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering
representation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential
harms alongside benefits. We investigate how these vary by geography,
affiliation type and subject area. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the
potential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and
their possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several
lessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating
the right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and
(iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation. We
encourage other researchers to use our dataset to provide additional analysis,
to further our understanding of how researchers responded to this requirement,

and explaining claims, for which the list of claims is readily available,
identifying check-worthy claim sentences from a text remains challenging.
Current claim identification models rely on manual annotations for each
sentence in the text, which is an expensive task and challenging to conduct on
a frequent basis across multiple domains. This paper explores methodology to
identify check-worthy claim sentences from fake news articles, irrespective of
domain, without explicit sentence-level annotations. We leverage two internal
supervisory signals - headline and the abstractive summary - to rank the
sentences based on semantic similarity. We hypothesize that this ranking
directly correlates to the check-worthiness of the sentences. To assess the
effectiveness of this hypothesis, we build pipelines that leverage the ranking
of sentences based on either the headline or the abstractive summary. The
top-ranked sentences are used for the downstream fact-checking tasks of
evidence retrieval and the article's veracity prediction by the pipeline. Our
findings suggest that the top 3 ranked sentences contain enough information for
evidence-based fact-checking of a fake news article. We also show that while
the headline has more gisting similarity with how a fact-checking website
writes a claim, the summary-based pipeline is the most promising for an
end-to-end fact-checking system.

adapted methods because the coupling with the body tissue does not allow for a
clear separation between antenna and channel. Especially for dynamically
varying on-body channels due to changing body poses, e.g. with head-worn
antennas, modeling is challenging and design goals for optimal antennas are
difficult to determine. Therefore, in this paper, the modeling of WBAN channels
using spherical wave functions (SWF) is utilized for antenna de-embedding and
for deriving optimal antenna characteristics that maximize the transmission
coefficient for the respective channel. It is evaluated how typical factors
influencing WBAN channels (different body anatomies, body postures, and varying
positions of the communication nodes), can be modeled statistically with SWF.
An optimized antenna design is developed based on the derived optimization
method, specifically adapted to the channel of on-body links with eye-wear
applications. The results with the optimized antenna are compared to other
standard antenna designs and validated against measurements.

expected to be generated in non-central ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions
and it is envisaged to induce several effects on hot QCD matter including the
possibility of local parity and local parity and charge conjugation symmetry
violations. A direct signature of such e.m. fields and a first quantitative
measurement of its strength and lifetime are still missing. We point out that
both the mean value of leptonic invariant mass of $Z^0$ boson, reconstructed by
its decaying lepton pairs, and the relative width are modified in relativistic
heavy ion collisions due to the presence of strong initial e.m. fields. We
propose a measurement of the leptonic invariant mass of $Z^0$ as a novel probe
of the strength of the $B_y$. Both shifts could be up to about few hundred MeV
and are found to depend on the integral of $B_y$ over the time duration
quadratically (approximate). Hence it provides a novel and clear probe of
electromagnetic fields, which can be tested experimentally.

designing competitive algorithms for the online matching problem and its

previous approaches and Devanur and Jain provided another scheme for a
generalization of the online matching problem.

Urban planners often have to make a lot of estimates based on both publicly

the Location-Allocation model popular in the field. Many municipalities in
smaller cities may have difficulty hiring specialists to carry out such
planning. This thesis proposes a new solution to streamline and facilitate the
process of such planning by using spatial embedding methods. Based only on
publicly available data from OpenStreetMap, and station layouts from 34 cities

using the Uber H3 discrete global grid system and to indicate regions where it
is worth placing a station based on existing systems in different cities using
transfer learning. The result of the work is a mechanism to support planners in
their decision making when planning a station layout with a choice of reference

crucial for autonomous driving vehicles to understand the surrounding objects

segment foreground instances. As a result, they struggle to achieve real-time
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time end-to-end panoptic
segmentation network for LiDAR point clouds, called CPSeg. In particular, CPSeg
comprises a shared encoder, a dual-decoder, and a cluster-free instance
segmentation head, which is able to dynamically pillarize foreground points
according to the learned embedding. Then, it acquires instance labels by
finding connected pillars with a pairwise embedding comparison. Thus, the
conventional proposal-based or clustering-based instance segmentation is
transformed into a binary segmentation problem on the pairwise embedding
comparison matrix. To help the network regress instance embedding, a fast and
deterministic depth completion algorithm is proposed to calculate the surface
normal of each point cloud in real-time. The proposed method is benchmarked on
two large-scale autonomous driving datasets: SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.
Notably, extensive experimental results show that CPSeg achieves
state-of-the-art results among real-time approaches on both datasets.

these problems. We present our calibration of the scaling relation between mass

calculates variations on the human strategy that lead to better performance.
Experiments with a JHU/APL-developed AI player for the cooperative card game
Hanabi suggest this technique makes unique contributions to explainability
while improving human performance. One area of focus for Instructive AI is in
the significant discrepancies that can arise between a human's actual strategy
and the strategy they profess to use. This inaccurate self-assessment presents
a barrier for XAI, since explanations of an AI's strategy may not be properly
understood or implemented by human recipients. We have developed and are
testing a novel, Instructive AI approach that estimates human strategy by
observing human actions. With neural networks, this allows a direct calculation
of the changes in weights needed to improve the human strategy to better
emulate a more successful AI. Subjected to constraints (e.g. sparsity) these
weight changes can be interpreted as recommended changes to human strategy
(e.g. ""value A more, and value B less""). Instruction from AI such as this
functions both to help humans perform better at tasks, but also to better
understand, anticipate, and correct the actions of an AI. Results will be
presented on AI instruction's ability to improve human decision-making and

environmentally friendly solvents such as water. Aqueous-surfactant solutions
prevent agglomeration of nanosheets through steric and electrostatic repulsion,
facilitating the production of high concentration nanomaterial dispersions.
Turbulent, shear-assisted liquid exfoliation of layered precursor materials
produces defect-free nanosheets by promoting mixing and generating sufficiently
high shear rates to overcome out-of-plane van der Waals bonds. In the presence
of a liquid-gas interface, a consequence of using surfactants in turbulent
flows is the formation of foam. In this experimental study, batch exfoliation
of graphite particles into few-layer graphene was performed using a kitchen
blender modified to operate across Reynolds numbers, $Re \sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$.
Foam formation during turbulent operation was found to influence the
hydrodynamics of the liquid exfoliation process. Measurements on the motion of
graphite particles indicate that surfactant concentration alters the rheology
of the mixture under dynamic conditions and changes the material flow patterns
within the device. As a result, the surfactant concentration that maximised
graphene concentration was non-unique. This highlights that the design and
selection of surfactants should consider both molecular scale repulsion
effectiveness and macroscale hydrodynamics of the liquid exfoliation process.
Furthermore, the multi-phase turbulent flows and complex fluids that exist
during batch exfoliation in aqueous-surfactants create major challenges for
realising $\textit{in situ}$ 2D material characterisation and quality control.
Here, we have developed a protocol to enable inline uv-vis-nIR spectroscopy to
determine graphene production and atomic layer number changes in-process.

Large Program, are presented in this work. By using multiwavelength maps (from
the mid-IR to the cm wavelengths) we perform SED fitting in order to extract
the physical properties of the galaxy on both global and local ($\sim$kpc)
scales. For the interpretation of the observations we make use of a
state-of-the-art SED fitting code, HerBIE (HiERarchical Bayesian Inference for
dust Emission). The observations indicate a galaxy morphology, at mm
wavelengths, similar to that of the cold dust emission traced by sub-mm
observations and to that of the molecular gas. The contribution of the radio
emission at the NIKA2 bands is very small (negligible at 1.15 mm and $\sim10\%$
at 2 mm) while it dominates the total energy budget at longer wavelengths
(beyond 5 mm). On local scales, the distribution of the free-free emission
resembles that of the dust thermal emission while the distribution of the
synchrotron emission shows a deficiency along the major axis of the disc of the
galaxy.

we set out a research program that explores a corresponding set of questions
for 3-uniform hypergraphs, a setting in which useful notions of regularity are
significantly more intricate.
  The main results in this paper concern certain combinatorial properties which
arose as natural higher-order generalizations of the order property in parallel
work of the authors in the arithmetic setting. Interpreted in the context of
3-uniform hypergraphs, these are tightly connected to the nature of irregular
triads. Specifically, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform
hypergraphs admits regular decompositions with so-called ""linear error"" if and
only if it does not have the functional order property.
  Along the way, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs is
homogeneous (i.e. all regular triads have density near $0$ or near $1$) if and
only it has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, complementing a recent
(non-quantitative) result of Chernikov and Towsner.
  We also address several questions arising from prior work on tame regularity
in hypergraphs. In particular, we characterize the hereditary properties of
$3$-uniform hypergraphs admitting the type of regular partitions appearing in
work of Fox et al. as those that have finite weak VC-dimension. This is again
analogous to a recent non-quantitative result of Chernikov and Towsner.

is a close relation to the notion of (non-symmetric) Mahler volume from convex

prove non-trivial facts about the normalized volume in the toric setting. For

$\epsilon$. From this result, it directly follows that there are also only
finitely many toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds of volume at least $\epsilon$ in
each dimension. Additionally, we show that the normalized volume of every toric
singularity is bounded from above by that of the rational double point of the
same dimension. Finally, we discuss certain bounds of the normalized volume in
terms of topological invariants of resolutions of the singularity. We establish
two upper bounds in terms of the Euler characteristic and of the first Chern

depends on a fitness function f, a mutation measure Q, and an initial
concentration distribution. The new model provides essentially two types of
asymptotic scenarios for evolution. If the complexity of sequences grows at the
right pace, then in the long term the survival is assured. This agrees with the
fact that larger genome size improves the replication fidelity. In other case,
the sequences cannot copy themselves with sufficiently fidelity, and in the

fields in three different configurations with single or multiple noise sources.
The genuine response of isolated environments to entanglement and coherence
retention is analyzed. We also briefly discuss the initial purity and relative
efficiency of the GHZ-like states. Unlike the multiple PL noise sources,
exposure, the GHZ-class state remains partially entangled and coherent for an
indefinite time when subject to single noise source. However, long-term
non-local correlation and coherence are still feasible under multiple noise
sources. Due to the lack of back-action of the environments, the conversion of
the free state into the resource GHZ-class states is not allowed. The parameter
optimization, in addition to the noise phase, regulates disorders, noise
effects, and memory properties in the current environments. Unlike the

spikes. Accordingly, a central problem in neuromorphic computing is training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) to reproduce spatio-temporal spiking patterns in
response to given spiking stimuli. Most existing approaches model the
input-output behavior of an SNN in a deterministic fashion by assigning each
input to a specific desired output spiking sequence. In contrast, in order to
fully leverage the time-encoding capacity of spikes, this work proposes to
train SNNs so as to match distributions of spiking signals rather than
individual spiking signals. To this end, the paper introduces a novel hybrid
architecture comprising a conditional generator, implemented via an SNN, and a
discriminator, implemented by a conventional artificial neural network (ANN).
The role of the ANN is to provide feedback during training to the SNN within an
adversarial iterative learning strategy that follows the principle of
generative adversarial network (GANs). In order to better capture multi-modal
spatio-temporal distribution, the proposed approach -- termed SpikeGAN -- is
further extended to support Bayesian learning of the generator's weight.
Finally, settings with time-varying statistics are addressed by proposing an
online meta-learning variant of SpikeGAN. Experiments bring insights into the
merits of the proposed approach as compared to existing solutions based on
(static) belief networks and maximum likelihood (or empirical risk
minimization).

$\text{N}_2$ and $\text{NO}$ have dominant contributions to the $\text{NO}$
formation and the corresponding extinction of $\text{N}_2$ through the exchange
process. For the considered temperature range, it is found that while nearly
50% of the dissociation processes for $\text{N}_2$ and $\text{NO}$ occurs in
the molecular quasi-steady-state (QSS) regime, the amount of the Zel'dovich
reaction is zero. Using the QSS approximation to model the Zel'dovich mechanism
leads to an overestimation of $\text{NO}$ production by more than a factor of 4

has profound consequences for the approaches that heavily rely on the validity
of QSS assumption in hypersonic applications. The investigation of the
rovibrational state population dynamics reveals substantial similarity among
different chemical systems for the energy transfer and the dissociation
processes, providing promising physical foundations for the use of
reduced-order strategies to other chemical systems without significant loss of

radiatively-inefficient accretion flows, like those observed with the Event
Horizon Telescope, are characterized by a bright ring of emission surrounding
the black-hole shadow. In the Kerr spacetime this bright ring, when narrow,
closely traces the boundary of the shadow and can, with appropriate
calibration, serve as its proxy. The present paper expands the validity of this
statement by considering two particular spacetime geometries: a solution to the
field equations of a modified gravity theory and another that parametrically
deviates from Kerr but recovers the Kerr spacetime when its deviation
parameters vanish. A covariant, axisymmetric analytic model of the accretion
flow based on conservation laws and spanning a broad range of plasma conditions
is utilized to calculate synthetic non-Kerr black-hole images, which are then
analysed and characterized. We find that in all spacetimes: (i) it is the
gravitationally-lensed unstable photon orbit that plays the critical role in
establishing the diameter of the rings observed in black-hole images, not the
event horizon or the innermost stable circular orbit, (ii) bright rings in
these images scale in size with, and encompass, the boundaries of the
black-hole shadows, even when deviating significantly from Kerr, and (iii)
uncertainties in the physical properties of the accreting plasma introduce
subdominant corrections to the relation between the diameter of the image and
the diameter of the black-hole shadow. These results provide important new
theoretical justification for using black-hole images to probe and test the
spacetimes of supermassive black holes.

composition of planet-forming environments. To further understand this
connection, we make the first ever measurement of the correlation between
planet occurrence and chemical abundances for ten different elements (C, Mg,
Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Ni). Leveraging data from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia to derive precise
stellar parameters ($\sigma_{R_\star}\approx2.3\%$,
$\sigma_{M_\star}\approx4.5\%$) for a sample of 1,018 Kepler Objects of

measured radii ($\sigma_{R_p}\approx3.4\%$). After controlling for biases in
the Kepler detection pipeline and the selection function of the APOGEE survey,
we characterize the relationship between planet occurrence and chemical
abundance as the number density of nuclei of each element in a star's
photosphere raised to a power, $\beta$. $\beta$ varies by planet type, but is
consistent within our uncertainties across all ten elements. For hot planets
($P$ = 1-10 days), an enhancement in any element of 0.1 dex corresponds to an
increased occurrence of $\approx$20% for Super-Earths ($R_p=1-1.9R_\oplus$) and
$\approx$60% for Sub-Neptunes ($R_p=1.9-4R_\oplus$). Trends are weaker for warm
($P$ = 10-100 days) planets of all sizes and for all elements, with the
potential exception of Sub-Saturns ($R_p=4-8R_\oplus$). Finally, we conclude
this work with a caution to interpreting trends between planet occurrence and

predictions for planet occurrence rates in nearby open clusters to facilitate

training neural networks, and has led to significant performance improvements
in many domains. PT can incorporate various design choices such as task and
data reweighting strategies, augmentation policies, and noise models, all of
which can significantly impact the quality of representations learned. The
hyperparameters introduced by these strategies therefore must be tuned
appropriately. However, setting the values of these hyperparameters is
challenging. Most existing methods either struggle to scale to high dimensions,
are too slow and memory-intensive, or cannot be directly applied to the
two-stage PT and FT learning process. In this work, we propose an efficient,
gradient-based algorithm to meta-learn PT hyperparameters. We formalize the PT
hyperparameter optimization problem and propose a novel method to obtain PT
hyperparameter gradients by combining implicit differentiation and
backpropagation through unrolled optimization. We demonstrate that our method
improves predictive performance on two real-world domains. First, we optimize
high-dimensional task weighting hyperparameters for multitask pre-training on
protein-protein interaction graphs and improve AUROC by up to 3.9%. Second, we
optimize a data augmentation neural network for self-supervised PT with SimCLR

  In this paper, we positively answer this question by giving an $\tilde

with a perfect fluid through an energy exchange, focusing on the exploration of
nonsingular configurations, including cyclic and bouncing models. We consider
two specific choices for the energy transfer. In the first case, the energy
transfer is proportional to a linear combination of the vacuum and fluid energy
densities which makes the conservation equations exactly integrable. The
resulting Friedmann equation can be interpreted as an energy constraint
equation with an effective potential for the scale factor that may include an
infinite barrier forcing a bounce at small values of the scale factor, as well
as a potential well allowing for cycling solutions. In the second case, the
energy transfer is a nonlinear combination of the vacuum and fluid energy
densities. Nonetheless even in this case the dynamics can be partially
integrated, leading to a first integral, reducing the number of degrees of
freedom. We show that also in this nonlinear case bouncing and cycling
cosmologies may arise. In both cases the structure of the resulting phase space
allows for nonsingular orbits with an early accelerated phase around a single
bounce, connected via a decelerated matter-dominated era to a late-time
accelerated phase dominated by an effective cosmological constant.

is that each pair corresponds to the same observation unit. If, however, such
pairs are obtained via record linkage of two files, this assumption can be
violated as a result of mismatch error rooting, for example, in the lack of
reliable identifiers in the two files. Recently, there has been a surge of
interest in this setting under the term ""Shuffled data"" in which the underlying
correct pairing of (X, Y)-pairs is represented via an unknown index
permutation. Explicit modeling of the permutation tends to be associated with
substantial overfitting, prompting the need for suitable methods of
regularization. In this paper, we propose a flexible exponential family prior
on the permutation group for this purpose that can be used to integrate various
structures such as sparse and locally constrained shuffling. This prior turns
out to be conjugate for canonical shuffled data problems in which the
likelihood conditional on a fixed permutation can be expressed as product over
the corresponding (X,Y)-pairs. Inference is based on the EM algorithm in which
the intractable E-step is approximated by the Fisher-Yates algorithm. The
M-step is shown to admit a significant reduction from $n^2$ to $n$ terms if the
likelihood of (X,Y)-pairs has exponential family form as in the case of
generalized linear models. Comparisons on synthetic and real data show that the
proposed approach compares favorably to competing methods.

important for not only the design and engineering of future platforms but also
the operation and safety of those that are currently deployed. Simulations or
experiments are typically performed in nominal sea conditions during ship
design or prior to deployment and the results may not be reflective of the
instantaneous state of the vessel and the ocean environment while deployed.
Short-term temporal predictions of ship responses given the current wave
environment and ship state would enable enhanced decision-making onboard for
both manned and unmanned vessels. However, the current state-of-the-art in
numerical hydrodynamic simulation tools are too computationally expensive to be
employed for real-time ship motion forecasting and the computationally
efficient tools are too low fidelity to provide accurate responses. A
methodology is developed with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to
represent the motions of a free running David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415
destroyer operating at 20 knots in Sea State 7 stern-quartering irregular seas.
Case studies are performed for both course-keeping and turning circle
scenarios. An estimate of the vessel's encounter frame is made with the
trajectories observed in the training dataset. Wave elevation time histories
are given by artificial wave probes that travel with the estimated encounter
frame and serve as input into the neural network, while the output is the 6-DOF
temporal ship motion response. Overall, the neural network is able to predict
the temporal response of the ship due to unseen waves accurately, which makes
this methodology suitable for system identification and real-time ship motion
forecasting. The methodology, the dependence of model accuracy on wave probe
and training data quantity and the estimated encounter frame are all detailed.

trade among millions of users generating billions of dollars in annual revenue.
Recently, two interview-based studies have suggested that DWMs may also promote
the emergence of direct user-to-user (U2U) trading relationships. Here, we
quantify the scale of, and thoroughly investigate, U2U trading around DWMs by
analysing 31 million Bitcoin transactions among users of 40 DWMs between June
2011 and Jan 2021. We find that half of the DWM users trade through U2U pairs
generating a total trading volume greater than DWMs themselves. We then show
that hundreds of thousands of DWM users form stable trading pairs that are
persistent over time. Users in stable pairs are typically the ones with the
largest trading volume on DWMs. Then, we show that new U2U pairs often form
while both users are active on the same DWM, suggesting the marketplace may
serve as a catalyst for new direct trading relationships. Finally, we reveal
that stable U2U pairs tend to survive DWM closures and that they were not
affected by COVID-19, indicating that their trading activity is resilient to
external shocks. Our work unveils sophisticated patterns of trade emerging in
the dark web and highlights the importance of investigating user behaviour
beyond the immediate buyer-seller network on a single marketplace.

Reddit users that participate in opiate-related sub-communities (subreddits) by
combining named entity recognition, geocoding, density-based clustering, and

the geospatial nature of our user cohort to answer policy-relevant questions

has compiled $\sim$150,000 spectra for thick-disk and halo stars to date. We
identify 800 high-confidence (a contamination rate of 4%) wide binaries and two
resolved triples, with binary separations mostly between $10^3$-$10^5$ AU and a
lowest [Fe/H] of $-2.7$. Based on their Galactic kinematics, 33 of them are
halo wide binaries, and most of those are associated with the accreted
Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus galaxy. The wide binary fraction in the thick disk
decreases toward the low metallicity end, consistent with the previous findings
for the thin disk. Our key finding is that the halo wide binary fraction is
consistent with the thick-disk stars at a fixed [Fe/H]. There is no significant
dependence of the wide binary fraction on the $\alpha$-captured abundance.
Therefore, the wide binary fraction is mainly determined by the iron abundance,
not their disk or halo origin nor the $\alpha$-captured abundance. Our results

eccentricity of a wide binary can be constrained by the angle between the
separation vector and the relative velocity vector (the $v$-$r$ angle). In this
paper, by using the $v$-$r$ angles of wide binaries in Gaia Early Data Release
3, we develop a Bayesian approach to measure the eccentricity distribution as a
function of binary separations. Furthermore, we infer the eccentricities of
individual wide binaries and make them publicly available. Our results show
that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries at $10^2$ AU is close to
uniform and becomes superthermal at $>10^{3}$ AU, suggesting two formation
mechanisms dominating at different separation regimes. The close binary
formation, most likely disk fragmentation, results in a uniform eccentricity
distribution at $<10^{2}$ AU. The wide binary formation that leads to highly
eccentric wide binaries at $>10^{3}$ AU may be turbulent fragmentation and/or
the dynamical unfolding of compact triples. With Gaia, measuring eccentricities
is now possible for a large number of wide binaries, opening a new window to
understanding binary formation and evolution.

calculations of reaction mechanisms. The major channels, for both isomers, are
due to H atom elimination from covalently bound adducts to give [C3NH4]+.
Theoretical calculations show that while for the reaction of aminomethylene
with acetylene any of the three lowest energy [C3NH4]+ isomers can form via
barrierless and exothermic pathways, for the methanimine reagent the only
barrierless pathway is the one leading to the production of protonated vinyl
cyanide (CH2CHCNH+), a prototypical branched nitrile species that has been
proposed as a likely intermediate in star forming regions and in the atmosphere
of Titan. The astrochemical implications of the results are briefly addressed.

sufficiently light and weakly coupled to the solar plasma. In a narrow region
of phase space, they are emitted with velocities smaller than the escape
velocity of the solar system, thereby populating a gravitationally bound
density that can accumulate over the solar lifetime, referred to as a ""solar
basin."" Detection strategies that can succeed in spite of (or even be enhanced
by) the low particle velocities are therefore poised to explore new regions of
parameter space when taking this solar population into account. Here we
identify ""direct deflection"" as a powerful method to detect such a population
of millicharged particles. This approach involves distorting the local flow of
gravitationally bound millicharges with an oscillating electromagnetic field
and measuring these distortions with a resonant LC circuit. Since it is easier
to distort the flow of slowly moving particles, the signal is parametrically
enhanced by the small solar escape velocity near Earth. The proposed setup can
probe couplings an order of magnitude smaller than other methods for
millicharge masses ranging from 100 meV to 100 eV and can operate concurrently
as a search for sub-GeV millicharged dark matter. The signal power scales as
the millicharge coupling to the eighth power, meaning that even with
conservative assumptions, direct deflection could begin to explore new regions
of parameter space. We also highlight novel features of millicharge solar
basins, including those associated with the phase space distribution and the
possibility for the occupation number to vastly exceed that of a thermal

planet formation simulations using a semi-analytic model of the HL Tau disk to
follow the growth and migration of hundreds of planetary embryos initially
distributed throughout the disk, assuming either a high or low turbulent
$\alpha$ viscosity. We have discovered that there is a bifurcation in the
migration history of forming planets as a consequence of varying the disk
viscosity. In our high viscosity disks, inward migration prevails and yields
compact planetary systems, tempered only by planet trapping at the water
iceline around 5 au. In our lower viscosity models however, low mass planets
can migrate outward to twice their initial orbital radii, driven by a radially
extended region of strong outward-directed corotation torques located near the
heat transition (where radiative heating of the disk by the star is comparable
to viscous heating) - before eventually migrating inwards. We derive analytic
expressions for the planet mass at which the corotation torque dominates, and
find that this ""corotation mass"" scales as $M_{\rm p, corot} \sim
\alpha^{2/3}$. If disk winds dominate the corotation torque, the corotation
mass scales linearly with wind strength. We propose that the observed
bifurcation in disk demographics into a majority of compact dust disks and a
minority of extended ring/gap systems is a consequence of a distribution of

jets can undergo significant interaction with the gas in the galactic disc and
may be able to drive large-scale, multiphase outflows. We apply our novel
sub-grid model for Blandford-Znajek jets to simulations of the central regions
of Seyferts, in which a black hole is embedded in a dense, sub-kpc
circumnuclear disc (CND) and surrounded by a dilute circumgalactic medium
(CGM). We find that the variability of the accretion flow is highly sensitive
both to the jet power and to the CND thermodynamics and, ultimately, is
determined by the complex interplay between jet-driven outflows and backflows.
Even at moderate Eddington ratios, AGN jets are able to significantly alter the
thermodynamics and kinematics of CNDs and entrain up to 10% of their mass in
the outflow. Mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of the warm outflowing
component are in agreement with recent observations for black holes with
similar bolometric luminosities, with outflow velocities that are able to reach
500 km/s. Depending on their power and direction, jets are able to drive a wide
variety of large-scale outflows, ranging from light, hot and collimated
structures to highly mass-loaded, multiphase, bipolar winds. This diversity of
jet-driven outflows highlights the importance of applying physically motivated
models of AGN feedback to realistic galaxy formation contexts. Such simulations
will play a crucial role in accurately interpreting the wealth of data that
next generation facilities such as JWST, SKA and Athena will provide.

galaxies is mainly dictated by the modeling of feedback from active galactic
nuclei (AGN). The amount of energy released by AGN feedback is proportional to
the mass that has been accreted onto the BHs, but the exact sub-grid modeling
of AGN feedback differs in all simulations. Whilst modern simulations reliably
produce populations of quiescent massive galaxies at z<2, it is also crucial to
assess the similarities and differences of the responsible AGN populations.
Here, we compare the AGN population of the Illustris, TNG100, TNG300,
Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The AGN luminosity function (LF)
varies significantly between simulations. Although in agreement with current
observational constraints at z=0, at higher redshift the agreement of the LFs
deteriorates with most simulations producing too many AGN of L_{x, 2-10
keV}~10^43-10^44 erg/s. AGN feedback in some simulations prevents the existence
of any bright AGN with L_{x, 2-10 keV}>=10^45 erg/s (although this is sensitive
to AGN variability), and leads to smaller fractions of AGN in massive galaxies
than in the observations at z<=2. We find that all the simulations fail at
producing a number density of AGN in good agreement with observational
constraints for both luminous (L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^43-10^45 erg/s) and fainter
(L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^42-10^43 erg/s) AGN, and at both low and high redshift.
These differences can aid us in improving future BH and galaxy subgrid modeling
in simulations. Upcoming X-ray missions (e.g., Athena, AXIS, and LynX) will
bring faint AGN to light and new powerful constraints. After accounting for AGN
obscuration, we find that the predicted number density of detectable AGN in
future surveys spans at least one order of magnitude across the simulations, at
any redshift.

results around $\Omega_{\rm neutral} \!\sim\! 10^{-3}$ and increases from lower

well reproduced by our non-equilibrium H$_2$-based star formation modelling.
H$_2$ depletion times remain below the Hubble time and comparable to the

We developed a freely available unsupervised machine-learning algorithm based

purpose, the algorithm combines different sources of information, such as the
apparent magnitude, size and color of the emitting source, and the equivalent
width and wavelength of the detected line. In each specific case, the algorithm
automatically identifies the most relevant ones (i.e., those able to minimize
the dispersion associated with the output parameter). The outputs can be easily

by radiation. Such radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs) could be responsible for
shaping the prompt GRB emission. Although well studied theoretically, RMS
models have not yet been fitted to data due to the computational cost of
simulating RMSs from first principles. Here, we bridge the gap between theory
and observations by developing an approximate method capable of accurately
reproducing radiation spectra from mildly relativistic (in the shock frame) or
slower RMSs, called the Kompaneets RMS approximation (KRA). The approximation
is based on the similarities between thermal Comptonization of radiation and
the bulk Comptonization that occurs inside an RMS. We validate the method by
comparing simulated KRA radiation spectra to first-principle
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement both inside
the RMS and in the RMS downstream. The KRA is then applied to a shock scenario
inside a GRB jet, allowing for fast and efficient fitting to GRB data. We
illustrate the capabilities of the developed method by performing a fit to a
non-thermal spectrum in GRB 150314A. The fit allows us to uncover the physical
properties of the RMS responsible for the prompt emission, such as the shock
speed and the upstream plasma temperature.

the geometrical lightcone effect. We investigate the impact of using the
standard mean redshift approximation as a function of survey depth, and show
that this assumption can lead to both an overall amplitude suppression and
scale-dependent error when compared to the `true' spectrum. However, we also
show that by using a carefully chosen `effective fixed-time', one can find a
range of scales where the approximation to the full model is highly accurate,
but only on a more restricted set of scales. We validate the theory by
constructing dark matter and galaxy lightcone mock surveys from a large
$N$-body simulation with a high cadence of snapshots. We do this by solving the
light cone equation exactly for every particle, where the particle worldlines
are obtained in a piecewise fashion with cubic interpolation between
neighbouring snapshots. We find excellent agreement between our measurements
and the theory ($\sim \pm 5\%$) over scales $(0.004 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1} \leq k \leq
0.54 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ and for a variety of magnitude limits. Finally, we look
to see how accurately we can measure the turnover scale of the galaxy power
spectrum $k_0$. Using the lightcone mocks we show that one can detect the
turnover scale with a probability $P \geq 95\%$ in an all-sky catalogue limited
to an apparent magnitude $m_{\rm lim}\sim 21$. We also show that the detection
significance would remain high for surveys with $m_{\rm lim}\sim22$ and $20\%$
sky coverage.

which can be understood as staggered valence bond solid orders, in which part
of the lattice symmetry is spontaneously broken and the Majorana fermions
acquire a mass gap. For small to intermediate $N$, on the other hand, phases
with spontaneously broken SO($N$) symmetry, which can be understood as

semimetal and antiferromagnetic phases are continuous for small $N \leq 3$ and

substrate, such as the extracellular matrix or a culture substrate, to spread
and proliferate. The mechanical and chemical properties of such structures play
a central role in the dynamical and statistical properties of the tissue. At
the cell scale, these substrates are highly disordered. Here, we investigate
how spatial heterogeneities of the cell-substrate interaction influence the
motility of the cells in a model confluent tissue. We use the Self-Propelled
Voronoi model and describe the disorder as a spatially dependent preferred
geometry of the individual cells. We found that when the characteristic length
scale of the preferred geometry is smaller than the cell size, the tissue is
less rigid than its homogeneous counterpart, with a consequent increase in cell
motility. This result is in sharp contrast to what has been reported for
tissues with heterogeneity in the mechanical properties of the individual
cells, where the disorder favors rigidity. Using the fraction of rigid cells,
we observe a collapse of the motility data for different model parameters and
provide evidence that the rigidity transition in the model tissue is
accompanied by the emergence of a spanning cluster of rigid cells.

characterizes spatial variability by a weighted combination of first-order

through specification of general bivariate discrete distributions that define
the conditional pmfs. Moreover, the discrete NNMP allows for construction of

space, facilitating covariate inclusion. In particular, we develop a modeling
and inferential framework for copula-based NNMPs that can attain flexible
dependence structures, motivating the use of bivariate copula families for
spatial processes. Compared to the traditional class of spatial generalized
linear mixed models, where spatial dependence is introduced through a
transformation of response means, our process-based modeling approach provides
both computational and inferential advantages. We illustrate the benefits with

  Technologies and Networking (CommNet 2021)",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) scheme for
federated edge learning (FEEL). The proposed scheme relies on the concept of
distributed learning by majority vote (MV) with sign stochastic gradient
descend (signSGD). As compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, with the
proposed method, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic
gradients by activating one of two orthogonal resources, i.e., orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers, and the MVs at the edge
server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting the energy
accumulations on the subcarriers. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. By taking path
loss, power control, cell size, and the probabilistic nature of the detected
MVs in fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function. Through simulations, we show that the
proposed scheme can provide a high test accuracy in fading channels even when
the time-synchronization and the power alignment at the ES are not ideal. We
also provide insight into distributed learning for location-dependent data
distribution for the MV-based schemes.

monopolist, $n$ buyers, and each buyer has a private signal $s_i$ describing a
piece of information about the item. Each bidder $i$ also has a valuation
function $v_i(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ mapping the (private) signals of all buyers to a
positive real number representing their value for the item. This setting
captures scenarios where the item's information is asymmetric or dispersed
among agents, such as in competitions for oil drilling rights, or in auctions
for art pieces. Due to the increased complexity of this model compared to
standard private values, it is generally assumed that each bidder's valuation
function $v_i$ is public knowledge. But in many situations, the seller may not
know how a bidder aggregates signals into a valuation. In this paper, we design
mechanisms that guarantee approximately-optimal social welfare while satisfying
ex-post incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the case where
the valuation functions are private to the bidders.
  When the valuations are public, it is possible for optimal social welfare to
be attained by a deterministic mechanism under a single-crossing condition. In
contrast, when the valuations are the bidders' private information, we show
that no finite bound can be achieved by any deterministic mechanism even under
single-crossing.
  Moreover, no randomized mechanism can guarantee better than an
$n$-approximation. We thus consider valuation functions that are submodular
over signals (SOS), introduced in the context of combinatorial auctions in a
recent breakthrough paper by Eden et al. [EC'19]. Our main result is an
$O(\log^2 n)$-approximation for buyers with private signals and valuations
under the SOS condition. We also give a tight $\Theta(k)$-approximation for the
case each agent's valuation depends on at most $k$ other signals even for
unknown $k$.

(DBNs) are widely used sequence models with complementary strengths and
limitations. While PCFGs allow for nested hierarchical dependencies (tree
structures), their latent variables (non-terminal symbols) have to be discrete.
In contrast, DBNs allow for continuous latent variables, but the dependencies
are strictly sequential (chain structure). Therefore, neither can be applied if
the latent variables are assumed to be continuous and also to have a nested
hierarchical dependency structure. In this paper, we present Recursive Bayesian
Networks (RBNs), which generalise and unify PCFGs and DBNs, combining their
strengths and containing both as special cases. RBNs define a joint
distribution over tree-structured Bayesian networks with discrete or continuous
latent variables. The main challenge lies in performing joint inference over
the exponential number of possible structures and the continuous variables. We
provide two solutions: 1) For arbitrary RBNs, we generalise inside and outside
probabilities from PCFGs to the mixed discrete-continuous case, which allows
for maximum posterior estimates of the continuous latent variables via gradient
descent, while marginalising over network structures. 2) For Gaussian RBNs, we
additionally derive an analytic approximation, allowing for robust parameter
optimisation and Bayesian inference. The capacity and diverse applications of
RBNs are illustrated on two examples: In a quantitative evaluation on synthetic
data, we demonstrate and discuss the advantage of RBNs for segmentation and
tree induction from noisy sequences, compared to change point detection and
hierarchical clustering. In an application to musical data, we approach the
unsolved problem of hierarchical music analysis from the raw note level and
compare our results to expert annotations.

is to understand the evolution of LSB dwarfs in the cluster. We also study the
contribution of the newly detected galaxies to the faint end of the luminosity
function. We test the detection completeness and parameter extraction accuracy
of MTO. We then apply MTO to the FDS images to identify LSB candidates. The
identified objects are fitted with 2D S\'ersic models using GALFIT and
classified based on their morphological appearance, colors, and structure. With
MTO, we are able to increase the completeness of our earlier FDS dwarf catalog

Due to the increased accuracy in measuring sizes of the detected objects, we
also add many small galaxies to the catalog that were previously excluded as
their outer parts had been missed in detection. We detect 265 new LSB dwarf
galaxies in the Fornax cluster, which increases the total number of known
dwarfs in Fornax to 821. Using the extended catalog, we show that the
luminosity function has a faint-end slope of -1.38+/-0.02. We compare the
obtained luminosity function with different environments studied earlier using
deep data but do not find any significant differences. On the other hand, the
Fornax-like simulated clusters in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation have
shallower slopes than found in the observational data. We also find several
trends in the galaxy colors, structure, and morphology that support the idea
that the number of LSB galaxies is higher in the cluster center due to tidal
forces and the age dimming of the stellar populations. The same result also
holds for the subgroup of large LSB galaxies, so-called ultra-diffuse galaxies.

quality that was never possible with old generation telescopes. Hence, radio

These newer wide-band and wide field-of-view (FOV) observations require

in order to provide deep and high dynamic range (DR) images with which to study
the diffuse and faint radio emissions in supercluster environments. Sometimes,
strong point sources hamper the radio observations and limit the achievement of
a high DR. In this paper, we have shown the DR improvements around strong radio

newer third-generation calibration (3GC) techniques using CubiCal and killMS
software. We have also calculated the statistical parameters to quantify the
improvements around strong radio sources. This analysis advocates for the use
of new calibration techniques to maximize the scientific returns from

degradation of the SEM image quality for a given imaging dose. SE count
imaging, which uses the direct count of SEs detected from the sample instead of

GGA+U methods. When we applied U$_{eff}$ in the range of 1 to 5 eV, both the
up-spin and down-spin band structures were observed to be direct. The charge
carrier effective masses were also found to enhance gradually from U$_{eff} =$
1 eV to 5 eV, but, these values were anomalous for U$_{eff} =$ 0 and 6 eV.
These results suggest that U$_{eff}$ should be limited within the range of 1 to
5 eV to calculate the structural, electronic and optical properties of GFCO

times. In prior works, the sampling probability of the transitions was adjusted
according to their importance. Reassigning sampling probabilities for every
transition in the replay buffer after each iteration is highly inefficient.
Therefore, experience replay prioritization algorithms recalculate the
significance of a transition when the corresponding transition is sampled to
gain computational efficiency. However, the importance level of the transitions
changes dynamically as the policy and the value function of the agent are
updated. In addition, experience replay stores the transitions are generated by
the previous policies of the agent that may significantly deviate from the most
recent policy of the agent. Higher deviation from the most recent policy of the
agent leads to more off-policy updates, which is detrimental for the agent. In
this paper, we develop a novel algorithm, Batch Prioritizing Experience Replay
via KL Divergence (KLPER), which prioritizes batch of transitions rather than
directly prioritizing each transition. Moreover, to reduce the off-policyness
of the updates, our algorithm selects one batch among a certain number of
batches and forces the agent to learn through the batch that is most likely
generated by the most recent policy of the agent. We combine our algorithm with
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient and evaluate it on various continuous control tasks. KLPER provides
promising improvements for deep deterministic continuous control algorithms in
terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and stability of the policy

diagnosis or image segmentation is difficult due to the lack of training data,

method to create synthetic data is highly sought after. However, most
three-dimensional image generators require additional image input or are
extremely memory intensive. To address these issues we propose adapting video
generation techniques for 3-D image generation. Using the temporal GAN (TGAN)
architecture, we show we are able to generate realistic head and neck PET
images. We also show that by conditioning the generator on tumour masks, we are
able to control the geometry and location of the tumour in the generated
images. To test the utility of the synthetic images, we train a segmentation
model using the synthetic images. Synthetic images conditioned on real tumour
masks are automatically segmented, and the corresponding real images are also
segmented. We evaluate the segmentations using the Dice score and find the
segmentation algorithm performs similarly on both datasets (0.65 synthetic
data, 0.70 real data). Various radionomic features are then calculated over the
segmented tumour volumes for each data set. A comparison of the real and
synthetic feature distributions show that seven of eight feature distributions
had statistically insignificant differences (p>0.05). Correlation coefficients
were also calculated between all radionomic features and it is shown that all
of the strong statistical correlations in the real data set are preserved in
the synthetic data set.

metric gravitational field and derive the both canonical $H_C$ and total $H_t$
Hamiltonians of the metric GR. We also developed an effective method which is
used to determine various Poisson brackets between analytical functions of the
basic dynamical variables, i.e., generalized coordinates $g_{\alpha\beta}$ and
momenta $\pi^{\mu\nu}$. In general, such variables can be chosen either from
the straight $\{ g_{\alpha\beta}, \pi^{\mu\nu} \}$, or dual $\{
g^{\alpha\beta}, \pi_{\mu\nu} \}$ sets of symplectic dynamical variables which
always arise (and complete each other) in any Hamiltonian formulation developed
for the coupled system of tensor fields. By applying canonical
transformation(s) of dynamical variables we reduce the canonical Hamiltonian
$H_C$ to its natural form. The natural form of canonical Hamiltonian provides
numerous advantages in actual applications to the metric GR, since the general
theory of dynamical systems with such Hamiltonians is well developed.
Furthermore, many analytical and numerically exact solutions have been found
and described in detail for dynamical systems with the Hamiltonians already
reduced to their natural forms. In particular, reduction of the canonical
Hamiltonian $H_C$ to its natural form allows one to derive the Jacobi equation

this issue and improve the regularity structure of the problem, we consider
cases in which analytic smoothing (bias-free mollification) cannot be performed
and introduce a novel numerical smoothing approach by combining a root-finding
method with a one-dimensional numerical integration with respect to a single

resulting function of the remaining variables is highly smooth, potentially
affording the improved efficiency of adaptive sparse grid quadrature (ASGQ) and
QMC methods, particularly when combined with hierarchical transformations (ie.,
the Brownian bridge and Richardson extrapolation on the weak error). This
approach facilitates the effective treatment of high dimensionality. Our study
is motivated by option pricing problems, focusing on dynamics where the
discretization of the asset price is necessary. Based on our analysis and
numerical experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of combining numerical
smoothing with the ASGQ and QMC methods over these methods without smoothing

applied to solve a broad class of problems, particularly approximating

In contrast, the most recent results obtain linear scaling either with

to adopt standard initialization strategies, possibly avoid lazy training, and
train all layers simultaneously in basic shallow neural networks while

worldwide and contributes disproportionally to peak electricity demand in many
regions. Strongly driven by occupant activities at home, household energy
consumption is stochastic and heterogeneous in nature. However, most
residential building energy models applied by industry use homogeneous,
deterministic occupant activity schedules, which work well for predictions of
annual energy consumption, but can result in unrealistic hourly or sub-hourly
electric load profiles, with exaggerated or muted peaks. This mattered less in
the past, but the increasing proportion of variable renewable energy generators
in power systems means that representing the heterogeneity and stochasticity of
occupant behavior is crucial for reliable energy planning. This is particularly
true for systems that include distributed energy resources, such as
grid-interactive efficient buildings, solar photovoltaics, and battery storage.
This work presents a stochastic occupant behavior simulator that models the
energy use behavior of individual household members. It also presents an
integration with a building stock model to simulate residential building loads
more accurately at community, city, state, and national scales. More
specifically, we first employ clustering techniques to identify distinct

interlayer excitons in MoSe$_{2}$-WSe$_{2}$ heterostacks as measured by back
focal plane imaging in the temperature range between 1.7 K and 20 K. By
comparing the data with an analytical model describing the dipolar emission
pattern in a dielectric environment, we are able to obtain the relative
contributions of the in- and out-of-plane transition dipole moments associated
to the interlayer exciton photon emission. We determine the transition dipole
moments for all observed interlayer exciton transitions to be (99 $\pm$ 1)%
in-plane for R- and H-type stacking, independent of the excitation power and
therefore the density of the exciton ensemble in the experimentally examined

$n=1,2,\ldots, N$ and every $i=0,1,\ldots,n-1$. In 1958 Steinhaus asked whether
piercing sequences can be arbitrarily long. A negative answer was provided by
Schinzel, who proved that any such sequence may have at most $74$ elements.
This was later improved to the best possible value of $17$ by Warmus, and
independently by Berlekamp and Graham.
  In this paper we study a more general variant of piercing sequences. Let
$f(n)\geq n$ be an infinite nondecreasing sequence of positive integers. A
sequence $X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{f(N)})$ is $f$-piercing if

A special case of $f(n)=n+d$, with $d$ a fixed nonnegative integer, was studied
by Berlekamp and Graham. They noticed that for each $d\geq 0$, the maximum
length of any $(n+d)$-piercing sequence is finite. Expressing this maximum
length as $s(d)+d$, they obtained an exponential upper bound on the function
$s(d)$, which was later improved to $s(d)=O(d^3)$ by Graham and Levy. Recently,
Konyagin proved that $2d\leqslant s(d)< 200d$ holds for all sufficiently big
$d$.
  Using a different technique based on the Farey fractions and stick-breaking
games, we prove here that the function $s(d)$ satisfies
$\left\lfloor{}c_1d\right\rfloor{}\leqslant s(d)\leqslant c_2d+o(d)$, where
$c_1=\frac{\ln 2}{1-\ln 2}\approx2.25$ and
$c_2=\frac{1+\ln2}{1-\ln2}\approx5.52$. We also prove that there exists an
infinite $f$-piercing sequence with $f(n)= \gamma n+o(n)$ if and only if
$\gamma\geq\frac{1}{\ln 2}\approx 1.44$.

drones, has increased in recent years. This goes in parallel with misuse
episodes, with an evident threat to the safety of people or facilities. As a
result, the detection of UAV has also emerged as a research topic. Most studies
on drone detection fail to specify the type of acquisition device, the drone
type, the detection range, or the dataset. The lack of proper UAV detection
studies employing thermal infrared cameras is also an issue, despite its
success with other targets. Besides, we have not found any previous study that
addresses the detection task as a function of distance to the target. Sensor
fusion is indicated as an open research issue as well, although research in
this direction is scarce too. To counteract the mentioned issues and allow
fundamental studies with a common public benchmark, we contribute with an
annotated multi-sensor database for drone detection that includes infrared and
visible videos and audio files. The database includes three different drones,
of different sizes and other flying objects that can be mistakenly detected as
drones, such as birds, airplanes or helicopters. In addition to using several
different sensors, the number of classes is higher than in previous studies. To
allow studies as a function of the sensor-to-target distance, the dataset is
divided into three categories (Close, Medium, Distant) according to the
industry-standard Detect, Recognize and Identify (DRI) requirements, built on
the Johnson criteria. Given that the drones must be flown within visual range
due to regulations, the largest sensor-to-target distance for a drone is 200 m,
and acquisitions are made in daylight. The data has been obtained at three

Sun. Solar surface flux transport models (SFTMs) are used to describe the
evolution of the radial magnetic field at the solar surface. There is however
uncertainty about using these models in the early stage of AR evolution. We aim
to test the applicability of SFTMs in the first days after the emergence of ARs
by comparing them with observations. The models we employ range from passive
evolution to models where the inflows around ARs are included. We simulate the
evolution of the surface magnetic field of 17 emerging active regions using a
local surface flux transport simulation. We selected regions that do not form
fully-fledged sunspots that exhibit moat flows. The simulation includes
diffusion and advection. We use observed flows from local correlation tracking
of solar granulation, as well as parametrizations of the inflows around ARs. To
evaluate our simulations, we measure the cross correlation between the observed
and the simulated magnetic field, as well as the total unsigned flux of the
ARs, over time. We also test the validity of our simulations by varying the
starting time relative to the emergence of flux. We find that the simulations
using observed surface flows can reproduce the evolution of the observed
magnetic flux. The effect of buffeting of the field by supergranulation can be
described as a diffusion process. The SFTM is applicable after 90% of the peak
total unsigned flux of the AR has emerged. Diffusivities in the range between
$D=250$ to $720$ km$^2$/s are consistent with the evolution of the AR flux in
the first five days after this time. We find that the converging flows around
emerging ARs are not important for the evolution of the total flux of the AR in
these first five days; their effect of increasing flux cancellation is balanced
by the decrease of flux transport away from the AR.

the material PC scores, two distance-based metrics are required to complete the
microstructure quantification of complex OPVs. A localized version of the

the two distance-based metrics to the short-circuit current of OPVs. It is

unstructured environments, but it remains challenging to have both speed and
quality in the solutions. One reason is that second-order optimality requires
calculating Hessian matrices that can grow with $O(N^2)$ with the number of
waypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation
time. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that
may not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced
computation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus
optimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory
optimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each
segment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved
classically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single
trajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments
through a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is
distributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories
with denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to
using any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems. We compare
the performance of our implementation of trajectory splitting against leading
motion planning algorithms and demonstrate the improved computational
efficiency of our method.

From the analysis, 15 Flat/Class I YSOs, 46 Class II YSOs, and 41 accreting PMS

analysis). The distance based on Gaia parallaxes is $\sim$1250 pc,
significantly closer than previously reported. The Class II YSOs and PMS stars

are slightly younger than the estimated crossing time of $\sim$2.7Myr and
closer to the estimated dynamical age $\sim$0.85 Myr. Younger Class I YSOs are
more concentrated spatially. There exists a cavity devoid of young stars where
the two clouds overlap. This evidence suggests that the current generation of
stars formed after the collision of two clouds $\sim$1 Myr ago, and this result

process multiple social cues in a complex real-world environment. However,
incongruency of input information across modalities is inevitable and could be
challenging for robots to process. To tackle this challenge, our study adopted
the neurorobotic paradigm of crossmodal conflict resolution to make a robot
express human-like social attention. A behavioural experiment was conducted on
37 participants for the human study. We designed a round-table meeting scenario
with three animated avatars to improve ecological validity. Each avatar wore a
medical mask to obscure the facial cues of the nose, mouth, and jaw. The
central avatar shifted its eye gaze while the peripheral avatars generated
sound. Gaze direction and sound locations were either spatially congruent or
incongruent. We observed that the central avatar's dynamic gaze could trigger
crossmodal social attention responses. In particular, human performances are
better under the congruent audio-visual condition than the incongruent
condition. Our saliency prediction model was trained to detect social cues,
predict audio-visual saliency, and attend selectively for the robot study.
After mounting the trained model on the iCub, the robot was exposed to
laboratory conditions similar to the human experiment. While the human
performances were overall superior, our trained model demonstrated that it
could replicate attention responses similar to humans.

learning agent has little to no feedback on the quality of its actions. In
these situations, a good strategy is to focus on exploration, hopefully leading
to the discovery of a reward signal to improve on. A learning algorithm capable
of dealing with this kind of settings has to be able to (1) explore possible
agent behaviors and (2) exploit any possible discovered reward. Efficient
exploration algorithms have been proposed that require to define a behavior
space, that associates to an agent its resulting behavior in a space that is
known to be worth exploring. The need to define this space is a limitation of
these algorithms. In this work, we introduce STAX, an algorithm designed to
learn a behavior space on-the-fly and to explore it while efficiently
optimizing any reward discovered. It does so by separating the exploration and
learning of the behavior space from the exploitation of the reward through an
alternating two-steps process. In the first step, STAX builds a repertoire of
diverse policies while learning a low-dimensional representation of the
high-dimensional observations generated during the policies evaluation. In the
exploitation step, emitters are used to optimize the performance of the
discovered rewarding solutions. Experiments conducted on three different sparse
reward environments show that STAX performs comparably to existing baselines
while requiring much less prior information about the task as it autonomously
builds the behavior space.

Cross-matching of cluster parameters such as mass and redshift of the cluster

samples for the Large Program. This SZ Large Program is observing a selection
of galaxy clusters at intermediate and high redshift $\left( 0.5 < z < 0.9
\right)$, covering one order of magnitude in mass. These are SZ-selected
clusters from the Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope catalogs, wherein the
selection is based on their integrated Compton parameter values, $Y_{500}$: the
value of the parameter within the characteristics radius $R_{500}$.
  THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamical simulations provide us with hundreds of
clusters satisfying these redshift, mass, and $Y_{500}$ requirements. In
addition to the standard post-processing analysis of the simulation, mock
observational maps are available mimicking X-ray, optical, gravitational
lensing, radio, and SZ observations of galaxy clusters. The primary goal of
employing the twin samples is to compare different cluster mass proxies from
synthetic X-ray, SZ effect and optical maps (via the velocity dispersion of
member galaxies and lensing $\kappa$-maps) of the clusters. Eventually, scaling
laws between different mass proxies and the cluster mass will be
cross-correlated to reduce the scatter on the inferred mass and the mass bias
will be related to various physical parameters.

PCA-based method for energy measurement is especially useful in applications
where the detector is operating near its saturation energy and pulse shape
varies strongly with photon energy. It has been shown previously that PCA using
two principal components can be used as an energy-measurement scheme. We extend
upon these ideas and develop a method for measuring the energies of photons by
characterizing their pulse shapes using any number of principal components and
any number of calibration energies. Applying this technique with 50 principal

Thermal Kinetic Inductance Detectors (TKIDs) from 75 eV to 43 eV at 5.9 keV. We

requiring system designers to carefully analyze the stability of closed-loop
systems that arise from their proposed switching control laws. This paper
presents a formal approach for verifying switched system stability that blends
classical ideas from the controls and verification literature using
differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for deductive verification of hybrid
systems. From controls, we use standard stability notions for various classes
of switching mechanisms and their corresponding Lyapunov function-based
analysis techniques. From verification, we use dL's ability to verify
quantified properties of hybrid systems and dL models of switched systems as
looping hybrid programs whose stability can be formally specified and proven by
finding appropriate loop invariants, i.e., properties that are preserved across
each loop iteration. This blend of ideas enables a trustworthy implementation
of switched system stability verification in the KeYmaera X prover based on dL.
For standard classes of switching mechanisms, the implementation provides fully
automated stability proofs, including searching for suitable Lyapunov
functions. Moreover, the generality of the deductive approach also enables
verification of switching control laws that require non-standard stability
arguments through the design of loop invariants that suitably express specific
intuitions behind those control laws. This flexibility is demonstrated on three
case studies: a model for longitudinal flight control by Branicky, an automatic

finite-difference discretization of the filtered compressible Navier-Stokes
equations capable of unifying dynamic sub-filter scale (SFS) modeling and shock
capturing under a single mathematical framework. Its innovation lies in the
introduction of a physical-space implementation of a spectral-like SFS
dissipation term by leveraging residuals of filter operations, achieving two
goals: (1) estimating the energy of the resolved solution near the grid cutoff;
(2) imposing a plateau-cusp shape to the spectral distribution of the added
dissipation. The QSV approach has been tested in a variety of flows to showcase
its capability to act interchangeably as: a shock capturing method, in the
Shu-Osher, shock/vortex or shock/wall interactions problems; or as a SFS
closure, in subsonic Taylor Green Vortex (TGV), and supersonic/hypersonic
turbulent channel flows. QSV performs well compared to previous eddy-viscosity
closures and shock capturing methods in such test cases. In a supersonic TGV
flow, a case which exhibits shock/turbulence interactions, QSV alone
outperforms the simple superposition of separate numerical treatments for SFS
turbulence and shocks. QSV's combined capability of simulating shocks and
turbulence independently, as well as simultaneously, effectively achieves the
unification of shock capturing and Large-Eddy Simulation.

of fault-injection attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with provable bounds
on detection performance. Recent literature in fault-injection attacks shows
the severe DNN accuracy degradation caused by bit flips. In this scenario, the
attacker changes a few weight bits during DNN execution by tampering with the
program's DRAM memory. To detect runtime bit flips, HASHTAG extracts a unique
signature from the benign DNN prior to deployment. The signature is later used
to validate the integrity of the DNN and verify the inference output on the
fly. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis scheme that accurately identifies
the most vulnerable DNN layers to the fault-injection attack. The DNN signature
is then constructed by encoding the underlying weights in the vulnerable layers
using a low-collision hash function. When the DNN is deployed, new hashes are
extracted from the target layers during inference and compared against the
ground-truth signatures. HASHTAG incorporates a lightweight methodology that
ensures a low-overhead and real-time fault detection on embedded platforms.
Extensive evaluations with the state-of-the-art bit-flip attack on various DNNs
demonstrate the competitive advantage of HASHTAG in terms of both attack
detection and execution overhead.

abnormality like stenosis. To this end, an artificial neural network (ANN)
model is trained using synthetic data so that it can predict the pressure and
velocity within the arterial network. The data required to train the neural
network were obtained from the CFD analysis of several geometries of arteries
with specific features in ABAQUS software. Blood pressure drop caused by
stenosis, which is one of the most important factors in the diagnosis of heart
diseases, can be predicted using our proposed model knowing the geometrical and
flow boundary conditions of any section of the coronary arteries. The
efficiency of the model was verified using three real geometries of LAD's
vessels. The proposed approach precisely predicts the hemodynamic behavior of
the blood flow. The average accuracy of the pressure prediction was 98.7% and
the average velocity magnitude accuracy was 93.2%. According to the results of
testing the model on three patient-specific geometries, model can be considered
as an alternative to finite element methods as well as other hard-to-implement
and time-consuming numerical simulations.

promising new technology offer exciting possibilities for creating higher
performance robotic devices. Granular jamming is achieved via the application
of a vacuum pressure inside a membrane containing particulate matter, and is
particularly interesting from a design perspective, as a myriad of design
parameters can potentially be exploited to induce a diverse variety of useful
behaviours. To date, the effect of variables such as grain shape and size, as
well as membrane material, have been studied as a means of inducing bespoke
gripping performance, however the other main contributing factor, membrane
morphology, has not been studied due to its particular complexities in both
accurate modelling and fabrication. This research presents the first study that
optimises membrane morphology for granular jamming grippers, combining
multi-material 3D printing and an evolutionary algorithm to search through a
varied morphology design space in materio. Entire generations are printed in a
single run and gripper retention force is tested and used as a fitness measure.
Our approach is relatively scalable, circumvents the need for modelling, and
guarantees the real-world performance of the grippers considered. Results show
that membrane morphology is a key determinant of gripper performance. Common
high performance designs are seen to optimise all three of the main identified
mechanisms by which granular grippers generate grip force, are significantly
different from a standard gripper morphology, and generalise well across a
range of test objects.

  We develop new techniques for adaptive minimization, applying them to a few

adaptive probability minimization problems which we call threshold problems. By
providing near-optimal solutions to these threshold problems, we obtain
bicriteria adaptive policies.
  We apply this method to obtain an adaptive approximation algorithm for the

minimize the expected minimum value seen among them, subject to a knapsack

does not hold in many real-world scenarios where massive data is collected from
a stream and storing and accessing all the data becomes impractical due to

resistive instabilities feeding off an inhomogeneous twist profile within the
open circuit. This paper considers the stability of a weakly sheared,
quantizing magnetic field in which the current is supported by a relativistic
particle flow. The electromagnetic field is almost perfectly force-free, and
the particles are confined to the lowest Landau state, experiencing no
appreciable curvature drift. In a charge-neutral plasma, we find multiple
branches of slowly growing tearing modes, relativistic analogs of the double
tearing mode, with peak growth rate $s \gtrsim 4\pi \widetilde k_y J_z/B_z$.
Here, $B_z$ is the strong (nearly potential) guide magnetic field, $J_z$ the
field-aligned current density, and $\widetilde k_y$ is the mode wavenumber
normalized by the current gradient scale. These modes are overstable when the
plasma carries net charge, with real frequency $\omega \sim s\cdot |n_0^+ -
n_0^-|/(n_0^+ + n_0^-)$ proportional to the imbalance in the densities of
positive and negative charges. An isolated current sheet thinner than the skin
depth supports localized tearing modes with growth rate scaling as (sheet
thickness/skin depth)$^{-1/2}$. In a pulsar, the peak growth rate is comparable
to the angular frequency of rotation, $s \gtrsim 2\widetilde k_y \Omega$, slow
compared with the longitudinal oscillations of particles and fields in a polar
gap. The resistive modes experience azimuthal drift reminiscent of sub-pulse
drift and are a promising driver of pulse-to-pulse flux variations. A companion
paper demonstrates a Cerenkov-like instability of current-carrying Alfv\'en
waves in thin current sheets with relativistic particle flow, and proposes
coherent curvature emission by these waves as a source of pulsar radio
emission.

Growth is rapid at wavenumbers below the inverse ambient skin depth $k_{p,\rm
ex}$. Small-scale Alfv\'enic wavepackets are promising sources of coherent
curvature radiation. When the group Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm gr} \lesssim
(k_{p,\rm ex}R_c)^{1/3} \sim 100$, where $R_c$ is the magnetic curvature
radius, a fraction $\sim 10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$ of the particle kinetic energy is
radiated into the extraordinary mode at a peak frequency $\sim 10^{-2}ck_{p,\rm
ex}$. Consistency with observations requires a high pair multiplicity ($\sim
10^{3-5}$) in the pulsar magnetosphere. Neither the primary, slow resistive
instability nor the secondary, Alfv\'enic instability depend directly on the
presence of magnetospheric `gaps', and may activate where the mean current is
fully supplied by outward drift of the corotation charge. The resistive mode is
overstable and grows at a rate comparable to the stellar spin frequency; the
model directly accommodates strong pulse-to-pulse radio flux variations and
coordinated subpulse drift. Alfv\'en mode growth can track the local plasma
conditions, allowing for lower-frequency emission from the outer magnetosphere.
Beamed radio emission from charged packets with $\gamma_{\rm gr} \sim 50-100$
also varies on sub-millisecond timescales. The modes identified here will be
excited inside the magnetosphere of a magnetar, and may mediate Taylor
relaxation of the magnetic twist.

connectomics based on statistical associations between neural activity,
association does not necessarily incorporate causation. Additional approaches
have been proposed to incorporate aspects of causality to turn functional
connectomes into causal functional connectomes, however, these methodologies
typically focus on specific aspects of causality. This warrants a systematic
statistical framework for causal functional connectomics that defines the

contrasting existing approaches and to guide development of further causal
methodologies. In this work, we develop such a statistical guide. In

causal modeling in the statistics literature. We particularly focus on the
introduction of directed Markov graphical models as a framework through which
we define the Directed Markov Property -- an essential criterion for examining
the causality of proposed functional connectomes. We demonstrate how based on

graph for the ReRAM channel is constructed, inside which specific messages are
updated iteratively to get a better estimation of the sneak path affected

Tailored for the joint detector and decoder over the ReRAM channel, effective

complex stress relaxation when the flow abruptly stops. Using rotational
rheometry, we study the two-step relaxation of aqueous cornstarch suspensions
out of the DST state upon flow cessation and show that the DST fluid retains
the memory of its shear-thickening state until the shear stress reaches a
constant value at late times. We find that this residual stress at the end of
the relaxation increases with the steady-state viscosity before the cessation.
Furthermore, the timescales that characterize the two-step exponential decay of
the shear stress exhibit near linear dependence on the steady-state viscosity.
Within the current framework that ascribes DST to the breakdown of hydrodynamic
lubrication layers leading to interparticle frictional contacts, the lasting
effects of the steady-state viscosity suggest that the memory of frictional
contacts persists until the end of the relaxation, despite the presence of
repulsive forces between the particles. These results indicate that complete,
spontaneous relaxation of the system out of DST is stalled by the partial
retention of the frictional force chains, which may be caused by the stationary
boundaries and the adhesion between cornstarch particles.

preliminary evidence is that such a condensate exists, at least for strong

been observed experimentally in TMDCs materials PdS2 and PdSe2. Here, we report
a theoretical prediction of the pressure-induced evolutions of crystal
structure and electronic structure of PdSSe, an isomorphous intermediate
material of the orthorhombic PdS2 and PdSe2. A series of pressure-induced
structural phase transitions from the layered orthorhombic structure into an
intermediate phase, then to a cubic phase are revealed. The intermediate phase
features the same structure symmetry as the ambient orthorhombic phase, except
for drastic collapsed interlayer distances and striking changes of the
coordination polyhedron. Furthermore, the structural phase transitions are
accompanied by electronic structure variations from semiconductor to semimetal,
which are attributed to bandwidth broaden and orbital-selective mechanisms.
Especially, the cubic phase PdSSe is distinct from the cubic PdS2 and PdSe2
materials by breaking inversion and mirror-plane symmetries, but showing
similar superconductivity under high pressure, which is originated from strong
electron-phonon coupling interactions concomitant with topologically nontrivial
Weyl and high-fold Fermions. The intricate interplay between lattice, charge,
and orbital degrees of freedom as well as the topologically nontrivial states
in these compounds will further stimulate wide interest to explore the exotic
physics of the TMDCs materials.

  In this paper, we study deterministic algorithms for this problem that are
also restricted to carrying out walks of length $t$ from $u$ and seeing which

oracle access to a function $f : [d]^t\to \{0,1\}$ where $f(x)$ is $1$ if the

Chemotherapy drug administration is a complex problem that often requires
expensive clinical trials to evaluate potential regimens. One way to alleviate
this burden and better inform future trials is to build reliable models for
drug administration. Previous chemotherapy optimization models have mainly
relied on optimal control, which does not lend itself to capturing complex and
vital operational constraints in chemotherapy planning involving discrete
decisions, such as doses via pills and rest periods. In addition, most of the
existing models for chemotherapy optimization lack an explicit toxicity measure
and impose toxicity constraints primarily through (fixed) limits on drug
concentration. The existing stochastic optimization models also focus on
maximizing the probability of cure when tumor heterogeneity is uncertain. In
this paper, we develop a mixed-integer program for combination chemotherapy
(utilization of multiple drugs) optimization that incorporates various
important operational constraints and, besides dose and concentration limits,
controls treatment toxicity based on its effect on the count of white blood
cells. To address the uncertainty of tumor heterogeneity, we propose chance
constraints that guarantee reaching an operable tumor size with a high
probability in a neoadjuvant setting. We present analytical results pertinent
to the accuracy of the model in representing biological processes of
chemotherapy and establish its merit for clinical applications through a
numerical study of breast cancer.

unweighted (multi)-graphs. This marks the first improvement for this problem
since a running time bound of $\tilde O(mn)$ was established by several papers
in the early 1990s.
  Our global minimum cut algorithm is obtained as a corollary of a minimum
Steiner cut algorithm, where a minimum Steiner cut is a minimum (weight) set of
edges whose removal disconnects at least one pair of vertices among a
designated set of terminal vertices. The running time of our deterministic
minimum Steiner cut algorithm matches that of the global minimum cut algorithm

because of a faster maximum flow subroutine; this improves the best known
randomized algorithm for the minimum Steiner cut problem as well.
  Our main technical contribution is a new tool that we call *isolating cuts*.
Given a set of vertices $R$, this entails finding cuts of minimum weight that
separate (or isolate) each individual vertex $v\in R$ from the rest of the
vertices $R\setminus \{v\}$. Na\""ively, this can be done using $|R|$ maximum
flow calls, but we show that just $O(\log |R|)$ suffice for finding isolating

In this paper, we propose two approaches known as oblique and rotation double
random forests. In the first approach, we propose rotation based double random
forest. In rotation based double random forests, transformation or rotation of
the feature space is generated at each node. At each node different random
feature subspace is chosen for evaluation, hence the transformation at each
node is different. Different transformations result in better diversity among
the base learners and hence, better generalization performance. With the double
random forest as base learner, the data at each node is transformed via two
different transformations namely, principal component analysis and linear
discriminant analysis. In the second approach, we propose oblique double random
forest. Decision trees in random forest and double random forest are
univariate, and this results in the generation of axis parallel split which
fails to capture the geometric structure of the data. Also, the standard random
forest may not grow sufficiently large decision trees resulting in suboptimal
performance. To capture the geometric properties and to grow the decision trees
of sufficient depth, we propose oblique double random forest. The oblique
double random forest models are multivariate decision trees. At each non-leaf
node, multisurface proximal support vector machine generates the optimal plane
for better generalization performance. Also, different regularization
techniques are employed for tackling the small sample size problems in the

spectrum at the time of need because CR nodes can sense vacant bands of
spectrum and can also access them to carry out communication. Various
capabilities of CR nodes depend upon efficient and continuous reporting of data
with each other and centralized base stations, which in turn can cause leakage
in privacy. Experimental studies have shown that the privacy of CR users can be
compromised easily during the cognition cycle, because they are knowingly or
unknowingly sharing various personally identifiable information (PII), such as
location, device ID, signal status, etc. In order to preserve this privacy
leakage, various privacy preserving strategies have been developed by
researchers, and according to us differential privacy is the most significant
among them.

structure for reporting $(s,t)$ mincuts (and by duality, the values of $(s,t)$
maxflows) for all pairs of vertices $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph. Gomory
and Hu showed that it can be computed using $n-1$ exact maxflow computations.
Surprisingly, this remains the best algorithm for Gomory-Hu trees more than 50
years later, *even for approximate mincuts*. In this paper, we break this
longstanding barrier and give an algorithm for computing a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree using $\text{polylog}(n)$ maxflow
computations. Specifically, we obtain the runtime bounds we describe below.
  We obtain a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm for undirected, weighted
graphs that runs in $\tilde O(m + n^{3/2})$ time and returns a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree algorithm w.h.p. Previously, the best
running time known was $\tilde O(n^{5/2})$, which is obtained by running Gomory
and Hu's original algorithm on a cut sparsifier of the graph.
  Next, we obtain a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm for undirected,
unweighted graphs that runs in $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ time and returns a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree algorithm w.h.p. This improves on our
first result for sparse graphs, namely $m = o(n^{9/8})$. Previously, the best
running time known for unweighted graphs was $\tilde O(mn)$ for an exact
Gomory-Hu tree (Bhalgat et al., STOC 2007); no better result was known if
approximations are allowed.
  As a consequence of our Gomory-Hu tree algorithms, we also solve the
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate all pairs mincut and single source mincut problems
in the same time bounds. (These problems are simpler in that the goal is to
only return the $(s,t)$ mincut values, and not the mincuts.) This improves on
the recent algorithm for these problems in $\tilde O(n^2)$ time due to Abboud
et al. (FOCS 2020).

directly apply AI-based methods to power systems because society cannot afford
cascading failures and large-scale blackouts, which easily cost billions of

develop, deploy, and evaluate AI systems in the energy sector by: (1)
understanding the power system measurements with physics, (2) designing AI
algorithms to forecast the need, (3) developing robust and accountable AI
methods, and (4) creating reliable measures to evaluate the performance of the

(PEF) as an example, which carefully analyzes synchrophasor patterns measured
by the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Such a physical understanding leads to
a data-driven framework that reduces the dimensionality with physics and
forecasts the event with high credibility. Specifically, for dimensionality
reduction, machine learning arranges physical information from different
dimensions, resulting inefficient information extraction. For event
forecasting, the supervised learning model fuses the results of different
models to increase the confidence. Finally, comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the high accuracy, efficiency, and reliability as compared to other

made for simplicity, and different groups developed their codes. A robust test
of these models/approaches is challenging because of the lack of directly
measured physical parameters. Fortunately, the viewing angle inferred from the
afterglow modeling is widely anticipated to be the same as the inclination
angle of the binary neutron star (BNS) mergers that can be evaluated with the
gravitational wave (GW) data. Therefore in the future, it is possible to
calibrate the afterglow modeling with the GW inclination angle measurements. We
take three methods, including both analytical estimations and direct
simulations, to project the uncertainties of the inclination angle
measurements. For some BNS mergers accompanied with electromagnetic
counterparts detected in the O4/O5 runs of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/LIGO-India
detectors, we show that the inclination angle can be determined within an
uncertainty of $\leq 0.1$ rad, supposing that the Hubble constant is known with
an accuracy of $\leq 3\%$ and the uncertainty of Hubble flow velocity is within
$\sim 1 \%$. The off-axis GRB outflow will give rise to afterglow emission, and
the most energetic ones may be detectable at the distance of $\sim$ 100-200 Mpc
even for a viewing angle of $\geq 0.3$ rad. Such events can thus serve as a
robust test of the afterglow modeling approach. We have also evaluated the
prospect of resolving the so-called Hubble tension with a single GW/GRB
association event. We find out that a $\sim 3\%$ precision Hubble constant is
obtainable if the uncertainty of the viewing angle can be constrained to be
within $\sim 0.1$ rad, which is expected to be the case for some nearby ($\leq
250$ Mpc) bright/on-axis GRBs with a well-behaved afterglow light curve
displaying a clear achromatic break at early times.

increase with energy and accumulate to detectable levels over large distances.
Astrophysical observations involving high-energy emissions and long baselines

facilitates the applications of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in
recommendation tasks. In the interaction graph, edges between user and item
nodes function as the main element of GCNs to perform information propagation
and generate informative representations. Nevertheless, an underlying challenge
lies in the quality of interaction graph, since observed interactions with
less-interested items occur in implicit feedback (say, a user views
micro-videos accidentally). This means that the neighborhoods involved with
such false-positive edges will be influenced negatively and the signal on user
preference can be severely contaminated. However, existing GCN-based
recommender models leave such challenge under-explored, resulting in suboptimal
representations and performance. In this work, we focus on adaptively refining
the structure of interaction graph to discover and prune potential
false-positive edges. Towards this end, we devise a new GCN-based recommender
model, \emph{Graph-Refined Convolutional Network} (GRCN), which adjusts the
structure of interaction graph adaptively based on status of model training,
instead of remaining the fixed structure. In particular, a graph refining layer
is designed to identify the noisy edges with the high confidence of being
false-positive interactions, and consequently prune them in a soft manner. We
then apply a graph convolutional layer on the refined graph to distill
informative signals on user preference. Through extensive experiments on three
datasets for micro-video recommendation, we validate the rationality and
effectiveness of our GRCN. Further in-depth analysis presents how the refined
graph benefits the GCN-based recommender model.

use supervised approaches to achieve fairness. However, in the real world,
getting data with trustworthy ground truth is challenging and also ground truth
can contain human bias. Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning
technique where, incrementally, labeled data is used to generate pseudo-labels
for the rest of the data (and then all that data is used for model training).
In this work, we apply four popular semi-supervised techniques as
pseudo-labelers to create fair classification models. Our framework, Fair-SSL,
takes a very small amount (10%) of labeled data as input and generates
pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. We then synthetically generate new data
points to balance the training data based on class and protected attribute as
proposed by Chakraborty et al. in FSE 2021. Finally, the classification model
is trained on the balanced pseudo-labeled data and validated on test data.
After experimenting on ten datasets and three learners, we find that Fair-SSL
achieves similar performance as three state-of-the-art bias mitigation
algorithms. That said, the clear advantage of Fair-SSL is that it requires only
10% of the labeled training data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

compare two different types of images, categorized as animal and object, by
predicting ABM values directly from image features extracted from convolutional
neural network (CNN), and indirectly from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. First, for two sets of images, we separately extract their average
features from layers of Alexnet, a classic model of CNN, then input the
features into a trained linear regression model to predict ABM values, and we
find higher-level instead of lower-level image features determine the
categorical difference in AB effect, and mid-level image features predict ABM
values more correctly than low-level and high-level image features. Then we
employ fMRI data from different brain regions collected when the subjects
viewed 50 test images to predict ABM values, and conclude that brain regions
covering relatively broader areas, like LVC, HVC and VC, perform better than
other smaller brain regions, which means AB effect is more related to synthetic
impact of several visual brain regions than only one particular visual regions.

resampling for restoration, which learns continuous gradient fields of point
clouds that converge points towards the underlying surface. In particular, we
represent a point cloud via its gradient field -- the gradient of the
log-probability density function, and enforce the gradient field to be
continuous, thus guaranteeing the continuity of the model for solvable
optimization. Based on the continuous gradient fields estimated via a proposed
neural network, resampling a point cloud amounts to performing gradient-based
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on the input noisy or sparse point cloud.
Further, we propose to introduce regularization into the gradient-based MCMC
during point cloud restoration, which essentially refines the intermediate
resampled point cloud iteratively and accommodates various priors in the
resampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed point set resampling achieves the state-of-the-art performance in

inevitably exist in the tiltrotor, which bring great challenges to the
controller design in transition mode. In this paper, we combined a
super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with an adaptive recursive
sliding mode control (ARSMC) together to design a tiltrotor aircraft attitude
system controller in transition mode using STESO-ARSMC (SAC). Firstly, the six
degrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear mathematical model of tiltrotor is
established. Secondly, the states and disturbances are estimated by the STES
observer. Thirdly, ARSM controller is designed to achieve finite time
convergence. The Lyapunov function is used to testify the convergence of the
tiltrotor UAV system. The new aspect is that the assessments of the states are
incorporated into the control rules to adjust for disruptions. When compared to
prior techniques, the control system proposed in this work can considerably
enhance anti-disturbance performance. Finally, simulation tests are used to
demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested technique.

subsurface zone. Loss of circulation is a common problem that often causes
interruptions to the drilling process and a reduction in efficiency. In this
work, a semi-analytical solution and mud type-curves (MTC) are proposed to
offer a quick and accurate diagnostic model to assess the lost-circulation of
Herschel-Bulkley fluids in fractured media. Based on the observed transient
pressure and mud-loss trends, the model can estimate the effective fracture
conductivity, the time-dependent cumulative mud-loss volume, and the leakage
period. The behavior of lost-circulation into fractured formation can be
quickly evaluated, at the drilling site, to perform useful diagnostics, such as
the rate of fluid leakage, and the associated effective fracture hydraulic
properties. Further, novel derivative-based mud-type-curves (DMTC) are
developed to quantify the leakage of drilling fluid flow into fractures. The
developed model is applied for non-Newtonian fluids exhibiting yield-power-law,
including shear thickening and thinning, and Bingham plastic fluids. Proposing
new dimensionless groups generates the dual type-curves, MTC and DMTC, which
offer superior predictivity compared to traditional methods. Both type-curve
sets are used in a dual trend matching, which significantly reduces the
non-uniqueness issue that is typically encountered in type-curves. Data for
lost circulation from several field cases are presented to demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed method. The semi-analytical solver, combined with
Monte Carlo simulations, is then applied to assess the sensitivity and
uncertainty of various fluid and subsurface parameters. The proposed can serve

is that they involve a `growth parameter' $r$ and a semi-algebraic predicate
$\Pi(o,o';r)$ of constant complexity on pairs of input objects, which depends
on $r$ and is monotone in $r$. One then defines a graph $G(r)$ whose edges are
all the pairs $(o,o')$ for which $\Pi(o,o';r)$ is true, and seeks the smallest
value of $r$ for which some monotone property holds for $G(r)$.
  Problems that fit into this context include (i) the reverse shortest path
problem in unit-disk graphs, recently studied by Wang and Zhao, (ii) the same
problem for weighted unit-disk graphs, with a decision procedure recently
provided by Wang and Xue, (iii) extensions of these problems to three and
higher dimensions, (iv) the discrete Fr\'echet distance with one-sided
shortcuts in higher dimensions, extending the study by Ben Avraham et al., (v)
perfect matchings in intersection graphs: given, e.g., a set of fat ellipses of
roughly the same size, find the smallest value $r$ such that if we expand each
of the ellipses by $r$, the resulting intersection graph contains a perfect
matching, (vi) generalized distance selection problems: given, e.g., a set of
disjoint segments, find the $k$'th smallest distance among the pairwise
distances determined by the segments, for a given (sufficiently small but
superlinear) parameter $k$, and (vii) the maximum-height independent towers
problem, in which we want to erect vertical towers of maximum height over a
1.5-dimensional terrain so that no pair of tower tips are mutually visible.
  We obtain significantly improved solutions for problems (i), (ii) and (vi),

Despite the potential to surpass the behavioral policies, RL-based methods are
generally impractical due to the training instability and bootstrapping the
extrapolation errors, which always require careful hyperparameter tuning via
online evaluation. In contrast, offline imitation learning (IL) has no such
issues since it learns the policy directly without estimating the value

imitate neighboring policies with less data, we propose \textit{Curriculum
Offline Imitation Learning (COIL)}, which utilizes an experience picking

this problem is understanding which features are most influential in image
recognition tasks and how they are processed by CNNs. It is widely accepted
that CNN models combine low-level features to form complex shapes until the
object can be readily classified, however, several recent studies have argued
that texture features are more important than other features. In this paper, we
assume that the importance of certain features varies depending on specific
tasks, i.e., specific tasks exhibit a feature bias. We designed two
classification tasks based on human intuition to train deep neural models to
identify anticipated biases. We devised experiments comprising many tasks to
test these biases for the ResNet and DenseNet models. From the results, we
conclude that (1) the combined effect of certain features is typically far more
influential than any single feature; (2) in different tasks, neural models can
perform different biases, that is, we can design a specific task to make a
neural model biased toward a specific anticipated feature.

Monte--Carlo simulations with the Sucksmith--Thompson method were performed to
analyze the effect of magnetic anisotropy energy on the thermodynamic
properties. Our method successfully reproduced the negative sign of isothermal
magnetic entropy changes when a magnetic field was applied along the hard
plane. We found that the temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy is not negligible at temperatures slightly above the Curie
temperature. We clarified that the origin of this phenomenon is attributed to
anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and magnetization anisotropy. The
difference between the entropy change of the easy axis and the hard plane is
proportional to the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy,
implying that the anisotropic entropy term is the main source of the
temperature dependence of the free energy difference when magnetizing in a
specific direction other than the easy axis. We also investigated the magnetic
susceptibility that can be used for the characterization of the negative sign
of the entropy change in the case of a hard plane. The competition of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and external magnetic field at low
temperature and low magnetic field region causes a high magnetic susceptibility
as the fluctuation of magnetization. Meanwhile, the anisotropy energy is
suppressed at a sufficient magnetic field applied along the hard axis, the
magnetization is fully rotated to the direction of the external magnetic field.

are immensely challenging due to a number of quality factors. We present an
extensive account of the various approaches taken to solve the problem over the
years. This ranges from methods as early as Structure from Motion (SFM) based
approaches to recent solution frameworks involving deep neural networks. We
show that the long-term motion patterns alone play a pivotal role in the task
of recognizing an event. Consequently each video is significantly represented
by a fixed number of key-frames using a graph-based approach. Only the temporal
features are exploited using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) +
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The results we obtain are
encouraging as they outperform standard temporal CNNs and are at par with those
using spatial information along with motion cues. Further exploring multistream
models, we conceive a multi-tier fusion strategy for the spatial and temporal
wings of a network. A consolidated representation of the respective individual
prediction vectors on video and frame levels is obtained using a biased
conflation technique. The fusion strategy endows us with greater rise in
precision on each stage as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and thus a
powerful consensus is achieved in classification. Results are recorded on four
benchmark datasets widely used in the domain of action recognition, namely CCV,
HMDB, UCF-101 and KCV. It is inferable that focusing on better classification
of the video sequences certainly leads to robust actuation of a system designed

coordinated aggregates in a tissue, exhibit strong coupling between chemical
signalling and mechanical responses to internally or externally applied
stresses. Intercellular communication in combination with such coordination of
morphogenetic movements can lead to drastic modifications in the calcium
distribution in the cells. In this paper we extend the recent mechanochemical
model in [K. Kaouri, P.K. Maini, P.A. Skourides, N. Christodoulou, S.J.
Chapman. J. Math. Biol., 78 (2019) 2059--2092], for an epithelial continuum in
one dimension, to a more realistic multi-dimensional case. The resulting
parametrised governing equations consist of an advection-diffusion-reaction
system for calcium signalling coupled with active-stress linear viscoelasticity
and equipped with pure Neumann boundary conditions. We implement a mixed finite
element method for the simulation of this complex multiphysics problem. Special
care is taken in the treatment of the stress-free boundary conditions for the
viscoelasticity in order to eliminate rigid motions from the space of
admissible displacements. The stability and solvability of the continuous weak
formulation is shown using fixed-point theory. We investigate numerically the
solutions of this system and show that solitary waves and periodic wavetrains
of calcium propagate through the embryonic epithelial sheet. We analyse the
bifurcations of the system guided by the bifurcation analysis of the
one-dimensional model. We also demonstrate the nucleation of calcium sparks
into synchronous calcium waves coupled with contraction. This coupled model can
be employed to gain insights into recent experimental observations in the

Dual Progressive Prototype Network (DPPN), constructs two types of prototypes
that record prototypical visual patterns for attributes and categories,

attribute-related local regions and updates corresponding attribute prototypes
to progressively explore accurate attribute-region correspondence. This enables
DPPN to produce visual representations with accurate attribute localization
ability, which benefits the semantic-visual alignment and representation
transferability. Besides, along with progressive attribute localization, DPPN
further projects category prototypes into multiple spaces to progressively
repel visual representations from different categories, which boosts category
discriminability. Both attribute and category prototypes are collaboratively
learned in a unified framework, which makes visual representations of DPPN
transferable and distinctive. Experiments on four benchmarks prove that DPPN
effectively alleviates the domain shift problem in GZSL.

to make detailed measurements of the stored muon beam profile, which are
essential for the experiment to achieve its uncertainty goals. Positrons from
muon decays spiral inward and pass through the tracking detector before
striking an electromagnetic calorimeter. The tracking detector is therefore
located inside the vacuum chamber in a region where the magnetic field is large
and non-uniform. As such, the tracking detector must have a low leak rate to
maintain a high-quality vacuum, must be non-magnetic so as not to perturb the
magnetic field and, to minimize energy loss, must have a low radiation length.
The performance of the tracking detector has met or surpassed the design
requirements, with adequate electronic noise levels, an average straw hit
resolution of $(110 \pm 20) \,\mu$m, a detection efficiency of 97% or higher,
and no performance degradation or signs of aging. The tracking detector's
measurements result in an otherwise unachievable understanding of the muon's
beam motion, particularly at early times in the experiment's measurement period
when there are a significantly greater number of muons decaying. This is vital
to the statistical power of the experiment, as well as facilitating the precise
extraction of several systematic corrections and uncertainties. This paper
describes the design, construction, testing, commissioning, and performance of
the tracking detector.

classifying cracks from image data using deep convolutional neural networks;
however, minimal research has been conducted to study the efficacy of network
performance when noisy images are used. This paper will address the problem and
is dedicated to investigating the influence of image noise on network accuracy.
The methods used incorporate a benchmark image data set, which is purposely
deteriorated with two types of noise, followed by treatment with image
enhancement pre-processing techniques. These images, including their native
counterparts, are then used to train and validate two different networks to
study the differences in accuracy and performance. Results from this research
reveal that noisy images have a moderate to high impact on the network's
capability to accurately classify images despite the application of image
pre-processing. A new index has been developed for finding the most efficient
method for classification in terms of computation timing and accuracy.
Consequently, AlexNet was selected as the most efficient model based on the
proposed index.

in-context learning, where the model learns to do a downstream task simply by
conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples. The LM learns
from these examples without being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it is
unclear what enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study how
in-context learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-range
coherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept to generate
coherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time, in-context learning
occurs when the LM also infers a shared latent concept between examples in a
prompt. We prove when this occurs despite a distribution mismatch between
prompts and pretraining data in a setting where the pretraining distribution is
a mixture of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train LMs
capable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale synthetic dataset
(GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit in-context learning. Beyond
the theory, experiments on GINC exhibit large-scale real-world phenomena

long-term stability, mostly associated to ion migration. The specific role of
non-covalent bonds in contributing to the stability remains elusive, and in
certain cases controversial. Here, we perform an investigation on a large
perovskite chemical space via a combination of first-principles calculations
for the bond strengths and the recently developed Sure Independent Screening
and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) algorithm. The latter is used to formulate
mathematical descriptors that, by highlighting the importance of specific
non-covalent molecular bonds, can guide the design of perovskites with
suppressed ion migration. The results unveil the distinct nature of different
non-covalent interactions, with remarkable differences compared to previous
arguments and interpretations in the literature on the basis of smaller
chemical spaces. In particular, we clarify the origin of the higher stability
offered by FA compared to MA, which shows to be different from previous
arguments in the literature, the reasons of the improved stability given by the
halogen F, and explain the exceptional case of overall stronger bonds for
Guanidiunium. The found descriptors reveal the criteria that, within the
stability boundaries given by the Goldschmidt factor, give an all-in-one
picture of non-covalent interactions which provide the more stable
configurations, also including interactions other than H-bonds. Such
descriptors are more informative than previously used quantities and can be
used as universal input to better inform new machine learning studies.

strong correlation between $\gamma$-ray luminosity and blackhole mass. Strong
$\gamma$-ray emission is typical in blazars, and the emission is always boosted

processes, but the data for their rheological properties are almost missing,
due to the specific difficulties in the respective experiments. In the current
study we describe a methodology for measuring and comparing the shear
rheological properties of rotator (R) and crystalline (C) phases formed in bulk
hydrocarbons at temperatures below the melting temperature. We apply this
approach to characterize the rheological properties of R and C phases formed
upon cooling of alkanes with chain length varied between 17 and 30 carbon
atoms. For comparison, we study also several alkane mixtures and one alkene
with double bond at the end of its chain. The obtained results show that the
storage and loss moduli of the rotator phases are ca. 10-times lower than those
of the respective crystalline phases. We found also that the rheological
properties of the crystal phases depend mainly on the subcooling temperature
below the crystallization temperature, while the R phases become softer with
the increase of the molecular length. We explain these results by assuming that
the rheological properties of the crystal phases are determined mainly by the
sliding of the ordered crystal domains with respect to each other, while in the
rotator phases we have multiple defects in the molecular packing which increase
with the alkane length. The proposed methodology and the obtained results serve
as a solid basis for further rheological studies of this important class of

on a theoretical level to derive insights and is also well suited for
implementation in Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical software. The
spherical wave function coefficients are calculated directly from near-field

significant impact on the transient optical response of nickel and on its

high demand for forecasting PV output to better integrate PV generation into

review 180 papers on PV forecasts and extract a database of forecast errors for

output forecasting. The use of data processing techniques is positively
correlated with the forecast quality, while the lengths of the forecast horizon

practice, reaction is often imperfect and can necessitate multiple random
encounters between reactants. In confined geometries, despite notable recent
advances, there is to date no general analytical treatment of such imperfect
transport-limited reaction kinetics. Here, we determine the kinetics of
imperfect reactions in confining domains for any diffusive or anomalously
diffusive Markovian transport process, and for different models of imperfect
reactivity. We show that the full distribution of reaction times is obtained in
the large confining volume limit from the knowledge of the mean reaction time
only, which we determine explicitly. This distribution for imperfect reactions
is found to be identical to that of perfect reactions upon an appropriate
rescaling of parameters, which highlights the robustness of our results.
Strikingly, this holds true even in the regime of low reactivity where the mean
reaction time is independent of the transport process, and can lead to large
fluctuations of the reaction time even in simple reaction schemes. We
illustrate our results for normal diffusion in domains of generic shape, and
for anomalous diffusion in complex environments, where our predictions are
confirmed by numerical simulations.

service station? The answer to this question clearly depends on the average
rate at which jobs arrive at the queue and on the average rate of service.
Somewhat less obvious is the fact that stochastic fluctuations in service and
arrival times are also important, and that these are a major source of backlogs
and delays. Strategies that could mitigate fluctuations induced delays are in
high demand as queue structures appear in various natural and man-made systems.
Here we demonstrate that a simple service resetting mechanism can reverse the
deleterious effects of large fluctuations in service times, thus turning a
marked drawback into a favourable advantage. This happens when stochastic
fluctuations are intrinsic to the server, and we show that the added feature of
service resetting can then dramatically cut down average queue lengths and
waiting times. While the analysis presented herein is based on the M/G/1
queueing model where service is general but arrivals are assumed to be
Markovian, Kingman's formula asserts that the benefits of service resetting
will carry over to queues with general arrivals. We thus expect results coming
from this work to find widespread application to queueing systems ranging from
telecommunications, via computing, and all the way to molecular queues that
emerge in enzymatic and metabolic cycles of living organisms.

incorporate the MEM into the information filter (IF) style, we use the
moment-matching technique to derive two pair linear models with only additive
noise. The separation is merely in a fashion, and the cross-correlation between
states is preserved as parameters in each other's model. As a result, the
closed-form expressions are transferred into an alternating iteration of two
linear IFs. With the two models, a centralized IF is proposed wherein the
measurements are converted into a summation of innovation parts. Later, under a
sensor network with the communication nodes and sensor nodes, we present two
distributed IFs through the consensus on information and consensus on
measurement schemes, respectively. Moreover, we prove the estimation errors of
the proposed filter are exponentially bounded in the mean square. The benefits
are testified by numerical experiments in comparison to state-of-the-art

can handle large-scale instances. The three models describe different case
studies of the hydroelectric power plants in the Swedish river
Skellefte\""alven. The models are two-stage stochastic programs with sampled
scenarios that describe uncertain electricity prices and local water inflows.
The first model is a day-ahead planning problem that concerns how to determine
optimal order strategies in a day-ahead energy market. We pose this problem
from the perspective of a hydropower producer, who participates in the Nordic
day-ahead market and operates in the Swedish river Skellefte\""alven. We
implement the day-ahead model using our computational tools and then solve
large-scale instances of the problem in a distributed environment. A
statistically significant value of running stochastic planning is obtained
using a sample-based algorithm. Next, we consider a variation of the day-ahead
problem that includes preventive maintenance scheduling. We show how intricate
coordination between the submitteed market orders and the maintenance schedule
results in a larger value of the stochastic solution than the day-ahead
problem. The final model is a capacity expansion problem with a long planning
horizon. The same methodology is applied as when solving the first two
hydropower problems. However, the planning horizon is considerably longer, from
one year up to 20 years compared to a 24 hour horizon. We note that the
relative significance of the value of the stochastic solution is much greater
when comparing to the extra profits incurred from the capacity expansion
instead of the total profit.

overall performance. Due to the generalization and scale of the knowledge
graph, most knowledge relationships are not helpful for a target user-item
prediction. To exploit the knowledge graph to capture target-specific knowledge
relationships in recommender systems, we need to distill the knowledge graph to
reserve the useful information and refine the knowledge to capture the users'
preferences. To address the issues, we propose Knowledge-aware Conditional
Attention Networks (KCAN), which is an end-to-end model to incorporate
knowledge graph into a recommender system. Specifically, we use a
knowledge-aware attention propagation manner to obtain the node representation
first, which captures the global semantic similarity on the user-item network

automatically distill the knowledge graph into the target-specific subgraph
based on the knowledge-aware attention. Afterward, by applying a conditional
attention aggregation on the subgraph, we refine the knowledge graph to obtain
target-specific node representations. Therefore, we can gain both
representability and personalization to achieve overall performance.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

structure. The approach includes the proposal of the AE architecture, a novel
ISAC loss function, and the training procedure. Numerical results demonstrate
the power of the proposed AE, in particular under hardware impairments.

technique is limited by the finite coherence time of the light sources when the
interference paths are not balanced. Higher-order interference effects involve
intensity correlations between multiple detectors and may have the advantage
over the traditional second order interference effect exhibited in only one
detector. We discuss various scenarios in fourth-order interference with
unbalanced delays in different paths. We find in some cases, interference
effect persists even when the delays are much larger than the coherence time of
the sources. We also extend the discussion to non-stationary pulsed fields,
which needs to consider the pulse shape and requires a different treatment.

were recently presented by Dixit et al. (2020) for skin friction in
zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs). In this work, a
new derivation is presented which shows that these relations (i) fundamentally
represent a dynamically-consistent scaling of skin friction for nominally
two-dimensional ZPG TBLs and fully-developed pipes and channels, and (ii) apply
individually to each of these flows. The new theoretical arguments are based on
transfer of kinetic energy from mean flow to large eddies of turbulence and
depend neither on flow geometry nor outer boundary condition, both of which
distinguish one type of flow from the other. Using skin friction data from the
literature, it is demonstrated that the finite-$Re$ model describes, as
predicted by the theory, data from individual flows remarkably well; these data
cover the complete range of laboratory/simulation Reynolds numbers to date. It
is, however, observed that performance of the model degrades while attempting
to describe data from all flows in a universal fashion. Differences in outer
boundary condition and large-scale structures amongst different types of flows
appear to be responsible for this degradation. An empirical correction based on
Clauser's shape factor, is proposed to absorb the outer boundary condition
effects into the scaling of skin friction. This correction leads to a new
universal scaling and a robust, semi-empirical, universal finite-$Re$ model for
skin friction in ZPG TBLs, pipes and channels. Remarkable collapse of data from
all flows in the new scaling underscores the importance of a
dynamically-consistent approach towards revealing universality of skin friction
in wall turbulence.

Mach number and $\beta$ is the plasma beta. We study the properties of shocks
induced in these disparate environments, including the distribution of the
shock Mach number, $M_s$, and the dissipation of the turbulent energy at
shocks, through numerical simulations using a high-order accurate code based on
the WENO scheme. In particular, we investigate the effects of different modes
of the forcing that drives turbulence: solenoidal, compressive, and a mixture
of the two. In the ISM turbulence, while the density distribution looks
different with different forcings, the velocity power spectrum, $P_v$, on small
scales exhibits only weak dependence. Hence, the statistics of shocks depend
weakly on forcing either. In the ISM models with $M_{\rm turb}\approx10$ and
$\beta\sim0.1$, the fraction of the turbulent energy dissipated at shocks is
estimated to be $\sim15~\%$, not sensitive to the forcing mode. In contrast, in
the ICM turbulence, $P_v$ as well as the density distribution show strong
dependence on forcing. The frequency and average Mach number of shocks are
greater for compressive forcing than for solenoidal forcing, so is the energy
dissipation. The fraction of ensuing shock dissipation is in the range of
$\sim10-35~\%$ in the ICM models with $M_{\rm turb}\approx0.5$ and
$\beta\sim10^6$. The rest of the turbulent energy should be dissipated through
turbulent cascade.

number of vehicles on roads. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can help
the city traffic managers to tackle the problem by providing accurate traffic
forecasts. For this, ITS requires a reliable traffic prediction algorithm that
can provide accurate traffic prediction at multiple time steps based on past
and current traffic data. In recent years, a number of different methods for
traffic prediction have been proposed which have proved their effectiveness in
terms of accuracy. However, most of these methods have either considered
spatial information or temporal information only and overlooked the effect of
other. In this paper, to address the above problem a deep learning based
approach has been developed using both the spatial and temporal dependencies.
To consider spatio-temporal dependencies, nearby road sensors at a particular
instant are selected based on the attributes like traffic similarity and
distance. Two pre-trained deep auto-encoders were cross-connected using the
concept of latent space mapping and the resultant model was trained using the
traffic data from the selected nearby sensors as input. The proposed deep
learning based approach was trained using the real-world traffic data collected
from loop detector sensors installed on different highways of Los Angeles and
Bay Area. The traffic data is freely available from the web portal of the
California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System (PeMS).
The effectiveness of the proposed approach was verified by comparing it with a
number of machine/deep learning approaches. It has been found that the proposed
approach provides accurate traffic prediction results even for 60-min ahead
prediction with least error than other techniques.

the consideration of matrices of size three with spectral decomposition over

must be considered. Existing closed-form expressions are based on the use of
principal matrix invariants which suffer from a number of deficiencies when

expressions as function of the matrix elements. We prove and demonstrate by
numerical examples that this alternative approach leads to increased floating

a bio-inspired flapping-wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) entitled RoboFalcon, which
is equipped with a novel mechanism to drive the bat-style morphing wings,
performs a morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern, and overall manages an appealing
flight. The novel mechanism of RoboFalcon allows coupling the morphing and
flapping during level flight and decoupling these when maneuvering is required,
producing a bilateral asymmetric downstroke affording high rolling agility. The
bat-style morphing wing is designed with a tilted mounting angle around the
radius at the wrist joint to mimic the wrist supination and pronation effect of
flying vertebrates' forelimbs. The agility of RoboFalcon is assessed through
several rolling maneuver flight tests, and we demonstrate its well-performing
agility capability compared to flying creatures and current flapping-wing
platforms. Wind tunnel tests indicate that the roll moment of the asymmetric
downstroke is correlated with the flapping frequency, and the wrist mounting
angle can be used for tuning the angle of attack and lift-thrust configuration
of the equilibrium flight state. We believe that this work yields a
well-performing bionic platform and provides a new actuation strategy for the
morphing-coupled flapping flight.

existence of continuous solutions to the adjoint conditions associated with the
sensitivities of the orbital periods to parameter perturbations and constraint
violations, even though the linearization of the governing boundary-value

evaporation without contamination by organic materials. Defining rounded edges
and a thinner area in the center of the device allow to pre-determine the

asymmetric heating of both electrodes. New grains are formed in the slit and on

random access for massive uplink communication. In this modulation,
transmitters encode data as rank-1 tensors, with factors from a discrete vector
constellation. This construction allows to split the multi-user receiver into a
user separation step based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, and independent
single-user demappers. In this paper, we analyze the limits of the tensor
decomposition using Cram\'er-Rao bounds, providing bounds on the accuracy of
the estimated factors. These bounds are shown by simulation to be tight at high
SNR. We introduce an approximate perturbation model for the output of the
tensor decomposition, which facilitates the computation of the log-likelihood
ratios (LLR) of the transmitted bits, and provides an approximate achievable
bound for the finite-length error probability. Combining TBM with classical
forward error correction coding schemes such as polar codes, we use the
approximate LLR to derive soft-decision decoder showing a gain over
hard-decision decoders at low SNR.

proportional to the rotation rate. This leads to the dominant geostrophic
balance of forces in the flow between pressure gradient and Coriolis force. The
so-called geostrophic regime of rotating convection is difficult to study with

  To deal with this problem, we propose an architecture for auto-scaling cloud

near future. Our approach leverages on time-series forecasting techniques, like
those based on machine learning and artificial neural networks, to predict the
future dynamics of key metrics, e.g., resource consumption metrics, and apply a
threshold-based scaling policy on them. The result is a predictive automation
policy that is able, for instance, to automatically anticipate peaks in the

actions to accommodate the expected increase in traffic.
  We prototyped our approach as an open-source OpenStack component, which
relies on, and extends, the monitoring capabilities offered by Monasca,
resulting in the addition of predictive metrics that can be leveraged by
orchestration components like Heat or Senlin. We show experimental results
using a recurrent neural network and a multi-layer perceptron as predictor,

associate an image in question with a suspect camera. Various techniques have
been developed based on the analysis of the subtle traces left in the images
during the acquisition. The Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU) noise pattern
caused by sensor imperfections has been proven to be an effective way to
identify the source camera. The existing literature suggests that the PRNU is
the only fingerprint that is device-specific and capable of identifying the
exact source device. However, the PRNU is susceptible to camera settings, image
content, image processing operations, and counter-forensic attacks. A forensic
investigator unaware of counter-forensic attacks or incidental image
manipulations is at the risk of getting misled. The spatial synchronization
requirement during the matching of two PRNUs also represents a major limitation
of the PRNU. In recent years, deep learning based approaches have been
successful in identifying source camera models. However, the identification of
individual cameras of the same model through these data-driven approaches
remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we bring to light the existence of a new
robust data-driven device-specific fingerprint in digital images which is
capable of identifying the individual cameras of the same model. It is
discovered that the new device fingerprint is location-independent, stochastic,
and globally available, which resolve the spatial synchronization issue. Unlike
the PRNU, which resides in the high-frequency band, the new device fingerprint
is extracted from the low and mid-frequency bands, which resolves the fragility
issue that the PRNU is unable to contend with. Our experiments on various
datasets demonstrate that the new fingerprint is highly resilient to image
manipulations such as rotation, gamma correction, and aggressive JPEG
compression.

of the polarization of the gauge field undergoes tachyonic growth leading to
the generation of helical magnetic fields. We obtain the Langevin equations
associated with the electromagnetic fields which are in the form of
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equations. Consequently, the
tachyonic growth of the helical magnetic fields is balanced by a mean-reverting
process of stochastic dynamics such that the magnetic fields settle down to an
equilibrium state with the amplitude smaller than what is obtained in the
absence of the stochastic noises. Working in the parameter space of the model
where both the backreaction and the strong coupling problems are under control
the model does not provide large enough seed to be amplified by the galactic
dynamo as the source of the magnetic fields observed on cosmological scales.

gamma-ray emissions and that have a dipole of $10^{14}$ G to $10^{15}$ G. A
promising mechanism for explaining magnetar formation is magnetic field
amplification by the MRI in fast-rotating protoneutron stars (PNS). This
scenario is supported by recent global models, which showed that small-scale
turbulence can generate a dipole with magnetar-like intensity. However, the
impact of buoyancy and density stratification on the efficiency of the MRI in
generating a dipole is still unknown. We assess the impact of the density and
entropy profiles on the MRI dynamo in a global model of a fast-rotating PNS,
which focuses on its outer stratified region that is stable to convection.
Using the pseudo-spectral code MagIC, we performed 3D Boussinesq and anelastic
MHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit diffusivities. We performed
a parameter study in which we investigate the effect of different
approximations and of thermal diffusion. We obtain a self-sustained turbulent
MRI-driven dynamo. This confirms most of our previous incompressible results
once rescaled for density. The MRI also generates a nondominant equatorial
dipole, which represents about 4.3% of the averaged magnetic field strength.
Interestingly, in the presence of a density gradient, an axisymmetric magnetic
field at large scales oscillates with time, which can be described as a
mean-field $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo. Buoyancy damps turbulence in the equatorial
plane but it has overall a relatively weak influence with a realistic high
thermal diffusion. Our results support the ability of the MRI to generate
magnetar-like large-scale magnetic fields. They furthermore predict the
presence of an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in the protoneutron star, which could be
important to model in-situ magnetic field amplification in core-collapse
supernovae. [abridged]

  Deep Neural Search",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Shared e-mobility services have been widely tested and piloted in cities
across the globe, and already woven into the fabric of modern urban planning.
This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to
deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the
services are ubiquitous to the users while sustainable in profitability.
However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different
deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively
expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of
trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation
environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility
systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the
real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the
optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the
real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search
approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative
deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a
multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are
used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed
loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating
better deployment plans in future iterations. The proposed approach has been
evaluated extensively in our simulation environment, and experimental results
show that it outperforms baselines e.g., human knowledge, and state-of-the-art
heuristic-based optimization approaches in both service coverage and net
revenue.

to scene adaptation methods, we aim to retain the previously-learned knowledge,
and therefore employ a continual learning experience replay strategy to adapt
the network. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show successful
adaptation to real-world indoor scenes both on the ScanNet dataset and on
in-house data recorded with an RGB-D sensor. Our method increases the
segmentation accuracy on average by 9.9% compared to the fixed pre-trained

This system shows rich phase equilibria arising from the competition between
two different types of capillary condensation, corner filling and meniscus
depinning transitions depending on the value of the aspect ratio $a=L/H$ and
divides into three regimes: For long capillaries, with $a<2/\pi$, the
condensation is of type I involving menisci which are pinned at the top edges
at the ends of the capillary. For intermediate capillaries, with $2/\pi<a<1$,
depending on the value of the contact angle the condensation may be of type I
or of type II, in which the menisci overspill into the reservoir and there is
no pinning. For short capillaries, with $a>1$, condensation is always of type
II. In all regimes, capillary condensation is completely suppressed for
sufficiently large contact angles which is determined explicitly. For long and

transition in the condensed liquid-like phase, associated with the depinning of
each meniscus as they round the upper open edges of the slit. Meniscus
depinning is third-order for complete wetting and second-order for partial

super-resolved via model-based deep learning. TranSMS leverages a vision

several unsupervised heuristics that take advantage of the characteristics of
the dataset for selecting parameters instead of using class label information.
Unsupervised heuristics, while an order of magnitude faster, are scarcely used
under the assumption that their results are significantly worse than those of
grid search. To challenge that assumption we have conducted a wide study of
various heuristics for SVM parameter selection on over thirty datasets, in both
supervised and semi-supervised scenarios. In most cases, the cross-validation
grid search did not achieve a significant advantage over the heuristics. In
particular, heuristical parameter selection may be preferable for high

one-to-one correspondence with certain elements of $E$, called projections. An

so-called b-comparability property, which is an analogue of general
comparability in operator algebras or unital abelian groups. It is shown that

rational spectral resolution and its properties are studied. If in addition $E$
possesses a separating set of states, then every element $a\in E$ is determined
by its spectral resolution. It is also proved that for some types of interval
effect algebras (with RDP, archimedean divisible), spectrality of $E$ is
equivalent to spectrality of its universal group and the corresponding rational
spectral resolutions are the same. In particular, for convex archimedean effect
algebras, spectral resolutions in $E$ are in agreement with spectral
resolutions in the corresponding order unit space.

characteristics of the spinal anatomy, we introduce a view-specific acoustic
shadow reward to utilize the shadow information to implicitly guide the
navigation of the probe toward different standard views of the spine. Our
method is validated in both quantitative and qualitative experiments in a

average navigation accuracy toward different standard views achieves
5.18mm/5.25deg and 12.87mm/17.49deg in the intra- and inter-subject settings,

associated experimental data, necessitates that we develop mathematical models
to further our understanding of these systems. As biological systems are
generally not well understood, most mathematical models of these systems are
based on experimental data, resulting in a seemingly heterogeneous collection
of models that ostensibly represent the same system. To understand the system
we therefore need to know how the different models are related, with a view to
obtaining a unified mathematical description. This goal is complicated by the
fact that distinct mathematical formalisms may be used to represent the same
system, making direct comparison of the models very difficult. In previous work
we developed an appropriate framework for model comparison where we represent
models as labelled simplicial complexes and compare them with two general
methodologies: comparison by distance or equivalence. In this article we
continue the development of our model comparison methodology in two directions.
First, we present a rigorous and automatable methodology for the core process
of comparison by equivalence, namely determining the vertices in a simplicial
representation, corresponding to model components, that are conceptually
related and the identification of these vertices via simplicial operations. Our
methodology is based on considerations of vertex symmetry in the simplicial
representation, for which we develop the required mathematical theory of group
actions on simplicial complexes. This methodology greatly simplifies and
expedites the process of determining model equivalence. Second, we provide an
alternative mathematical framework for our model-comparison methodology by
representing models as groups, which allows for the direct application of
group-theoretic techniques within our model-comparison methodology.

self-gravity fluid in the expanding universe with $\Omega_\Lambda+\Omega_m=1$,
which extends our previous work in the static case. By use of field theory
techniques, we obtain the nonlinear, hyperbolic equation of 2-pt correlation
function $\xi$ of perturbation. Under the Zel'dolvich approximation the
equation becomes an integro-differential equation and contains also the 3-pt
and 4-pt correlation functions. By adopting the Groth-Peebles and Fry-Peebles
ansatz, the equation becomes closed, contains a pressure term and a delta
source term which were neglected in Davis and Peebles' milestone work. The
equation has three parameters of fluid: the particle mass $m$ in the source,
the overdensity $\gamma$, and the sound speed $c_s$. We solve only the linear
equation and apply to the system of galaxies. We assume two models of $c_s$
and, take an initial power spectrum at a redshift $z=7$, which inherits the
relevant imprint from the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations at the
decoupling. The solution $\xi({\bf r}, z)$ is growing during expansion, and
contains $100$Mpc periodic bumps at large scales, and a main mountain (a global
maximum with $\xi \propto r^{-1}$) at small scales $r\lesssim 50$Mpc. The
profile of $\xi$ agrees with the observed ones from galaxy and quasar surveys.
The bump separation is given by the Jeans length $\lambda_J$ as the correlation
scale, also modified by $\gamma$ and $c_s$. The main mountain is largely
generated by the source $\propto m$ as the clustering scale. Since the outcome
is affected by the initial condition and the parameters as well, it is hard to
infer the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations accurately. The difficulties
with the sound horizon as a distance ruler are pointed out.

attention due to its robust performance. Most of the existing methods focus on
proposing different cross-modal fusion strategies. However, these strategies
introduce redundancy in the features of different modalities without fully
considering the complementary properties between modal information, and these
approaches do not guarantee the non-loss of original semantic information
during intra- and inter-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
cross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure
(CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Firstly, we perform representation
learning for audio and video modalities to obtain the semantic features of the
two modalities by efficient ResNeXt and 1D CNN, respectively. Secondly, we feed
the features of the two modalities into the cross-modal blocks separately to
ensure efficient complementarity and completeness of information through the
self-attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output
of emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation with the original
representation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct
experiments on the RAVDESS dataset. The experimental results show that the
proposed CFN-SR achieves the state-of-the-art and obtains 75.76% accuracy with
26.30M parameters. Our code is available at

much-needed flexibility to the power system. However, flexibility utilization
also introduces new challenges to distribution system operators (DSOs), who
need mechanisms to supervise flexibility activations and monitor their effect
on distribution network operation. Flexibility activations can be broadly
categorized to those originating from electricity markets and those initiated
by the DSO to avoid constraint violations. Simultaneous electricity market
driven flexibility activations may cause voltage quality or temporary
overloading issues, and the failure of flexibility activations initiated by the
DSO might leave critical grid states unresolved. This work proposes a novel
data processing pipeline for automated real-time identification of fast-ramped
flexibility activation events. Its practical value is twofold: i) potentially
critical flexibility activations originating from electricity markets can be
detected by the DSO at an early stage, and ii) successful activation of
DSO-requested flexibility can be verified by the operator. In both cases the
increased awareness would allow the DSO to take counteractions to avoid
potentially critical grid situations. The proposed pipeline combines techniques
from unsupervised detection and open-set classification. For both building
blocks feasibility is systematically evaluated and proofed on real load and

theories of gravity? We explore these questions using a simple spherical flow
model in general relativity, scalar Gauss--Bonnet gravity, and the Rezzolla and

general relativity are subdominant compared to corrections to the critical
impact parameter, and argue that this is generally true. We find that
astrophysical model parameters are the dominant source of uncertainty in this
calculation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the astrophysical
model. Given a sufficiently accurate astrophysical model, however, it is
possible using measurements of the black hole shadow to distinguish between

radius $R_{ in}= 4.5$\,kpc beyond which the stellar emissivity and dust
distribution fall exponentially. For $R<R_{ in}$ the emissivities fall linearly
towards the centre. The old stellar populations in the disk have an exponential
scalelength that increases monotonically from $h_{ s}^{ disk}(K)=2.2\pm

oblique projections that employ cell face normal vectors we derive variations

gradients are tested and compared on a variety of grids such as structured,
locally refined, randomly perturbed, unstructured, and with high aspect ratio.
The tests include quadrilateral and triangular grids, and employ both compact
and extended stencils, and observations are made about the best choice of
gradient and weighting scheme for each case. On high aspect ratio grids, it is
found that most gradients can exhibit a kind of numerical instability that may
be so severe as to make the gradient unusable. A theoretical analysis of the
instability reveals that it is triggered by roundoff errors in the calculation
of the cell centroids, but ultimately is due to truncation errors of the

analysis, we provide guidelines on the range of weights that can be used safely

properties of an inaccessible medium. Many approaches have been proposed
employing algorithms to solve the Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problem

implement adequate structures to represent the problem domain, the input data,
the results of the adopted metrics, and experimentation routines. We introduce
an open-source Python library that offers a modular and standardized framework
for implementing and evaluating the performance of algorithms for the problem.
Based on the implementation of fundamental components for the execution of
algorithms, this library aims to facilitate the development and discussion of
new methods. Through a modular structure organized into classes, researchers
can design their case studies and benchmarking experiments relying on features
such as test randomization, specific metrics, and statistical comparison. To
the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that such tools for
benchmarking and comparison are introduced for microwave imaging algorithms. In
addition, two new metrics for location and shape recovery are presented. In
this work, we introduce the principles for the design of the problem components

allocation and migration of time-sensitive computing tasks in a
resource-constrained internet of vehicles (IoV) context. This is achieved by
tackling, as the main objective, the minimization of the carbon footprint of
the edge network, whilst delivering adequate quality of service (QoS) to the
end users (e.g., meeting task execution deadlines). EASE integrates i) a
centralized optimization step, solved through model predictive control (MPC),
to manage the renewable energy that is locally collected at the edge servers
and their local computing resources, estimating their future availability, and
ii) a distributed consensus step, solved via dual ascent in closed form, to
reach agreement on service migrations. EASE is compared with four existing
migration strategies. Quantitative results demonstrate its greater energy
efficiency, which often gets close to complete carbon neutrality, while also
improving the QoS.

non-monotonic behaviour in the studied temperature range with the value of
$\sim-$81 $\mu$V/K at room temperature. The $|S|$ first increases till 560 K
($\sim-$93 $\mu$V/K) and then decreases up to 800 K ($\sim-$84 $\mu$V/K)
indicating the dominating n-type behaviour in the full temperature range. The
electrical conductivity, $\sigma$ (thermal conductivity, $\kappa$) shows the
monotonic decreasing (increasing) behaviour with the values of $\sim$5.2$\times
10^{5}$ (12.1 W/m-K) and $\sim$3.6$\times 10^{5}$ (14.2 W/m-K)
$\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K and 800 K, respectively. The $\kappa$ exhibits the
temperature dependency as, $\kappa \propto T^{0.16}$. The DFT based Boltzmann
transport theory is used to understand these behaviour. The multi-band electron
and hole pockets appear to be mainly responsible for deciding the temperature
dependent transport behaviour. Specifically, the decrease in the $|S|$ above
560 K and change in the slope of $\sigma$ around 450 K are due to the
contribution of thermally generated charge carriers from the hole pockets. The
temperature dependent relaxation time is computed which shows temperature
dependency of $1/T^{0.35}$. Present study suggests that electronic
band-structure obtained from DFT provides reasonably good estimate of the
transport coefficients of CoSi in the high temperature region of $300-800$ K.

described in [N. B\""auerle and Li, Z., J. Appl. Probab., 50, 1025-1043 (2013)],

atmosphere, producing a surface pressure variation through the orbit of Titan
and tidal winds in the troposphere. The future Dragonfly mission could analyse
this exotic meteorological phenomenon.
  Aims: We analyse the effect of Saturn's tides on Titan's atmosphere and
interior to determine how pressure measurements by Dragonfly could constrain
Titan's interior.
  Methods: We model atmospheric tides with analytical calculations and with a
3D Global Climate Model (the IPSL-Titan GCM), including the tidal response of
the interior.
  Results: We predict that the Love numbers of Titan's interior should verify 1
+ Re(k2 - h2) ~ 0.02-0.1 and Im(k2 - h2) < 0.04. The deformation of Titan's
interior should therefore strongly weaken gravitational atmospheric tides,
yielding a residual surface pressure amplitude of only ~ 5 Pa, with a phase
shift of 5-20 hours. Tidal winds are very weak, of the order of 3*10^-4 m/s in
the lower troposphere. Finally, constraints from Dragonfly data may permit the
real and the imaginary parts of k2 - h2 to be estimated with a precision of
~0.01-0.03.
  Conclusions: Measurements of pressure variations by Dragonfly over the whole
mission could give valuable constraints on the thickness of Titan's ice shell,
and via geophysical models, its heat flux and the density of Titan's internal

to be extremely valuable in directly accessing magnetodynamics quantities, such
as energy barriers, magnetic interactions, lifetime of excited states and
fluctuations at the most fundamental level. Here, we explore the existence of a
new flavor of low-energy spin-excitations for quantum spins coupled to an
electron bath. In sharp contrast to the usual tunneling signature of two steps
symmetrically centered around the Fermi level, we find a single step in the
conductance. Combining time-dependent and many-body perturbation theories,
magnetic field-dependent tunneling spectra are explained to be the result of an
interplay between weak magnetic anisotropy energy, magnetic interactions and
Stoner-like electron-hole excitations that are strongly dependent on the
magnetic states of the studied nanostructures. We additionally map the
evolution of the conductance peak in artificial nanostructures crafted
atom-by-atom, which show clear evidence of spin-coupled behavior. The results
are rationalized in terms of a non-collinear magnetic ground state and the
dominance of ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. The atomically crafted

However, black-box problems, especially those arising from recent

undermine their efficiency guarantees and lead to dangerous under-estimation

Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation (Deep-PrAE) to design statistically

its effectiveness in numerical examples including the safety-testing of

endeavors to theoretically validate the importance and effects of neural

generalize better than fully connected multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs),
especially when the number of nodes (e.g., users, base stations, or antennas)

large antenna arrays at high carrier frequencies (in the mmWave range) pushes
towards a propagation regime in which the wavefront is no longer plane but
spherical. This allows to infer the position and orientation of a transmitting
source from the received signal without the need of using multiple anchor
nodes, located in known positions. To understand the fundamental limits of
large antenna arrays for localization, this paper combines wave propagation
theory with estimation theory, and computes the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for
the estimation of the source position on the basis of the three Cartesian
components of the electric field, observed over a rectangular surface area. The
problem is referred to as holographic positioning and is formulated by taking
into account the radiation angular pattern of the transmitting source, which is
typically ignored in standard signal processing models. We assume that the
source is a Hertzian dipole, and address the holographic positioning problem in
both cases, that is, with and without a priori knowledge of its orientation. To
simplify the analysis and gain further insights, we also consider the case in
which the dipole is located on the line perpendicular to the surface center.
Numerical and asymptotic results are given to quantify the CRBs, and to
quantify the effect of various system parameters on the ultimate estimation
accuracy. It turns out that surfaces of practical size may guarantee a

of hierarchical fragmentation, where turbulence dominates over thermal

linked to the scale-dependent, dynamical mass inflow/accretion on clump and
core scales. We therefore suggest that the G34 cloud could be undergoing a

from the Comptonization component. Our results indicate that the soft X-ray
irradiation can account for the optical emission in the majority of ULXs, and
the fraction of hard X-rays reprocessed on the outer disk is constrained to be
no more than $\sim$$10^{-2}$ in general. Such an upper limit is well consistent
with the irradiation fraction expected in the case of no beaming. Therefore, no
stringent constraint on the beaming effect can be placed according to the

or intermediate) however the occurrence rates of each shock type is not known
for turbulent systems. Here we present a method for detecting and classifying
the full range of MHD shocks applied to the Orszag-Tang vortex. Our results
show that the system is dominated by fast and slow shocks, with far less
frequent intermediate shocks appearing most readily near magnetic reconnection
sites. We present a potential mechanism that could lead to the formation of
intermediate shocks in MHD systems, and study the coherency and abundances of
shocks in compressible MHD turbulence.

operations and is highly error-resilient. The core operations of HDC manipulate
HD vectors in bulk bit-wise fashion, offering many opportunities to leverage

continuous movement of HD vectors among the processor and the memory can make
the cognition task prohibitively slow and energy-intensive. Hardware
accelerators only marginally improve related metrics. On the contrary, only
partial implementation of an HDC framework inside memory, using emerging
memristive devices, has reported considerable performance/energy gains. This
paper presents an architecture based on racetrack memory (RTM) to conduct and
accelerate the entire HDC framework within the memory. The proposed solution
requires minimal additional CMOS circuitry and uses a read operation across
multiple domains in RTMs called transverse read (TR) to realize exclusive-or

propose an RTM nanowires-based counting mechanism that leverages the TR

sufficiently close to the critical point of the vapor--gas system, the charge
destabilizes the vapor phase and initiates a phase transition. The fluid's free
energy is described by the van der Waals expression augmented by electrostatic
energy and a square-gradient term. We calculate the equilibrium density profile
at arbitrary temperatures, particle charges, and vapor densities. In contrast
to classical nucleation theory, here, both liquid and vapor phases are
different from the bulk phases because they are spatially nonuniform. In
addition, the theory applies to both sharp and diffuse interfaces and
calculates the surface tension self-consistently. We find the composition
profiles and integrate them to get the adsorption near the particle. We find
that the adsorption changes discontinuously at a first-order phase transition
line. This line becomes a second-order phase transition at high enough
temperatures. We describe the transition point numerically and provide
approximate analytical expressions for it. Similarly to prewetting, the
adsorption diverges at the binodal phase boundary. We construct a phase diagram
indicating changes in the binodal, spinodal, and critical temperature. It is
shown that the field gradient enlarges the range of temperature and vapor
density where liquid can nucleate.

generation communications, as they can be deployed to provide wireless
connectivity to ground users to supplement existing terrestrial networks. The
majority of the existing research into the use of UAV access points for
cellular coverage considers rotary-wing UAV designs (i.e. quadcopters).
However, we expect fixed-wing UAVs to be more appropriate for connectivity
purposes in scenarios where long flight times are necessary (such as for rural
coverage), as fixed-wing UAVs rely on a more energy-efficient form of flight
when compared to the rotary-wing design. As fixed-wing UAVs are typically
incapable of hovering in place, their deployment optimisation involves
optimising their individual flight trajectories in a way that allows them to
deliver high quality service to the ground users in an energy-efficient manner.
In this paper, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to
optimise the energy efficiency of fixed-wing UAV cellular access points while
still allowing them to deliver high-quality service to users on the ground. In
our decentralized approach, each UAV is equipped with a Dueling Deep Q-Network
(DDQN) agent which can adjust the 3D trajectory of the UAV over a series of
timesteps. By coordinating with their neighbours, the UAVs adjust their
individual flight trajectories in a manner that optimises the total system
energy efficiency. We benchmark the performance of our approach against a
series of heuristic trajectory planning strategies, and demonstrate that our
method can improve the system energy efficiency by as much as 70%.

nonlinear elliptic equations that makes use of domain decomposition, an
accelerated Schwarz framework, and two-layer neural networks to approximate the
boundary-to-boundary map for the subdomains, which is the key step in the
Schwarz procedure. Conventionally, the boundary-to-boundary map requires
solution of boundary-value elliptic problems on each subdomain. By leveraging
the compressibility of multiscale problems, our approach trains the neural
network offline to serve as a surrogate for the usual implementation of the
boundary-to-boundary map. Our method is applied to a multiscale semilinear
elliptic equation and a multiscale $p$-Laplace equation. In both cases we
demonstrate significant improvement in efficiency as well as good accuracy and
generalization performance.

strategy is firstly presented. According to the dynamic information and
environmental feedback of the mobile robot, the RL agent can output the optimal
MIMO PID parameters in real time, without knowing mathematical model and
decoupling multiple control loops. Then, to improve the convergence speed of RL
and the stability of mobile robots, a Lyapunov-based reward shaping soft
actor-critic (LSAC) algorithm is proposed based on Lyapunov theory and
potential-based reward shaping method. The convergence and optimality of the
algorithm are proved in terms of the policy evaluation and improvement step of
soft policy iteration. In addition, for line-following robots, the region
growing method is improved to adapt to the influence of forks and environmental
interference. Through comparison, test and cross-validation, the simulation and

frequencies associated with these events. These stellar eruptions have proven
to be elusive, although a promising approach to detect and characterise these
phenomena are low-frequency radio observations of potential type II bursts as
CME induced shocks propagate through the stellar corona. Stellar type II radio
bursts are expected to emit below 450 MHz, similarly to their solar
counterparts. We show that the length of time these events remain above the
ionospheric cutoff is not necessarily dependent on the stellar magnetic cycle,
but more on the eruption location relative to the stellar magnetic field. We
find that these type II bursts would remain within the frequency range of LOFAR
for a maximum of 20-30 minutes post-eruption for the polar CMEs, (50 minutes
for 2nd harmonics). We find evidence of slower equatorial CMEs, which result in
slightly longer observable windows for the 2008 and 2013 simulations. Stellar
magnetic geometry and strength has a significant effect on the detectability of
these events. We place the CMEs in the context of the stellar mass-loss rate
(27-48 $\times$ solar mass-loss rate), showing that they can amount to 3-50% of
the stellar wind mass-loss rate for $\epsilon$ Eridani. Continuous monitoring
of likely stellar CME candidates with low-frequency radio telescopes will be

A mathematical model based on Physarum's behavior, known as the Physarum
Directed Dynamics, can solve positive linear programs. In this paper, we
present a family of Physarum-based dynamics extending the previous work and
introduce a new algorithm to solve positive Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). The
Physarum dynamics are governed by orthogonal projections (w.r.t. time-dependent
scalar products) on the affine subspace defined by the linear constraints. We
present a natural generalization of the scalar products used in the LP case to
the matrix space for SDPs, which boils down to the linear case when all
matrices in the SDP are diagonal, thus, representing an LP. We investigate the
behavior of the induced dynamics theoretically and experimentally, highlight
challenges arising from the non-commutative nature of matrix products, and
prove soundness and convergence under mild conditions. Moreover, we consider a
more abstract view on the dynamics that suggests a slight variation to
guarantee unconditional soundness and convergence-to-optimality. By simulating
these dynamics using suitable discretizations, one obtains numerical algorithms
for solving positive SDPs, which have applications in discrete optimization,
e.g., for computing the Goemans-Williamson approximation for MaxCut or the
Lovasz theta number for determining the clique/chromatic number in perfect
graphs.

undirected graph $G$ with edge costs, a set $R$ of terminal vertices, and an

compute a subgraph $H$ of $G$ of minimum cost, such that there are at least
$d_{s,t}$ disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ in $H$. If the paths are required
to be edge-disjoint we obtain the edge-connectivity variant (EC-SNDP), while
internally vertex-disjoint paths result in the vertex-connectivity variant
(VC-SNDP). Another important case is the element-connectivity variant
(LC-SNDP), where the paths are disjoint on edges and non-terminals.
  In this work we shed light on the parameterized complexity of the above
problems. We consider several natural parameters, which include the solution
size $\ell$, the sum of demands $D$, the number of terminals $k$, and the
maximum demand $d_\max$. Using simple, elegant arguments, we prove the
following results.
  - We give a complete picture of the parameterized tractability of the three
variants w.r.t. parameter $\ell$: both EC-SNDP and LC-SNDP are FPT, while
VC-SNDP is W[1]-hard.
  - We identify some special cases of VC-SNDP that are FPT:
  * when $d_\max\leq 3$ for parameter $\ell$,
  * on locally bounded treewidth graphs (e.g., planar graphs) for parameter
$\ell$, and
  * on graphs of treewidth $tw$ for parameter $tw+D$.
  - The well-known Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem can be seen as
single-source EC-SNDP with $d_\max=1$ on directed graphs, and is FPT
parameterized by $k$ [Dreyfus & Wagner 1971]. We show that in contrast, the

finely than the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PH), whereas the latter
characterizes physically motivated problems such as Approximate Simulation
(APX-SIM) [Ambainis, CCC 2014]. In this area, a central role has been played by
the classes $P^{NP[\log]}$ and $P^{QMA[\log]}$, defined identically to $P^{NP}$
and $P^{QMA}$, except that only logarithmically many oracle queries are
allowed. Here, [Gottlob, FOCS 1993] showed that if the adaptive queries made by
a $P^{NP}$ machine have a ""query graph"" which is a tree, then this computation
can be simulated in $P^{NP[\log]}$.
  In this work, we first show that for any verification class
$C\in\{NP,MA,QCMA,QMA,QMA(2),NEXP,QMA_{\exp}\}$, any $P^C$ machine with a query
graph of ""separator number"" $s$ can be simulated using deterministic time
$\exp(s\log n)$ and $s\log n$ queries to a $C$-oracle. When $s\in O(1)$ (which
includes the case of $O(1)$-treewidth, and thus also of trees), this gives an
upper bound of $P^{C[\log]}$, and when $s\in O(\log^k(n))$, this yields bound
$QP^{C[\log^{k+1}]}$ (QP meaning quasi-polynomial time). We next show how to
combine Gottlob's ""admissible-weighting function"" framework with the
""flag-qubit"" framework of [Watson, Bausch, Gharibian, 2020], obtaining a
unified approach for embedding $P^C$ computations directly into APX-SIM
instances in a black-box fashion. Finally, we formalize a simple no-go
statement about polynomials (c.f. [Krentel, STOC 1986]): Given a multi-linear
polynomial $p$ specified via an arithmetic circuit, if one can ""weakly
compress"" $p$ so that its optimal value requires $m$ bits to represent, then
$P^{NP}$ can be decided with only $m$ queries to an NP-oracle.

implied reference model, the number of clusters and, often, several
hyper-parameters and algorithms' tunings. In practice, one produces several
partitions, and a final one is chosen based on validation or selection
criteria. There exist an abundance of validation methods that, implicitly or
explicitly, assume a certain clustering notion. Moreover, they are often
restricted to operate on partitions obtained from a specific method. In this
paper, we focus on groups that can be well separated by quadratic or linear
boundaries. The reference cluster concept is defined through the quadratic
discriminant score function and parameters describing clusters' size, center
and scatter. We develop two cluster-quality criteria called quadratic scores.
We show that these criteria are consistent with groups generated from a general
class of elliptically-symmetric distributions. The quest for this type of
groups is common in applications. The connection with likelihood theory for
mixture models and model-based clustering is investigated. Based on bootstrap
resampling of the quadratic scores, we propose a selection rule that allows
choosing among many clustering solutions. The proposed method has the
distinctive advantage that it can compare partitions that cannot be compared
with other state-of-the-art methods. Extensive numerical experiments and the
analysis of real data show that, even if some competing methods turn out to be
superior in some setups, the proposed methodology achieves a better overall
performance.

contextualizes the digital watermarking technique, which is referred to as

Natural Preserve Transform is employed as a part of the fuzzy logic

robustness and performance of the proposed system are experimentally tested
with the help of image processing operations like image compression, noise

will observe an Einstein ring from the lens system aligned in a highly
symmetric configuration. Time delays between different locations on the
Einstein ring cannot emerge without gravitational wave of cosmological
wavelength propagating through the lens system. Otherwise, different locations
on the Einstein ring will show time delays. Our previous studies showed that
time delays from different locations on the Einstein ring in the presence of
gravitational wave of cosmological wavelength present a special relationship.
But this result is limited to a specific aligned source-deflector-observer
configuration where the source and the observer are equidistant from the
deflector and the gravitational wave has special direction of propagation and
polarization. In order to investigate the property in the general case, we
extend to the general condition that the source and the observer aren't

gravitational wave is arbitrary in the present work. Results in this work show
that time delays between different locations on the Einstein ring with the

To conduct experiments on its application, public transport timetables were

were divided into micro-regions. A method was also proposed to identify regions

based surrogates to predict structural response, i.e., displacements and
accelerations, for given input (harmonic) excitations. In particular, the focus
is on the development of efficient network architectures using fully-connected,
sparsely-connected, and convolutional network layers, and on the corresponding
training strategies that can provide a balance between the overall network
complexity and prediction accuracy in the target dataspaces. For linear
dynamics, sparsity patterns of the weight matrix in the network layers are used
to construct convolutional DNNs with sparse layers. For nonlinear dynamics, it
is shown that sparsity in network layers is lost, and efficient DNNs
architectures with fully-connected and convolutional network layers are
explored. A transfer learning strategy is also introduced to successfully train
the proposed DNNs, and various loading factors that influence the network
architectures are studied. It is shown that the proposed DNNs can be used as
effective and accurate surrogates for predicting linear and nonlinear dynamical
responses under harmonic loadings.

engineering and science applications. Often such missing data arise in
experimental observations from limitations of sensors or post-processing
transformation errors. Other times they arise from numerical and algorithmic
constraints in computer simulations. One such instance and the application
emphasis of this paper are numerical simulations of storm surge. The simulation
data corresponds to time-series surge predictions over a number of save points
within the geographic domain of interest, creating a spatio-temporal imputation
problem where the surge points are heavily correlated spatially and temporally,
and the missing values regions are structurally distributed at random. Very
recently, machine learning techniques such as neural network methods have been
developed and employed for missing data imputation tasks. Generative
Adversarial Nets (GANs) and GAN-based techniques have particularly attracted
attention as unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, the
Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) performance is improved by
applying convolutional neural networks instead of fully connected layers to
better capture the correlation of data and promote learning from the adjacent
surge points. Another adjustment to the method needed specifically for the
studied data is to consider the coordinates of the points as additional
features to provide the model more information through the convolutional
layers. We name our proposed method as Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Imputation Nets (Conv-GAIN). The proposed method's performance by considering
the improvements and adaptations required for the storm surge data is assessed
and compared to the original GAIN and a few other techniques. The results show
that Conv-GAIN has better performance than the alternative methods on the

between them caused by spontaneous occurrences of labelled (aka
partially-observed) events. Due to the partially-observed feature, fundamental
properties therein could be classified into two categories:
state/event-inference-based properties (e.g., strong detectability,
diagnosability, and predictability) and state-concealment-based properties
(e.g., opacity). Intuitively, the former category describes whether one can use
observed output sequences to infer the current and subsequent states, past
occurrences of faulty events, or future certain occurrences of faulty events;
while the latter describes whether one cannot use observed output sequences to
infer whether some secret states have been visited (that is, whether the DES
can conceal the status that its secret states have been visited). Over the past
two decades these properties were studied separately using different methods.
In this review article, for labeled finite-state automata, a unified
concurrent-composition method is shown to verify all above inference-based
properties and concealment-based properties, resulting in a unified
mathematical framework for the two categories of properties. In addition,
compared with the previous methods in the literature, the
concurrent-composition method does not depend on assumptions and is more
efficient.

maximization of a fisher consistent surrogate loss function. We show that a
large class of concave surrogates fails to be Fisher consistent, which differs
from the classic setting for binary classification. We further characterize a
non-concave family of Fisher consistent smooth surrogate functions, which can
be optimized with gradient descent using off-the-shelf machine learning
algorithms. Compared to the existing direct search approach under the support
vector machine framework (Zhao et al., 2015), our proposed DTR estimation via
surrogate loss optimization (DTRESLO) method is more computationally scalable
to large sample size and allows for a broader functional class for the
predictor effects. We establish theoretical properties for our proposed DTR

DTRESLO method. Finite sample performance of our proposed estimator is
evaluated through extensive simulations and an application on deriving an

and using isochrones to assess the stellar ages. From these analyses, we find a

the southwest of LH75. The center of SNR B0532$-$67.5 is located closer to the

Available spectral surveys below 51 GHz are more than 25 years old and new work
is needed.
  Aims. Characterizing the rich molecular content of this source, specially for
heavy species, requires to carry out very sensitive spectral surveys at low
frequencies. In particular in this work we have achieved an rms in the range
0.2-0.6 mK per MHz.
  Methods. long Q-band (31.0-50.3 GHz) single dish integrations were carried
out with the Yebes 40m telescope using specifically built receivers. State of
the art line catalogs are used for line identification.
  Results. A total of 652 spectral features corresponding to 713 transitions
from 81 species (we count as different the isomers, isotopologues and
ortho/para species) are present in the data. Only 57 unidentified lines remain
with signal to noise ratios >3. Some new species and/or vibrational modes have
been discovered for the first time with this survey.
  Conclusions. This IRC+10216 spectral survey is, by far, the most sensitive
one carried out to this date in the Q-band. It therefore provides the most
complete view of IRC+10216 from 31.0 to 50.3 GHz, giving unique information on
its molecular content, specially for heavy species. Rotational diagrams built
from the data provide valuable information on the physical conditions and

their product is compact, in the product topology. Tychonoff's theorem is shown
to be equivalent to the axiom of choice. In this paper, we show that any
countable product of compact metric spaces is compact, without using
Tychonoff's theorem. The proof needs only basic and standard facts of compact
metric spaces and the Bolzano-Weierstrass property. Moreover, the component
spaces need not be assumed to be copies of the same compact metric space, and
each component space can be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space
independently. Total boundedness together with completeness of a metric space
implies its compactness. Completeness of a product of complete spaces is easily
inferred from the completeness of each component. Total boundedness therefore
suffices to prove the compactness of a product space consisting of countably
(infinitely) many nonempty compact component spaces. The countable infiniteness
is needed in the proof to exhibit a standard metric that gives rise to the
product topology. Any such metric topology for the product arises as exhibited,
and they are all equivalent to the product topology. The requirement of
summability of the sequences restricts the scope of the result to countably
infinite products. In summary, the product space obtained by taking the product
of any sequence of nonempty compact metric spaces in the product topology is
shown to be compact, using only the basic and standard facts of compact metric
spaces. In conclusion, compactness of the product of a countably infinitely
many nonempty compact metric spaces can be proved within Cantor's set theory,
without using the axiom of choice and Tychonoff's theorem.

follow a Gompertz growth function for locations of very different sizes. This
lack of dependence on region size leads us to hypothesize that virus spread
depends on universal properties of the network of social interactions. We test
this hypothesis by simulating the propagation of a virus on networks of
different topologies. Our main finding is that Gompertz growth observed for
early outbreaks occurs only for a scale-free network, in which nodes with many
more neighbors than average are common. These nodes that have very many
neighbors are infected early in the outbreak and then spread the infection very
rapidly. When these nodes are no longer infectious, the remaining nodes that
have most neighbors take over and continue to spread the infection. In this
way, the rate of spread is fastest at the very start and slows down
immediately. Geometrically it is seen that the ""surface"" of the epidemic, the
number of susceptible nodes in contact with the infected nodes, starts to
rapidly decrease very early in the epidemic and as soon as the larger nodes
have been infected. In our simulation, the speed and impact of an outbreak
depend on three parameters: the average number of contacts each node makes, the
probability of being infected by a neighbor, and the probability of recovery.
Intelligent interventions to reduce the impact of future outbreaks need to
focus on these critical parameters in order to minimize economic and social
collateral damage.

management and public safety. Recent studies have shown the potential of
convolution-free Transformer approach to extract the dynamic dependencies among
complex influencing factors. However, two issues prevent the approach from
being effectively applied in traffic flow forecasting. First, it ignores the
spatiotemporal structure of the traffic flow videos. Second, for a long
sequence, it is hard to focus on crucial attention due to the quadratic times
dot-product computation. To address the two issues, we first factorize the
dependencies and then design a progressive space-time self-attention mechanism
named ProSTformer. It has two distinctive characteristics: (1) corresponding to
the factorization, the self-attention mechanism progressively focuses on
spatial dependence from local to global regions, on temporal dependence from
inside to outside fragment (i.e., closeness, period, and trend), and finally on
external dependence such as weather, temperature, and day-of-week; (2) by
incorporating the spatiotemporal structure into the self-attention mechanism,
each block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependence by aggregating the
regions with spatiotemporal positions to significantly decrease the
computation. We evaluate ProSTformer on two traffic datasets, and each dataset
includes three separate datasets with big, medium, and small scales. Despite
the radically different design compared to the convolutional architectures for
traffic flow forecasting, ProSTformer performs better or the same on the big
scale datasets than six state-of-the-art baseline methods by RMSE. When
pre-trained on the big scale datasets and transferred to the medium and small
scale datasets, ProSTformer achieves a significant enhancement and behaves
best.

coordinate to optimize a given system-level objective. While solving for the
global optimal is intractable in many cases, the greedy algorithm is a
well-studied and efficient way to provide good approximate solutions - notably
for submodular optimization problems. Executing the greedy algorithm requires
the agents to be ordered and execute a local optimization based on the
solutions of the previous agents. However, in limited information settings,
passing the solution from the previous agents may be nontrivial, as some agents
may not be able to directly communicate with each other. Thus the communication
time required to execute the greedy algorithm is closely tied to the order that
the agents are given. In this work, we characterize interplay between the
communication complexity and agent orderings by showing that the complexity
using the best ordering is O(n) and increases considerably to O(n^2) when using
the worst ordering. Motivated by this, we also propose an algorithm that can
find an ordering and execute the greedy algorithm quickly, in a distributed
fashion. We also show that such an execution of the greedy algorithm is
advantageous over current methods for distributed submodular maximization.

continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. Our method employs the
strong anisotropic material property of continuous fibres by generating
toolpaths along the directions of tensile stresses in the critical regions.
Moreover, the density of toolpath distribution is controlled in an adaptive way
proportionally to the values of stresses. Specifically, a vector field is
generated from the stress tensors under given loads and processed to have
better compatibility between neighboring vectors. An optimal scalar field is
computed later by making its gradients approximate the vector field. After
that, isocurves of the scalar field are extracted to generate the toolpaths for
continuous fibre reinforcement, which are also integrated with the boundary
conformal toolpaths in user selected regions. The performance of our method has

71.4% improvement on the mechanical strength in physical tests when using the
same (or even slightly smaller) amount of continuous fibres.
