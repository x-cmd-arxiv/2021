classification problem. In this paper, we reformulate this task as a
single-label prediction problem by encoding the multi-speaker labels with power
set. Specifically, we propose the speaker embedding-aware neural diarization
(SEND) method, which predicts the power set encoded labels according to the
similarities between speech features and given speaker embeddings. Our method
is further extended and integrated with downstream tasks by utilizing the
textual information, which has not been well studied in previous literature.
The experimental results show that our method achieves lower diarization error
rate than the target-speaker voice activity detection. When textual information
is involved, the diarization errors can be further reduced. For the real
meeting scenario, our method can achieve 34.11% relative improvement compared
with the Bayesian hidden Markov model based clustering algorithm.

develop and analyze the basic properties and constraints on sequences of data
over finite alphabets. A central problem considered using these tools is that
of data compression, and specifically lossy data compression. In this work we
consider this very problem, however, instead of sequences of data we consider
directed graphs. We show that given a more natural distortion measure, fitting
the data structure of a directed graph, the method of types cannot be applied.
The suggested distortion measure aims to preserves the local structure of a
directed graph. We build on the recent work of Barvinok and extend the method
of types to the two dimensional setting of directed graphs. We see that the
extension is quite natural in many ways. Given this extension we provide a
lower and upper bound on the rate-distortion problem of lossy compression given
the suggested distortion measure.

strict bounds on its rate. Stochastic mechanical systems include pure
diffusions in Euclidean space or on Lie groups, as well as systems evolving on
phase space for which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem applies, i.e.,
return-to-equilibrium processes. Two separate ways for ensembles of such
mechanical systems forced by noise to reach equilibrium are examined here.
First, a restorative potential and damping can be applied, leading to a
classical return-to-equilibrium process wherein energy taken out by damping can
balance the energy going in from the noise. Second, the process evolves on a
compact configuration space (such as random walks on spheres, torsion angles in
chain molecules, and rotational Brownian motion) lead to long-time solutions
that are constant over the configuration space, regardless of whether or not
damping and random forcing balance. This is a kind of potential-free
equilibrium distribution resulting from topological constraints. Inertial and
noninertial (kinematic) systems are considered. These systems can consist of
unconstrained particles or more complex systems with constraints, such as
rigid-bodies or linkages. These more complicated systems evolve on Lie groups
and model phenomena such as rotational Brownian motion and nonholonomic robotic
systems. In all cases, it is shown that the rate of entropy production is
closely related to the appropriate concept of Fisher information matrix of the
probability density defined by the Fokker-Planck equation. Classical results
from information theory are then repurposed to provide computable bounds on the
rate of entropy production in stochastic mechanical systems.

concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This paradigm was challenged by the
discovery of topological order, in materials where the number of accessible
states is not solely determined by the number of broken symmetries, but also by
space topology. Until now however, the concept of topological order has been
linked to quantum entanglement and has therefore remained out of reach in
classical systems. Here, we show that classical systems whose global geometry
frustrates the emergence of homogeneous order realise an unanticipated form of
topological order defined by non-orientable order-parameter bundles:
non-orientable order. We validate experimentally and theoretically this concept
by designing frustrated mechanical metamaterials that spontaneously break a
discrete symmetry under homogeneous load. While conventional order leads to a
discrete ground-state degeneracy, we show that non-orientable order implies an
extensive ground-state degeneracy -- in the form of topologically protected
zero-nodes and zero-lines. Our metamaterials escape the traditional
classification of order by symmetry breaking. Considering more general stress
distributions, we leverage non-orientable order to engineer robust mechanical
memory and achieve non-Abelian mechanical responses that carry an imprint of
the braiding of local loads. We envision this principle to open the way to
designer materials that can robustly process information across multiple areas
of physics, from mechanics to photonics and magnetism.

re-identification aim at directly disentangling person representations into
domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature. However, they
ignore that some crucial characteristics are stubbornly entwined in both the
domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature, which are
intractable to decompose in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective Calibrated Feature Decomposition (CFD) module that focuses
on improving the generalization capacity for person re-identification through a
more judicious feature decomposition and reinforcement strategy. Specifically,
a calibrated-and-standardized Batch normalization (CSBN) is designed to learn
calibrated person representation by jointly exploring intra-domain calibration
and inter-domain standardization of multi-source domain features. CSBN
restricts instance-level inconsistency of feature distribution for each domain
and captures intrinsic domain-level specific statistics. The calibrated person
representation is subtly decomposed into the identity-relevant feature, domain
feature, and the remaining entangled one. For enhancing the generalization
ability and ensuring high discrimination of the identity-relevant feature, a
calibrated instance normalization (CIN) is introduced to enforce discriminative
id-relevant information, and filter out id-irrelevant information, and
meanwhile the rich complementary clues from the remaining entangled feature are
further employed to strengthen it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong
generalization capability of our framework. Our models empowered by CFD modules
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches

similar results. For the excited states, we see that while FDE (constrained not

orbitals with important contributions from the solvent. The BOMME results, on
the other hand, provide a faithful qualitative representation of the spectra in
all energy regions considered, though its intrinsic approximation of employing
a lower-accuracy exchange-correlation functional for the environment induces
non-negligible shifts in peak positions for the excitations from the halide to

explored their application to satellite cloud data filling tasks. A numerical

reaction energy for releasing hydrogen is the use of MgH$_2$-based
nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we investigate first the thermodynamic properties of
Mg$_n$H$_{2n}$ NPs ($n<10$) from first-principles, in particular by assessing
the anharmonic effects on the enthalpy, entropy and thermal expansion by means
of the Stochastic Self Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). The latter
method goes beyond previous approaches, typically based on molecular mechanics
and the quasi-harmonic approximation, allowing the ab initio calculation of the
fully-anharmonic free energy. We find an almost linear dependence on
temperature of the interatomic bond lengths - with a relative variation of few
percent over 300K -, alongside with a bond distance decrease of the Mg-H bonds.
In order to increase the size of NPs toward experiments of hydrogen desorption
from MgH$_2$ we devise a computationally effective Machine Learning model
trained to accurately determine the forces and total energies (i.e. the
potential energy surfaces), integrating the latter with the SSCHA model to
fully include the anharmonic effects. We find a significative decrease of the

continuously, leading to great savings in the computational cost without
sacrificing any accuracy on the finally learned model. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first screening method which introduces the dual optimum
estimation technique -- by carefully exploring and exploiting the strong
convexity and the complex structure of the dual problem -- in static screening
methods to dynamic screening. In this way, we can absorb the advantages of both
the static and dynamic screening methods and avoid their drawbacks. Our
estimation would be much more accurate than those developed based on the
duality gap, which contributes to a much stronger screening rule. Moreover, our
method is also the first screening method in sparse CRFs and even structure
prediction models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world

important for many applications of charged particle beams, such as analysis and
modification of materials, and recently for modelling metal nanoparticle
radiosensitisation in ion beam cancer therapy. We have calculated the stopping
power of the transition metals Pt and Au for protons and alpha particles in a
wide energy range, using the dielectric formalism, which realistically accounts
for the excitation spectrum of each metal through the Mermin Energy Loss
Function - Generalised Oscillator Strength methodology. For each combination of
projectile, energy and target, we have considered: (i) the equilibrium charge
state of the projectile through the target, (ii) the energy-loss due to
electron capture and loss processes, and (iii) the energy loss resulting from
the polarisation of the projectile's electronic cloud due to the self-induced
electric field. Our calculated stopping powers show a fairly good agreement
with the available experimental data for platinum and gold, particularly the
most recent ones around the stopping power maximum, which validates the
methodology we have used to be further extended to other transition metals. For
the materials studied (platinum and gold), two commonly used and different
sources of the experimental excitation spectrum yield comparable calculated
stopping powers and mean excitation energies, the latter being closer to the
most recent data provided in a recent ICRU Report than to previous
compilations. Despite the small differences in the sources of excitation
spectra of these metals, they lead to practically the same stopping power
results as far as they reproduce the main excitation features of the material
and fulfil physically motivated sum rules.

endoscopy, swarms of drug particles) through complex environments when active
control is a necessity but where direct manipulation can be hazardous. The
proposed control scheme consists of a switching control architecture
implemented by two sub-controllers. The first sub-controller is designed to
employ the robot's inverse kinematic solutions to do an environment search for
the to-be-carried ferromagnetic particle while being robust to disturbances.
The second sub-controller uses a customized rainbow algorithm to control a
robotic arm, i.e., the UR5 robot, to carry a ferromagnetic particle to a
desired position through a constrained environment. For the customized Rainbow
algorithm, Quantile Huber loss from the Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN)
algorithm and ResNet are employed. The proposed controller is first trained and
tested in a real-time physics simulation engine (PyBullet). Afterward, the
trained controller is transferred to a UR5 robot to remotely transport a
ferromagnetic particle in a real-world scenario, achieving a 98.86% success
rate over 30 episodes for randomly generated trajectories, demonstrating the
viability of the proposed approach for real-life applications. In addition, two
classical pathfinding approaches, Attractor Dynamics and the execution extended
Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (ERRT), are also investigated and compared to
the RL-based method. The proposed RL-based algorithm is shown to achieve
performance comparable to that of the tested classical path planners whilst
being more robust to deploy in dynamical environments.

of medical resources is the key to combating COVID-19. In the US Veteran
Affairs Health Care System (VA), many of the enrollees are susceptible to
COVID-19. Predicting the COVID-19 to allocate medical resources promptly
becomes a critical issue. When the VA enrollees have COVID-19 symptoms, it is
recommended that their first step should be to call the VA Call Center. For
confirmed COVID-19 patients, the median time from the first symptom to hospital
admission was seven days. By predicting the number of COVID-19 related calls,
we could predict imminent surges in healthcare use and plan medical resources
ahead. Objective: The study aims to develop a method to forecast the daily
number of COVID-19 related calls for each of the 110 VA medical centers.
Methods: In the proposed method, we pre-trained a model using a cluster of
medical centers and fine-tuned it for individual medical centers. At the
cluster level, we performed feature selection to select significant features
and automatic hyper-parameter search to select optimal hyper-parameter value
combinations for the model. Conclusions: This study proposed an accurate method
to forecast the daily number of COVID-19 related calls for VA medical centers.
The proposed method was able to overcome modeling challenges by grouping
similar medical centers into clusters to enlarge the dataset for training
models, and using hyper-parameter search to automatically find optimal
hyper-parameter value combinations for models. With the proposed method, surges
in health care can be predicted ahead. This allows health care practitioners to
better plan medical resources and combat COVID-19.

localization failure and another one caused by battery power outage. We show
that dense vegetation perturbs the GNSS signal, rendering it unsuitable for
navigation in forest trails. Furthermore, we highlight the increased
uncertainty related to localizing using point cloud registration in forest

patient needs to know what time to arrive for an appointment, but does not need
to know the assigned station ahead of time.
  Previous work developed a randomized algorithm for this problem which
achieved an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most 1.5, proving that online
MPAS was fundamentally different from the online bin-packing problem. Our main
contribution is to develop a new randomized algorithm for the problem that
achieves an asymptotic competitive ratio under 1.455, indicating the potential
for further progress. This improvement is attained by modifying the process for
scheduling appointments to increase the density of the packing in the worst
case, along with utilizing the dual of the bin-packing linear programming
relaxation to perform the analysis. We also present the first known lower bound
of 1.2 on the asymptotic competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized
online MPAS algorithm. These results demonstrate how deferred decision-making
can be leveraged to yield improved worst-case performance, a phenomenon which
should be investigated in a broader class of settings.

characterize the same object of interest using multiple viewpoints more
comprehensively. In this work, we investigate the use of canonical correlation
analysis (CCA) and penalized variants of CCA (pCCA) for the fusion of two
modalities. We study a simple graphical model for the generation of
two-modality data. We analytically show that, with known model parameters,
posterior mean estimators that jointly use both modalities outperform arbitrary
linear mixing of single modality posterior estimators in latent variable
prediction. Penalized extensions of CCA (pCCA) that incorporate domain
knowledge can discover correlations with high-dimensional, low-sample data,
whereas traditional CCA is inapplicable. To facilitate the generation of
multi-dimensional embeddings with pCCA, we propose two matrix deflation schemes
that enforce desirable properties exhibited by CCA. We propose a two-stage
prediction pipeline using pCCA embeddings generated with deflation for latent
variable prediction by combining all the above. On simulated data, our proposed
model drastically reduces the mean-squared error in latent variable prediction.
When applied to publicly available histopathology data and RNA-sequencing data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer patients, our model can
outperform principal components analysis (PCA) embeddings of the same dimension

imbalance, where the majority classes can dominate the training process and
alter the decision boundaries of the minority classes. Recently, researchers
have investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for
long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance
gain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can
help improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in
by imbalanced data distribution. This poor uniformity manifests in samples from
the minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address
this problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which
improves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. TSC
first generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It
then makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and
uniformly distributed targets during training. This forces all classes,
including minority classes, to maintain a uniform distribution in the feature
space, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in
the presence of long-tail data. Experiments on multiple datasets show that TSC
achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition tasks.

we show that \texttt{FGPR} converges to a critical point of the full

encourage new connections between closely connected nodes. We show that our
model is tractable to theoretical analysis, which helps explain how these local
dynamics erode connectivity across opinion groups, affecting polarization and a
related measure of disagreement across edges. Finally, we validate our model
against real-world data, showing that our edge dynamics drive the structure of

nature and society with global coverage. However, the data collected with new
photography tools is usually oblique - they are difficult to be georeferenced,
and huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data
may be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single
image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human
user has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the
image and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the
camera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to
enable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional
method is difficult to scale due to several challenges including the
labor-intensive inputs, the need of rich experience to identify well-defined
GCPs, and limitations in camera pose estimation. Therefore, existing
monoplotting methods are rarely used in analyzing large-scale databases or
near-real-time warning systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a
novel semi-automatic monoplotting framework that provides pixel-level
correspondence between photos and DEMs requiring minimal human interventions. A
pipeline of analyses was developed including key point detection in images and
DEM rasters, retrieving georeferenced 3D DEM GCPs, regularized gradient-based
optimization, pose estimation, ray tracing, and the correspondence
identification between image pixels and real world coordinates. Two numerical
experiments show that the framework is superior in georeferencing visual data
in 3-D coordinates, paving a way toward fully automatic monoplotting
methodology.

time-scale of roughly 26-171 days were detected. The quasi-simultaneous radio

that the synchrotron radiation is self-absorbed. The turnover frequency and the
peak flux density of the synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) spectra are in the
ranges of 42-167 GHz and 0.9-10.2 Jy, respectively. From the SSA spectra, we
derived the SSA magnetic field strengths to be 9.20 mG, 12.28 mG, and 50.97 mG

also derived the equipartition magnetic field strengths to be in the range

  Although the insdel-metric Singleton bound has been derived before, it is

that an $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon code can have insdel distance $2n-4k+4$ as long as

imperfection. In this study, we consider the effect of disorder and the
breaking of parity symmetry on a topological network system in which the edge
states are protected by Chern numbers. In the absence of periodicity, the local
Chern number is adopted to characterize the topological features of the
network. Our numerical results show that the local Chern number and the edge
states are very robust against onsite disorder as long as the gap of the bulk
state continuum remains open and survives even when the bulk band gap is
closed. Breaking the parity symmetry can destroy the quantization of local
Chern numbers, compromising the existence of edge modes. We observed
non-integer local Chern number peaks that are non-zero inside the bulk bands

for hadron physics. We first extract the internal structure of the fully heavy

only cusp effect from the $J/\psi\psi(3770)$ channel. In addition, there is
also a cusp slightly below $6.8~\mathrm{GeV}$ stemming from the
$J/\psi\psi^\prime$ channel. The two $0^{++}$ tetraquarks behave as two
resonances above the di-$\eta_c$ and di-$J/\psi$ threshold, respectively. The
$2^{++}$ state is a bound state below the di-$J/\psi$ threshold. Furthermore,
we find that the $X_{0^{++}}(6035)$ shows a significant structure in the
di-$\eta_c$ lineshape even after the coupled channel effect. This is an unique
feature which can distinguish compact $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ tetraquark from the

between a pair of feasible solutions for a particular problem. The primary
concern in Theoretical Computer Science has been revealing their computational
complexity for classical problems.
  This paper presents an initial study on reconfiguration problems derived from
a submodular function, which has more of a flavor of Data Mining. Our
submodular reconfiguration problems request to find a solution sequence
connecting two input solutions such that each solution has an objective value
above a threshold in a submodular function $f: 2^{[n]} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ and is
obtained from the previous one by applying a simple transformation rule. We
formulate three reconfiguration problems: Monotone Submodular Reconfiguration
(MSReco), which applies to influence maximization, and two versions of
Unconstrained Submodular Reconfiguration (USReco), which apply to determinantal
point processes. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
  1. We prove that MSReco and USReco are both $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete.
  2. We design a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for MSReco and a
$\frac{1}{n}$-approximation algorithm for (one version of) USReco.
  3. We devise inapproximability results that approximating the optimum value
of MSReco within a $(1-\frac{1+\epsilon}{n^2})$-factor is
$\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard, and we cannot find a
$(\frac{5}{6}+\epsilon)$-approximation for USReco.
  4. We conduct numerical study on the reconfiguration version of influence
maximization and determinantal point processes using real-world social network

explores the notion of parallel tree induction, i.e., imbuing our model with
hierarchical inductive biases in a parallelizable, non-autoregressive fashion.
To this end, our proposed FASTTREES achieves competitive or superior
performance to ON-LSTM on four well-established sequence modeling tasks, i.e.,
language modeling, logical inference, sentiment analysis and natural language
inference. Moreover, we show that the FASTTREES module can be applied to
enhance Transformer models, achieving performance gains on three sequence

mathematical language understanding), paving the way for modular tree induction

recommender systems. Existing studies have applied GNNs to capture
collaborative relations in the data. However, in real-world scenarios, the
relations in a recommendation graph can be of various kinds. For example, two
movies may be associated either by the same genre or by the same
director/actor. If we use a single graph to elaborate all these relations, the
graph can be too complex to process. To address this issue, we bring the idea
of pre-training to process the complex graph step by step. Based on the idea of
divide-and-conquer, we separate the large graph into three sub-graphs: user
graph, item graph, and user-item interaction graph. Then the user and item
embeddings are pre-trained from user and item graphs, respectively. To conduct
pre-training, we construct the multi-relational user graph and item graph,
respectively, based on their attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel
Reinforced Attentive Multi-relational Graph Neural Network (RAM-GNN) to the
pre-train user and item embeddings on the user and item graph prior to the
recommendation step. Specifically, we design a relation-level attention layer
to learn the importance of different relations. Next, a Reinforced Neighbor
Sampler (RNS) is applied to search the optimal filtering threshold for sampling
top-k similar neighbors in the graph, which avoids the over-smoothing issue. We
initialize the recommendation model with the pre-trained user/item embeddings.
Finally, an aggregation-based GNN model is utilized to learn from the
collaborative relations in the user-item interaction graph and provide
recommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that RAM-GNN outperforms other
state-of-the-art graph-based recommendation models and multi-relational graph

rich sensing information and a higher line-of-sight (LoS) availability,
THz-operated reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) acting as base stations
are deployed. The sensing parameters are extracted by leveraging THz's
quasi-opticality and opportunistically utilizing uplink communication
waveforms. This enables the use of the same waveform, spectrum, and hardware
for both sensing and communication purposes. The environmental sensing
parameters are then derived by exploiting the sparsity of THz channels via
tensor decomposition. Hence, a high-resolution indoor mapping is derived so as
to characterize the spatial availability of communications and the mobility of
users. Simulation results show that in the proposed framework, the resolution
and data rate of the overall system are positively correlated, thus allowing a
joint optimization between these metrics with no tradeoffs. Results also show
that the proposed framework improves the system reliability in static and
mobile systems. In particular, the highest reliability gains of 10% in
reliability are achieved in a walking speed mobile environment compared to

proposed instrument combines spectroscopic and polarimetric capabilities, where
the spectroscopy can resolve Doppler shifts in UV resonance lines with 10 km/s
precision, and polarimetry can resolve linear polarization with 1e-3 precision
or better. The spectroscopy will identify absorption by mass streams seen in
projection against the stellar disk as a function of orbital phase, hot
accretion spots, as well as scattering from extended splash structures,
circumbinary disks, and other flows in and above/below the orbital plane (e.g.
jets) that fail to be transferred conservatively. The polarimetry affects more
the light coming from material not seen against the stellar disk, allowing the
geometry of the scattering to be tracked, resolving ambiguities left by the
spectroscopy and light-curve information. For example, nonconservative mass
streams ejected in the polar direction will produce polarization of the
opposite sign from conservative transfer accreting in the orbital plane. Also,
time domain coverage over a range of phases of the binary orbit are well
supported by the Polstar observing strategy. Combining these elements will

amount of mass that can escape from the system, an important channel for
changing the final mass, and ultimate supernova, of the large number of massive

applicable to relatively small systems and are out of reach of most materials
researchers due to the requirement of high computing resources or the software

used an element substitution approach for generating or predicting new

crystal structure prediction algorithm (TCSP) and its companion web server,
which makes this tool to be accessible to all materials researchers. Our
algorithm uses elemental/chemical similarity and oxidation states to guide the
selection of template structures and then rank them based on the substitution
compatibility and can return multiple predictions with ranking scores in a few
minutes. Benchmark study on the ~98,290 formulas of the Materials Project
database using leave-one-out evaluation shows that our algorithm can achieve
high accuracy (for 13,145 target structures, TCSP predicted their structures
with RMSD < 0.1) for a large portion of the formulas. We have also used TCSP to
discover new materials of the Ga-B-N system showing its potential for
high-throughput materials discovery. Our user-friendly web app TCSP can be

batteries, coupled with advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), have opened up
new opportunities for enabling sustainable smart applications. Nevertheless,
implementing those computation and memory-intensive intelligent algorithms on
EH devices is extremely difficult due to the challenges of limited resources
and intermittent power supply that causes frequent failures. To address those
challenges, this paper proposes a methodology that enables fast deep learning
with low-energy accelerators for tiny energy harvesting devices. We first
propose $RAD$, a resource-aware structured DNN training framework, which
employs block circulant matrix and structured pruning to achieve high
compression for leveraging the advantage of various vector operation
accelerators. A DNN implementation method, $ACE$, is then proposed that employs
low-energy accelerators to profit maximum performance with small energy
consumption. Finally, we further design $FLEX$, the system support for
intermittent computation in energy harvesting situations. Experimental results
from three different DNN models demonstrate that $RAD$, $ACE$, and $FLEX$ can
enable fast and correct inference on energy harvesting devices with up to 4.26X
runtime reduction, up to 7.7X energy reduction with higher accuracy over the
state-of-the-art.

physical entropy for viscous and heat conductive polytropic gases behave
singularly in the presence of vacuum and it is thus a challenge to study its
dynamics. It is shown in this paper that the uniform boundedness of the entropy
and the inhomogeneous Sobolev regularities of the velocity and temperature can
be propagated for viscous and heat conductive gases in $\mathbb R^3$, provided
that the initial vacuum occurs only at far fields with suitably slow decay of
the initial density. Precisely, it is proved that for any strong solution to
the Cauchy problem of the heat conductive compressible Navier--Stokes
equations, the corresponding entropy keeps uniformly bounded and the $L^2$
regularities of the velocity and temperature can be propagated, up to the
existing time of the solution, as long as the initial density vanishes only at
far fields with a rate no more than $O(\frac{1}{|x|^2})$. The main tools are
some singularly weighted energy estimates and an elaborate De Giorgi type
iteration technique. The De Giorgi type iterations are carried out to different
equations in establishing the lower and upper bounds of the entropy.

ignores points' positional distribution, leading to inadequate assembling of
fine-grained structures. To mitigate this bottleneck, we present an efficient
alternative to max pooling, Position Adaptive Pooling (PAPooling), that
explicitly models spatial relations among local points using a novel graph
representation, and aggregates features in a position adaptive manner, enabling
position-sensitive representation of aggregated features. Specifically,
PAPooling consists of two key steps, Graph Construction and Feature
Aggregation, respectively in charge of constructing a graph with edges linking
the center point with every neighboring point in a local region to map their
relative positional information to channel-wise attentive weights, and
adaptively aggregating local point features based on the generated weights
through Graph Convolution Network (GCN). PAPooling is simple yet effective, and
flexible enough to be ready to use for different popular backbones like
PointNet++ and DGCNN, as a plug-andplay operator. Extensive experiments on
various tasks ranging from 3D shape classification, part segmentation to scene
segmentation well demonstrate that PAPooling can significantly improve
predictive accuracy, while with minimal extra computational overhead. Code will

graviton mass above which the topological phase transition disappears and

constraints is discussed. It is assumed that the constraint coefficients are
random vectors whose probability distributions are only partially known.
Possibility theory is used to model the imprecise probabilities. In one of the
interpretations, a possibility distribution (a membership function of a fuzzy
set) in the set of coefficient realizations induces a necessity measure, which
in turn defines a family of probability distributions in this set. The
distributionally robust approach is then used to transform the imprecise
constraints into deterministic counterparts. Namely, the uncertain left-had
side of each constraint is replaced with the expected value with respect to the
worst probability distribution that can occur. It is shown how to represent the
resulting problem by using linear or second order cone constraints. This leads
to problems which are computationally tractable for a wide class of
optimization models, in particular for linear programming.

beginning to be adopted by commercial processors, operating systems and

to measure the memory safety extensions supported on different processors. In
fact, the issue is not constrained only for memory safety but all aspect of
processor security. All of the existing test suites related to processor
security lack some of the key properties, such as comprehensiveness,
distinguishability and portability.
  As an initial step, we propose an expandable test framework for measuring the
processor security and open source a memory safety test suite utilizing this
framework. The framework is deliberately designed to be flexible so it can be
gradually extended to all types of hardware supported security extensions in
processors. The initial test suite for memory safety currently contains 160
test cases covering spatial and temporal safety of memory, memory access
control, pointer integrity and control-flow integrity. Each type of
vulnerabilities and their related defenses have been individually evaluated by
one or more test cases. The test suite has been ported to three different

objective is to maximize the minimum fairness rate amongst all SUs and CUs

Angular heterogeneity occurs when the probability of choosing a moving

that particles perform Gaussian Fickian diffusion with directional drifting in

seek the services of online blackmarkets for rapidly inflating content
reputation. Such blackmarkets act underneath a thriving collusive ecosystem
comprising core users and compromised accounts (together known as collusive
users). Core users form the backbone of blackmarkets; thus, spotting and
suspending them may help in destabilizing the entire collusive network.
Although a few studies focused on collusive user detection on Twitter,
Facebook, and YouTube, none of them differentiate between core users and
compromised accounts.
  We are the first to present a rigorous analysis of core users in YouTube
blackmarkets. To this end, we collect a new dataset of collusive YouTube users.
We study the core-periphery structure of the underlying collusive commenting
network (CCN). We examine the topology of CCN to explore the behavioral
dynamics of core and compromised users. We then introduce KORSE, a novel
graph-based method to automatically detect core users based only on the
topological structure of CCN. KORSE performs a weighted k-core decomposition
using our proposed metric, called Weighted Internal Core Collusive Index
(WICCI). However, KORSE is infeasible to adopt in practice as it requires
complete interactions among collusive users to construct CCN. We, therefore,
propose NURSE, a deep fusion framework that only leverages user timelines
(without considering the underlying CCN) to detect core blackmarket users.
Experimental results show that NURSE is quite close to KORSE in detecting core
users and outperforms nine baselines.

up to 30% of the shock kinetic flux escaping in Ly$\alpha$ photons. The
reformation of molecules in the cooling tail means H$_2$ is even a good tracer

sum of exponentials. The correctness of the auxiliary linear problem is ensured
by the obtained estimates of the stability of the solution concerning the
initial data and the right-hand side in the corresponding Hilbert spaces. The
study's main result is to prove the unconditional stability of the proposed
two-level scheme with weights for the evolutionary system of equations for
modeling heat conduction in solid media with memory. In this case, finding an
approximate solution on a new level in time is not more complicated than the
classical heat equation. The numerical solution of a model one-dimensional in
space heat conduction problem with memory effects is presented.

available yet may fail to be adopted. This paper focusses specifically on
cognitive factors that affect adoption including: inability to generate trust,
loss of farming knowledge and reduced social cognition. It is recommended that
agriculture develops its own framework for the performance and safety of RAAT
drawing on human factors research in aerospace engineering including human
inputs (individual variance in knowledge, skills, abilities, preferences, needs
and traits), trust, situational awareness and cognitive load. The kinds of
cognitive impacts depend on the RAATs level of autonomy, ie whether it has
automatic, partial autonomy and autonomous functionality and stage of adoption,
ie adoption, initial use or post-adoptive use. The more autonomous a system is,
the less a human needs to know to operate it and the less the cognitive load,
but it also means farmers have less situational awareness about on farm
activities that in turn may affect strategic decision-making about their
enterprise. Some cognitive factors may be hidden when RAAT is first adopted but
play a greater role during prolonged or intense post-adoptive use. Systems with
partial autonomy need intuitive user interfaces, engaging system information,
and clear signaling to be trusted with low level tasks; and to compliment and
augment high order decision-making on farm.

aims to learn a reliable classifier using labeled data from a source domain and
evaluate it on a target domain. In this vein, most approaches utilized domain
adaptation that maps data from different domains into a common feature space.
To further improve the model performance, several methods targeted to mine
domain-specific information were proposed. However, most of them only utilized
a limited part of domain-specific information. In this study, we first develop
a method of extracting domain-specific words based on the topic information
derived from topic models. Then, we propose a Topic Driven Adaptive Network

sub-networks: a semantics attention network and a domain-specific word
attention network, the structures of which are based on transformers. These
sub-networks take different forms of input and their outputs are fused as the

classification across domains. Case studies also indicate that topic models

fatality are not available in every disease and setting. For example, we may
know population mortality and prevalence rather than case fatality and

estimating transition rates between disease states based on incomplete data.
This builds on previous methods by using a formal statistical model with
transparent data-generating assumptions, while providing accessible software as
an R package. Rates for people of different ages and areas can be related
flexibly through splines or hierarchical models. Previous methods are also
extended to allow age-specific trends through calendar time. The model is used
to estimate case fatality for multiple diseases in the city regions of England,
based on incidence, prevalence and mortality data from the Global Burden of

relating to those diseases and areas. Different assumptions about rates are

partition the server into sub-queues, each with a smaller service capacity, and
can route different types of customers to different sub-queues

expected waiting time.
  First, we show that by properly partitioning the queue, it is possible to
reduce the expected waiting time of customers, and there exist a series of
instances such that the reduction can be arbitrarily large. Then we consider
four settings of this problem, depending on whether the partition is given
(thus only assignment decision is to be made) or not and whether each type of
customers can only be assigned to a unique queue or can be assigned to multiple
queues in a probabilistic manner. When the partition is given, we show that
this problem is NP-hard in general if each type of customers must be assigned
to a unique queue. When the customers can be assigned to multiple queues in a
probabilistic manner, we identify a structure of the optimal assignment and
develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal assignment. When the
decision maker can also optimize the partition, we show that the optimal
decision must be to segment customers deterministically based on their service
rates, and to assign customers with consecutive service rates into the same
queue. Efficient algorithms are also proposed in this case. Overall, our work
is the first to comprehensively study the queue partition problem based on
customer types, which has the potential to increase the efficiency of queueing

quark conserving weak decays of $\Xi_c$ and $\Xi_b$. This process involves
elementary transitions of $us\to du$ or $s\to ud \bar u$ with the heavy quark
as a spectator, while for the charmed baryon in the initial state it can also
occur via $cs\to dc$ to conserve the heavy quark flavor in the weak decays. It
shows that the heavy quark symmetry (HQS) plays an essential role in the
processes where the heavy quark acts as a spectator. For the $\Xi_c$ decays,
the dominance of the pole terms in the parity-conserving transitions is
evident. This can naturally explain the sizeable branching ratio for
$\Xi_c^0\to\Lambda_c\pi^-$ as recently reported by LHCb. The same mechanism
predicts a large branching ratio for $\Xi_c^+\to\Lambda_c\pi^0$. In contrast,
the decays of $\Xi_b$ will only go through the parity-violating processes
because of the HQS. In addition, the branching ratios of the $\Xi_c^+\to
\Lambda_c \pi^0$ and $\Xi_b^0\to \Lambda_b \pi^0$ processes are also predicted
for the further experimental measurement.

scale-lengths and the stellar spin parameter, {\lambda}, for all three disc
types with {\lambda} > 0.35. The outer scale-lengths of TII and TIII discs show
a positive trend with {\lambda}, albeit weaker for the latter. TII discs prefer
fast rotating galaxies. With regards to the stellar age distribution, negative
and U-shape age profiles are the most common for all disc types. Positive age
profiles are determined by a more significant contributions of young stars in
the central regions, which decrease rapidly in the outer parts. TII discs
prefer relative higher contributions of old stars compared to other mono-age
populations across the discs whereas TIII discs become progressively more
dominated by intermediate age (2-6 Gyrs) stars for increasing radius. The
change in slope of the age profiles is located after the break of the mass
surface density. We find evidence of larger flaring for the old stellar
populations in TIII systems compared to TI and TII, which could indicate the
action of other processes. Overall, the relative distributions of mono-age
stellar populations and the dependence of the star formation activity on radius

DL/UL time allocation, precoding matrices at devices, transmit covariance
matrices at the HAP, and phase shifts at the IRS. Since the resulting
optimization problem is non-convex, there are no standard methods to solve it

optimized in an iterative manner. To reduce the computational complexity, a
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) based algorithm is proposed, where we
transform the original problem into an equivalent form based on the MMSE

particular, the IRS phase shift optimization problem is recast as an
second-order cone program (SOCP), where all the IRS phase shifts are
simultaneously optimized. For comparison, we also study two suboptimal IRS
beamforming configurations in simulations, namely partially dynamic IRS

hosting clouds. The understanding of not only the formation, but also the
composition of clouds is crucial to the understanding of future observations.
As observations of the planet's surface will remain very difficult, it is
essential to link the observable high atmosphere gas and cloud composition to
the surface conditions. We present a fast and simple chemical equilibrium (eq.)
model for the troposphere of rocky exoplanets, which is in chemical and phase
eq. with the crust. The hydrostatic eq. atmosphere is built from bottom to top.
In each atmospheric layer chemical eq. is solved and all thermally stable
condensates are removed, depleting the atmosphere above in the effected
elements. These removed condensates build an upper limit for cloud formation
and can be separated into high and low temperature condensates. The most
important cloud condensates for 1000K>T>400K are KCl, NaCl, FeS, FeS2, FeO,
Fe2O3, Fe3O4. For T<400K H2O, C, NH3, NH4Cl, NH4SH are thermally stable. For
even lower temperatures of T<150K CO2, CH4, NH3, H2S become stable. The
inclusion of clouds with trace abundances results in the thermal stability of a
total of 72 condensates for atmospheres with the different surface conditions
(300K<T<1000K and p=1bar,100bar). The different cloud condensates are not
independent of each other, but follow sequences of condensation, which are
robust against changes in crust composition, surface pressure, and surface
temperature. Independent of the existence of water as a crust condensate H2O is
a thermally stable cloud condensate for all investigated elemental abundances.
However, the water cloud base depends on the hydration level of the crust.
Therefore, the detection of water condensates alone does not necessarily imply
stable water on the surface, even if the temperature could allow water
condensation.

the query image while maintaining its other attributes. For example, the collar
attribute of the query image can be changed from round to v-neck to retrieve
similar images from a large dataset. A key challenge in e-commerce is that
images have multiple attributes where users would like to manipulate and it is
important to estimate discriminative feature representations for each of these
attributes. The proposed FashionSearchNet-v2 architecture is able to learn
attribute specific representations by leveraging on its weakly-supervised
localization module, which ignores the unrelated features of attributes in the
feature space, thus improving the similarity learning. The network is jointly
trained with the combination of attribute classification and triplet ranking
loss to estimate local representations. These local representations are then
merged into a single global representation based on the instructed attribute
manipulation where desired images can be retrieved with a distance metric. The
proposed method also provides explainability for its retrieval process to help
provide additional information on the attention of the network. Experiments
performed on several datasets that are rich in terms of the number of
attributes show that FashionSearchNet-v2 outperforms the other state-of-the-art

Next-to-Quasi-Circular corrections in the $\ell=m$, $\ell\leq 5$ multipoles
entering the radiation reaction and (ii) consequently updating the NR-informed
spin-orbital sector of the model. This yields a new waveform model that
presents a higher self-consistency between waveform and dynamics and an
improved agreement with NR simulations. We test the model computing the EOB/NR
unfaithfulness $\bar{F}_{\rm EOB/NR}$ over all 534 spin-aligned configurations
available through the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime catalog, notably using the
noise spectral density of Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer, for total mass up to $500M_\odot$. We find that the maximum
unfaithfulness $\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOB/NR}$ is mostly between $10^{-4}$ and
$10^{-3}$, and the performance progressively worsens up to $\sim 5\times
10^{-3}$ as the effective spin of the system is increased. We perform similar
analyses on the \SEOB{} model, that delivers $\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOB/NR}$
values uniformly distributed versus effective spin and mostly between $10^{-3}$

that start subsonic, reach the sound speed at the sonic point and transition to
supersonic flows. The sonic point, mathematically corresponds to a singularity
of the system of differential equations describing the flow. In the problem of
an isothermal wind, the Parker solution provides an exact analytical expression
tuned appropriately so that the singularity does not affect the solution.
However, if the wind is polytropic it is not possible to find an analytical
solution and a numerical approach needs to be followed. We study solutions of
spherical winds that are driven by pressure within a gravitational field. The
solutions pass smoothly from the critical point and allow us to study the
impact of the changes of the polytropic index to these winds. We explore the
properties of these solutions as a function of the polytropic index and the
boundary conditions used. We apply the Complex Plane Strategy (CPS) and we
obtain numerically solutions of polytropic winds. This allows us to avoid the
singularity appearing in the equations through the introduction complex
variables and integration on the complex plane. Applying this method, we obtain
solutions with physical behaviour at the stellar surface, the sonic point and
at large distances from the star. We further explore the role of the polytropic
index in the flow and the effect of mass--loss rate and temperature on the
solution. We find that the increase of polytropic index as well as the decrease
of flow parameter both yield to a smoother velocity profile and lower
velocities and shifts the transition point from subsonic to supersonic
behaviour further from the star. Finally, we verify that the increasing of
coronal temperature yields higher wind velocities and a weaker dependence on
polytropic index.

(i) They are hard to interpret by human experts. (ii) Transferring results from

mimicking the human solution approach to explain-ability and transfer-ability:
By learning general concepts such as physical quantities or system states, the
model becomes interpretable by humans. Furthermore concepts on this abstract

materials, is mediated by local rearrangements called ""soft spots"". Experiments
and simulations have shown that soft spots are two-state entities interacting
via quadrupolar displacement fields generated when they switch states. When the
system is subjected to cyclic strain driving, the soft spots can return to
their original state after one or more forcing cycles. In this case, the system
has periodic dynamics and will always repeat the same microscopic states. Here
we focus on multi-periodic dynamics, i.e. dynamics that has periodicity larger
than the periodicity of the drive, and use a graph-theoretical approach to
analyze the dynamics obtained from numerical simulations. In this approach,
mechanically stable configurations that transform purely elastically into each
other over a range of applied strains, are represented by vertices, and plastic
events leading from one stable configuration to the other, are represented by
directed edges. An algorithm based on the graph topology and the displacement
fields of the soft spots reveals that multi-periodic behavior results from the
states of some soft spots repeating after more than one period and provides
information regarding the mechanisms that allow for such dynamics. To better
understand the physical mechanisms behind multi-periodicity, we use a model of
interacting hysterons. Each hysteron is a simplified two-state element
representing hysteretic soft-spot dynamics. We identify several mechanisms for
multi-periodicity in this model, some involving direct interactions between
multi-periodic hysterons and another resulting from cooperative dynamics
involving several hysterons. These cooperative events are naturally more common
when more hysterons are present, thus explaining why multi-periodicity is more
prevalent at large drive amplitudes.

translations, however, they do not have an equivalent embedded mechanism to
handle other transformations such as rotations and change in scale. Several
approaches exist that make CNNs equivariant under other transformation groups
by design. Among these, steerable CNNs have been especially effective. However,
these approaches require redesigning standard networks with filters mapped from
combinations of predefined basis involving complex analytical functions. We
experimentally demonstrate that these restrictions in the choice of basis can
lead to model weights that are sub-optimal for the primary deep learning task
(e.g. classification). Moreover, such hard-baked explicit formulations make it
difficult to design composite networks comprising heterogeneous feature groups.
To circumvent such issues, we propose Implicitly Equivariant Networks (IEN)
which induce equivariance in the different layers of a standard CNN model by
optimizing a multi-objective loss function that combines the primary loss with
an equivariance loss term. Through experiments with VGG and ResNet models on
Rot-MNIST , Rot-TinyImageNet, Scale-MNIST and STL-10 datasets, we show that
IEN, even with its simple formulation, performs better than steerable networks.
Also, IEN facilitates construction of heterogeneous filter groups allowing
reduction in number of channels in CNNs by a factor of over 30% while
maintaining performance on par with baselines. The efficacy of IEN is further
validated on the hard problem of visual object tracking. We show that IEN
outperforms the state-of-the-art rotation equivariant tracking method while

after a predefined interval of time called pulse-repetition-interval (PRI).
This technique helps to estimate the range and Doppler shift of targets and
suppress clutter. In dual-function radar communication (DFRC), different
waveforms are transmitted after each PRI. Thus, each waveform yields different
range-side-lobe (RSL) levels at the receiver's output. As a consequence,
Doppler shift estimation and clutter suppression become challenging tasks. A
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method claims that if the number of waveforms is more
than two, it is impossible to achieve fully coherent RSL levels with both
waveforms. Therefore, this algorithm uses iterative methods to achieve as much
as possible coherency and minimize the RSL levels. In contrast to that SOTA
method, we proposed two novel closed-form receivers for the DFRC that yield a
fully coherent response for several waveforms and suppress the RSL levels.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed receivers achieve full
coherency and the RSL levels are significantly lower than the conventional
method.

propose a three steps approach. In the first step, captured images by a UAV are
analyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second
step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances
among individuals, then cluster them, while the third step provides an
energy-efficient and/or reliable UAV trajectory to inspect clusters for

following insights: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle
from which the image was captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to
the estimation error in individuals' bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory
design algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due
to its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.

two approaches used for cooperation in MARL. While fully decentralized methods
are prone to converge to suboptimal solutions due to partial observability and
nonstationarity, the methods involving centralization suffer from scalability
limitations and lazy agent problem. Centralized training decentralized
execution paradigm brings out the best of these two approaches; however,
centralized training still has an upper limit of scalability not only for
acquired coordination performance but also for model size and training time. In
this work, we adopt the centralized training with decentralized execution
paradigm and investigate the generalization and transfer capacity of the
trained models across variable number of agents. This capacity is assessed by
training variable number of agents in a specific MARL problem and then
performing greedy evaluations with variable number of agents for each training
configuration. Thus, we analyze the evaluation performance for each combination
of agent count for training versus evaluation. We perform experimental
evaluations on predator prey and traffic junction environments and demonstrate
that it is possible to obtain similar or higher evaluation performance by
training with less agents. We conclude that optimal number of agents to perform
training may differ from the target number of agents and argue that transfer
across large number of agents can be a more efficient solution to scaling up

static neutron stars in the context of $f(R)$ gravity. We use the most popular
$f(R)$ gravity model, namely the $R^2$ gravity, and calculate the maximum
baryon mass of static neutron stars adopting several realistic equations of
state and one ideal equation of state, namely that of causal limit. Our
motivation is based on the fact that neutron stars with baryon masses larger
than the maximum mass for static neutron star configurations inevitably
collapse to black holes. Thus with our analysis, we want further to enlighten
the predictions for the maximum baryon masses of static neutron stars in $R^2$
gravity, which, in turn, further strengthens our understanding of the
mysterious mass-gap region. As we show, the baryon masses of most of the
equations of states studied in this paper, lie in the lower limits of the
mass-gap region $M\sim 2.5-5 M_{\odot}$, but intriguingly enough, the highest
value of the maximum baryon masses we found is of the order of $M\sim 3
M_{\odot}$. This upper mass limit also appears as a maximum static neutron star
gravitational mass limit in other contexts. Combining the two results which
refer to baryon and gravitational masses, we point out that the gravitational
mass of static neutron stars cannot be larger than three solar masses, while
based on maximum baryon masses results of the present work, we can
conspicuously state that it is highly likely the lower mass limits of
astrophysical black holes in the range of $M\sim 2.5-3 M_{\odot}$. This, in
turn, implies that maximum neutron star masses in the context of $R^2$ gravity
are likely to be in the lower limits of the range of $M\sim 2.4-3 M_{\odot}$.
Hence our work further supports the General Relativity claim that neutron stars
cannot have gravitational masses larger than $3$$M_{\odot}$.

optical nonlinearity that acts in a nonlocal manner, offering a new way of
heralding the creation of entanglement. Intriguingly, pre-shaping the

correlations. The concept can be generalized to entangle not only photons but
also photonic quasiparticles such as plasmon-polaritons and phonons.

which is also expensive. To this end, in this paper, we bring up a new problem
scenario: ""Can we derive zero-shot learning for novel attribute
detectors/classifiers and use them to automatically annotate the dataset for
labeling efficiency?"". Basically, given only a small set of detectors that are
learned to recognize some manually annotated attributes (i.e., the seen
attributes), we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a
zero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, Zero-Shot Learning for
Attributes (ZSLA), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge,
tackles this new research problem by applying the set operations to first
decompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes and then recombine
these basic attributes into the novel ones. Extensive experiments are conducted
to verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing
the semantics of the novel attributes and show their superior performance in
terms of detection and localization compared to other baseline approaches.
Moreover, we demonstrate the application of automatic annotation using our
synthesized detectors on Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Various
generalized zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the dataset
re-annotated by ZSLA show comparable performance with those trained with the

Traditional code clone detection technologies pay more attention to the

the event embedding method to model the execution characteristics of program

the flow characteristics of a chemically reacting hypersonic flow over a
backward-facing step. This work explores the effects of the Knudsen number on
the behaviour of rarefied flow and compares the results with the non-reacting
flow. The primary objective of the present thesis is to elucidate the variation
of temperature in the flow domain with Knudsen number. The results of the study
show that chemical reactions affect the temperature distribution in the flow
domain significantly.

edge frequencies are considered. We propose a game theoretic approach whereby
using the modularity function we try to estimate in a streaming graph

On the science side, we outline the types of remote Earth observation
measurements that GEOSCAN enables beyond the state-of-the-art, and how such
measurements translate to improvements in CCT that can lead to reduction in
uncertainty of the global climate models (GCMs). From the engineering side, we
investigate feasibility of the concept starting from hardware components of the

for enhanced positioning and tracking of people and assets within indoor

localization. However, the observed signal characteristics from independently
maintained WiFi access points vary greatly over time. Moreover, some of the
WiFi access points visible at the initial deployment phase may be replaced or
removed over time. These factors are often ignored in indoor localization
frameworks and cause gradual and catastrophic degradation of localization
accuracy post-deployment (over weeks and months). To overcome these challenges,
we propose a Siamese neural encoder-based framework that offers up to 40%
reduction in degradation of localization accuracy over time compared to the
state-of-the-art in the area, without requiring any retraining.

(e.g., Apache Spark) to collect, store, and analyze a large volume of security
event data for detecting cyber-attacks. The volume of digital data in general
and security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity
with which the security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is
unpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with
the unpredictable increase/decrease in the velocity of security event data.
However, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA
systems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this
paper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with
default Spark settings. we then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g.,
execution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA
system. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a
parameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's
scalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a
Spark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our
experiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system
with default Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by
59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly
impact scalability (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8%
compared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting. The findings
of our study highlight the importance of exploring the parameter space of the
