proposed instrument designed to bridge the so-called ""MeV gap"" by surveying the
sky with unprecedented sensitivity from ~100 keV to about one GeV. This energy
band is of key importance for multi-messenger and multi-wavelength studies but
it is nevertheless currently under-explored. AMEGO-X addresses this situation
by proposing a design capable of detecting and imaging gamma rays via both
Compton interactions and pair production processes. However, some of the
objects that AMEGO-X will study, such as gamma-ray bursts and magnetars, extend
to energies below ~100 keV where the dominant interaction becomes photoelectric
absorption. These events deposit their energy in a single pixel of the
detector. In this work we show how the ~3500 cm^2 effective area of the AMEGO-X
tracker to events between ~25 keV to ~100 keV will be utilized to significantly
improve its sensitivity and expand the energy range for transient phenomena.
Although imaging is not possible for single-site events, we show how we will
localize a transient source in the sky using their aggregate signal to within a
few degrees. This technique will more than double the number of cosmological
gamma-ray bursts seen by AMEGO-X, allow us to detect and resolve the pulsating
tails of extragalactic magnetar giant flares, and increase the number of
detected less-energetic magnetar bursts -- some possibly associated with fast
radio bursts. Overall, single-site events will increase the sensitive energy
range, expand the science program, and promptly alert the community of fainter
transient events.

comprises 38 entries structured in five categories. Contribution: The high
number of agile practices and thus, the wide variety increased steadily over
the past decades due to the adaption of agile methods. Based on our findings,
we present a comprehensive overview of agile practices. The research community

manner with an optimal transport adjustment for the relevant joint probability
distributions, which together provide a constructive response to claims of
bias-in-bias-out. A key distinction is between fairness claims that are
empirically testable and fairness claims that are not. We then use confusion

This approach is useful in practice since it relies only on the local age
differential between nodes to make scheduling decisions. Finally, we propose
the class of policies called Age Debt, which can handle 1) non-linear AoI cost

for over multiple decades, offering high compression rates at minor perceptual
loss in image quality. For GPU-accelerated computer vision and deep learning
tasks, such as the training of image classification models, efficient JPEG
decoding is essential due to limitations in memory bandwidth. As many decoder
implementations are CPU-based, decoded image data has to be transferred to
accelerators like GPUs via interconnects such as PCI-E, implying decreased
throughput rates. JPEG decoding therefore represents a considerable bottleneck
in these pipelines. In contrast, efficiency could be vastly increased by
utilizing a GPU-accelerated decoder. In this case, only compressed data needs
to be transferred, as decoding will be handled by the accelerators. In order to
design such a GPU-based decoder, the respective algorithms must be parallelized
on a fine-grained level. However, parallel decoding of individual JPEG files
represents a complex task. In this paper, we present an efficient method for
JPEG image decompression on GPUs, which implements an important subset of the
JPEG standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates codeword locations at arbitrary
positions in the bitstream, thereby enabling parallel decompression of
independent chunks. Our performance evaluation shows that on an A100 (V100) GPU
our implementation can outperform the state-of-the-art implementations

AccelMerger, the first automated methodology to create coarse grained, control-

matching to recognize similar function call-graphs and loops, and neural
networks to quickly evaluate their post-HLS characteristics. It accurately
identifies which functions to accelerate, and it merges accelerators to respect
an area budget and to accommodate system communication characteristics like
latency and bandwidth. Merging two accelerators can save as much as 99% of the
area of one. The space saved is used by a globally optimal integer linear
program to allocate more accelerators for increased performance. We demonstate
AccelMerger's effectiveness using HLS flows without any manual effort to

density and central escape velocities have high values. Most of our studied
objects escape in a binary with another black hole (BH) as their companion and
have masses between $100$ and $140\: M_{\odot}$. Escaping IMBHs tend to
build-up mass most effectively through repeated mergers in a binary with BHs
due to gravitational wave emission. Binaries play a key role in their ejection
from the system as they allow these massive objects to gather energy needed for
escape. The binaries in which IMBHs escape tend to have very high binding
energy at the time of escape and the last interaction is strong but does not
involve a massive intruder. These IMBHs gain energy needed to escape the
cluster gradually in successive dynamical interactions. We present specific
examples of the history of IMBH formation and escape from star cluster models.

analyzing the net effects becomes a complex task, so that one ideally would
separate those motions to simplify analysis. The model-free and two-step
approaches have established the separability of the total correlation function
of reorientation motion into contributions from statistically independent
motions. Separability has been used to justify the analysis of experimental
relaxation rate constants by fitting data to a total correlation function
resulting from the product of two or three individual correlation functions,
each representing an independent motion. The resulting parameters are used to
describe motion in the molecule, but if multiple internal motions are present,
interpreting those parameters is not trivial. We suggest an alternative
approach: quantitative and timescale-specific comparison of experiment and
simulation, as previously established using the detector analysis. This is
followed by separation of simulated correlation functions into independent
motions, and timescale-specific parameterization of the results, such that one
may determine how each motion contributes to experimental parameters. We
establish protocols for the separation of the correlation function into
components using coordinates from molecular dynamics simulation. Separation is
achieved by defining a series of frames, where the frames iteratively split the
total motion into contributions from motion within each frame and of each
frame. Then timescale specific parameters (e.g. detector responses) describing
the total motion may be interpreted in terms of the timescale-specific
parameterization of the individual motions.

system through comparing the X-ray luminosity to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich

observations confirmed it to be a merging low mass cluster featuring two
distinct subclusters, both with a highly disturbed X-ray morphology. Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data covering 120-750MHz show an extended
radio feature resembling a radio relic, near the location of a temperature
discontinuity in the X-rays. We measure a Mach number from the X-ray
temperature jump. Several characteristics of radio relics are found in
Abell2108, making this cluster one of the few low mass mergers likely hosting a
radio relic. The radio spectrum is exceptionally steep, and the radio power is
very weak (P1.4GHz=1E22W/Hz). To account for the shock/relic offset, we propose
a scenario in which the shock created the relic by re-accelerating a cloud of
pre-existing relativistic electrons and then moved away, leaving behind a
fading relic. The electron aging timescale derived from the high-frequency
steepening in the relic spectrum is consistent with the shock travel time to
the observed X-ray discontinuity. However, the lower flux in GMRT band 4 data
causing the steepening could be due to instrumental limitations, and deeper
radio data are needed to constrain the spectral slope of the relic at high

Developing our established programme of representing the quantum state through
exact free-standing deterministic trajectory models, it is shown how quantum
evolution may be treated as the autonomous propagation of two coupled
congruences. The wavefunction at a point is derived from two action functions,
each generated by a single trajectory. The model shows that conservation as
expressed through a continuity equation is not a necessary component of a
trajectory theory of state. Probability is determined by the difference in the
action functions, not by the congruence densities. The theory also illustrates
how time-reversal symmetry may be implemented through the collective behaviour
of elements that individually disobey the conventional transformation (T) of
displacement (scalar) and velocity (reversal). We prove that an integral curve
of the linear superposition of two vectors can be derived algebraically from
the integral curves of one of the constituent vectors labelled by integral
curves associated with the other constituent. A corollary establishes relations
between displacement functions in diverse trajectory models, including where
the functions obey different symmetry transformations. This is illustrated by
showing that a (T-obeying) de Broglie-Bohm trajectory is a sequence of points
on the (non-T) HJ trajectories, and vice versa.

This models the process when a rocket ejects fuel. Different scenarios are

found, in particular, near the horizon and for a photon rocket (when the

compare in two ways how a rocket can reverse its direction of motion to a black
hole near the event horizon by restoring the initial energy-to-mass ratio: (i)
by a single ejection or (ii) in the two-step process when it stops and moves
back afterwards. For a nonphotonic rocket, in case (ii) a larger mass can be
taken out from the vicinity of a horizon. For a photonic one, there is no
difference between (i) and (ii) in this respect. We also consider briefly the

$\epsilon_0$ and total energy $E$ among $N$ distinguishable particles is
resolved using the conventional theory based on Boltzmann's principle of equal
probabilities of configurations of particles distributed among energy levels

algorithmic paradigm which captures state-of-the-art algorithmic guarantees for
a wide array of problems. In the average case setting, SoS lower bounds provide
strong evidence of algorithmic hardness or information-computation gaps. Prior
to this work, SoS lower bounds have been obtained for problems in the ""dense""
input regime, where the input is a collection of independent Rademacher or
Gaussian random variables, while the sparse regime has remained out of reach.
We make the first progress in this direction by obtaining strong SoS lower
bounds for the problem of Independent Set on sparse random graphs. We prove
that with high probability over an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G\sim
G_{n,\frac{d}{n}}$ with average degree $d>\log^2 n$, degree-$D_{SoS}$ SoS fails
to refute the existence of an independent set of size $k =
\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{d}(\log n)(D_{SoS})^{c_0}} \right)$ in $G$ (where
$c_0$ is an absolute constant), whereas the true size of the largest
independent set in $G$ is $O\left(\frac{n\log d}{d}\right)$.
  Our proof involves several significant extensions of the techniques used for
proving SoS lower bounds in the dense setting. Previous lower bounds are based
on the pseudo-calibration heuristic of Barak et al [FOCS 2016] which produces a
candidate SoS solution using a planted distribution indistinguishable from the
input distribution via low-degree tests. In the sparse case the natural planted
distribution does admit low-degree distinguishers, and we show how to adapt the
pseudo-calibration heuristic to overcome this.
  Another notorious technical challenge for the sparse regime is the quest for
matrix norm bounds. In this paper, we obtain new norm bounds for graph matrices
in the sparse setting.

exist valid tests for whether the underlying density of given data is
log-concave. The recent universal inference methodology provides a valid test.
The universal test relies on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and efficient
methods already exist for finding the log-concave MLE. This yields the first
test of log-concavity that is provably valid in finite samples in any
dimension, for which we also establish asymptotic consistency results.
Empirically, we find that the highest power is obtained by using random
projections to convert the d-dimensional testing problem into many
one-dimensional problems, leading to a simple procedure that is statistically

give an online algorithm for this problem with a competitive ratio of ${\rm

Prior to our work, the best competitive ratio known for this problem was $O(k

based on a new covering linear program relaxation for $k$-server on HSTs. This
LP naturally corresponds to the min-cost flow formulation of $k$-server, and
easily extends to the case of time-windows. We give an online algorithm for
obtaining a feasible fractional solution for this LP, and a primal dual
analysis framework for accounting the cost of the solution. Together, they
yield a new $k$-server algorithm with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio, and
extend to the time-windows case as well. Our principal technical contribution
lies in thinking of the covering LP as yielding a {\em truncated} covering LP
at each internal node of the tree, which allows us to keep account of server

that any feasible accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by such

that consists of finding an approximate D-stationary point of a sequence of AL

star has ionized its environment forming an HII region of size $\sim$2.7 pc,

our large-scale dust maps reveal that it has heated the dust up to several

emission resembles a bipolar HII region. From dust and $^{13}$CO gas analyses,
we find evidences that the formation of the HII region has occurred at the very

of the filament. We show that the HII region is currently compressing a clump

given reward function. In this paper, we show a number of additional
theoretical properties of GFlowNets. They can be used to estimate joint
probability distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions where
some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent
distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize
the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single
but trained generative pass. They could also be used to estimate partition
functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets
(supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over
all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph). We introduce variations
enabling the estimation of entropy and mutual information, sampling from a
Pareto frontier, connections to reward-maximizing policies, and extensions to
stochastic environments, continuous actions and modular energy functions.

(DiverGAN) to generate diverse, plausible and semantically consistent images
according to a natural-language description. DiverGAN adopts two novel
word-level attention modules, i.e., a channel-attention module (CAM) and a
pixel-attention module (PAM), which model the importance of each word in the
given sentence while allowing the network to assign larger weights to the
significant channels and pixels semantically aligning with the salient words.
After that, Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is
introduced to enable the linguistic cues from the sentence embedding to
flexibly manipulate the amount of change in shape and texture, further
improving visual-semantic representation and helping stabilize the training.
Also, a dual-residual structure is developed to preserve more original visual
features while allowing for deeper networks, resulting in faster convergence
speed and more vivid details. Furthermore, we propose to plug a fully-connected
layer into the pipeline to address the lack-of-diversity problem, since we
observe that a dense layer will remarkably enhance the generative capability of
the network, balancing the trade-off between a low-dimensional random latent
code contributing to variants and modulation modules that use high-dimensional
and textual contexts to strength feature maps. Inserting a linear layer after
the second residual block achieves the best variety and quality. Both
qualitative and quantitative results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the
superiority of our DiverGAN for realizing diversity, without harming quality

the dynamics without noise, we find that swimmers favor either cross-stream or
rotational drift, depending on their swimming speed and aspect ratio. When
including noise, i.e. rotational diffusion, we find that swimmers are driven
into certain parts of phase space, leading to a nonuniform steady-state
distribution. This distribution exhibits a transition from swimmer aggregation
in low-shear regions of the flow to aggregation in high-shear regions as the
swimmer's speed, aspect ratio, and rotational diffusivity are varied. To
explain the nonuniform phase-space distribution of swimmers, we apply a
weak-noise averaging principle that produces a reduced description of the
stochastic swimmer dynamics. Using this technique, we find that certain swimmer
trajectories are more favorable than others in the presence of weak rotational
diffusion. By combing this information with the phase-space speed of swimmers
along each trajectory, we predict the regions of phase space where swimmers
tend to accumulate. The results of the averaging technique are in good
agreement with direct calculations of the steady-state distributions of
swimmers. In particular, our analysis explains the transition from low-shear to
high-shear aggregation.

ReRAM-based architectures offer high-performance yet energy efficient computing
platforms for on-chip CNN training/inferencing. However, ReRAM-based

weights, which requires more ReRAM cells that cannot be integrated in a single

procedure effectively identifies over-confident, near off-class samples as a
cause of limited robustness in case of smoothed classifiers, and offers an

progenitor calculations, adopting a semiempirical initial-final mass relation.
The physics inputs have been updated compared to our previous BaSTI
calculations: ^{22}Ne diffusion in the core is now included, together with an
updated CO phase diagram, and updated electron conduction opacities. We have
calculated models with various different neon abundances in the core, suitable
to study white dwarfs in populations with metallicities ranging from
super-solar to metal poor, and have performed various tests/comparisons of the
chemical stratification and cooling times of our models. Two complete sets of
calculations are provided, for two different choices of the electron conduction
opacities, to reflect the current uncertainty in the evaluation of the electron
thermal conductivity in the transition regime between moderate and strong
degeneracy, crucial for the H and He envelopes. We have also made a first,
preliminary estimate of the effect -- that turns out to be generally small --
of Fe sedimentation on the cooling times of white dwarf models, following
recent calculations of the phase diagrams of carbon-oxygen-iron mixtures.
  We make publicly available the evolutionary tracks from both sets of

Sloan, Pan-STARSS, Galex, Gaia-DR2, Gaia-eDR3, HST-ACS, HST-WFC3, and JWST

perturbatively integrate the Vasiliev system in operator form and in a variety
of gauges. Expanding the master fields in inhomogenous symplectic group
elements, and letting products be controlled only by the group, we specify a
family of factorized gauges in which we are able to integrate the system to all

presented previously in the literature; and then connect, at first order, to a
family of rotated Vasiliev gauges in which the solutions can be represented in
terms of Fronsdal fields. The gauge function responsible for the latter
transformation is explicitly constructed at first order. The analysis of the
system in various orderings is facilitated by an analytic continuation of
Gaussian symbols, by means of which one can distinguish and connect the two
branches of the metaplectic double cover and give a rationale to the properties
of the inner Klein operators as Gaussian delta sequences defining analytic
delta densities. As an application of some of the techniques here developed, we

and/or divergences of resonance widths at very low and very high
eccentricities. We have recently re-examined the nature of these divergences
using non-perturbative numerical analyses, making use of Poincar\'e sections
but from a different perspective relative to previous implementations of this
method. This perspective reveals fine structure of resonances which otherwise
remains hidden in conventional approaches, including analytical,
semi-analytical and numerical-averaging approaches based on the critical
resonant angle. At low eccentricity, first order resonances do not have
diverging widths but have two asymmetric branches leading away from the nominal
resonance location. A sequence of structures called ``low-eccentricity resonant
bridges"" connecting neighboring resonances is revealed. At planet-grazing
eccentricity, the true resonance width is non-divergent. At higher
eccentricities, the new results reveal hitherto unknown resonant structures and
show that these parameter regions have a loss of some -- though not necessarily
entire -- resonance libration zones to chaos. The chaos at high eccentricities
was previously attributed to the overlap of neighboring resonances. The new
results reveal the additional role of bifurcations and co-existence of
phase-shifted resonance zones at higher eccentricities. By employing a
geometric point of view, we relate the high eccentricity phase space structures
and their transitions to the shapes of resonant orbits in the rotating frame.
We outline some directions for future research to advance understanding of the
dynamics of mean motion resonances.

constrains both branches to have consistent semantic outputs. Whilst both

used to estimate the channel behavior of molecular SIMO systems. A simplified

facets of quantum mechanics. To complete this task of steering quantum states,
one can employ quantum control through a sequence of generalized measurements
which direct the system towards the target state. In an active version of this
protocol, the obtained measurement readouts are used to adjust the protocol
on-the-go. This enables a sped-up performance relative to the passive version
of the protocol, where no active adjustments are included. In this work, we
consider such active measurement-driven steering as applied to the challenging
case of many-body quantum systems. For helpful decision-making strategies, we
offer Hilbert-space-orientation techniques, comparable to those used in
navigation. The first one is to tie the active-decision protocol to the greedy
accumulation of the cost function, such as the target state fidelity. We show
the potential of a significant speedup, employing this greedy approach to a
broad family of Matrix Product State targets. For system sizes considered here,
an average value of the speedup factor $f$ across this family settles about
$20$, for some targets even reaching a few thousands. We also identify a
subclass of Matrix Product State targets, for which the value of $f$ increases
with system size. In addition to the greedy approach, the second wayfinding
technique is to map out the available measurement actions onto a Quantum State
Machine. A decision-making protocol can be based on such a representation,
using semiclassical heuristics. This State Machine-based approach can be
applied to a more restricted set of targets, sometimes offering advantages over
the cost function-based method. We give an example of a W-state preparation
which is accelerated with this method by $f\simeq3.5$, outperforming the greedy
protocol for this target.

While some established, indirect methods are adopted to measure both these

few suggested methods exist to measure these properties when AGN are viewed
highly inclined and potentially obscured by large amounts of gas. In this
context, we explore the accuracy and performance of a recently proposed method
to estimate the spin of AGN through fitting their accretion disk spectral
energy distribution, when adapted for highly inclined and obscured systems, and
in particular to a sample of six, local water megamasers. For these sources,
both the accretion rate and inclination angle are known, allowing us to rely
only on the AGN bolometric luminosity to infer their spin. Using the bolometric
luminosity as a proxy for the accretion disk peak luminosity, we derive the
expected bolometric luminosity as a function of spin. Then, we measure the
bolometric luminosity of each source through X-ray spectroscopy, and compare it
with the expected value to constrain the spin of the AGN. The quality of the
constraints depend critically on the accuracy of the measured bolometric
luminosity, which is difficult to estimate in heavily obscured systems. Three
out of six sources do not show consistency between the expected and measured
bolometric luminosities, while other three (four, when considering the [OIII]
line as tracer of the bolometric luminosity) are formally consistent with high
spin values. Our results suggest that this method, although promising (and
possibly considered as a future calibrator for other methods) needs better
observational data and further theoretical modeling to be successfully applied

Here, we compute the predicted neutrino signal from X-ray flares detected in 66
blazars observed more than 50 times with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. We consider a scenario where X-ray flares are
powered by synchrotron radiation of relativistic protons, and neutrinos are
produced through photomeson interactions between protons with their own
synchrotron X-ray photons. Using the 1 keV X-ray light curves for flare
identification, the 0.5-10 keV fluence of each flare as a proxy for the
all-flavour neutrino fluence, and the IceCube point-source effective area for
different detector configurations, we calculate the number of muon and antimuon
neutrinos above 100 TeV expected for IceCube from each flaring source. The bulk
of the neutrino events from the sample originates from flares with durations
$\sim 1-10$ d. Accounting for the X-ray flare duty cycle of the sources in the
sample, which ranges between $\sim2$ and 24 per cent, we compute an average
yearly neutrino rate for each source. The median of the distribution (in

($\sigma_{\rm g}$), is observed to increase with the star formation rate (SFR)
of a galaxy, but it is yet not established whether this trend is driven by
stellar feedback or gravitational instabilities. In this work we carry out
hydrodynamical simulations of entire disc galaxies, with different gas
fractions, to understand the origins of the SFR-$\sigma_{\rm g}$ relation. We
show that disc galaxies reach the same levels of turbulence regardless of the
presence of stellar feedback processes, and argue that this is an outcome of
the way disc galaxies regulate their gravitational stability. The simulations
match the SFR-$\sigma_{\rm g}$ relation up to SFRs of the order of tens of
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{\rm g}\sim 50$ km s$^{-1}$ in neutral hydrogen
and molecular gas, but fail to reach the very large values ($>100$ km s$^{-1}$)
reported in the literature for rapidly star-forming galaxies. We demonstrate
that such high values of $\sigma_{\rm g}$ can be explained by 1) insufficient
beam smearing corrections in observations, and 2) stellar feedback being
coupled to the ionised gas phase traced by recombination lines. Given that the
observed SFR-$\sigma_{\rm g}$ relation is composed of highly heterogeneous
data, with $\sigma_{\rm g}$ at high SFRs almost exclusively being derived from
H$\alpha$ observations of high redshift galaxies with complex morphologies, we
caution against analytical models that attempt to explain the SFR-$\sigma_{\rm

dust is accelerated by radiation from the star and coupled to the gas via
collisional drag forces. But it has recently been shown that such dust-gas
mixtures are unstable to a super-class of instabilities called the resonant
drag instabilities (RDIs), which promote dust clustering. We therefore consider
idealized simulations of the RDIs operating on a spectrum of dust grain sizes
subject to radiative acceleration (allowing for different grain optical
properties), coupled to the gas with a realistic drag law, including or
excluding the effects of magnetic fields and charged grains, and calculate for
the first time how the RDIs could contribute to observed variability. We show
that the RDIs naturally produce significant variations ($\sim 10-20\%$
$1\sigma$-level) in the extinction, corresponding to $\sim 0.1-1\,$mag level in
the stellar types above, on timescales of order months to a year. The
fluctuations are surprisingly robust to finite source-size effects as they are
dominated by large-scale modes, which also means their spatial structure could
be resolved in some nearby systems. We also quantify how this produces
variations in the line-of-sight grain size-distribution. All of these
variations are similar to those observed, suggesting that the RDIs may play a
key role driving observed variability in dust extinction within dusty
outflow/ejection events around cool stars. We further propose that the measured
variations in grain sizes could directly be used to identify the presence of

cross-sectional area which increases from the base of the transition region
(TR) to the corona. The TR is defined as the part of a loop between the top of
the chromosphere and the location where thermal conduction changes from an
energy loss to an energy gain. There are significant differences from constant
area loops due to the manner in which the reduced volume of the TR responds to
conductive and enthalpy fluxes from the corona. For static loops with modest
area variation the standard picture of loop energy balance is retained, with
the corona and TR being primarily a balance between heating and conductive
losses in the corona, and downward conduction and radiation to space in the TR.
As the area at the loop apex increases, the TR becomes thicker and the density
in TR and corona larger. For large apex areas, the coronal energy balance
changes to one primarily between heating and radiation, with conduction playing
an increasingly unimportant role, and the TR thickness becoming a significant
fraction of the loop length. Approximate scaling laws are derived that give
agreement with full numerical solutions for the density, but not the
temperature. For non-uniform areas, dynamic loops have a higher peak
temperature and are denser in the radiative cooling phase by of order 50% than
the constant area case for the examples considered. They also show a final
rapid cooling and draining once the temperature approaches 1 MK. Although the
magnitude of the emission measure will be enhanced in the radiative phase,
there is little change in the important observational diagnostic of its
temperature dependence.

groundbreaking applications in optics and photonics. Recently, there is a
growing interest in composing EM skyrmions based on different field vectors of
EM waves. Here, we realize an EM skyrmion, i.e., a spoof plasmonic skyrmion,
using the electric field vectors of spoof localized surface plasmons (spoof
LSPs) in a planar microwave resonator with rotational and mirroring symmetries.
We construct the spoof plasmonic skyrmion, which holds a hedgehog-like
configuration in its electric field vectors, by synthesizing a scalar vortex
with a topological charge 0 in the out-of-plane component of the fields, and a
polarization vortex with a topological charge 1 in the in-plane component of
the fields. Besides an experimental demonstration of this skyrmion, we employ
group representation theory and pinpoint the symmetry origin of the skyrmion.
Such an investigation demonstrates the ubiquity of the existence of the
skyrmion in any planar EM resonator holding rotational and mirroring
symmetries, regardless the dimensions and the operating frequencies. The
designed skyrmion not only promises novel microwave applications for sensing,
processing, storing and transferring information, but also lays down a general
guideline for devising skyrmions operating over a broad range in the EM spectra
owing to the fact that the conducted symmetry investigation is independent of
specific dimension or frequency.

hand-crafted methods such as BPG (HEVC intra) in terms of the coding gain.
However, the large network size prohibits the usage of LIC on resource-limited
embedded systems. This paper reduces the network complexity by quantizing both
weights and activations. 1) For the weight quantization, we study different
kinds of grouping and quantization scheme at first. A channel-wise non-linear
quantization scheme is determined based on the coding gain analysis. After
that, we propose a fine tuning scheme to clip the weights within a certain
range so that the quantization error can be reduced. 2) For the activation
quantization, we first propose multiple non-linear quantization codebooks with
different maximum dynamic ranges. By selecting an optimal one through a
multiplexer, the quantization range can be saturated to the greatest extent. In
addition, we also exploit the mean-removed quantization for the analysis
transform outputs in order to reduce the bit-width cost for the specific
channel with the large non-zero mean. By quantizing each weight and activation
element from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit fixed point, the memory cost for
both weight and activation can be reduced by 75% with negligible coding
performance loss. As a result, our quantized LIC can still outperform BPG in
terms of MS-SSIM. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to give a
complete analysis on the coding gain and the memory cost for a quantized LIC
network, which validates the feasibility of the hardware implementation.

way neural activity drives task-related behavior in animals, operating under
the implicit assumption that the obtained solutions are universal. Observations
in both neuroscience and machine learning challenge this assumption. Animals
can approach a given task with a variety of strategies, and training machine
learning algorithms introduces the phenomenon of underspecification. These
observations imply that every task is associated with a space of solutions. To
date, the structure of this space is not understood, limiting the approach of
comparing RNNs with neural data. Here, we characterize the space of solutions
associated with various tasks. We first study a simple two-neuron network on a
task that leads to multiple solutions. We trace the nature of the final
solution back to the network's initial connectivity and identify discrete
dynamical regimes that underlie this diversity. We then examine three
neuroscience-inspired tasks: Delayed and interval discrimination, and Time
reproduction. For each task, we find a rich set of solutions. Variability can
be found directly in the neural activity of the networks, and additionally by
testing the trained networks' ability to extrapolate, as a perturbation to a
system often reveals hidden structure. Furthermore, we relate extrapolation
patterns to specific dynamical objects and effective algorithms found by the
networks. We introduce a tool to derive the reduced dynamics of networks by
generating a compact directed graph describing the essence of the dynamics with
regards to behavioral inputs and outputs. Using this representation, we can
partition the solutions to each task into a handful of types and partially
predict them from neural features. Our results shed light on the concept of the
space of solutions and its uses in Machine learning and in Neuroscience.

the star-forming disk of 19 nearby spiral galaxies with low inclination and
located close to the star formation main sequence at z=0. The mean LF slope
$\alpha$ in our sample is =1.73 with a $\sigma$ of 0.15. We find that $\alpha$
decreases with the galaxy's star formation rate surface density and argue that
this is driven by an enhanced clustering of young stars at high gas surface
densities. Looking at the HII regions within single galaxies we find that no
significant variations occur between the LF of the inner and outer part of the
star-forming disk, whereas the LF in the spiral arm areas is shallower than in
the inter-arm areas for six out of the 13 galaxies with clearly visible spiral
arms. We attribute these variations to the spiral arms increasing the molecular

at finite P\'eclet number $Pe=U h/\kappa$ (where $U$ and $h$ are characteristic
velocity and length scales, and $\kappa$ is the molecular diffusivisity of the
scalar) is a fundamental problem of interest in many environmental and
industrial flows. Particularly when $Pe \gg 1$, identifying initial
perturbations of given energy which optimally and thoroughly mix fluids of
initally different properties can be computationally challenging. To address
this challenge, we consider the identification of initial perturbations in an
idealized two-dimensional flow on a torus that extremize various measures over
finite time horizons. We identify such `optimal' initial perturbations using
the `direct-adjoint looping' (DAL) method, thus requiring the evolving flow to
satisfy the governing equations and boundary conditions at all points in space
and time. We demonstrate that minimising multiscale measures commonly known as
`mix-norms' over short time horizons is a computationally efficient and robust
way to identify initial perturbations that thoroughly mix layered scalar
distributions over relatively long time horizons, provided the magnitude of the
mix-norm's index is not too large. Minimisation of such mix-norms triggers the
development of coherent vortical flow structures which effectively mix, with
the particular properties of these flow structures depending on $Pe$ and also
the time horizon of interest.

topological invariant which quantifies a $2\pi$-quantized change in the
Berry-Zak phase between a pair of rotation-invariant lines in the bulk,
three-dimensional Brillouin zone; because this change is reversed on the
complementary section of the Brillouin zone, we refer to this new invariant as
a returning Thouless pump (RTP). We find that the RTP is associated to
anomalous values for the angular momentum of surface states, which guarantees
metallic in-gap states for open boundary condition with sharply terminated
hoppings; more generally for arbitrarily terminated hoppings, surface states
are characterized by Berry-Zak phases that are quantized to a rational multiple
of $2\pi$. The RTP adds to the family of topological invariants (the Hopf and
Chern numbers) that are known to classify two-band Hamiltonians in Wigner-Dyson
symmetry class A. Of these, the RTP and Hopf invariants are delicate, meaning
that they can be trivialized by adding a particular trivial band to either the
valence or the conduction subspace. Not all trivial band additions will nullify
the RTP invariant, which allows its generalization beyond two-band Hamiltonians
to arbitrarily many bands; such generalization is a hallmark of
symmetry-protected delicate topology.

for observing novel features of possible non-Kerr objects, in the case that the

sufficient resolution being available in the future, we explore in this work
the structure and properties of null geodesics around a Hartle-Thorne spacetime

quadrupole deformation $\delta q$. These spacetimes have been found to exhibit
a bifurcation of the equatorial light-ring to two off-equatorial light-rings in
a range of $\delta q$s and spin parameters. In addition to this, there is a
range of parameters where both the equatorial and the off-equatorial
light-rings are present. This results in the formation of a pocket that can
trap photons. We investigate the properties of these trapped orbits and find
that chaotic behaviour emerges. Some of these chaotic orbits are additionally
found to be ""sticky"" and get trapped close to periodic orbits for long times.
We also explore how these novel features affect the shadow and find that the
off-equatorial light-rings produce distinctive features that deform its
circular shape, while the chaotic behaviour associated to the pocket creates
features with fractal structure. These results are shown to be quite general,
extending to higher order Hartle-Thorne spacetimes.

that a prestack migration and a subsequent residual moveout analysis have been
performed for a seismic survey and a new depth model has not yet been
determined. Travel times of reflected events for individual traces are
determined for diffraction points situated along horizons of analysis. These
events are downward continued into the model used for the migration of the
survey. The NIP wave theorem can then be applied to events exhibiting small
subsurface offsets in order to determine residual radii of curvature to be used
in the updating of seismic velocity model by seismic stripping. Alternatively,
it is suggested to construct an aplanat and hence to determine a focus point of
the reflected event without knowledge of the true velocity model. The distance
of the estimated point of focus from the observed zero offset response of the
migrated reflector serves as an indication of the focusing of the considered
event at the particular subsurface offset and can be used as a measure for the
necessity of a subsequent remigration of the survey with a new velocity model.
A summation over the first Fresnel zone at the migrated zero offset position is
suggested as an alternative to conventional stacking leading to improvement of
the signal to noise ratio. Applications to model computations and to a seismic
survey over an overthrust structure show promising results regarding the
applicability of the suggested method.

new challenges for power system operators around the world. The high level of
complexity of IBR generators makes accurate classical model-based stability
analysis a difficult task. This paper proposes a novel methodology for solving
the problem of estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA) of a nonlinear system
by combining classical model based methods with modern data driven methods. Our
method yields certifiable inner approximations of the ROA, typical to that of
model based methods, but also harnesses trajectory data to yield an improved
accurate ROA estimation. The method is carried out by using analytical Lyapunov
functions, such as energy functions, in combination with data that is used to
fit a converse Lyapunov function. Our methodology is independent of the
function fitting method used. In this work, for implementation purposes, we use
Bernstein polynomials to function fit. Several numerical examples of ROA
estimation are provided, including the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB)
system, a three machine system and the Van-der-Pol system.

evolving and must be monitored by a multi-robot team, e.g., unmanned aerial
vehicles monitoring pasturelands in a precision agriculture context. In such a
case, an intermittent deployment strategy is necessary as persistent deployment
or monitoring is not cost-efficient for a slowly evolving process. At the same
time, the problem of where to sense once deployed must be solved as process
observations yield useful feedback for determining effective future deployment
and monitoring decisions. In this context, we model the environmental process
to be monitored as a spatiotemporal Gaussian process with mutual information as
a criterion to measure our understanding of the environment. To make the

impose a diverse set of homogeneous and heterogeneous constraints. In addition,
to reflect the cost-sensitive nature of real-world applications, we apply
budgets on the cost of deployed heterogeneous robot teams. To solve the

synergy with other communication compression methods decreasing the
communication cost further. Our experiments indicate that 8-bit decentralized
training has minimal accuracy loss compared to its full precision counterpart
even with non-IID data. However, when low precision training is accompanied by
communication compression through sparsification we observe a 1-2% drop in
accuracy. The proposed low precision decentralized training decreases
computational complexity, memory usage, and communication cost by 4x and
compute energy by a factor of ~20x, while trading off less than a $1\%$

microchannels but many of its properties remain unexplored. In this work,
inertial flow rates are investigated for different channel lengths, operating
temperatures, and resistor pulse energies. Flow in closed channels is
visualized by adding fluorescent tracer beads to the test fluid (pure water). A
robust methodology of extracting flow rates from high-resolution video
recordings is developed. Flow rates are found to scale inversely with the
channel length. The observed dependence is explained based on a simple
phenomenological ""kick"" model of inertial pumping. Flow rates are also fitted
to the more fundamental one-dimensional model of inertial pumping from which
the intrinsic drive bubble strength is extracted. The measured flow rates vary
strongly with temperature. For well-developed drive bubbles, flow rates at T =
70C are about 12x higher than at T = 30C. Three separate effects contribute to
increasing flow rates at high temperatures: (i) lower viscosity of the test
fluid, (ii) a stronger drive bubble, and (iii) increasing mechanical efficiency
of the pump, i.e., better conversion of the drive bubble strength to
unidirectional post-collapse kick. Relative contributions of the three effects
are quantified. The energy dependence of flow rates exhibits a clear saturation
behavior. The bubble strength is fitted to a phenomenological saturation model.
In the end, a complete predictive length-temperature-energy model of flow rates
is constructed. The observed strong temperature dependence of inertial pumping
should be considered when designing microfluidic workflows. It also highlights
the need for integrated flowmeters that could stabilize complex flow patterns
via sensory feedback.

(free-breathing, retrospective cardiac gating) IR radial FLASH is used for data
acquisition at 3T. First, to reduce the waiting time between inversions, an
analytical formula is derived that takes the incomplete T1 recovery into
account for an accurate T1 calculation. Second, the respiratory motion signal
is estimated from the k-space center of the contrast varying acquisition using
an adapted singular spectrum analysis (SSA-FARY) technique. Third, a
motion-resolved model-based reconstruction is used to estimate both parameter
and coil sensitivity maps directly from the sorted k-space data. Thus,
spatiotemporal total variation, in addition to the spatial sparsity
constraints, can be directly applied to the parameter maps. Validations are
performed on an experimental phantom, eleven human subjects, and a young
landrace pig with myocardial infarction. Results: In comparison to an IR
spin-echo reference, phantom results confirm good T1 accuracy when reducing the
waiting time from five seconds to one second using the new correction. The
motion-resolved model-based reconstruction further improves precision compared
to the spatial regularization-only reconstruction. Aside from showing that a
reliable respiratory motion signal can be estimated using modified SSA-FARY, in
vivo studies demonstrate that dynamic myocardial T1 maps can be obtained within
two minutes with good precision and repeatability. Conclusion: Motion-resolved
myocardial T1 mapping during free-breathing with good accuracy, precision and
repeatability can be achieved by combining inversion-recovery radial FLASH,
self-gating and a calibrationless motion-resolved model-based reconstruction.

a novel compartmental epidemiological model specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
and analyzes the effect of common preventative measures such as testing,
quarantine, social distancing, and vaccination. By accounting for the most
prevalent interventions that have been enacted to minimize the spread of the
virus, the model establishes a paramount foundation for future mathematical
modeling of COVID-19 and other modern pandemics. Specifically, the model
expands on the classic SIR model and introduces separate compartments for
individuals who are in the incubation period, asymptomatic, tested-positive,
quarantined, vaccinated, or deceased. It also accounts for variable infection,
testing, and death rates. I first analyze the outbreak in Santa Clara County,
California, and later generalize the findings. The results show that, although
all preventative measures reduce the spread of COVID-19, quarantine and social
distancing mandates reduce the infection rate and subsequently are the most
effective policies, followed by vaccine distribution and, finally, public
testing. Thus, governments should concentrate resources on enforcing quarantine
and social distancing policies. In addition, I find mathematical proof that the
relatively high asymptomatic rate and long incubation period are driving
factors of COVID-19's rapid spread.

Fine-grained vehicle classification appears to be a challenging task as

essentially required. Existing Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR)
systems have been developed on synchronized and controlled traffic conditions.
Need for robust VMMR in complex, urban, heterogeneous, and unsynchronized

detection and fine-grained classification are addressed using deep learning. To
perform fine-grained classification with related complexities, local dataset
THS-10 having high intra-class and low interclass variation is exclusively
prepared. The dataset consists of 4250 vehicle images of 10 vehicle models,
i.e., Honda City, Honda Civic, Suzuki Alto, Suzuki Bolan, Suzuki Cultus, Suzuki
Mehran, Suzuki Ravi, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Wagon R and Toyota Corolla. This
dataset is available online. Two approaches have been explored and analyzed for
classification of vehicles i.e, fine-tuning, and feature extraction from deep
neural networks. A comparative study is performed, and it is demonstrated that
simpler approaches can produce good results in local environment to deal with
complex issues such as dense occlusion and lane departures. Hence reducing
computational load and time, e.g. fine-tuning Inception-v3 produced highest

MobileNet-v2 and ResNet-18 produced 96.8% and 95.7% accuracies, respectively.

This theoretical model combines features of the Schumpeter Mark I (centering

facts concerning growth, market concentration, inequality and productivity. In
particular, the model can reproduce the industry life-cycle, a Kuznets curve, a

and produce the gamma-rays through inelastic proton-proton collisions. We apply
a standard model for particle diffusion in the interstellar medium and derive

from Puppis A, unless the SNR is older than 7 kyr or the diffusion coefficient
is higher than typical Galactic values, and relatively low-energy cosmic rays
are currently escaping from the SNR. In the second scenario, we consider the
protostellar jet HH219 as the origin of the GeV source and find the very
interesting possibility that particles could be accelerated up to energies of
at least several TeV in HH219. This would make this system the first known of

through the dynamical formation of massless bound-state poles that are

infrared properties of the interaction vertices, inducing crucial modifications
to their fundamental Ward identities. Within this general framework, we present
a detailed derivation of the non-Abelian Ward identity obeyed by the pole-free
part of the three-gluon vertex in the soft-gluon limit, and determine the
smoking-gun displacement that the onset of the Schwinger mechanism produces to
the standard result. Quite importantly, the quantity that describes this
distinctive feature coincides formally with the bound-state wave function that
controls the massless pole formation. Consequently, this signal may be computed
in two independent ways: by solving an approximate version of the pertinent
Bethe-Salpeter integral equation, or by appropriately combining the elements
that enter in the aforementioned Ward identity. For the implementation of both
methods we employ two- and three-point correlation functions obtained from

However, there is little prior theoretical work that explains the effectiveness
of ILC even in the presence of large modeling errors, where optimal control
methods using the misspecified model (MM) often perform poorly. Our work
presents such a theoretical study of the performance of both ILC and MM on
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems with unknown transition dynamics. We
show that the suboptimality gap, as measured with respect to the optimal LQR
controller, for ILC is lower than that for MM by higher order terms that become
significant in the regime of high modeling errors. A key part of our analysis
is the perturbation bounds for the discrete Ricatti equation in the finite
horizon setting, where the solution is not a fixed point and requires tracking
the error using recursive bounds. We back our theoretical findings with
empirical experiments on a toy linear dynamical system with an approximate

communications network can incur large dark count rate increases from the
natural radiation environment of space. Displacement damage to the material
lattice of a detector from the ionizing radiation can result in a permanent
dark count increase in the detector. In this work, we analyze the
radiation-induced dark count rate of a silicon single-photon avalanche diode
onboard a satellite at different orbiting altitudes, as well as, the additional
radiation from a nuclear-disturbed environment caused by a high-altitude
nuclear explosion. For detectors on low Earth orbit satellites, protons are the
biggest source of radiation damage and are best mitigated by choosing an orbit
that minimizes exposure when passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly and
Polar Cusps. Detectors on medium Earth orbit and geostationary orbit
satellites, if shielded by more than 10 mm of aluminum, provide the best
platform in terms of the least amount of radiation damage to the detectors. In
the event of a high-altitude nuclear explosion, the artificial radiation belts
produced by the explosion will cause too much damage to silicon single-photon
detectors on low Earth orbit satellites and render them unfit for quantum
communications in less than a day. Higher orbit satellites will only suffer
minor dark count rate increases from the artificial radiation belts.

(Ly$\alpha$) forest in the spectra of high-redshift quasars are powerful
cosmological tools, yet these measurements can be compromised if the intrinsic
quasar continuum is significantly uncertain. One particularly problematic case
is broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, which exhibit blueshifted absorption
associated with many spectral features that are consistent with outflows of up
to $\sim0.1c$. As these absorption features can both fall in the forest region
and be difficult to distinguish from Ly$\alpha$ absorption, cosmological
analyses eliminate the 12 - 16% of quasars that exhibit BALs. In this paper we
explore an alternate approach that includes BALs in the Ly$\alpha$ auto
correlation function, with the exception of the expected locations of the BAL
absorption troughs. This procedure returns over 95% of the pathlength that is
lost by the exclusion of BALs, as well as increases the density of sightlines.
We show that including BAL quasars reduces the fractional uncertainty in the
covariance matrix and correlation function and does not significantly change
the shape of the correlation function relative to analyses that exclude BAL
quasars. We also evaluate different definitions of BALs, masking strategies,
and potential differences in the quasar continuum in the forest region for BALs
with different amounts of absorption.

analysis. Originally studied over the discrete hypercube, recent years have
seen increasing interest in extensions to settings like the $p$-biased cube,
slice, or Grassmannian, where variants of hypercontractivity have found a
number of breakthrough applications including the resolution of Khot's 2-2
Games Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018). In this work, we develop a
new theory of hypercontractivity on high dimensional expanders (HDX), an
important class of expanding complexes that has recently seen similarly
impressive applications in both coding theory and approximate sampling. Our
results lead to a new understanding of the structure of Boolean functions on
HDX, including a tight analog of the KKL Theorem and a new characterization of
non-expanding sets.
  Unlike previous settings satisfying hypercontractivity, HDX can be
asymmetric, sparse, and very far from products, which makes the application of
traditional proof techniques challenging. We handle these barriers with the
introduction of two new tools of independent interest: a new explicit
combinatorial Fourier basis for HDX that behaves well under restriction, and a
new local-to-global method for analyzing higher moments. Interestingly, unlike
analogous second moment methods that apply equally across all types of
expanding complexes, our tools rely inherently on simplicial structure. This
suggests a new distinction among high dimensional expanders based upon their
behavior beyond the second moment.

efficiency benefits due to sparse, event-driven computation. Non-spiking
artificial neural networks are typically trained with stochastic gradient
descent using backpropagation. The calculation of true gradients for
backpropagation in spiking neural networks is impeded by the non-differentiable
firing events of spiking neurons. On the other hand, using approximate
gradients is effective, but computationally expensive over many time steps. One
common technique, then, for training a spiking neural network is to train a
topologically-equivalent non-spiking network, and then convert it to an spiking
network, replacing real-valued inputs with proportionally rate-encoded Poisson
spike trains. Converted SNNs function sufficiently well because the mean
pre-firing membrane potential of a spiking neuron is proportional to the dot
product of the input rate vector and the neuron weight vector, similar to the
functionality of a non-spiking network. However, this conversion only considers
the mean and not the temporal variance of the membrane potential. As the
standard deviation of the pre-firing membrane potential is proportional to the
L4-norm of the neuron weight vector, we propose a weight adjustment based on
the L4-norm during the conversion process in order to improve classification
accuracy of the converted network.

the first auxiliary vector and test it on the second. In order to stabilize
risk estimate, we average this procedure over multiple draws of the synthetic

unbiased estimate of risk under no assumptions on the estimator of the mean
vector, albeit for a slightly ""harder"" version of the original problem, where
the noise variance is inflated. We show that, under the assumptions required
for Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), a limiting version of this
estimator recovers SURE exactly. We also analyze a bias-variance decomposition
of the error of our risk estimator, to elucidate the effects of the variance of
the auxiliary noise and the number of bootstrap samples on the accuracy of the

either stamping or growing a 2D monolayer on a non-Euclidean

A combination of these fields leads to anisotropic confinement and 1D flat

an autonomous, unpowered hypersonic pursuit vehicle that seeks to intercept an
evading ground target whose motion is constrained in a one-dimensional space.
We formulate this problem as a pursuit-evasion game whose saddle point solution
is in general difficult to compute onboard the hypersonic vehicle due to its
highly nonlinear dynamics. To overcome this computational complexity, we
linearize the nonlinear hypersonic dynamics around a reference trajectory and
subsequently utilize feedback control design techniques from Linear Quadratic
Differential Games (LQDGs). In our proposed guidance algorithm, the hypersonic
vehicle computes its open-loop optimal state and input trajectories off-line
and prior to the commencement of the game. These trajectories are then used to
linearize the nonlinear equations of hypersonic motion. Subsequently, using
this linearized system model, we formulate an auxiliary two-player zero-sum
LQDG which is effective in the neighborhood of the given reference trajectory
and derive its feedback saddle point strategy that allows the hypersonic
vehicle to modify its trajectory online in response to the target's evasive
maneuvers. We provide numerical simulations to showcase the performance of our
proposed guidance law.

These ghosts occur due to the presence of higher than two derivatives in the

perturbations, where superluminal modes may arise in the theory. If we consider
the quantum theory, the ghosts generate the negative norm states, which give
the negative probabilities, and therefore the ghosts are physically
inconsistent. Motivated by the importance of $F\left( R,\mathcal{G} \right)$
gravity for providing viable inflationary and dark energy phenomenologies, in
this work we shall provide a technique that can render $F\left( R,\mathcal{G}

by introducing two auxiliary scalar fields, and by employing the Lagrange
multiplier technique, the theory is ghost free in the Einstein frame. Also the

method in order to realize several cosmological evolutions of interest. We
demonstrate how we can realize several cosmologically interesting

great importance for urban applications, yet highly challenging owing to the
complexity of SAR data. This paper addresses the issue of building height
retrieval in large-scale urban areas from a single TerraSAR-X spotlight or
stripmap image. Based on the radar viewing geometry, we propose that this
problem can be formulated as a bounding box regression problem and therefore
allows for integrating height data from multiple data sources in generating
ground truth on a larger scale. We introduce building footprints from
geographic information system (GIS) data as complementary information and
propose a bounding box regression network that exploits the location
relationship between a building's footprint and its bounding box, allowing for
fast computation. This is important for large-scale applications. The method is
validated on four urban data sets using TerraSAR-X images in both
high-resolution spotlight and stripmap modes. Experimental results show that
the proposed network can reduce the computation cost significantly while
keeping the height accuracy of individual buildings compared to a Faster R-CNN
based method. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inaccurate GIS data on our
proposed network, and this study shows that the bounding box regression network
is robust against positioning errors in GIS data. The proposed method has great
potential to be applied to regional or even global scales.

interplay of deformation of the material and near-field photon transfer
therein. Furthermore, by combining such naturally constructed complex photon
transmission with a simple photon detection protocol, Schubert polynomials, the
foundation of versatile permutation operations in mathematics, have been
generated. In this study, we demonstrate an order recognition algorithm
inspired by Schubert calculus using optical near-field statistics via
nanometre-scale photochromism. More specifically, by utilizing Schubert
polynomials generated via optical near-field patterns, we show that the order
of slot machines with initially unknown reward probability is successfully
recognized. We emphasize that, unlike conventional algorithms in the
literature, the proposed principle does not estimate the reward probabilities.
Instead, it exploits the inversion relations contained in the Schubert
polynomials. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the Schubert polynomials
generated from an optical near-field pattern, order recognition performances
are compared with uniformly distributed and spatially strongly skewed
probability distributions, where the optical near-field pattern outperforms the
others. We found that the number of singularities contained in Schubert
polynomials and that of the given problem or considered environment exhibits a
clear correspondence, indicating that superior order recognition performances
may be attained if the singularity of the given problem is presupposed. This
study paves a new way toward nanophotonic intelligent devices and systems by
the interplay of complex natural processes and mathematical insights gained by
Schubert calculus.

mesoscopic samples can appear as a disorder-induced insulator-to-metal

Similarly, control theory is cast in information-theoretic terms by envisioning

about the causality, modeling, and control of turbulence, which stands as a

Consequently, existing approaches neglect to explore attention mechanisms that

joint feature learning across under-sampled and reference data, so the feature

range-dependent sound propagation problems. Existing coupled-mode programs have
disadvantages such as high computational cost, weak adaptability to complex
ocean environments and numerical instability. In this paper, a new algorithm is
designed that uses an improved range normalization and global matrix approach
to address range dependence in ocean environments. Due to its high accuracy in
solving differential equations, the spectral method has recently been applied
to range-independent normal modes and has achieved remarkable results. This
algorithm uses the Chebyshev--Tau spectral method to solve for the eigenmodes
in the range-independent segments. The main steps of the algorithm are
parallelized, so OpenMP multithreading technology is also applied for further
acceleration. Based on this algorithm, an efficient program is developed, and
numerical simulations verify that this algorithm is reliable, accurate and
capable. Compared with the existing coupled-mode programs, the newly developed
program is more stable and efficient at comparable accuracies and can solve
waveguides in more complex and realistic ocean environments.

estimating moving object velocity would not only provide a tracking capability

role in optimizing immersive multimedia systems. When assessing the quality of
360{\textdegree} video, human tends to perceive its quality degradation from
the viewport-based spatial distortion of each spherical frame to motion
artifact across adjacent frames, ending with the video-level quality score,
i.e., a progressive quality assessment paradigm. However, the existing BVQA
approaches for 360{\textdegree} video neglect this paradigm. In this paper, we
take into account the progressive paradigm of human perception towards
spherical video quality, and thus propose a novel BVQA approach (namely ProVQA)
for 360{\textdegree} video via progressively learning from pixels, frames and
video. Corresponding to the progressive learning of pixels, frames and video,
three sub-nets are designed in our ProVQA approach, i.e., the spherical
perception aware quality prediction (SPAQ), motion perception aware quality
prediction (MPAQ) and multi-frame temporal non-local (MFTN) sub-nets. The SPAQ
sub-net first models the spatial quality degradation based on spherical
perception mechanism of human. Then, by exploiting motion cues across adjacent
frames, the MPAQ sub-net properly incorporates motion contextual information
for quality assessment on 360{\textdegree} video. Finally, the MFTN sub-net
aggregates multi-frame quality degradation to yield the final quality score,
via exploring long-term quality correlation from multiple frames. The
experiments validate that our approach significantly advances the
state-of-the-art BVQA performance on 360{\textdegree} video over two datasets,

work by Antz et al. (2015) demonstrated the advantages of Jacobi iteration as
an alternative to direct solution of these systems. Depending on the threshold
and fill-level parameters chosen, the factors can be highly non-normal and, in
this case, Jacobi is unlikely to converge in a low number of iterations. We
demonstrate that row scaling can reduce the departure from normality, allowing
us to replace the inherently sequential solve with a rapidly converging
Richardson iteration. There are several advantages beyond the lower compute
time. Scaling is performed locally for a diagonal block of the global matrix
because it is applied directly to the factor. Further, an ILUT Schur complement
smoother maintains a constant GMRES iteration count as the number of MPI ranks
increases, and thus parallel strong-scaling, is improved. Our algorithms have
been incorporated into hypre, and we demonstrate improved time to solution for
Nalu-Wind and PeleLM pressure solvers. For large problem sizes, GMRES$+$AMG

remarkable strides in recent years. Among the state-of-the-art methodologies,
encoding point clouds into a bird's eye view (BEV) has been demonstrated to be
both effective and efficient. Different from perspective views, BEV preserves
rich spatial and distance information between objects. Yet, while farther
objects of the same type do not appear smaller in the BEV, they contain sparser
point cloud features. This fact weakens BEV feature extraction using
shared-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In order to address this
challenge, we propose Range-Aware Attention Network (RAANet), which extracts
effective BEV features and generates superior 3D object detection outputs. The
range-aware attention (RAA) convolutions significantly improve feature
extraction for near as well as far objects. Moreover, we propose a novel
auxiliary loss for point density estimation to further enhance the detection
accuracy of RAANet for occluded objects. It is worth to note that our proposed
RAA convolution is lightweight and compatible to be integrated into any CNN
architecture used for detection from a BEV. Extensive experiments on the
nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, with
real-time inference speed of 16 Hz for the full version and 22 Hz for the lite

Therefore, measuring and trying to understand residual heterogeneity is still

from a given equilibrium distribution of states of a complex system. The
approach is illustrated by the folding/unfolding reaction for two proteins - a
model beta-hairpin and a-helical protein a3D. For beta-hairpin, the free energy
surfaces (FESs) and free energy profiles (FEPs) are employed as the equilibrium
distributions of states, playing a role of the potentials of mean force to
determine the acceptance probabilities of new states in the MC simulations.
Based on the FESs and PESs for a set of temperatures that were simulated with
the molecular dynamics (MD) method, the MC simulations are performed to extract
folding/ unfolding rates. It has been found that the rate constants and
first-passage time (FPT) distributions obtained in the MC simulations change
with temperature in good agreement with those from the MD simulations. For a3D
protein, whose equilibrium folding/unfoldingwas studied with the
single-molecule FRET method (Chung et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 115, 2011, 3642),
the FRET-efficiency histograms at different denaturant concentrations were used
as the equilibrium distribution of protein states. It has been found that the
rate constants for folding and unfolding obtained in the MC simulations change
with denaturant concentration in reasonable agreement with the constants that
were extracted from the photon trajectories on the basis of theoretical models.
The simulated FPT distributions are single-exponential, which is consistent
with the assumption of two-state kinetics that was made in the theoretical
models. The promising feature of the present approach is that it is based
solely on the equilibrium distributions of states, without introducing any
additional parameters to perform simulations, which suggests its applicability
to other complex systems.

model. The P&R facility location problem identifies locations for a fixed
number of P&R facilities from among potential locations such that the number of
users of the P&R facilities is maximized. This problem has previously been
formalized under a multinomial logit demand function. However, as it imposes
the strong condition of the independence of irrelevant alternatives, the MNL
model is unable to represent the real-world P&R facility location problem
exactly. Respecting the nested structure of individual choice behavior, we
generalize the MNL model to a nested logit model and develop two computational
methods -- neighborhood search and randomized rounding -- to solve large-scale
P&R facility location problems under the NL demand function. The neighborhood
search method first finds one feasible solution and then improves the feasible
solution to the next one along an edge of the polyhedron whose vertices are the
feasible solutions. The neighborhood search method is randomized to create an
adaptive randomized rounding procedure. Computational experiments verified that
the computational methods were able to solve the nonlinear optimization problem
under the NL demand function on 1,000 medium-scale instances to exact

This contributes a significant uncertainty to galactic chemical evolution
simulations. We present stellar yields of AGB stars for $M=1-8$$M_\odot$ and
$Z=0.04-0.10$. We also weight these yields to represent the chemical
contribution of a metal-rich stellar population. We find that as metallicity
increases, the efficiency of the mixing episodes (known as the third dredge up)
on the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) decrease significantly. Consequently,
much of the nucleosynthesis that occurs on the TP-AGB is not represented on the
surface of very metal-rich stars. It instead remains locked inside the white
dwarf remnant. The temperatures at the base of the convective envelope also
decrease with increasing metallicity. For the intermediate mass models, this
results in the occurrence of only partial hydrogen burning at this location, if
any burning at all. We also investigate heavy element production via the slow
neutron capture process (s-process) for three 6$M_\odot$ models: $Z=0.04, 0.05$
and $0.06$. There is minor production at the first s-process peak at strontium,
which decreases sharply with increasing metallicity. We find the chemical
contributions of our models are dominated by proton capture nucleosynthesis,
mixed to the surface during first and second dredge up events. This conclusion
is mirrored in our stellar population yields, weighted towards the lower mass
regime to reflect the mass distribution within a respective galaxy.

that no single criterion obtained from modal dispersion calculations alone can
be used as a proxy for sensitivity. Furthermore, we find that the optimal
detection limits occur where directional coupling is supported, where the
narrowest spectra occur. Such narrow spectral features can only be measured by
filtering out all higher-order modes at the output, e.g., via a single-mode
waveguide. Our calculations also confirm a characteristic square root

is provided with a video, the subtitle information, a question and candidate
answers for it. The task is to predict the correct answer for the question
using the components of the multimedia - namely video/images, audio and text.
Traditionally, MovieQA is done using the image and text component of the
multimedia. In this paper, we propose a novel network with triple-attention
architecture for the inclusion of audio in the Movie QA task. This architecture
is fashioned after a traditional dual attention network focused only on video
and text. Experiments show that the inclusion of audio using the
triple-attention network results provides complementary information for Movie
QA task which is not captured by visual or textual component in the data.
Experiments with a wide range of audio features show that using such a network
can indeed improve MovieQA performance by about 7% relative to just using only
visual features.

expected to reduce road accidents and improve safety in the transportation
domain as it removes the factor of human error from driving tasks. The DNN
based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviors due to
unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. It is not possible to
generalize the DNN model performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the
driving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may
lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This
study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis based anomaly detection
system to prevent the safety critical inconsistent behavior of autonomous
vehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components.
The first component, the inconsistent behavior predictor, is based on an
autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios.
Based on reconstruction error and threshold it determines the normal and
unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behavior. The
second component provides on the fly safety guards, that is, it automatically
activates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behavior. We
evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous
driving scenarios using already available open sourced DNN based ADSs in the
Udacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of
DeepGuard can predict up to 93 percent on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83 percent on
DAVE2 ADS, and 80 percent of inconsistent behavior on the EPOCH ADS model,
outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad. Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89
percent of all predicted inconsistent behaviors of ADS by executing predefined
safety guards.

among supernova (SN) explosion mechanism(s), progenitor stars, and cosmic-ray
acceleration. Non-thermal emission from SNRs is an effective and promising tool
for probing their surrounding circumstellar media (CSM) and, in turn, the
stellar evolution and mass-loss mechanism(s) of massive stars. In this work, we
calculate the time evolution of broadband non-thermal emissions from Type Ib/c
SNRs whose CSM structures are derived from the mass-loss history of their
progenitors. Our results predict that Type Ib/c SNRs make a transition of
brightness in radio and $\gamma$-ray bands from an undetectable dark for a
certain period to a re-brightening phase. This transition originates from their
inhomogeneous CSM structures in which the SNRs are embedded within a
low-density wind cavity surrounded by a high-density wind shell and the ambient
interstellar medium (ISM). The ""resurrection"" in non-thermal luminosity happens
at an age of ~1,000 yrs old for a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor evolved within a
typical ISM density. Combining with the results of Type II SNR evolution
recently reported by Yasuda et al. (2021), this result sheds light on a
comprehensive understanding of non-thermal emissions from SNRs with different
SN progenitor types and ages, which is made possible for the first time by the
incorporation of realistic mass-loss histories of the progenitors.

However, if the intensity of the phase-reference pulse is not monitored

to launch attacks. To this end, we propose two practical phase-reference pulse
intensity attack strategies, where Eve can reduce the trusted phase noise by
manipulating the intensity of the phase-reference pulse, thereby hiding her
attack on the signal pulse if the total excess noise remains unchanged. The
performance of the LLO CV-QKD system under these attacks has been analyzed. We
show that precisely monitoring the intensity of the phase-reference pulse in

Moreover, an intensity-monitoring scheme for the phase-reference pulse is
proposed to strengthen the security of the practical LLO CV-QKD system and make
the trusted phase noise model more robust.

the Jaccrad similarity in massive binary (0/1) data. To generate $K$ hash
values for each data vector, the standard theory of MinHash requires $K$
independent permutations. Interestingly, the recent work on ""circulant MinHash""
(C-MinHash) has shown that merely two permutations are needed. The first
permutation breaks the structure of the data and the second permutation is
re-used $K$ time in a circulant manner. Surprisingly, the estimation accuracy
of C-MinHash is proved to be strictly smaller than that of the original
MinHash. The more recent work further demonstrates that practically only one
permutation is needed. Note that C-MinHash is different from the well-known
work on ""One Permutation Hashing (OPH)"" published in NIPS'12. OPH and its
variants using different ""densification"" schemes are popular alternatives to
the standard MinHash. The densification step is necessary in order to deal with
empty bins which exist in One Permutation Hashing.
  In this paper, we propose to incorporate the essential ideas of C-MinHash to
improve the accuracy of One Permutation Hashing. Basically, we develop a new
densification method for OPH, which achieves the smallest estimation variance
compared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is
named C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the
existing structure of the data), C-OPH only needs a ""shorter"" permutation of
length $D/K$ (instead of $D$), where $D$ is the original data dimension and $K$
is the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in $K$
bins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation
variance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the
existing (densified) OPH methods.

focus on the early (< 1Gyr) epoch of bar formation so that the interaction is
clearly identifiable. The nearby NGC 4303 (isolated) and NGC 3627 (interaction
history) are selected as observational analogues to tailor these simulations.
Regardless of formation mechanism, both models show similar internal dynamical
features, although the interaction appears to promote bar-arm disconnection in
the outer disc velocity structure. Both bars trigger similar boosts in star
formation (79%; 66%), while the interaction also triggers an earlier 31% burst.
Significant morphological dependence is observed in the relation between
surface gas and star formation rate. In both cases, the bar component is
notably steepest; the arm is similar to the overall disc average; and the
inter-arm clearly the shallowest. A distinguishable feature of the tidal disc
is the presence of moderately dense, inefficiently star forming gas mostly
confined to tidal debris outside the optical disc. The tidal disc also exhibits
a unique trend of radially increasing star formation efficiency and a clear
dearth of star formation which persists along the bar between the centre and
bar ends. These are potential signatures for identifying a barred system

of the drifting rate and the drifting timescale are obtained. The aberration
effect and the twist of the magnetic field lines may result in drifting in both
directions. For one FRB, the burst width is larger at lower frequency according
to the radius-to-frequency mapping. For the FRB population, the magnetic fields
of the repeaters may be larger than that of the non-repeaters. Then, according
to the radius-to-frequency mapping, the burst widths of the repeaters will be
wider than that of the apparent non-repeaters. If similar window function (or
emission cones) like that of pulsars and magnetars is also at work in the case
of FRBs, then the window function may explain the single or multiple components
of FRB profiles. The radius-to-frequency mapping modeling is to some degree
independent of the underlying radio emission mechanism.

However, the strong dependence on predicted shrink-masks leads to unstable

address these problems, we construct an efficient text detection network,

the Adaptive Shrink-Mask (ASM) is proposed to represent texts by shrink-masks

only equipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design
constraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence
performance speedup when training large-scale DNNs. Traditional memory saving
techniques either suffer from performance overhead or are constrained by
limited interconnect bandwidth or specific interconnect technology. In this
paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient CNN training framework (called
COMET) that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly reduce
the memory requirement for training, to allow training larger models or to
accelerate training. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt
image-based lossy compressors (such as JPEG) to compress the activation data,
our framework purposely adopts error-bounded lossy compression with a strict
error-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we perform a theoretical analysis on
the compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the
gradients, and empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients over the
training process. Based on these analyses, we optimize the error-bounded lossy
compression and propose an adaptive error-bound control scheme for activation
data compression. We evaluate our design against state-of-the-art solutions

that our proposed framework can significantly reduce the training memory
consumption by up to 13.5X over the baseline training and 1.8X over another

Dy$_{\rm Zr}^0$), but most often energetically less favorable than the
trivalent Dy$^{3+}$ (i.e., Dy$_{\rm Zr}^-$) in as-synthesized BaZrO$_3$, due to
the formation of low-energy, positively charged oxygen vacancies and the
mixed-site occupancy of Dy in the host lattice. The Dy$^{4+}$/Dy$^{3+}$ ratio
can, in principle, be increased by preparing the material under highly
oxidizing and Ba-rich conditions and co-doping with acceptor-like impurities;
however, post-synthesis treatment may still be needed to realize a
non-negligible Dy$^{4+}$ concentration. We also find that certain unoccupied Dy
$4f$ states and the O $2p$ states are {\it strongly hybridized}, a feature not
often seen in rare-earth-containing materials, and that the isolated Dy$_{\rm
Zr}$ defect might be the source of a broad blue emission in band-to-defect
(""charge-transfer"") luminescence.

deviation under different camera conditions. Simultaneously, we find that most
of the existing adversarial metric attacks are realized by interfering with the
color characteristics of the sample. Based on this observation, we first
propose a local transformation attack (LTA) based on color variation. It uses
more obvious color variation to randomly disturb the color of the retrieved
image, rather than adding random noise. Experiments show that the performance
of the proposed LTA method is better than the advanced attack methods.
Furthermore, considering that the contour feature is the main factor of the
robustness of adversarial training, and the color feature will directly affect
the success rate of attack. Therefore, we further propose joint adversarial
defense (JAD) method, which include proactive defense and passive defense.
Proactive defense fuse multi-modality images to enhance the contour feature and
color feature, and considers local homomorphic transformation to solve the
over-fitting problem. Passive defense exploits the invariance of contour
feature during image scaling to mitigate the adversarial disturbance on contour
feature. Finally, a series of experimental results show that the proposed joint
adversarial defense method is more competitive than a state-of-the-art methods.

locking the relative phase between the squeezed vacuum state of light obtained
by a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator and the orthogonal polarized
local oscillator beam by means of the quantum noise lock. Under the same
conditions, PSS can be employed not only to improve SNR, but also to keep the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of SNS unchanged, compared with the case of
using polarization coherent state (PCS), and the enhancement of SNR is
positively correlated with the squeezing level of PSS. With the increase of
probe laser power and atomic number density, the SNR and FWHM of SNS will
increase correspondingly. With the help of PSS of Stokes operator S2, quantum
enhancement of both SNR and FWHM of SNS signal has been demonstrated by
controlling optical power of the S2 polarization squeezed light beam or atomic

decisions for hand-off/beam switching which enhances its reliability and
latency. We formulate the LiDAR-aided blockage prediction problem and present
the first real-world demonstration for LiDAR-aided blockage prediction in
mmWave systems. In particular, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset,
based on the DeepSense 6G structure, that comprises co-existing LiDAR and
mmWave communication measurements in outdoor vehicular scenarios. Then, we
develop an efficient LiDAR data denoising (static cluster removal) algorithm
and a machine learning model that proactively predicts dynamic link blockages.
Based on the real-world dataset, our LiDAR-aided approach is shown to achieve
95\% accuracy in predicting blockages happening within 100ms and more than 80\%
prediction accuracy for blockages happening within one second. If used for
proactive hand-off, the proposed solutions can potentially provide an order of
magnitude saving in the network latency, which highlights a promising direction
for addressing the blockage challenges in mmWave/sub-THz networks.

interest. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors hosting such sensors have
recently opened up new horizons for sensing in the subnanometer scales in 2D
heterostructures. However, controlled creation of quantum sensor in a single
layer 2D materials with high sensitivity has been elusive so far. Here, we
report on a novel 2D quantum sensor, the VB2 centre in hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN), with superior sensing capabilities. The centre's inherently low symmetry
configuration gives rise to unique electronic and spin properties that
implement a qubit in a 2D material with unprecedented sensitivity. The qubit is
decoupled from its dense spin environment at low magnetic fields that gives
rise to the reduction of the spin resonance linewidth and elongation of the
coherence time. The VB2 centre is also equipped with a classical memory that
can be utilized in storing population information. Using scanning transmission
electron microscopy imaging, we confirm the presence of the point defect
structure in free standing monolayer hBN created by electron beam irradiation.
Our results provide a new material solution towards atomic-scale sensing in low
dimensions.

particle and halo models has been a challenge for twenty years. Using the same
target material, NaI(Tl), is required and presently two experiments, ANAIS-112
and COSINE-100, are running for such a goal. A precise knowledge of the
detector response to nuclear recoils is mandatory because this is the most
likely channel to find the dark matter signal. The light produced by nuclear
recoils is quenched with respect to that produced by electrons by a factor that
has to be measured experimentally. However, current quenching factor
measurements in NaI(Tl) crystals disagree within the energy region of interest
for dark matter searches. To disentangle whether this discrepancy is due to
intrinsic differences in the light response among different NaI(Tl) crystals,
or has its origin in unaccounted for systematic effects will be key in the
comparison among the different experiments. We present measurements of the
quenching factors for five small NaI(Tl) crystals performed in the same
experimental setup to control systematics. Quenching factor results are
compatible between crystals and no clear dependence with energy is observed
from 10 to 80 keVnr.

central supermassive black hole (SMBH) has a feedback effect on shaping the
global properties of the host galaxy. However, whether feedback from the
outflow is effective, and if so, whether it is positive or negative, has long
been controversial. Here, using the latest catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), we use the flux ratio of the [O II] to [Ne V] emission lines as
a proxy to compare the star formation rate (SFR) in the hosts of quasars with
different types of broad absorption lines (BALs): low-ionization (Lo)BAL,
high-ionization (Hi)BAL, and non-BAL. We find that SFR decreases from LoBAL to
HiBAL quasars, and then increases from HiBAL to non-BAL quasars. Assuming that
the sequence of LoBAL to HiBAL to non-BAL represents evolution, our results are
consistent with a quenching and subsequent rebound of star formation in quasar
host galaxies. This phenomenon can be explained that the SFR is suppressed by
the outflow, which then rebounds once the outflow disappears as the quasars
evolve from HiBALs to non-BALs. Our result suggests that the quasar outflow has
a negative global feedback on galaxy evolution.

the screening of a large number of hypothetical MOFs-water working pairs for
engineering applications is still challenging. Based on a recently reported
database of over 5000 hypothetical MOFs, a first contribution of this study is
the identification of the minimal set of crystallographic descriptors
underpinning the most important sorption properties of MOFs for \ch{CO2} and,
importantly, for \ch{H2O}. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison of several
Sequential Learning (SL) algorithms for MOFs properties optimization is carried
out and the role played by the above minimal set of crystallographic
descriptors clarified. In sorption-based energy transformations, thermodynamic
limits of important figures of merit (e.g. maximum specific energy) depend both
on operating conditions and equilibrium sorption properties in a wide range of
sorbate coverage values. The access to the latter properties is often
incomplete, with essential quantities such as equilibrium adsorption isotherms
spanning over the full sorbate coverage range and values of the isosteric heat
being only partially available. As a result, this may prevent the computation
of objective functions during the optimization procedure. We propose a fast
procedure for optimizing specific energy in a closed sorption energy storage
system with the only access to the water Henry coefficient at a fixed

for which space is relational. This means that the configuration of an
$N$-particle system is a shape, which is what remains when the effects of
rotations, translations, and dilations are quotiented out. This reformulation
of mechanics naturally leads to a relational notion of time as well, in which a
history of the universe is just a curve in shape space without any reference to
a special parametrization of the curve given by an absolute Newtonian time.
When relational mechanics (classical or quantum) is regarded as fundamental,
the usual descriptions in terms of absolute space and absolute time emerge
merely as corresponding to the choice of a gauge. This gauge freedom forces us
to recognize that what we have traditionally regarded as fundamental in physics
might in fact be imposed by us through our choice of gauge. It thus imparts a
somewhat Kantian aspect to physical theory.

effective in a range of vision tasks by learning representations invariant to
data augmentations such as random cropping and color jittering. However, such
invariance could be harmful to downstream tasks if they rely on the
characteristics of the data augmentations, e.g., location- or color-sensitive.
This is not an issue just for unsupervised learning; we found that this occurs
even in supervised learning because it also learns to predict the same label
for all augmented samples of an instance. To avoid such failures and obtain
more generalizable representations, we suggest to optimize an auxiliary
self-supervised loss, coined AugSelf, that learns the difference of
augmentation parameters (e.g., cropping positions, color adjustment
intensities) between two randomly augmented samples. Our intuition is that
AugSelf encourages to preserve augmentation-aware information in learned
representations, which could be beneficial for their transferability.
Furthermore, AugSelf can easily be incorporated into recent state-of-the-art
representation learning methods with a negligible additional training cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple idea consistently improves
the transferability of representations learned by supervised and unsupervised
methods in various transfer learning scenarios. The code is available at

weakly scattering samples inside a Lambertian cavity with high reflectance

for many NLP tasks including the traditional sequence tagging ones. Despite
their state-of-the-art performance on high-resource languages, they still fall
behind of their statistical counter-parts in low-resource scenarios. One
methodology to counter attack this problem is text augmentation, i.e.,
generating new synthetic training data points from existing data. Although NLP
has recently witnessed a load of textual augmentation techniques, the field
still lacks a systematic performance analysis on a diverse set of languages and
sequence tagging tasks. To fill this gap, we investigate three categories of
text augmentation methodologies which perform changes on the syntax (e.g.,
cropping sub-sentences), token (e.g., random word insertion) and character
(e.g., character swapping) levels. We systematically compare them on
part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and semantic role labeling for a
diverse set of language families using various models including the
architectures that rely on pretrained multilingual contextualized language
models such as mBERT. Augmentation most significantly improves dependency
parsing, followed by part-of-speech tagging and semantic role labeling. We find
the experimented techniques to be effective on morphologically rich languages
in general rather than analytic languages such as Vietnamese. Our results
suggest that the augmentation techniques can further improve over strong
baselines based on mBERT. We identify the character-level methods as the most
consistent performers, while synonym replacement and syntactic augmenters
provide inconsistent improvements. Finally, we discuss that the results most

In this paper, we investigate digital quantum simulation of open quantum

digital quantum simulation depends only on the error in a single Trotter step,
which indicates that error accumulation may not be disastrous. By numerical
simulation of the quantum circuits for the DQS of the dissipative XYZ model, we
then show that the correct results can be recovered by quantum error mitigation
as long as the error rate in the DQS is below a sharp threshold. We explain
this threshold behavior by the existence of a dissipation-driven quantum phase

to be implemented only once, and can then be parameterized with different taint
specifications (that is, sets of sources and sinks, as well as any sanitizers
that render otherwise problematic flows innocuous) to detect many different
kinds of vulnerabilities.
  But while techniques for implementing scalable inter-procedural static taint
tracking are fairly well established, crafting taint specifications is still
more of an art than a science, and in practice tends to involve a lot of manual
effort.
  Past work has focussed on automated techniques for inferring taint

approaches have shown great promise.

Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI
acquisition speed by reconstructing MR images from sub-sampled MRI data
acquired using multiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning
combined with Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the
potential to produce high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI
data. In this work we present a novel Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem
solver applied to the task of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction, called the
Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet), by exploiting the properties

each responsible for one iteration of the unrolled variational optimization
scheme for solving the inverse problem of multi-coil Accelerated MRI
Reconstruction. Contrary to traditional approaches, the optimization steps are
performed in the observation domain ($k$-space) instead of the image domain.
Each block of the RecurrentVarNet refines the observed $k$-space and comprises
a data consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input a learned
hidden state and the prediction of the previous block. Our proposed method
achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative reconstruction
results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public multi-coil brain

into the primary use of this additional phrase in the expansion development of
Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. The findings indicate that multiple
versions of the velocity function may explain the universe's initial explosion

  through Controlled Nucleation and Release of Microbubbles",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The backswimmer fly is an aquatic insect, capable of regulating its buoyancy
underwater. Its abdomen is covered with hemoglobin cells, used to bind and
release oxygen, reversibly. Upon entering water, the fly entraps an air bubble
in a superhydrophobic hairy structure on its abdomen for respiration. This
bubble, however, can change its volume through regulated oxygen flow from the
abdominal hemoglobin cells. In this way, it can reach neutral buoyancy without
further energy consumption. In this study, we develop a small, centimeter
scale, backswimmer inspired robot (BackBot) with auto-buoyancy regulation
through controlled nucleation and release of microbubbles. The bubbles nucleate
and grow directly on onboard electrodes through electrolysis, regulated by low
voltage. We use 3D printing to introduce a three-dimensional bubble-entrapping
cellular structure, in order to create a stable external gas reservoir. To
reduce buoyancy forces, the bubbles are released through linear mechanical
vibrations, decoupled from the robot's body. Through pressure sensing and a
Proportional Integral Derivative control loop mechanism, the robot
auto-regulates its buoyancy to reach neutral floatation underwater within
seconds. This mechanism can promote the replacement of traditional and
physically larger buoyancy regulation systems, such as pistons and pressurized
tanks, and to enable the miniaturization of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.

indicator of physiological status for numerous applications. Despite the
progress and active developments made in HRV metric research over the last few
decades, the representation of the heartbeat sequence upon which HRV is based
has received relatively little attention. The recently introduced heart rate
n-variability (HRnV) offers an alternative to R-to-R peak interval
representations which complements conventional HRV analysis by considering HRV
behavior on varying scales. Although HRnV has been shown to improve triage in
pilot studies, there is currently no open and standard software to support
future research of HRnV and its broader clinical applications. We aimed to
develop an open, reliable, and easy to use software package implementing HRnV
for further research and improvements of HRnV. This package has been designed
to facilitate collaborative investigations between clinicians and researchers
to study HRnV in various contexts and applications. Approach: We developed an
open-source software, HRnV-Calc, based on the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal
Toolbox (PCST), which features comprehensive graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
for HRnV and HRV analysis. Main results: While preserving the core
functionalities and performance of PCST, HRnV-Calc enables step-by-step manual
inspection and configuration of HRV and HRnV analysis, so that results can be
debugged, easily interpreted, and integrated to downstream applications.
Significance: The open-source HRnV-Calc software, an accessible and

assessment and is designed to assist in future improvements and applications of

Maximally Projected Wannier Functions (SCMPWF) approach has been implemented in
the Full-Potential-Local-Orbital code, FPLO. SCMPWFs represent the zeroth order
approximation to maximally localized Wannier functions, projecting a subset of
wave functions onto a set of suitably chosen local trial-functions with
subsequent orthonormalization. The particular nature of the local orbitals in
FPLO make them an ideal set of projectors, since they are constructed to be a

sufficient, the option is there to choose particular local linear combinations

spread in densities, which is believed to be due to the diversity of planetary
atmospheres and thus controlled by planetary atmospheric mass loss. One of the
main drivers of long-term atmospheric escape is the absorption of high-energy
XUV radiation from the host star. For main sequence solar-like stars, rotation
and XUV radiation are closely connected, with faster rotating stars being XUV
brighter and with both rotation and XUV decreasing with time. This evolution,
however, does not follow a unique path, as stars born with the same mass and
metallicity can have widely different initial rotation rates. This
non-uniqueness holds up to about 1 Gyr, while atmospheric escape from
exoplanets is strongest. The atmospheric mass loss through this period is often
deciding the future of the planet and its position in the observed population.
Therefore, the diversity of possible stellar histories can be an uncertain
factor affecting the predictions of population studies. Here, I explore its
relevance for different planets and different host stars.

critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining
their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform
metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes.
Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important
property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the
metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep
Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can
efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and
robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add
simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to
produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the
distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and
handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most
near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17\% more
reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the
performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes
and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result.
Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single
CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and
Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. CLMB is open-source and available at

of the dark matter (DM) halo of the Milky Way (MW) with the galactocentric
tangential velocities of a sample of hypervelocity stars (HVSs). We compute the
trajectories of different samples of HVSs in a MW where the baryon distribution
is axisymmetric and the DM potential either is spherical or is spheroidal or
triaxial with radial-dependent axis ratios. We determine the shape of the DM
potential with the distribution of the latitudinal velocity $|v_{\vartheta}|$
in axisymmetric Galactic potentials, or with the distribution of
$|v_{\vartheta}|$ and of a function $\bar v_{\varphi}$ of the azimuthal
velocity in non-axisymmetric Galactic potentials. We recover the correct shape
of the DM potential by comparing the distribution of $|v_{\vartheta}|$ and
$\bar v_{\varphi}$ against the corresponding distributions of mock samples of
HVSs that traveled in DM halos of different shapes. We use the largest possible
sample of $\sim 800$ HVSs of $4~M_\odot$ ejected with the Hills mechanism at a
rate $\sim 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, currently outgoing, and located at more than 10
kpc from the Galactic center. In our ideal case of galactocentric velocities
with null uncertainties and no observational limitations, our method recovers
the correct shape of the DM potential with a success rate $S\gtrsim 89\%$ in
axisymmetric Galactic potentials, and $S > 96\%$ in the explored
non-axisymmetric cases. The unsuccessful cases yield axis ratios of the DM
potential that are off by $\pm 0.1$. The success rate decreases with decreasing
sample size: for example, for a spherical DM halo, $S$ drops from $\sim 98\%$
to $\sim 38\%$ when the sample size decreases from $\sim 800$ to $\sim 40$
HVSs. A robust determination of the shape of the DM potential thus requires the
measure of the galactocentric velocity of a few hundred genuine HVSs.

expressions for the density profiles and currents in all phases. In particular,
the front width in the shock phase on a system of size $L$ is found to scale as
$L^{1/2}$, which is not predicted by mean field theory. The results are found

technology leads to an increase in road throughput and safety, which directly
addresses the increased infrastructure needs due to increased traffic on the
roads. However, the No-Free-Lunch theorem states that the performance of one
platooning coordination strategy is not necessarily transferable to other
problems. Moreover, especially in the field of SAS, the selection of the most
appropriate strategy depends on the current situation of the system. In this
paper, we address the problem of self-aware optimization of adaptation planning
strategies by designing a framework that includes situation detection, strategy
selection, and parameter optimization of the selected strategies. We apply our
approach on the case study platooning coordination and evaluate the performance
of the proposed framework.

  Environments",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing causal structure learning methods assume data collected from
one environment and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In some
cases, data are collected from different subjects from multiple environments,
which provides more information but might make the data non-identical or
non-independent distribution. Some previous efforts try to learn causal
structure from this type of data in two independent stages, i.e., first
discovering i.i.d. groups from non-i.i.d. samples, then learning the causal
structures from different groups. This straightforward solution ignores the
intrinsic connections between the two stages, that is both the clustering stage
and the learning stage should be guided by the same causal mechanism. Towards
this end, we propose a unified Causal Cluster Structures Learning (named CCSL)
method for causal discovery from non-i.i.d. data. This method simultaneously
integrates the following two tasks: 1) clustering samples of the subjects with
the same causal mechanism into different groups; 2) learning causal structures
from the samples within the group. Specifically, for the former, we provide a
Causality-related Chinese Restaurant Process to cluster samples based on the
similarity of the causal structure; for the latter, we introduce a
variational-inference-based approach to learn the causal structures.
Theoretical results provide identification of the causal model and the
clustering model under the linear non-Gaussian assumption. Experimental results
on both simulated and real-world data further validate the correctness and
effectiveness of the proposed method.

KOI-984$c$ is on a 21.5-day, moderately eccentric ($e\simeq 0.4$) orbit, in

of cliques in a $d$-uniform hypergraph. This allows us to beat the
Sauer--Shelah lemma for this notion of dimension. We use this to obtain several
results on $\Sigma_3^k$-circuits, i.e., depth-$3$ circuits with top gate OR and
bottom fan-in at most $k$:
  * Tight relationship between the number of satisfying assignments of a
$2$-CNF and the dimension of the largest projection accepted by it, thus

resource, we formulate bookkeeping equations in two different ways. The first,
called the PDE formulation, is rather standard. It employs a first order
partial differential equation, with a non-local boundary condition, for the
size-density of the consumer, coupled to an ordinary differential equation for
the resource concentration. The second is called the DELAY formulation and
employs a renewal equation for the population level birth rate of the consumer,
coupled to a delay differential equation for the (history of the) resource
concentration. With each of the two formulations we associate a constructively
defined semigroup of nonlinear solution operators. The two semigroups are
intertwined by a non-invertible operator. In this paper we delineate in what
sense the two semigroups are equivalent. In particular, we (i) identify
conditions on both the model ingredients and the choice of state space that
guarantee that the intertwining operator is surjective, (ii) focus on large
time behaviour and (iii) consider full orbits, i.e., orbits defined for time
running from $-\infty $ to $+\infty $. Conceptually, the PDE formulation is by
far the most natural one. It has, however, the technical drawback that the
solution operators are not differentiable, precluding rigorous linearisation.
For the delay formulation, one can (under certain conditions concerning the
model ingredients) prove the differentiability of the solution operators and
establish the Principle of Linearised Stability. Next the equivalence of the
two formulations yields a rather indirect proof of this principle for the PDE
formulation.

transformative for exoplanet studies. It has even been suggested that JWST
could provide the first opportunity to search for biosignatures in an alien
atmosphere using transmission spectroscopy. This claim is investigated,
specifically for the proposed anoxic biosignature pair CH4-CO2. The most
favourable known target is adopted (TRAPPIST-1e), with an assumed atmospheric
composition similar to the Archean Earth. Compared to previous studies, a more
systematic investigation of the effect that cloud/haze-layers have on the
detectability of CH4 and CO2 is performed. In addition to a clear atmosphere
scenario, cloud/haze-layers are considered at eight pressure levels between
600mbar and 1mbar. These pressures cover a plausible range for H2O cloud and
photochemical haze, based on observations of solar system atmospheres and
physical models of tidally-locked planets such as TRAPPIST-1e, although no
assumptions regarding the cloud/haze-layer composition are made in this study.
For the clear atmosphere and cloud/haze-layer pressures of 600-100mbar, strong
(5-sigma) detections of both CH4 and CO2 are found to be possible with
approximately 5-10 co-added transits measured using the Near Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSpec) prism, assuming a dry stratosphere. However,
approximately 30 co-added transits would be required to achieve the same result
if a cloud/haze-layer is present at 10mbar. A cloud/haze-layer at 1mbar would
prevent the detection of either molecule with the NIRSpec prism for observing
programs up to 50 transits (>200 hours of JWST time), the maximum considered.

estimation of waves impinging a sensor array. However, the majority of the
methods proposed so far only consider a known, fixed number of impinging waves,
i.e., a fixed source number. This paper proposes a machine-learning-based
estimator designed for the case when the source number is variable and hence
unknown a priori. The proposed estimator comprises a framework of single-label
classifiers. Each classifier predicts if waves are present within certain
randomly selected segments of the array's field of view (FOV), resulting from
discretising the FOV with a certain (FOV) resolution. The classifiers'
predictions are combined into a probabilistic angle spectrum, whereupon the
source number and the AOAs are estimated jointly by applying a probability
threshold whose optimal level is learned from data. The estimator's performance
is assessed using a new performance metric: the joint AOA estimation success
rate. Numerical simulations show that for low SNR (-10 dB), a low FOV
resolution (2$^\circ$) yields a higher success rate than a high resolution
(1$^\circ$), whereas the opposite applies for mid (0 dB) and high (10 dB) SNRs.
In nearly all simulations, except one at low SNR and a high FOV resolution, the
proposed estimator outperforms the MUSIC algorithm if the maximum allowed AOA
estimation error is approximately equal to (or larger than) the FOV resolution.

this case, the LHC sensitivity to new physics signals is influenced
significantly by systematic uncertainties associated with the Parton
Distribution Functions (PDF), particularly in the valence quark sector relevant

measure in experiments how dissipative the cooling mechanism is. Moreover, its
violation can reveal the departure from a strictly harmonic confinement or from

large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with fast and

suprathermal particles as seed populations for SEP events can be made by using
observations close to the Sun. We study a series of SEP events observed by the
Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) suite on board the
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) from 2020 May 27 to June 2, during which PSP was at
heliocentric distances between $\sim$0.4 and $\sim$0.2 au. These events were
also observed by the Ahead Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO-A)
near 1 au, but the particle intensity magnitude was much lower than that at
PSP. We find that the SEPs should have spread in space as their source regions
were distant from the nominal magnetic footpoints of both spacecraft, and the
parent CMEs were slow and narrow. We study the decay phase of the SEP events in
the $\sim$1-2 MeV proton energy range at PSP and STEREO-A, and discuss their
properties in terms of both continuous injections by successive solar eruptions
and the distances where the measurements were made. This study indicates that
seed particles can be continuously generated by eruptions associated with slow

there for tens of hours, even if minimal particle intensity enhancements were
measured near 1 au.

reflect signals of proximity to a catastrophic failure. A systematic analysis

show the variation of predictability of the system as the interaction range and

captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends
quadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences
is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention
mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic
complexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by
considering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with
Bernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a
single hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This
leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies
on specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures).
We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence

Transformer. On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, for evaluating
performance on long sequences, our method achieves results consistent with

Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in the strongly-interacting regime of
a neutral-atom system. We assume that each atom in the envisioned system
initially resides in its ground state and is subject to several external laser
pulses that are close to being resonant with the same internal atomic
transition. In particular, in the special case of a three-atom system
(Rydberg-atom trimer) we determine configurations of field alignments and
atomic positions that enable the realization of chiral $W$ states -- a special
type of twisted three-qubit $W$ states of interest for implementing
noiseless-subsystem qubit encoding. Using chiral W states as an example we also
address the problem of deterministically converting twisted $W$ states into
their GHZ counterparts in the same three-atom system, thus significantly
generalizing recent works that involve only ordinary $W$ states. We show that
starting from twisted -- rather than ordinary -- $W$ states is equivalent to
renormalizing downwards the relevant Rabi frequencies. While this leads to
somewhat longer state-conversion times, we also demonstrate that those times
are at least two orders of magnitude shorter than typical lifetimes of relevant
Rydberg states.

to simulate individual stars in a simulation with only moderately high
resolution for the gas, allowing us to study whole sections of a galaxy rather
than be restricted to individual clouds. We use this method to simulate star
and star cluster formation in spiral arms, investigating massive GMCs and
spiral arm regions with lower mass clouds, from two galaxy models with
different spiral potentials. After selecting these regions from pre-run galaxy
simulations, we re-sample the particles to obtain a higher resolution. We then
re-simulate these regions for 3 Myr to study where and how star clusters form.
We analyse the early evolution of the embedded star clusters in these regions.
We find that the massive GMC regions, which are more common with stronger
spiral arms, form more massive clusters than the sections of spiral arms
containing lower mass clouds. Clusters form both by accreting gas and by
merging with other proto-clusters, the latter happening more frequently in the
denser GMC regions.

networks, queuing networks, and distribution networks. While the flow dynamics
in such networks follow the conservation of mass on the links, the outflow from
each link is often non-linear due to, e.g., flow capacity constraints and
simultaneous service rate constraints. Such non-linear constraints imply a
limit on the magnitude of exogenous inflow that is able to be accommodated by
the network before it becomes overloaded and its state trajectory diverges.
This paper shows how the Strong integral Input-to-State Stability (Strong iISS)
property allows for quantifying the effects of the exogenous inflow on the flow
dynamics. The Strong iISS property enables a unified stability analysis of
classes of dynamical flow networks that were only partly analyzable before,
such as networks with cycles, multi-commodity flow networks and networks with
non-monotone flow dynamics. We present sufficient conditions on the maximum
magnitude of exogenous inflow to guarantee input-to-state stability for a
dynamical flow network, and we also present cases when this sufficient
condition is necessary. The conditions are exemplified on a few existing
dynamical flow network models, specifically, fluid queuing models with
time-varying exogenous inflows and multi-commodity flow models.

complex, where the spatial distribution of haze is varied from image to image.
Recent methods adopt deep neural networks to recover clean scenes from hazy
images directly. However, due to the paradox caused by the variation of real
captured haze and the fixed degradation parameters of the current networks, the
generalization ability of recent dehazing methods on real-world hazy images is
not ideal.To address the problem of modeling real-world haze degradation, we
propose to solve this problem by perceiving and modeling density for uneven
haze distribution. We propose a novel Separable Hybrid Attention (SHA) module
to encode haze density by capturing features in the orthogonal directions to
achieve this goal. Moreover, a density map is proposed to model the uneven
distribution of the haze explicitly. The density map generates positional
encoding in a semi-supervised way. Such a haze density perceiving and modeling
capture the unevenly distributed degeneration at the feature level effectively.
Through a suitable combination of SHA and density map, we design a novel
dehazing network architecture, which achieves a good complexity-performance
trade-off. The extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate
that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin

In this paper, we present a simple approach to address this task. We use CLIP
encoding as a prefix to the caption, by employing a simple mapping network, and
then fine-tunes a language model to generate the image captions. The recently
proposed CLIP model contains rich semantic features which were trained with
textual context, making it best for vision-language perception. Our key idea is
that together with a pre-trained language model (GPT2), we obtain a wide
understanding of both visual and textual data. Hence, our approach only
requires rather quick training to produce a competent captioning model. Without
additional annotations or pre-training, it efficiently generates meaningful
captions for large-scale and diverse datasets. Surprisingly, our method works
well even when only the mapping network is trained, while both CLIP and the

$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{c}}^\ast(\mathcal{X})$ the space of all continuous
functions $f$ with compact support satisfying that $\operatorname{Lip}
f:=\limsup _{r \rightarrow 0} \sup_{y\in B(\cdot, r)} |f(\cdot)-f(y)|/r$ is
also a continuous function with compact support and $\operatorname{Lip} f=\lim

uniformly. Let $p \in[1,\infty)$. In this article, the authors prove that, for
any $f\in\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{c}}^\ast(\mathcal{X})$, \begin{align*}

generalizes a recent surprising formula of H. Brezis, J. Van Schaftingen, and
P.-L. Yung from the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^n$ to
$\mathcal{X}$. Applying this generalization, the authors establish new
fractional Sobolev and Gagliardo--Nirenberg inequalities in $\mathcal{X}$. All
these results have a wide range of applications. Particularly, when applied to
two concrete examples, namely, ${\mathbb R}^n$ with weighted Lebesgue measure
and the complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci

depend on the geometrical relation of differences and derivatives in the metric

A classic example is the measurement of the optical phase enabled by optical
interferometry where the best sensitivity achievable with N photons scales as
1/N - known as the Heisenberg limit . To achieve phase estimation at the
Heisenberg limit, it has been common to consider protocols based on highly
complex NOON states of light. However, despite decades of research and several
experimental explorations, there has been no demonstration of deterministic
phase estimation with NOON states reaching the Heisenberg limit or even
surpassing the shot noise limit. Here we use a phase estimation scheme based on
a deterministic source of Gaussian squeezed vacuum states and high-efficiency
homodyne detection to obtain phase estimates with an extreme sensitivity that
significantly surpasses the shot noise limit and even beats the performance of
an ideal, and thus unrealistic, NOON state protocol. Using a high-efficiency
setup with a total loss of about 11% we achieve a Fisher Information of 15.8(6)
rad^2 per photon unparalleled by any other optical phase estimation technology.
The work represents a fundamental achievement in quantum metrology, and it
opens the door to future quantum sensing technologies for the interrogation of
light-sensitive biological systems.

we utilize our high-fidelity continuum method, material point method (MPM).
Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of

prove sample complexity guarantees for this procedure, which bound how large

classification framework sensitive to data labels. When updating them based on

discern old class data clearly from the new. In this paper, we explore the
performance of Self-Supervised representation learning in Class Incremental
Learning (SSCIL) for the first time, which discards data labels and the model's
classifiers. To comprehensively discuss the difference in performance between
supervised and self-supervised methods in CIL, we set up three different class
incremental schemes: Random Class Scheme, Semantic Class Scheme, and Cluster
Scheme, to simulate various class incremental learning scenarios. Besides, we
propose Linear Evaluation Protocol (LEP) and Generalization Evaluation Protocol
(GEP) to metric the model's representation classification ability and
generalization in CIL. Our experiments (on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet) show that
SSCIL has better anti-forgetting ability and robustness than supervised
strategies in CIL. To understand what alleviates the catastrophic forgetting in
SSCIL, we study the major components of SSCIL and conclude that (1) the
composition of different data augmentation improves the quality of the model's
representation and the \textit{Grayscale} operation reduces the system noise of
data augmentation in SSCIL. (2) the projector, like a buffer, reduces
unnecessary parameter updates of the model in SSCIL and increases the
robustness of the model. Although the performance of SSCIL is significantly
higher than supervised methods in CIL, there is still an apparent gap with
joint learning. Our exploration gives a baseline of self-supervised class
incremental learning on large-scale datasets and contributes some forward
strategies for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting in CIL.

fall, has long been criticized for being destabilizing as it moves prices away
from the fundamentals. Motivated by the relationship between positive feedback
trading and investors cognitive bias, this paper provides a quantitative
measurement of the bias based on the conditional estimates of diffusion
processes. We prove the asymptotic properties of the estimates, which helps to
interpret the investment behaviors that if a feedback trader finds a security
perform better than his expectation, he will expect the future return to be
higher, while in the long term, this bias will converge to zero. Furthermore,
the observed deviations between the return forecast and its realized value lead
to adaptive expectations in reality, for which we raise an exponential
smoothing model as an adjustment method. In the empirical study on the stock
market in China, we show the effectiveness of the ES method in bringing the
biased expectation closer to the fundamental level, and suggest that the
feedback traders, who are often over-optimistic about the return, are likely to
suffer from downside risk and aggravate the speculative bubbles in the market.

  When designing randomized controlled trials, how to assign participants to
treatments becomes a key issue. In particular in the presence of covariate
factors, the assignment can significantly influence statistical properties and
thereby the quality of the trial. Another key issue is the widely popular
assumption among experimenters that participants do not influence each other --
which is far from reality in a field study and can, if unaccounted for,
deteriorate the quality of the trial.

trials bridging terms from different disciplines, we first address the issue of

Thereby, we review a recent assignment algorithm that achieves good worst-case
variance bounds.
  Second, we address social spillover effects. Therefore, we build a
comprehensive graph-based model of influence between participants, for which we
design our own average treatment effect estimator $\hat \tau_{net}$. We discuss

compiled in \citet{Pei20PASA}. These four derived parameters stepping onto the

in: (1) putting forward an updated demarcation between BL Lacs and FSRQs based
on the relation between broad-line region luminosity and disk luminosity both
measured in Eddington units, i.e., $L_{\rm disk}/L_{\rm
Edd}=4.68\times10^{-3}$, indicating that there are some differences between BL
Lacs and FSRQs on the accretion power in the disk; (2) proposing that there is
a so-called `appareling zone', a potential transition field between BL Lacs and
FSRQs where the changing-look blazars perhaps reside; (3) the location of
$\gamma$-ray emission region is principally constrained outside the broad-line
region, and for some BL Lacs are also away from the dusty molecular torus,

question of experimental validity becomes more critical than ever. For the
purposes of evaluation of crowd experiments, it is paramount that we
distinguish between different dimensions of their validity. Here, we
differentiate between four types of experimentation in crowd dynamics based on
their underlying purpose of investigation. This includes experiments whose main
aim is (i) testing a behavioural theory/hypothesis, (ii) exploring empirical
behavioural regularities; (iii) assessing collective (system-level) performance
rather than individual behaviour (iv) calibrating and/or validating
pre-existing models. While delineating various dimensions of external/internal
validity as they relate to crowd experiments, we argue how the importance of
different validity dimensions varies depending on investigation purpose. This
could provide clarity about circumstances where artificiality of laboratory
settings is justified as opposed to experiments for which higher levels of
contextual fidelity should be given more weight. It is critical that
investigators (a) be conscious of the trade-off between controllability and
realism in their experiment design and (b) identify potential factors that can
jeopardise validity of their experiments and mitigate them. Inferences made
from field data do not invariably supersede those of experiments on the issue
of validity. Depending on the purpose of investigation, maintaining internal
validity sometimes necessitates laboratory settings and justifies
artificiality. In the absence of adequate control over the causal relationship,
the question of external validity will be futile. Therefore, striking a
reasonable balance between internal and external validity of crowd experiments
should be made a major design consideration.
