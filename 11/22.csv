The formation processes of massive stars are still unclear but a
picture is emerging involving accretion disks and molecular outflows in what
appears to be a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation. A census of
outflow activity towards massive star-forming clumps in various evolutionary
stages has the potential to shed light on massive star formation (MSF).
  Aims. We conducted an outflow survey towards ATLASGAL clumps using SEDIGISM
data and aimed to obtain a large sample of clumps exhibiting outflows in
different evolutionary stages.
  Methods. We identify the high-velocity wings of the 13CO lines toward
ATLASGAL clumps by (1) extracting the simultaneously observed 13CO and C18O
spectra from SEDIGISM, and (2) subtracting Gaussian fits to the scaled C18O
from the 13CO, line after considering opacity broadening.
  Results. We have detected high-velocity gas towards 1192 clumps out of a
total sample of 2052, giving an overall detection rate of 58%. Outflow activity
has been detected in the earliest quiescent clumps (i.e., 70$\mu$m weak), to
the most evolved HII region stages i.e., 8$\mu$m bright with MSF tracers. The
detection rate increases as a function of evolution (quiescent=51%,
protostellar=47%, YSO=57%, UCHII regions=76%).
  Conclusion. Our sample is the largest outflow sample identified so far. The
high-detection rate from this large sample is consistent with previous results
and supports that outflows are a ubiquitous feature of MSF. The lower detection
rate in early evolutionary stages may be due to that outflows in the early
stages are weak and difficult to detect. We obtain a statistically significant
sample of outflow clumps for every evolutionary stage, especially for outflow
clumps in the 70$\mu$m dark stage. This suggests that the absence of 70$\mu$m
emission is not a robust indicator of starless/pre-stellar cores.

inability to acquire and accumulate new cognitive capabilities. When some new
data appears, such as new object classes that are not in the prescribed set of

them due to the fundamental formulation that it takes. The current solution is
typically to re-design and re-learn the entire network, perhaps with a new
configuration, from a newly expanded dataset to accommodate new knowledge. This
process is quite different from that of a human learner. In this paper, we
propose a new learning method named Accretionary Learning (AL) to emulate human
learning, in that the set of objects to be recognized may not be pre-specified.
The corresponding learning structure is modularized, which can dynamically
expand to register and use new knowledge. During accretionary learning, the
learning process does not require the system to be totally re-designed and
re-trained as the set of objects grows in size. The proposed DNN structure does
not forget previous knowledge when learning to recognize new data classes. We
show that the new structure and the design methodology lead to a system that

and liquid phases due to shear jamming caused by impact. In addition to
observing Newtonian-like spreading and bulk shear jamming, we observe the
transition between these regimes in the form of localised patches of jammed
suspension in the spreading drop. We capture shear jamming as it occurs via a
solidification front traveling from the impact point, and show that the speed
of this front is set by how far the impact conditions are beyond the shear
thickening transition.

an electron. We classify the electron states further either by the spin
operator projected on the magnetic field or by the helicity operator. We then
evaluate numerically the true absorption rates accounting for the induced
emission for some parameter values typical to the outer gaps of different types

support faster and more fine-grained syscall filtering than state-of-the-art
seccomp-bpf. With the provided memory safety guarantees, DPTI can even securely
support deep argument filtering, such as string comparisons. Second, DPTI
freezes or stashes memory to efficiently confine potentially untrusted SGX

surface tension of the domain wall. Surrounding it a cloud of electrons almost
of atomic size. Also we explain the self interactions of dark matter suggested
by astronomical studies of dwarf galaxies etc. Interaction in the shielding
slows the dark matter down to a low terminal velocity. Nuclei in the
underground detectors are thus not detected. Further we explain the
``mysterious'' X-ray line of 3.5 keV from our dark matter particles colliding
with each other so that the surfaces/skins unite. Even the 3.5 keV X-ray
radiation from the Tycho supernova remnant is explained as our pearls hitting
cosmic rays in the remnant. DAMA-LIBRA and Xenon1T experiments see supposedly
our dark matter pearls excited during their stopping in the shielding or the
air. The most remarkable support for our type of model is that both these
underground experiments see events with about 3.5 keV energy, just the energy
of the X-ray line. We get a good numerical understanding of the fitted cross
section over mass ratio of self interacting dark matter observed in the study
of dwarf galaxies. Also the total energy of the dark matter pearls stopped in
the shield is reasonably matching order of magnitudewise with the absolute
observation rates of DAMA-LIBRA and Xenon1T, although the their ratio requires
further development. Accepting that the different phases of the vacuum could be
realized inside the Standard Model, our whole scheme also could. No new physics

influence important decisions pertaining to individuals, might produce outcomes
that discriminate against protected groups. We study such fairness concerns in
the context of a two-sided market, where there are two sets of agents, and each
agent has preferences over the other set. The goal is producing a matching
between the sets. This setting has been the focus of a rich body of work. The
seminal work of Gale and Shapley formulated a stability desideratum, and showed
that a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently. We study
this question through the lens of metric-based fairness notions (Dwork et al.,
Kim et al.). We formulate appropriate definitions of fairness and stability in
the presence of a similarity metric, and ask: does a fair and stable matching
always exist? Can such a matching be found in polynomial time? Our
contributions are as follows: (1) Composition failures for classical
algorithms: We show that composing the Gale-Shapley algorithm with fair
hospital preferences can produce blatantly unfair outcomes. (2) New algorithms
for finding fair and stable matchings: Our main technical contributions are
efficient new algorithms for finding fair and stable matchings when: (i) the
hospitals' preferences are fair, and (ii) the fairness metric satisfies a
strong ""proto-metric"" condition: the distance between every two doctors is
either zero or one. In particular, these algorithms also show that, in this
setting, fairness and stability are compatible. (3) Barriers for finding fair
and stable matchings in the general case: We show that if the hospital
preferences can be unfair, or if the metric fails to satisfy the proto-metric
condition, then no algorithm in a natural class can find a fair and stable
matching. The natural class includes the classical Gale-Shapley algorithms and

phonon mediated attractive electron-electron interaction throughout the entire

strength from the weak to the strong regime in our calculational procedure. The
main highlight of our results is the appearance of a '2-gap-like' structure in
the superconducting phase, arising out of the two-body interacting matrix
elements, calculated in the presence of the active Coulomb correlation. We have
made use of the 'two-square well model' potential to evaluate the

to breath-held cine MRI protocols, enabling applicability to pediatric and

the slices are acquired sequentially, the cardiac/respiratory motion patterns
may be different for each slice; current free-breathing approaches perform
independent recovery of each slice. In addition to not being able to exploit
the inter-slice redundancies, manual intervention or sophisticated
post-processing methods are needed to align the images post-recovery for
quantification. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised
variational deep manifold learning scheme for the joint alignment and
reconstruction of multislice dynamic MRI. The proposed scheme jointly learns
the parameters of the deep network as well as the latent vectors for each
slice, which capture the motion-induced dynamic variations, from the k-t space
data of the specific subject. The variational framework minimizes the
non-uniqueness in the representation, thus offering improved alignment and

It is well known
that population structure can affect evolutionary dynamics. Traditionally,
natural selection is studied between mutants that differ in reproductive rate,

different population structures. In our framework, mutation alters population
structure, which is given by a graph that specifies the dispersal of offspring.
Reproduction can be either genetic or cultural. Competing mutants disperse
their offspring on different graphs. A more connected graph implies higher
motility. We show that enhanced motility tends to increase an invader's
fixation probability, but there are interesting exceptions. For island models,
we show that the magnitude of the effect depends crucially on the exact layout
of the additional links. Finally, we show that for low-dimensional lattices,
the effect of altered motility is comparable to that of altered fitness: in the
limit of large population size, the invader's fixation probability is either
constant or exponentially small, depending on whether it is more or less motile
than the resident.

physical impact of the finite thickness of a galactic disc on the disc
stability against the non-axisymmetric perturbations and on the longevity of
the spiral density waves, with and without the presence of gas. The longevity
is quantified via group velocity of density wavepackets. The galactic disc is
first modelled as a collisionless stellar disc with finite height and then more
realistically as a gravitationally-coupled stars plus gas system (with
different thickness for stars and gas). For each case, we derive the
appropriate dispersion relation in the WKB approximation, and study the
dynamical effect of the disc thickness on the life-time of spiral density waves
via a parametric approach. We find the generic trend that the effective
reduction in disc self-gravity due to disc thickness makes it more stable
against the non-axisymmetric perturbations, and shortens the life-span of the
spiral density waves. Further, the interstellar gas and the disc thickness are
shown to have a mutually opposite dynamical effect on the disc stability as
well as the longevity of the spiral density waves. While the gas supports the
non-axisymmetric features for a longer time, the disc thickness has an
opposite, quenching effect. Consequently, the net change is set by the relative
dominance of the opposite effects of the interstellar gas and the disc
thickness.

  One of the applications is a power-logarithmic bound on the quantum transport

frequencies and uniformly for all phases. To the best of our knowledge, these
are the first results on the quantum dynamics for quasiperiodic operators in
dimension greater than one that do not require exclusion of a positive measure
of phases. Moreover, and in contrast to localisation, the estimates are uniform
in the phase.
  The arguments are also applicable to ergodic operators corresponding to other

as regularized gradient descent where the regularizer is a multiscale metric
entropy defined directly on the metric space. This answers an open question of
Bubeck (Highlights of Algorithms, 2019).

algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the
approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains
a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness
of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in
$\ell_p$-metrics.
  We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH),
which roughly asserts that the well-studied max k-coverage problem on set
systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than 1-1/e, even when the
membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then
show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced
by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation
results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are
close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we
show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:
  $\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a
factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor
of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under UGC.

a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor
of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC.
  We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective.
Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al.
(SICOMP '05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated
above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same

specific image from a large gallery given a query sketch. Despite the
widespread applicability of FG-SBIR in many critical domains (e.g., crime
activity tracking), existing approaches still suffer from a low accuracy while
being sensitive to external noises such as unnecessary strokes in the sketch.
The retrieval performance will further deteriorate under a more practical
on-the-fly setting, where only a partially complete sketch with only a few
(noisy) strokes are available to retrieve corresponding images. We propose a
novel framework that leverages a uniquely designed deep reinforcement learning
model that performs a dual-level exploration to deal with partial sketch
training and attention region selection. By enforcing the model's attention on
the important regions of the original sketches, it remains robust to
unnecessary stroke noises and improve the retrieval accuracy by a large margin.
To sufficiently explore partial sketches and locate the important regions to
attend, the model performs bootstrapped policy gradient for global exploration
while adjusting a standard deviation term that governs a locator network for
local exploration. The training process is guided by a hybrid loss that
integrates a reinforcement loss and a supervised loss. A dynamic ranking reward
is developed to fit the on-the-fly image retrieval process using partial
sketches. The extensive experimentation performed on three public datasets
shows that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
partial sketch based image retrieval.

  2022",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the offline reinforcement learning problem, where the aim is to
learn a decision making policy from logged data. Offline RL -- particularly
when coupled with (value) function approximation to allow for generalization in
large or continuous state spaces -- is becoming increasingly relevant in
practice, because it avoids costly and time-consuming online data collection
and is well suited to safety-critical domains. Existing sample complexity
guarantees for offline value function approximation methods typically require
both (1) distributional assumptions (i.e., good coverage) and (2)
representational assumptions (i.e., ability to represent some or all $Q$-value
functions) stronger than what is required for supervised learning. However, the
necessity of these conditions and the fundamental limits of offline RL are not
well understood in spite of decades of research. This led Chen and Jiang (2019)
to conjecture that concentrability (the most standard notion of coverage) and
realizability (the weakest representation condition) alone are not sufficient
for sample-efficient offline RL. We resolve this conjecture in the positive by
proving that in general, even if both concentrability and realizability are
satisfied, any algorithm requires sample complexity polynomial in the size of
the state space to learn a non-trivial policy.
  Our results show that sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning
requires either restrictive coverage conditions or representation conditions
that go beyond supervised learning, and highlight a phenomenon called
over-coverage which serves as a fundamental barrier for offline value function
approximation methods. A consequence of our results for reinforcement learning
with linear function approximation is that the separation between online and
offline RL can be arbitrarily large, even in constant dimension.

function is used to find the monopole pairing mode and the dynamic variation of
the pairing gap associated with this mode. The spectroscopic factor for the

estimated. It is found that the pairing correlations give rise to the same
coherent contribution to the semiclassical spectroscopic factor as to the

distribution of the neutron levels near the Fermi energy. A numerical
evaluation of the reduced spectroscopic factor for the excitation of monopole
pairing vibrations in two-neutron transfer reaction in superfluid nuclei shows
that it does not exceed several percent of the spectroscopic factor for the

trees. By varying the evaporation rate from liquid-vapor interface in the
nanopore, effects on naturally-created pressure difference and liquid flow

work required to erase information using thermal reservoirs. Recently this
bound was improved to include corrections for finite-sized thermal reservoirs.
In conventional information-erasure schemes, conservation of energy plays a key
role with the cost of erasure. However, it has been shown that erasure can be
achieved through the manipulation of spin angular momentum rather than energy,
using a reservoir composed of energy-degenerate spin particles under the
constraint of the conservation of spin angular momentum, in the limit of an
infinite number of particles. In this case the erasure cost is in terms of
dissipation of spin angular momentum. Here we analyze the erasure of memory
using a finite-sized spin reservoir. We compute the erasure cost to compare it
with its infinite counterpart and determine what size of finite reservoir gives
similar erasure cost statistics using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the
measure of difference. Our findings show that erasure with finite-sized
reservoirs results in the erasure of less information compared to the infinite
reservoir counterpart when compared on this basis. In addition we discuss the
cost of resetting the state of the ancillary spin particles used in the erasure
process, and we investigate the degradation in erasure performance when a
finite reservoir is repeatedly reused to erase a sequence of memories.

performing adversarial domain adaptation from the sample-rich source party to

interpretability is critical. However, existing adversarial domain adaptation

improve interpretability, we exploit domain expertise to split the feature
space into multiple groups that each holds relevant features, and we learn a
semantically meaningful high-order feature from each feature group. In
addition, we apply a feature extractor (along with a domain discriminator) for
each feature group to enable a fine-grained domain adaptation. We design a
secure protocol that enables performing the PrADA in a secure and efficient

novel dynamic model has been formulated to avoid the need for tuning the model
constant. Three data-driven approaches were introduced for the determination of
the fractional-order to have a model which is totally free of any tuning

$\textit{a posteriori}$ tests. In the former test, using a high-fidelity and
well-resolved dataset from direct numerical simulations (DNS), we computed the

relies on the fact that DL model can be decomposed to classifiers and feature

be used to train classifiers on multiple tasks. Furthermore, recent studies
proposed multiple algorithms that can fine-tune teacher models' feature
extractors to train student models more efficiently. We note that regardless of
the fine-tuning of feature extractors, the classifiers of student models are
trained with final outputs of feature extractors (i.e., the outputs of
penultimate layers). However, a recent study suggested that feature maps in
ResNets across layers could be functionally equivalent, raising the possibility
that feature maps inside the feature extractors can also be used to train
student models' classifiers. Inspired by this study, we tested if feature maps
in the hidden layers of the teacher models can be used to improve the student
models' accuracy (i.e., TL's efficiency). Specifically, we developed 'adaptive
transfer learning (ATL)', which can choose an optimal set of feature maps for
TL, and tested it in the few-shot learning setting. Our empirical evaluations
suggest that ATL can help DL models learn more efficiently, especially when

Recently, a series of QML computational models inspired by the noise-tolerant

the limit where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, the qRNN recovers the dynamics of
the classical version. Beyond this limit, we observe that the quantum dynamics
of the qRNN provide it quantum computational features that can aid it in

show that the qRNN is indeed capable of replicating the learning of several
cognitive tasks such as multitasking, decision making, and long-term memory by
taking advantage of several key features of this platform such as interatomic

sequence labeling. Dialogue sequence labeling is a supervised learning task
that estimates labels for each utterance in the target dialogue document, and
is useful for many applications such as dialogue act estimation. Accurate
labeling is often realized by a hierarchically-structured large model
consisting of utterance-level and dialogue-level networks that capture the
contexts within an utterance and between utterances, respectively. However, due
to its large model size, such a model cannot be deployed on
resource-constrained devices. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on
knowledge distillation which trains a small model by distilling the knowledge
of a large and high performance teacher model. Our key idea is to distill the
knowledge while keeping the complex contexts captured by the teacher model. To
this end, the proposed method, hierarchical knowledge distillation, trains the
small model by distilling not only the probability distribution of the label
classification, but also the knowledge of utterance-level and dialogue-level
contexts trained in the teacher model by training the model to mimic the
teacher model's output in each level. Experiments on dialogue act estimation
and call scene segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

without losing label information. Especially when extending SSL to
semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), many strong augmentation methodologies
related to image geometry and interpolation-regularization are hard to utilize
since they possibly hurt the location information of the bounding box in the

data augmentation method, Mix/UnMix (MUM), which unmixes feature tiles for the
mixed image tiles for the SSOD framework. Our proposed method makes mixed input
image tiles and reconstructs them in the feature space. Thus, MUM can enjoy the
interpolation-regularization effect from non-interpolated pseudo-labels and
successfully generate a meaningful weak-strong pair. Furthermore, MUM can be
easily equipped on top of various SSOD methods. Extensive experiments on
MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the superiority of MUM by
consistently improving the mAP performance over the baseline in all the tested

the potential is constructed from the triple scalar product summed over all

compare the relative effect of 2-body and $d$-body forces by adding the

synchronization to a final configuration consisting of equally spaced particles

assessment is almost absent in the literature. This research is dedicated to
developing an analytical framework to characterise and quantify the
effectiveness of micro-segmentation on enhancing networks security. We rely on
a twofold graph-feature based framework of the network connectivity and attack
graphs to evaluate the network exposure and robustness, respectively. While the
former assesses the network assets connectedness, reachability and centrality,
the latter depicts the ability of the network to resist goal-oriented

deployment of micro-segmentation reveals exposure reduction and robustness
improvement in the range of 60% - 90%.

$(R,\circledast)$ is a commutative monoid, we want a new function $(\circledast
s)_\pi$ that sends each $d\in D$ to the ""sum"" of all $s(e)$ for which
$\pi(e)=d$. The operation lives alongside querying -- or more generally data
migration -- in typical database usage: one wants to know how much Canadians
spent on cell phones in 2021, for example, and such requests typically require
both aggregation and querying. But whereas querying has an elegant
category-theoretic treatment in terms of parametric right adjoints between
copresheaf categories, a categorical formulation of aggregation -- especially
one that lives alongside that for querying -- appears to be completely absent
from the literature.
  In this paper we show how both querying and aggregation fit into the
""polynomial ecosystem"". Starting with the category $\mathbf{Poly}$ of
polynomial functors in one variable, we review the relatively recent results of
Ahman-Uustalu and Garner, which showed that the framed bicategory
$\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$ of comonads in $\mathbf{Poly}$ is precisely the
right setting for data migration: its objects are categories and its
bicomodules are parametric right adjoints between their copresheaf categories.
We then develop a great deal of theory, compressed for space reasons, including
local monoidal closed structures, a coclosure to bicomodule composition, and an
understanding of adjoints in $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$. Doing so allows us
to derive interesting mathematical results, e.g.\ that the ordinary operation
of transposing a span can be decomposed into the composite of two more
primitive operations, and then finally to explain how aggregation arises,
alongside querying, in $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$.

examples. Many defense mechanisms have been proposed in the literature,
however, the existing defenses assume a passive attacker who knows little about
the defense system and does not change the attack strategy according to the
defense. Recent works have shown that a strong adaptive attack, where an
attacker is assumed to have full knowledge about the defense system, can easily
bypass the existing defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial
example defense system called Medical Aegis. To the best of our knowledge,
Medical Aegis is the first defense in the literature that successfully
addresses the strong adaptive adversarial example attacks to medical images.
Medical Aegis boasts two-tier protectors: The first tier of Cushion weakens the
adversarial manipulation capability of an attack by removing its high-frequency
components, yet posing a minimal effect on classification performance of the
original image; the second tier of Shield learns a set of per-class DNN models
to predict the logits of the protected model. Deviation from the Shield's
prediction indicates adversarial examples. Shield is inspired by the
observations in our stress tests that there exist robust trails in the shallow
layers of a DNN model, which the adaptive attacks can hardly destruct.
Experimental results show that the proposed defense accurately detects adaptive
attacks, with negligible overhead for model inference.

fail for oblong pens because a single fixed camera does not cover the entire
floor at adequate resolution. We address this problem by using multiple
cameras, placed such that the visual fields of adjacent cameras overlap, and
together they span the entire floor. Avoiding breaks in tracking requires
inter-camera handover when a pig crosses from one camera's view into that of an
adjacent camera. We identify the adjacent camera and the shared pig location on
the floor at the handover time using inter-view homography. Our experiments
involve two grow-finish pens, housing 16-17 pigs each, and three RGB cameras.
Our algorithm first detects pigs using a deep learning-based object detection
model (YOLO) and creates their local tracking IDs using a multi-object tracking
algorithm (DeepSORT). We then use inter-camera shared locations to match
multiple views and generate a global ID for each pig that holds throughout
tracking. To evaluate our approach, we provide five two-minutes long video
sequences with fully annotated global identities. We track pigs in a single
camera view with a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and Precision of 65.0% and

Archimedean lattices in two dimensions, and the simple cubic (SC),
body-centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices in three
dimensions, is investigated. In two dimensions, correlations between
coordination number $z$ and site thresholds $p_c$ for Archimedean lattices up
to 10th nearest neighbors (NN) are seen by plotting $z$ versus $1/p_{c}$ and
$z$ versus $-1/\ln(1-p_c)$, using the data of d'Iribarne et al. [J. Phys. A
32:2611, 1999] and others. The results show that all the plots overlap on a
line with a slope consistent with the theoretically predicted asymptotic value
of $zp_{c} \sim 4 \eta_c = 4.51235$, where $\eta_c$ is the continuum threshold
for disks. In three dimensions, precise site and bond thresholds for BCC and
FCC lattices with 2nd and 3rd NN, and bond thresholds for the SC lattice with
up to the 13th NN, are obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations, using an efficient
single-cluster growth method. For site percolation, the values of thresholds
for different types of lattices with compact neighborhoods also collapse
together, and linear fitting is consistent with the predicted value of $zp_{c}
\sim 8 \eta_c = 2.7351$, where $\eta_c$ is the continuum threshold for spheres.
For bond percolation, Bethe-lattice behavior $p_c = 1/(z-1)$ is expected to
hold for large $z$, and the finite-$z$ correction is confirmed to satisfy
$zp_{c} - 1 \sim a_{1}z^{-x}$, with $x=2/3$ for three dimensions as predicted
by Frei and Perkins [Electron. J. Probab. 21:56, 2016] and by Xu et al. [Phys.

neighborhoods, the asymptotic behavior of $zp_{c}$ is universal, depending only
upon the dimension of the system and whether site or bond percolation, but not
upon the type of lattice.

General theory and practical implementation of G-CNNs have been studied for
planar images under either rotation or scaling transformation, but only
individually. We present, in this paper, a roto-scale-translation equivariant
CNN (RST-CNN), that is guaranteed to achieve equivariance jointly over these

transformations in reality are rarely perfect and typically subject to input
deformation, we provide a stability analysis of the equivariance of
representation to input distortion, which motivates the truncated expansion of
the convolutional filters under (pre-fixed) low-frequency spatial modes. The
resulting model provably achieves deformation-robust RST equivariance, i.e.,
the RST symmetry is still ""approximately"" preserved when the transformation is
""contaminated"" by a nuisance data deformation, a property that is especially
important for out-of-distribution generalization. Numerical experiments on

established. To apply the novel renormalization of crossing probabilities that
the authors propose can be studied in other models of interest that are not
self-dual, we collect results to formulate vertical and horizontal strip, and
renormalization, inequalities for the dilute Potts model, whose measure is
obtained from the high temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure
supported over the hexagonal lattice in the presence of two external fields.
The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is
another model that enjoys the RSW box crossing property in the Continuous
Critical phase, which is one of the four possible behaviors that the model is
shown to enjoy. Through a combination of the Spatial Markov Property (SMP) and
Comparison between Boundary Conditions (CBC) of the high-temperature spin
measure, four phases of the dilute Potts model can be analyzed, exhibiting a
class of boundary conditions upon which the probability of obtaining a
horizontal crossing is significantly dependent. The exponential factor that is
inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the
high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the
number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in
exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in
Nienhuis' 1991 paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model.

Existing 3D attackers generally perform point-wise perturbation over point
clouds, resulting in deformed structures or outliers, which is easily
perceivable by humans. Moreover, their adversarial examples are generated under
the white-box setting, which frequently suffers from low success rates when
transferred to attack remote black-box models. In this paper, we study 3D point

Imperceptible Transfer Attack (ITA): 1) Imperceptibility: we constrain the
perturbation direction of each point along its normal vector of the
neighborhood surface, leading to generated examples with similar geometric
properties and thus enhancing the imperceptibility. 2) Transferability: we
develop an adversarial transformation model to generate the most harmful
distortions and enforce the adversarial examples to resist it, improving their
transferability to unknown black-box models. Further, we propose to train more
robust black-box 3D models to defend against such ITA attacks by learning more
discriminative point cloud representations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that our ITA attack is more imperceptible and transferable than

triggers of existing attacks are directly injected in the pixel space, which
tend to be detectable by existing defenses and visually identifiable at both

FTROJAN through trojaning the frequency domain. The key intuition is that
triggering perturbations in the frequency domain correspond to small pixel-wise
perturbations dispersed across the entire image, breaking the underlying
assumptions of existing defenses and making the poisoning images visually
indistinguishable from clean ones. We evaluate FTROJAN in several datasets and
tasks showing that it achieves a high attack success rate without significantly
degrading the prediction accuracy on benign inputs. Moreover, the poisoning
images are nearly invisible and retain high perceptual quality. We also
evaluate FTROJAN against state-of-the-art defenses as well as several adaptive

FTROJAN can robustly elude or significantly degenerate the performance of these

SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The
aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of
the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and
probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to
several synthetic and real-world data sets and demonstrate substantial
improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely
noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential
equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as
has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra
dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected
from 1900-1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as
standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be

stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms used for policy evaluation in
reinforcement learning. Here, we consider Gradient TD algorithms with an
additional heavy ball momentum term and provide choice of step size and
momentum parameter that ensures almost sure convergence of these algorithms
asymptotically. In doing so, we decompose the heavy ball Gradient TD iterates
into three separate iterates with different step sizes. We first analyze these
iterates under one-timescale SA setting using results from current literature.
However, the one-timescale case is restrictive and a more general analysis can
be provided by looking at a three-timescale decomposition of the iterates. In
the process, we provide the first conditions for stability and convergence of
general three-timescale SA. We then prove that the heavy ball Gradient TD
algorithm is convergent using our three-timescale SA analysis. Finally, we
evaluate these algorithms on standard RL problems and report improvement in
performance over the vanilla algorithms.

text recognition, largely because it naturally integrates recognition clues
from both visual and semantic domains. However, recent studies show that the
two kinds of clues are not always well registered and therefore, feature and
character might be misaligned in the difficult text (e.g., with rare shapes).
As a result, constraints such as character position are introduced to alleviate
this problem. Despite certain success, a content-free positional embedding
hardly associates stably with meaningful local image regions. In this paper, we
propose a novel module called Multi-Domain Character Distance Perception
(MDCDP) to establish a visual and semantic related positional encoding. MDCDP
uses positional embedding to query both visual and semantic features following
the attention mechanism. The two kinds of constrained features are then fused
to produce a reinforced feature, generating a content-aware embedding that well
perceives spacing variations and semantic affinities among characters, i.e.,
multi-domain character distance. We develop a novel network named CDistNet that
stacks multiple MDCDPs to guide a gradually precise distance modeling. Thus,
the feature-character alignment is well built even various recognition
difficulties presented. We create two series of augmented datasets with
increasing recognition difficulties and apply CDistNet to both them and six
public benchmarks. The experiments demonstrate that CDistNet outperforms recent
popular methods by large margins in challenging recognition scenarios. It also
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks. In addition, the

pricing. In this paper, we consider an expected value of a function of a
stochastic variable and a real-valued parameter, and how to calculate
derivatives of the expectation with respect to the parameter. This problem is
related to calculating sensitivities of financial derivatives, and so of
industrial importance. Based on QMCI and the general-order central difference
formula for numerical differentiation, we propose two quantum methods for this

naive iteration method, simply calculates the formula by iterative computations
and additions of the terms in it, and then estimates its expected value by QAE.
The second one, which we name the sum-in-QAE method, performs the summation of
the terms at the same time as the sum over the possible values of the
stochastic variable in a single QAE. We see that, depending on the smoothness
of the function and the number of qubits available, either of two methods is
better than the other. In particular, when the function is nonsmooth or we want
to save the qubit number, the sum-in-QAE method can be advantageous.

plurisubharmonic current $T$ of bidegree $(p,p)$ on a complex manifold $X$ of
dimension $k,$ and let $V\subset X$ be a K\""ahler submanifold of dimension $l$
and $B$ a relatively compact piecewise $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth open subset of
$V.$ We define the notion of the $j$-th Lelong number of $T$ along $B$ for
every $j$ with $\max(0,l-p)\leq j\leq \min(l,k-p)$ and prove their existence as
well as their basic properties.
  Our method relies on some Lelong-Jensen formulas for the normal bundle to $V$
in $X,$ which are of independent interest.
  The second part of our article is devoted to geometric characterizations of
the generalized Lelong numbers. As a consequence of this study, we show that
the top degree Lelong number of $T$ along $B$ is totally intrinsic. This is a
generalization of the fundamental result of Siu (for positive closed currents)
and of Alessandrini--Bassanelli (for positive plurisubharmonic currents) on the
independence of Lelong numbers at a single point on the choice of coordinates.

modeling, the coupling between the fluid and structure variables is mediated
using a regularized version of Dirac delta function. In the IB literature, the

a broader concept than kernel generation, and there are well-established
numerical optimization techniques to solve this problem. For example, we show

to maximize the positive sample score $s_p$ and minimize the negative sample

individually, which is flexible in weighting and sampling on instance-level but
ignores the inherent ranking property. By qualitatively minimizing the relative
score $s_n - s_p$, the pairwise approaches capture the ranking of samples
naturally but suffer from training efficiency. Additionally, both approaches
are hard to explicitly provide a personalized decision boundary to determine if
users are interested in items unseen. To address those issues, we innovatively
introduce an auxiliary score $b_u$ for each user to represent the User Interest
Boundary(UIB) and individually penalize samples that cross the boundary with
pairwise paradigms, i.e., the positive samples whose score is lower than $b_u$
and the negative samples whose score is higher than $b_u$. In this way, our
approach successfully achieves a hybrid loss of the pointwise and the pairwise

provide a personalized decision boundary and significantly improve the training
efficiency without any special sampling strategy. Extensive results show that
our approach achieves significant improvements on not only the classical
pointwise or pairwise models but also state-of-the-art models with complex loss

for considerable $h^{}_d$ with negligible $\Delta$ and $A_r=1.0$. The dipolar
interaction of enough strength promotes antiferromagnetic coupling in square
ensembles of MNPs. There is a prolonged magnetization decay for large $\Delta$
because of enhancement in ferromagnetic coupling. Notably, magnetization
relaxes slowly for $\alpha<\alpha^\star$ even with moderate $h^{}_d$ and a
significant $A^{}_r$. Interestingly, the slowing down of the magnetic
relaxation shifts to a lower $\alpha^{\star}$ with $h^{}_d=1.0$. The
magnetization ceases to relax for $\alpha\leq60^\circ$ and $h^{}_d\leq0.6$ due
to large shape anisotropy with $A^{}_r=400.0$. Remarkably, a majority of the
magnetic moment reverses its direction by $180^\circ$ for $\alpha>60^\circ$ and
large $h^{}_d$, resulting in the negative magnetization. The effective N\'eel
relaxation time $\tau^{}_N$ also depends strongly on these parameters.
$\tau^{}_N$ depends weakly on $\alpha$ and $\Delta$ for $h^{}_d\leq0.2$,
irrespective of $A^{}_r$. On the other hand, $\tau^{}_N$ decreases with
$\alpha$ for significant $h^{}_d$ provided $\alpha$ is greater than $45^\circ$

even with moderate $h^{}_d$. While for $\alpha>30^\circ$, $\tau^{}_N$ decreases
with $\alpha$. These observations are useful in novel materials, spintronics

of single proteins often present large hysteresis, with unfolding forces that
are higher than refolding ones. Therefore, the high energy of the transition
state (TS) in these molecules precludes kinetic rates measurements in
equilibrium hopping experiments. In irreversible pulling experiments,
force-dependent kinetic rates measurements show a systematic discrepancy
between the sum of the folding and unfolding TS distances derived by the
kinetic Bell-Evans model and the full molecular extension predicted by elastic
models. Here, we show that this discrepancy originates from the force-induced
movement of TS. Specifically, we investigate the highly kinetically stable
protein barnase, using pulling experiments and the Bell-Evans model to
characterize the position of its kinetic barrier. Experimental results show
that while the TS stays at a roughly constant distance relative to the native

conversion of the protein extension into amino acid units shows that the TS
position follows the Leffler-Hammond postulate: the higher the force, the lower

segment-frame attention module to capture relations between the low-level
frames and high-level segments. By regularizing the predictions of frames and
their corresponding segments via a consistency loss, the network can generate
semantic-consistent segments and then rectify the misclassified predictions
caused by ambiguous low-level frames. We validate SAHC on two public surgical
video datasets, i.e., the M2CAI16 challenge dataset and the Cholec80 dataset.

(PAD) methods is critical to ensure the security of Face Recognition Systems
(FRSs). However, in a real scenario, Presentation Attacks (PAs) are various and
it is hard to predict the Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) species that
will be used by the attacker. Existing PAD methods are highly dependent on the
limited training set and cannot generalize well to unknown PAI species. Unlike
this specific PAD task, other face related tasks trained by huge amount of real
faces (e.g. face recognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted
into different application scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to trade
position of PAD and face related work in a face system and apply the free
acquired prior knowledge from face related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to
improve the generalization ability in detecting PAs. The proposed method, first
introduces task specific features from other face related task, then, we design
a Cross-Modal Adapter using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to re-map such
features to adapt to PAD task. Finally, face PAD is achieved by using the
hierarchical features from a CNN-based PA detector and the re-mapped features.
The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant
improvements in the complicated and hybrid datasets, when compared with the

superconductivity caused by magnetic attractive interactions is
presented.(1)The magnetic attractive interaction leads to
superconductivity.This interactions happen only when the electron velocity
reaches up to 106 m/s and the distance between two electrons is about 0.0529
nm. The number of superconducting electrons is about 10-5 of the number of free

why superconductors show Meissner effect.(3)Tc is determined by the magnetic

to focus on trivial postural coordinates and be hesitant in motion learning. To
enhance the learning of motions, the Contrastive Motion Learner performs
contrastive learning between the representations learned from coordinate

mainly come from the lack of discriminative object features due to severe scale
variations, low contrasts, and clustered distributions. In order to address
these problems, a novel context aggregation network (CATNet) is proposed to
improve the feature extraction process. The proposed model exploits three
lightweight plug-and-play modules, namely dense feature pyramid network
(DenseFPN), spatial context pyramid (SCP), and hierarchical region of interest

module that establishes more flexible information flows by adopting inter-level
residual connections, cross-level dense connections, and feature re-weighting
strategy. Leveraging the attention mechanism, SCP further augments the features
by aggregating global spatial context into local regions. For each instance,
HRoIE adaptively generates RoI features for different downstream tasks. We
carry out extensive evaluations of the proposed scheme on the challenging

Hartree-Fock to contrast ATMG with $n=3,4,5,\ldots$ layers and TBG.
$\textbf{I}$: We show how external fields enter in the decomposition of ATMG

magic angle TBG subsystem with a screened interaction. $\textbf{IV}$: We
perform an analytic strong coupling analysis of the external fields and
corroborate it with Hartree-Fock. An in-plane magnetic field in TBG drives a
transition to a valley Hall state or a gapless ""magnetic semimetal."" A
displacement field $V$ has little effect on TBG, but induces a gapped phase in
ATMG for small $V$ for $n = 4$ and above a critical $V$ for $n = 3$. For $n\geq

superconductivity in the skyrmion mechanism - increases with $V$ at angles near
and below the magic angle. $\textbf{V}$: We complement our strong coupling
approach with a weak coupling theory of ATMG pair-breaking. While for $n=2$

focused on Gaussian signaling, independent and identically distributed (IID)

various transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and massive
user access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO)
system with more practical constraints, i.e., non-Gaussian signaling, non-IID
channel, and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring
new challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate
capacity analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve the
capacity optimal performance with practical complexity.
  To address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the
GMU-MIMO capacity and design a capacity optimal transceiver, which jointly
considers encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is
developed to make a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation
complexity. Specifically, the capacity region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO is
characterized by using the celebrated mutual information and minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) lemma and the MMSE optimality of orthogonal
approximate message passing (OAMP)/vector AMP (VAMP). Furthermore, a

However, in the computer vision domain, model performance in FL is far behind

bridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for computer vision tasks,
in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking

detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking datasets, models, and various

challenges that deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks may not
be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset actually downgrades the model
accuracy to some degree in different tasks; improving the system efficiency of
federated training is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the
per-client memory cost. We believe that such a library and benchmark, along

of the condensate, can in turn affect the condensate dynamics, resulting in
highly nonlinear equations of motion. We find that the dipole and breathing
oscillations of the condensate along the direction of gauge field are coupled
by this field. For a quasi-onedimensional condensate, this coupling makes the
collective motion quasiperiodic. While for a quasitwo-dimensional condensate,
the gauge field can also induce a Hall effect, manifested as an additional
coupling between dipole and breathing oscillations in perpendicular direction.
When the densitydependent gauge field is strong, the interplay between these
oscillations can cause the collective dynamics of the condensate to become

with nested-meshes, we evaluate the eccentricity reached by a low-mass,
luminous planet embedded in an inviscid disc with constant thermal diffusivity
and subjected to thermal forces. We find that a cell size of at most one tenth
of the size of the region heated by the planet is required to get converged
results. When the planet's luminosity is supercritical, we find that it reaches
an eccentricity of order $10^{-2}$--$10^{-1}$, which increases with the
luminosity and broadly scales with the disc's aspect ratio. Restricting our
study to the case of pebble accretion, we incorporate to our model the
dependence of the accretion rate of pebbles on the eccentricity. There is
therefore a feedback between eccentricity, which determines the accretion rate
and hence the planet's luminosity, and the luminosity, which yields the
eccentricity attained through thermal forces. We solve for the steady state
eccentricity and study how this quantity depends on the disc's turbulence
strength parameter $\alpha_z$, on the dimensionless stopping time of the
pebbles $\tau_s$, on the inward mass flux of pebbles and on the headwind (the
difference between the gas velocity and the Keplerian velocity). We find that
in general low-mass planets (up to a few Earth masses) reach eccentricities
comparable to the disc's aspect ratio, or a sizeable fraction of the latter.
Eccentric, low-mass protoplanets should therefore be the norm rather than the
exception, even if they orbit far from other planets or from large scale
disturbances in the disc.

low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a
sufficiently large product set. Since its discovery in a work of Dvir,
Kopparty, Saraf and Sudan [SIAM J. Comput., 2013], the lemma has found numerous
applications in both math and computer science; in particular, in the
definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin
[J. ACM, 2014].
  In this work, we show how to algorithmize the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel
lemma for arbitrary product sets over any field. In other words, we give an
efficient algorithm for unique decoding of multivariate multiplicity codes from
half their minimum distance on arbitrary product sets over all fields.
Previously, such an algorithm was known either when the underlying product set
had a nice algebraic structure: for instance, was a subfield (by Kopparty [ToC,
2015]) or when the underlying field had large (or zero) characteristic, the
multiplicity parameter was sufficiently large and the multiplicity code had
distance bounded away from $1$ (Bhandari, Harsha, Kumar and Sudan [STOC 2021]).
In particular, even unique decoding of bivariate multiplicity codes with
multiplicity two from half their minimum distance was not known over arbitrary
product sets over any field.
  Our algorithm builds upon a result of Kim and Kopparty [ToC, 2017] who gave
an algorithmic version of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (without multiplicities) or
equivalently, an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of Reed-Muller codes
over arbitrary product sets. We introduce a refined notion of distance based on
the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma and design a unique decoding algorithm
for this distance measure. On the way, we give an alternate analysis of
Forney's classical generalized minimum distance decoder that might be of

increasingly complex structure, we study the properties of the dynamics of the

complexity of dynamical behaviors emerging from even simple simplicial
complexes. We place ourselves in the case where the vector of internal
frequencies of the edge oscillators lies in the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian,

discovered come to be, we need to study systems at different evolutionary
stages, with different central stars but also in different environments. The
most challenging environment for planet formation may be the harsh UV radiation
field of nearby massive stars which quickly erodes disks by external
photo-evaporation. We have observed the AT Pyx system, located in the head of a
cometary globule in the Gum Nebula, to search for signs of ongoing planet
formation. We used the extreme adaptive optics imager VLT/SPHERE to observe AT
Pyx in polarized light as well as total intensity in the J, H and K-band.
Additionally we employed VLT/NACO to observe the system in the L-band. We
resolve the disk around AT Pyx in scattered light across multiple wavelengths.
We find an extended (>126 au) disk, with an intermediate inclination between 35
deg and 42 deg. The disk shows complex sub-structure and we identify 2 and
possibly 3 spiral-like features. Depending on the precise geometry of the disk
(which we can not unambiguously infer from our data) the disk may be eccentric
with an eccentricity of ~0.16 or partially self-shadowed. The spiral features
and possible eccentricity are both consistent with signatures of an embedded
gas giant planet equal in mass to Jupiter. Our own observations can rule out
brown dwarf companions embedded in the resolved disk, but are not sensitive
enough to detect gas giants. AT Pyx is the first disk in a cometray globule in
the Gum Nebula which is spatially resolved. By comparison with disks in the
Orion Nebula Cluster we note that the extension of the disk may be exceptional
for this environment if the external UV radiation field is comparable to other
cometary globules in the region. The signposts of ongoing planet formation are
intriguing and need to be followed up with higher sensitivity.

over time, and magnetized stellar winds are thought to be predominantly
responsible for this significant angular momentum loss. Previous studies have
demonstrated that the wind torque can be predicted via formulations dependent
on stellar properties, such as magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar
radius and mass, wind mass-loss rate, and stellar rotation rate. Although these
stars are observed to experience surface differential rotation, torque
formulations so far have assumed solid-body rotation. Surface differential
rotation is expected to affect the rotation of the wind and thus the angular
momentum loss. To investigate how differential rotation affects the torque, we
use the PLUTO code to perform 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric
simulations of stellar winds, using a colatitude-dependent surface differential
rotation profile that is solar-like (i.e., rotation is slower at the poles than
the equator). We demonstrate that the torque is determined by the average
rotation rate in the wind, so that the net torque is less than that predicted
by assuming solid-body rotation at the equatorial rate. The magnitude of the
effect is essentially proportional to the magnitude of the surface differential
rotation, for example, resulting in a torque for the Sun that is $\sim 20 \%$
smaller than predicted by the solid-body assumption. We derive and fit a
semi-analytic formulation that predicts the torque as a function of the
equatorial spin rate, magnitude of differential rotation, and wind
magnetization (depending on the dipolar magnetic field strength and mass-loss
rate, combined).

new deep neural network for 3D sensing from monocular image sequences based on
planar parallax, which takes full advantage of the commonly seen road plane
geometry in driving scenes. RPANet takes a pair of images aligned by the
homography of the road plane as input and outputs a $\gamma$ map for 3D
reconstruction. Beyond estimating the depth or height, the $\gamma$ map has a
potential to construct a two-dimensional transformation between two consecutive
frames while can be easily derived to depth or height. By warping the
consecutive frames using the road plane as a reference, the 3D structure can be
estimated from the planar parallax and the residual image displacements.
Furthermore, to make the network better perceive the displacements caused by
planar parallax, we introduce a novel cross-attention module. We sample data
from the Waymo Open Dataset and construct data related to planar parallax.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the sampled dataset to demonstrate
the 3D reconstruction accuracy of our approach in challenging scenarios.

compartment sizes (restricted diffusion) and membrane permeability (water
exchange). However, restricted diffusion and exchange have opposite effects on
the diffusion-weighted signal, which can confound parameter estimates. In this
work, we present a signal representation that captures the effects of both
restricted diffusion and exchange up to second order in b-value and is
compatible with gradient waveforms of arbitrary shape. The representation
features mappings from a gradient waveform to two scalars that separately
control the sensitivity to restriction and exchange. We demonstrate that these
scalars span a two-dimensional space that can be used to choose waveforms that
selectively probe restricted diffusion or exchange, in order to eliminate the
correlation between the two phenomena. We found that waveforms with specific
but unconventional shapes provide an advantage over conventional pulsed and
oscillating gradient acquisitions. We also show that parametrisation of
waveforms into a two-dimensional space can be used to understand protocols from
other approaches that probe restricted diffusion and exchange. For example, we
find that the variation of mixing time in filter-exchange imaging corresponds
to variation of our exchange-weighting scalar at a fixed value of the
restriction-weighting scalar. Numerical evaluation of the proposed signal
representation using Monte Carlo simulations on a synthetic substrate showed
that the theory is applicable to sizes in the range 2 - 7 micrometres and
barrier-limited exchange in the range 0 - 20 s$^{-1}$. The presented theory
constitutes a simple and intuitive description of how restricted diffusion and
exchange influence the signal as well as how to design a protocol to separate
the two effects.

the plasma beta regime is large or of order 1 or smaller. Here, we show
explicitly that the two sets of turbulence transport models admit a
conservation representation that resembles the well-known WKB transport

definitions of the ""pressure"" associated with the turbulent fluctuations. This
includes introducing a distinct turbulent pressure tensor for 3D incompressible

  - Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving Workshop (NeurIPS 2021 ML4AD)",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework for learning
decision-making from offline data and therefore constitutes a promising
approach for real-world applications as automated driving. Self-driving
vehicles (SDV) learn a policy, which potentially even outperforms the behavior
in the sub-optimal data set. Especially in safety-critical applications as
automated driving, explainability and transferability are key to success. This
motivates the use of model-based offline RL approaches, which leverage
planning. However, current state-of-the-art methods often neglect the influence
of aleatoric uncertainty arising from the stochastic behavior of multi-agent
systems. This work proposes a novel approach for Uncertainty-aware Model-Based
Offline REinforcement Learning Leveraging plAnning (UMBRELLA), which solves the
prediction, planning, and control problem of the SDV jointly in an
interpretable learning-based fashion. A trained action-conditioned stochastic
dynamics model captures distinctively different future evolutions of the
traffic scene. The analysis provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness
of our approach in challenging automated driving simulations and based on a
real-world public dataset.

if $G$ is a finite group of exponent $n$ then the exponent of the Schur
multiplier of $G$ can be bounded by a function $f(n)$ depending only on $n$.
Moravec does not give a value for $f(n)$, but actually his proof shows that we
can take $f(n)=ne$ where $e$ is the order of $b^{-n}a^{-n}(ab)^{n}$ in the
Schur multiplier of $R(2,n)$. (Here$R(2,n)$ is the largest finite two generator
group of exponent $n$, and we take $a,b$ to be the generators of $R(2,n)$.) It
is an easy hand calculation to show that $e=n$ for $n=2,3$, and it is a
straightforward computation with the $p$-quotient algorithm to show that $e=n$
for $n=4,5,7$. The groups $R(2,8)$ and $R(2,9)$ are way out of range of the
$p$-quotient algorithm, even with a modern supercomputer. But we are able
toshow that $e\geq n$ for $n=8,9$. Moravec's proof also shows that if $G$ is a
finite group of exponent $n$ with nilpotency class $c$, then the exponent of
the Schur multiplier of $G$ is bounded by $ne$ where $e$ is the order of
$b^{-n}a^{-n}(ab)^{n}$ in the Schur multiplier of the class $c$ quotient
$R(2,n;c)$ of $R(2,n)$. If $q$ is a prime power we let $e_{q,c}$ be the order
of $b^{-q}a^{-q}(ab)^{q}$ in the Schur multiplier of $R(2,q;c)$. We are able to
show that $e_{p^{k},p^{2}-p-1}$ divides $p$ for all prime powers $p^{k}$. If
$k>2$ then $e_{2^{k},c}$ equals 2 for $c<4$, equals 4 for $4\leq c\leq11$, and
equals $8$ for $c=12$. If $k>1$ then $e_{3^{k},c}$ equals 1 for $c<3$, equals 3
for $3\leq c<12$, and equals 9 for $c=12$.
  We also investigate the order of $[b,a]$ in a Schur cover for $R(2,q;c)$.

interaction mechanism with the human. If a robot accepts task instruction in
natural language, first, it has to understand the user's intention by decoding
the instruction. However, while executing the task, the robot may face
unforeseeable circumstances due to the variations in the observed scene and
therefore requires further user intervention. In this article, we present a
system called Talk-to-Resolve (TTR) that enables a robot to initiate a coherent
dialogue exchange with the instructor by observing the scene visually to
resolve the impasse. Through dialogue, it either finds a cue to move forward in
the original plan, an acceptable alternative to the original plan, or
affirmation to abort the task altogether. To realize the possible stalemate, we
utilize the dense captions of the observed scene and the given instruction
jointly to compute the robot's next action. We evaluate our system based on a
data set of initial instruction and situational scene pairs. Our system can
identify the stalemate and resolve them with appropriate dialogue exchange with
82% accuracy. Additionally, a user study reveals that the questions from our

theoretically constructed by indeno-substitution at the peri-positions of DCPP,
and suitably functionalizing with aza-, fluoride and imide-groups to enhance
the electron transport behavior in the materials. To further ensure the
solubility and stability of these organic compounds, we incorporated
triethylsilylethynyl (TES) groups in the designed structures. The factors such
as degree of aromaticity, electronic structure, molecular packing motif,
intermolecular charge coupling, and charge transfer rate are essential in
determining the charge transporting ability. The low-lying LUMO-levels (< -4.0
eV) and high electron affinities (> 3.0 eV) of a few DCPPs ensure efficient
electron injection from the metal electrodes. These molecules are arranged in
bowl-in-bowl columnar packing, which is suitable for facilitating the
intermolecular charge transport in the crystal. As a result, we observed
enhanced hole-transport behavior in DCPP-9 ({\mu}h = 6.296 cm2V-1s-1), electron
transport in DCPP-TES-6 ({\mu}e = 0.142 cm2V-1s-1) and ambipolar nature of
DCPP-12 and DCPP-TES-12. The DCPP-derivatives are also optically active in the
UV-visible region, which is confirmed from the TD-DFT analysis. Inspired from
their non-centrosymmetric molecular geometry and optical activity, we also
investigated their non-linear optical (NLO) responses, which may pave their way

enveloping semipermeable shell - under channel crossflow is studied numerically
using two-dimensional lattice-Boltzmann simulations. The core is initially
loaded with a solute that diffuses passively through the shell towards the
fluid. The cylinder internal structure and the initial condition considered in
this study differ and thus complement the classical studies dealing with
homogeneous uncoated cylinders whose surfaces are sustained at either constant
concentration or constant mass flux. Here, the cylinder acts as a reservoir
endowed with a shell that controls the leakage rate of the encapsulated solute.
The transition from steady to unsteady laminar flow regime, around the
cylinder, alters the released solute spatial distribution and the mass transfer
efficiency, which is characterized by the Sherwood number (the dimensionless
mass transfer coefficient). Moreover, the reservoir involves unsteady and
continuous boundary conditions, which lead to unsteady and nonuniform
distribution of both the concentration and the mass flux at the cylinder
surface. The effect of adding a coating shell is highlighted, for a given ratio
of the cylinder diameter to the channel width, by extracting a correlation from
the computed data set. This new correlation shows explicit dependency of the
Sherwood number upon the shell solute permeability (the shell mass transfer
coefficient).

applications. However, HTC models are challenging to develop because they often
require processing a large volume of documents and labels with hierarchical
taxonomy. Recent HTC models based on deep learning have attempted to
incorporate hierarchy information into a model structure. Consequently, these
models are challenging to implement when the model parameters increase for a
large-scale hierarchy because the model structure depends on the hierarchy
size. To solve this problem, we formulate HTC as a sub-hierarchy sequence
generation to incorporate hierarchy information into a target label sequence
instead of the model structure. Subsequently, we propose the Hierarchy DECoder
(HiDEC), which decodes a text sequence into a sub-hierarchy sequence using
recursive hierarchy decoding, classifying all parents at the same level into
children at once. In addition, HiDEC is trained to use hierarchical path
information from a root to each leaf in a sub-hierarchy composed of the labels
of a target document via an attention mechanism and hierarchy-aware masking.
HiDEC achieved state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer model
parameters than existing models on benchmark datasets, such as RCV1-v2, NYT,

and to determine for which inputs the policies differ in their suggested

Transformers. While Transformers have delivered significant performance
improvements, training such networks is extremely memory intensive owing to
storing all intermediate activations that are needed for gradient computation
during backpropagation, especially for long sequences. To this end, we present
Mesa, a memory-saving training framework for Transformers. Specifically, Mesa
uses exact activations during forward pass while storing a low-precision
version of activations to reduce memory consumption during training. The
low-precision activations are then dequantized during back-propagation to
compute gradients. Besides, to address the heterogeneous activation
distributions in the multi-head self-attention layers, we propose a head-wise
activation quantization strategy, which quantizes activations based on the
statistics of each head to minimize the approximation error. To further boost
training efficiency, we learn quantization parameters by running estimates.
More importantly, by re-investing the saved memory in employing a larger batch
size or scaling up model size, we may further improve the performance under
constrained computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet,
CIFAR-100 and ADE20K demonstrate that Mesa can achieve flexible memory-savings
(up to 50%) during training while achieving comparable or even better
performance. Code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/Mesa.

various AI-based interactive healthcare paradigms. This includes medical
conditions that alter social behavior such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Engagement is a multi-faceted
construct which is composed of behavioral, emotional, and mental components.
Previous research has neglected this multi-faceted nature of engagement and
focused on the detection of engagement level or binary engagement label. In
this paper, a system is presented to distinguish these facets using contextual
and relational features. This can facilitate further fine-grained analysis.
Several machine learning classifiers including traditional and deep learning
models are compared for this task. An F-Score of 0.74 was obtained on a
balanced dataset of 22242 instances with neural network-based classification.
The proposed framework shall serve as a baseline for further research on

complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect sizes.
However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures are stable have
yet to be investigated, because studying the influence of a large number of
small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial polymorphism is
mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity of the systems that
arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a haploid population in a
two-patch environment, while it is known from population genetics that
polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is stable in the symmetric case,
there exists no analytical predictions on how this polymorphism holds when a
polygenic background also contributes to the trait. Here we propose to answer
this question by introducing a new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take
into account the combined contributions of a major-effect locus and of a
quantitative background resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is
encoded according to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of
small variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits are
concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal distribution,
using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a reduction in the complexity
of the system using a separation of time scales approach. We predict an
undocumented phenomenon of loss of polymorphism at the major-effect locus
despite strong selection for local adaptation, because the quantitative
background slowly disrupts the rapidly established polymorphism at the
major-effect locus, which is confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our
study highlights how segregation of a quantitative background can greatly
impact the dynamics of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns.

However, insome experimental preparations,because of unipolar morphology or
other characteristicsof the recorded neurons, the sizes of the spikes recorded
from the soma can be much smaller. The experimental settings and the quality of
the recording can also affect the observed amplitudes of the spikes. Whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings from the somata of projection neurons of the antennal
lobe in Drosophila or mosquitoes can show spikes with amplitudes as small as 2
mV. Moreover, the observed spikes often ride on relatively large
depolarizations, which makes it difficult for the standard thresholding-based
approaches to distinguish them from noise or sharp EPSPs present in the signal.
For spike detection in such neuronal recordings, we propose a clustering-based
algorithm that separates peaks corresponding to action potentials from those
corresponding to noise. Candidate peaks, including many noise peaks, are first
selected according to their sharpness, and then a feature vector is extracted
for each peak. The 3-dimensional feature vector contains the absolute value of
the peak voltage, height of the spike, and the magnitude of the second
derivative minima attained during the spike. In most recordings, this 3D space
reveals two natural clusters, separating the noise peaks from the true action
potentials. Some parameters of the algorithm can be optionally altered by the
user to improve detection, which comes handy in the few recordings where the
default parameters do not work well. In summary, the algorithm facilitates
accurate spike detection to enable the interpretation and analysis of
patch-clamp data from neuronal recordings in invertebrates. The algorithm is
implemented as an freely available open-source tool.

proposed in our previous paper [1] to curved elastic beams. This formulation is
based on equilibrium equations in their integrated form, combined with the
kinematic relations and sectional equations that link the internal forces to
sectional deformation variables. The resulting first-order differential
equations are approximated by the finite difference scheme and the boundary
value problem is converted to an initial value problem using the shooting
method. The paper develops the theoretical framework based on the
Navier-Bernoulli hypothesis, with a possible extension to shear-flexible beams.
Numerical procedures for the evaluation of equivalent nodal forces and of the
element tangent stiffness are presented in detail. Unlike standard finite
element formulations, the present approach can increase accuracy by refining
the integration scheme on the element level while the number of global degrees
of freedom is kept constant. The efficiency and accuracy of the developed
scheme are documented by seven examples that cover circular and parabolic
arches, a spiral-shaped beam, and a spring-like beam with a zig-zag centerline.
The proposed formulation does not exhibit any locking. No excessive stiffness
is observed for coarse computational grids and the distribution of internal
forces is not polluted by any oscillations. It is also shown that a cross
effect in the relations between internal forces and deformation variables
arises, i.e., the bending moment affects axial stretching and the normal force
affects the curvature. This coupling is theoretically explained in the
appendix.

misbehaves upon trigger inputs as the backdoor attacker desires, posing severe
consequences to DL model deployments. State-of-the-art defenses are either
limited to specific backdoor attacks (source-agnostic attacks) or
non-user-friendly in that machine learning (ML) expertise or expensive
computing resources are required. This work observes that all existing backdoor
attacks have an inevitable intrinsic weakness, non-transferability, that is, a
trigger input hijacks a backdoored model but cannot be effective to another
model that has not been implanted with the same backdoor. With this key
observation, we propose non-transferability enabled backdoor detection (NTD) to
identify trigger inputs for a model-under-test (MUT) during
run-time.Specifically, NTD allows a potentially backdoored MUT to predict a
class for an input. In the meantime, NTD leverages a feature extractor (FE) to
extract feature vectors for the input and a group of samples randomly picked
from its predicted class, and then compares similarity between the input and
the samples in the FE's latent space. If the similarity is low, the input is an
adversarial trigger input; otherwise, benign. The FE is a free pre-trained
model privately reserved from open platforms. As the FE and MUT are from
different sources, the attacker is very unlikely to insert the same backdoor
into both of them. Because of non-transferability, a trigger effect that does
work on the MUT cannot be transferred to the FE, making NTD effective against
different types of backdoor attacks. We evaluate NTD on three popular

polarized anelastic limit can be well controlled by regulating the amplitude of
mechanical cycling. Through the atomic-level analysis of nonaffine

survived anelastic events dominate the directional anelastic limit. The
polarized distribution of local yield stress reveals that the mechanical
polarity is attributed to the plastic-event-healing induced asymmetry of local
potential energy surface, rather than frozen-in anelastic strain. Furthermore,
the healing of plastic events associated with the redistribution of local

While this feature promises several benefits such as increased performance or
the reuse of legacy code, it can also break the language's guarantees, e.g.,
crash-safety. In this work, we first provide a comparative analysis of the
security risks of native extension APIs in three popular scripting languages.
Additionally, we discuss a novel methodology for studying the misuse of the

producing reads of uninitialized memory, hard crashes or memory leaks in 33 npm

identify six open-source web applications in which such exploits can be
deployed remotely by a weak adversary. Finally, we were assigned seven security

similarity with conventional glass-forming materials. However, active matter is
inherently out-of-equilibrium and even simple models such as active Brownian
particles (ABPs) and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) behave
markedly differently from their passive counterparts. Controversially, this
difference has been shown to manifest itself via either a speedup, slowdown, or
non-monotonic change of the glassy relaxation dynamics. Here we rationalize
these seemingly contrasting views on the departure from equilibrium by
identifying the ratio of the short-time length scale to the cage length, i.e.
the length scale of local particle caging, as a vital and unifying control
parameter for active glassy matter. In particular, we explore the glassy
dynamics of both thermal and athermal ABPs and AOUPs upon increasing the
persistence time. We find that for all studied systems there is an optimum of
the dynamics; this optimum occurs when the cage length coincides with the
corresponding short-time length scale of the system, which is either the
persistence length for athermal systems or a combination of the persistence
length and a diffusive length scale for thermal systems. This new insight, for
which we also provide a simple physical argument, allows us to reconcile and
explain the manifestly disparate departures from equilibrium reported in many
previous studies of dense active materials.

evolution, when stars are so cool that spectral lines are no longer formed in
the normal H- or He-dominated atmospheres, magnetic fields can be probed only
by means of circular polarimetry of the continuum. The study of the fields of
featureless DC white dwarfs may reveal whether Ohmic decay acts on magnetic
white dwarfs, or if magnetic fields continue to be generated even several
billion years after white dwarf formation. Compared to spectropolarimetry,
broad-band circular polarisation measurements have the advantage of reaching a
higher accuracy in the continuum, with the potential of detecting magnetic
fields as weak as a fraction of a MG in DC stars, if the telescope size is
adequate for the star's magnitude. Here we present the results of a first

relationship between magnetic field strength (when known from
spectropolarimetry) and circular polarisation of the continuum. We also

polarimetric techniques since the late 1970s. We also discuss the

Accurately modeling the propagation of a flame in more than one spatial
dimension during statistically significant time windows usually comprises a
large range of temporal and spatial scales, which entail high computational
costs. Recent machine learning developments have shown great potential in
accelerating such simulations. However, purely data-driven approaches, which
only make use of an artificial neural network and data, often fail to
accurately simulate the evolution of the reactive flow over a sufficiently long
time and in a physically consistent manner. Therefore, we propose a hybrid
approach that uses a neural network model in combination with a non-reactive
PDE solver that provides partial physical information. In this study, we
demonstrate that results obtained from non-reactive PDEs can be efficiently
corrected at every time step by a hybrid neural network PDE solver model so
that the effect of the chemical reactions on the flow field is correctly
accounted for. For validation purposes, the obtained simulations of the hybrid
model are successfully compared against results coming from a complete set of
reactive PDEs, which are inherently more expensive. We demonstrate the validity
of the proposed approach on a planar and a Bunsen-type flame at various
operating conditions. The hybrid neural-network PDE approach correctly models
the flame evolution of the cases under study for significantly long time
windows, yields improved generalization, and allows for larger simulation time
steps.

not strictly match the objective of open set classification testing. In this
paper, we derive a new loss named global boundary CosFace (GB-CosFace). Our
GB-CosFace introduces an adaptive global boundary to determine whether two face
samples belong to the same identity so that the optimization objective is
aligned with the testing process from the perspective of open set
classification. Meanwhile, since the loss formulation is derived from the
softmax-based loss, our GB-CosFace retains the excellent properties of the
softmax-based loss, and CosFace is proved to be a special case of the proposed
loss. We analyze and explain the proposed GB-CosFace geometrically.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple face recognition benchmarks indicate that
the proposed GB-CosFace outperforms current state-of-the-art face recognition

learning (RL) where an agent learns from pre-collected datasets. However, as
many real-world scenarios involve interaction among multiple agents, it is
important to resolve offline RL in the multi-agent setting. Given the recent
success of transferring online RL algorithms to the multi-agent setting, one
may expect that offline RL algorithms will also transfer to multi-agent
settings directly. Surprisingly, we empirically observe that conservative
offline RL algorithms do not work well in the multi-agent setting -- the
performance degrades significantly with an increasing number of agents. Towards
mitigating the degradation, we identify a key issue that non-concavity of the
value function makes the policy gradient improvements prone to local optima.
Multiple agents exacerbate the problem severely, since the suboptimal policy by
any agent can lead to uncoordinated global failure. Following this intuition,

observatory at a regional scale in Latin America, by deploying a large network
of Water Cherenkov detectors (WCD) and other astroparticle detectors in a wide
range of latitudes from Antarctica to M\'exico, and altitudes from sea level to
more than 5500 m a.s.l. Detectors telemetry, atmospherics conditions and flux
of secondary particles at the ground are measured with extreme detail at each
LAGO site by using our own-designed hardware and firmware (ACQUA).
  To combine and analyse all these data, LAGO developed ANNA, our data analysis
framework. Additionally, ARTI, a complete framework of simulations designed to
simulate the expected signals at our detectors coming from primary cosmic rays
entering the Earth atmosphere, allowing a precise characterization of the sites
in realistic atmospheric, geomagnetic and detector conditions.
  As the measured and synthetic data started to flow, we are facing challenging
scenarios given a large amount of data emerging, performed on a diversity of
detectors and computing architectures and e-infrastructures. These data need to
be transferred, analyzed, catalogued, preserved, and provided for internal and
public access and data-mining under an open e-science environment. In this
work, we present the implementation of ARTI at the EOSC-Synergy cloud-based
services as the first example of LAGO' frameworks that will follow the FAIR
principles for provenance, data curation and re-using of data.
  For this, we calculate the flux of secondary particles expected in up to 1
week at detector level for all the 26 LAGO, and the 1-year flux of high energy
secondaries expected at the ANDES Underground Laboratory and other sites.
Therefore, we show how this development can help not only LAGO but other
data-intensive cosmic rays observatories, muography experiments and underground
laboratories.

aims at increasing the predictive performance for COVID-19 diagnosis while more
complex model architecture. Firstly, the CNN model includes four similar
convolutional layers followed by a flattening and two dense layers. This work
proposes a less complex solution based on simply classifying 2D-slices of
Computed Tomography scans. Despite the simplicity in architecture, the proposed
CNN model showed improved quantitative results exceeding state-of-the-art when
predicting slice cases. The results were achieved on the annotated CT slices of
the COV-19-CT-DB dataset. Secondly, the original dataset was processed via
anatomy-relevant masking of slice, removing none-representative slices from the
CT volume, and hyperparameters tuning. For slice processing, a fixed-sized
rectangular area was used for cropping an anatomy-relevant region-of-interest
in the images, and a threshold based on the number of white pixels in binarized
slices was employed to remove none-representative slices from the 3D-CT scans.
The CNN model with a learning rate schedule and an exponential decay and slice
flipping techniques was deployed on the processed slices. The proposed method
was used to make predictions on the 2D slices and for final diagnosis at
patient level, majority voting was applied on the slices of each CT scan to
take the diagnosis. The macro F1 score of the proposed method well-exceeded the
baseline approach and other alternatives on the validation set as well as on a
test partition of previously unseen images from COV-19CT-DB dataset.

young open clusters. We tested a new set of PMS models including radius
inflation due to starspots or magnetic inhibition of convection, using five
clusters observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning the age range ~10-100 Myr
where such effects could be important. Gaia-ESO radial velocities were combined
with Gaia EDR3 astrometry to obtain clean lists of high-probability members for
the five clusters. A Bayesian maximum likelihood method was adopted to derive
the best model parameters and the cluster reddening and age. Models were
calculated for different values of the mixing length parameter
($\alpha_{ML}=2.0$, 1.5 and 1.0), without spots or with effective spot coverage
$\beta_{spot}=0.2$ and 0.4. To reproduce the CMD and the Li depletion pattern
in Gamma Vel A and B and in 25 Ori we need both a reduced convection efficiency
$\alpha_{ML}=1.0$ and an effective spot coverage of ~20%. We obtained ages of
18 Myr and 21 Myr for Gamma Vel A and B, respectively, and 19 Myr for 25 Ori.
However, a single isochrone is not sufficient to account for the Li dispersion,
and an increasing level of spot coverage as mass decreases seems to be
required. The older clusters (NGC2451B at 30 Myr, NGC2547 at 35 Myr, and
NGC2516 at 138 Myr) are consistent with standard models ($\alpha_{ML}=2.0$ and
no spots) except at low masses: a 20% spot coverage seems to reproduce the
sequence of M-type stars better and might explain the observed abundance
spread. The quality of Gaia-ESO data combined with Gaia allows us to gain
important insights on PMS evolution. Models including starspots can provide a
consistent explanation of the cluster sequences and Li abundances of young
clusters, although a range of starspot coverage is required to fully reproduce
the data.

achieved at 22 GHz for OJ 287. Comparison with ground-based VLBI observations
reveals a progressive jet bending with increasing angular resolution that
agrees with predictions from a supermassive binary black hole model, although
other models cannot be ruled out. Spectral analyses suggest that the VLBI core
is dominated by the internal energy of the emitting particles during the onset
of a multi-wavelength flare, while the parsec-scale jet is consistent with
being in equipartition between the particles and magnetic field. Estimated
minimum brightness temperatures from the visibility amplitudes show a continued
rising trend with projected baseline length up to $10^{13}$ K, reconciled with
the inverse Compton limit through Doppler boosting for a jet closely oriented
to the line of sight. The observed electric vector position angle suggests that
the innermost jet has a predominantly toroidal magnetic field, which together
with marginal evidence of a gradient in rotation measure across the jet width
indicate that the VLBI core is threaded by a helical magnetic field, in
agreement with jet formation models.

the hadronic triangle diagram, and the topological-scattering diagram, which is
the intermediate structure between topological diagram and triangle diagram,

diagram is confirmed by the quark substructure of meson-meson scattering. The
coefficient of each triangle diagram can be derived from the
topological-scattering diagram and the total rescattering amplitudes are
consistent with the ones derived from the chiral Lagrangian. If only the
short-distance $T$ diagram is considered as the weak vertex in triangle

definite proportional relation of $L(C):L(E):L(P)=-2:1:1$ under the $SU(3)_F$

structure theory for the class $\mathcal{S}_Q$ of stable codimension 1
stationary integral varifolds admitting no classical singularities of density
$<Q$. This theory comprises three main theorems which describe the nature of a
varifold $V\in \mathcal{S}_Q$ when: (i) $V$ is close to a flat disk of
multiplicity $Q$ (for integer $Q$); (ii) $V$ is close to a flat disk of integer
multiplicity $<Q$; and (iii) $V$ is close to a stationary cone with vertex
density $Q$ and support the union of 3 or more half-hyperplanes meeting along a
common axis. The main new result concerns (i) and gives in particular a
description of $V\in \mathcal{S}_Q$ near branch points of density $Q$. Results
concerning (ii) and (iii) directly follow from parts of the work [Wic14] (and
are reproduced in Part 2).
  These three theorems, taken with $Q=p/2$, are readily applicable to
codimension 1 rectifiable area minimising currents mod $p$ for any integer
$p\geq 2$, establishing local structure properties of such a current $T$ as
consequences of little, readily checked, information. Specifically, applying
case (i) it follows that, for even $p$, if $T$ has one tangent cone at an
interior point $y$ equal to an (oriented) hyperplane $P$ of multiplicity $p/2$,
then $P$ is the unique tangent cone at $y$, and $T$ near $y$ is given by the
graph of a $\frac{p}{2}$-valued function with $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity in a
certain generalised sense. This settles a basic remaining open question in the
study of the local structure of such currents near points with planar tangent
cones, extending the cases $p=2$ and $p=4$ of the result which have been known
since the 1970's from the De Giorgi--Allard regularity theory ([All72]) and the
structure theory of White ([Whi79]) respectively.

density voxel grid for scene geometry and a feature voxel grid with a shallow
network for complex view-dependent appearance. Modeling with explicit and
discretized volume representations is not new, but we propose two simple yet
non-trivial techniques that contribute to fast convergence speed and
high-quality output. First, we introduce the post-activation interpolation on
voxel density, which is capable of producing sharp surfaces in lower grid
resolution. Second, direct voxel density optimization is prone to suboptimal
geometry solutions, so we robustify the optimization process by imposing
several priors. Finally, evaluation on five inward-facing benchmarks shows that
our method matches, if not surpasses, NeRF's quality, yet it only takes about
15 minutes to train from scratch for a new scene.

ongoing research have been driven by the rapid pace of technological
innovation, that has led to advances such as very large clusters, the wide
diffusion of multi-core processors, the game-changing role of general-purpose
graphic processing units, and the ubiquitous adoption of cloud computing. This
has been paralleled by significant advances within logic programming, such as
tabling, more powerful static analysis and verification, the rapid growth of
Answer Set Programming, and in general, more mature implementations and
systems. This survey provides a review of the research in parallel logic
programming covering the period since 2001, thus providing a natural

nonlinear flux in the range of $k$ over which the elastic scaling is observed.
The multiscale balance between the two fluxes determines the crossover

damping rate of a superconducting microwave resonator by orders of magnitude
and give rise to non-trivial Lamb shifts, (ii) the damping rate can be

assessment of power systems. Traditional methods of transient stability
assessment, such as time domain simulation approach and direct methods, are
appropriate for offline studies and thus, cannot be applied for online
transient stability prediction, which is a major requirement in modern power
systems. This motivated the requirement to apply an artificial
intelligence-based approach. In this regard, supervised machine learning is
beneficial for predicting transient stability status, in the presence of
uncertainties. Therefore, this paper examines the application of a binary
support vector machine-based supervised machine learning, for predicting the
transient stability status of a power system, considering uncertainties of
various factors, such as load, faulted line, fault type, fault location and
fault clearing time. The support vector machine is trained using a Gaussian
Radial Basis function kernel and its hyperparameters are optimized using
Bayesian optimization. Results obtained for the IEEE 14-bus test system
demonstrated that the proposed method offers a fast technique for probabilistic
transient stability status prediction, with an excellent accuracy. DIgSILENT

follow a Lotka-Volterra system of coupled differential equations. We assume
that each species interacts with d other species and that their interaction
coefficients are independent random variables. This parameter d reflects the
connectance of the foodweb and the sparsity of its interactions especially if d
is much smaller that n. We address the question of feasibility of the foodweb,
that is the existence of an equilibrium solution of the Lotka-Volterra system
with no vanishing species. We establish that for a given range of d with an
extra condition on the sparsity structure, there exists an explicit threshold
depending on n and d and reflecting the strength of the interactions, which
guarantees the existence of a positive equilibrium as the number of species n
gets large. From a mathematical point of view, the study of feasibility is
equivalent to the existence of a positive solution (component-wise) to the
equilibrium linear equation. The analysis of such positive solutions
essentially relies on large random matrix theory for sparse matrices and
Gaussian concentration of measure. The stability of the equilibrium is
established. The results in this article extend to a sparse setting the results

of galaxy formation and evolution. Most studies attribute the colour of the red
spirals to different environmental effects. We analyze a volume limited sample
from the SDSS to study the roles of small-scale and large-scale environments on
the colour of spiral galaxies. We compare the star formation rate, stellar age
and stellar mass distributions of the red and blue spirals and find
statistically significant differences between them at $99.9\%$ confidence
level. The red spirals inhabit significantly denser regions than the blue
spirals, explaining some of the observed differences in their physical
properties. However, the differences persist in all types of environments,
indicating that the local density alone is not sufficient to explain the origin
of the red spirals. Using an information theoretic framework, we find a small
but non-zero mutual information between the colour of spiral galaxies and their
large-scale environment that are statistically significant ($99.9\%$ confidence
level) throughout the entire length scale probed. Such correlations between the
colour and the large-scale environment of spiral galaxies may result from the
assembly bias. Thus both the local environment and the assembly bias may play
essential roles in forming the red spirals. The spiral galaxies may have
different assembly history across all types of environments. We propose a
picture where the differences in the assembly history may produce spiral
galaxies with different cold gas content. Such a difference would make some
spirals more susceptible to quenching. In all environments, the spirals with
high cold gas content could delay the quenching and maintain a blue colour,
whereas the spirals with low cold gas fractions would be easily quenched and
become red.

models of material strength, but the required system sizes are often at or
beyond the limit of existing methods. Many important structures are thus
missing in the training or validation of interatomic potentials, whilst studies
of dislocation-defect interactions must mitigate the effect of strong periodic
image interactions along the line direction. We show how these restrictions can
be lifted through the use of linear machine learning potentials in hybrid
simulations, where only a subset of atoms are governed by ab initio forces. The
linear form is exploited in a constrained retraining procedure, qualitatively
expanding the range of training structures for learning and giving precise
matching of dislocation core structures, such that lines can cross the
quantum/classical boundary. We apply our method to fully three dimensional
studies of impurity segregation to edge and screw dislocations in tungsten. Our
retrained potentials give systematically improved accuracy to QM/ML reference
data and the three dimensional geometry allows for long-range relaxations that
qualitatively change impurity-induced core reconstructions compared to
simulations using short periodic supercells. More generally, the ability to
treat arbitrary sub-regions of large scale simulations with ab initio accuracy

dissections, relies on obtaining and comparing cross-sectional diameter
measurements at predefined aortic landmarks, over time. Due to a lack of robust
tools, the orientation of the cross-sectional planes is defined manually by
highly trained operators. We show how manual annotations routinely collected in
a clinic can be efficiently used to ease this task, despite the presence of a
non-negligible interoperator variability in the measurements.
  Impact: Ill-posed but repetitive imaging tasks can be eased or automated by
leveraging imperfect, retrospective clinical annotations.
  Methodology: In this work, we combine convolutional neural networks and
uncertainty quantification methods to predict the orientation of such
cross-sectional planes. We use clinical data randomly processed by 11 operators
for training, and test on a smaller set processed by 3 independent operators to
assess interoperator variability.
  Results: Our analysis shows that manual selection of cross-sectional planes
is characterized by 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of $10.6^\circ$ and
$21.4^\circ$ per angle. Our method showed to decrease static error by
$3.57^\circ$ ($40.2$%) and $4.11^\circ$ ($32.8$%) against state of the art and
LOA by $5.4^\circ$ ($49.0$%) and $16.0^\circ$ ($74.6$%) against manual
processing.
  Conclusion: This suggests that pre-existing annotations can be an inexpensive
resource in clinics to ease ill-posed and repetitive tasks like cross-section
extraction for surveillance of aortic dissections.

set of $\mathcal{S}$ is disjoint with or completely contain in some MCS, then
the set $\mathcal{S}$ is locally distinguishable. Furthermore, we gave a useful

explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic
discharge and curiosity. However, recent implementations suffer from an
exponential complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible
policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al (2020) used Monte Carlo tree
search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different
tasks. Additionally, Champion et al (2021a) proposed a tree search approach
based on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of
a variational message passing approach to active inference, which enables
compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However,
this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active
inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present
an experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this
context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help
mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard
active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small
graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI
exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach
intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently,
successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP
algorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and
the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe
when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is
true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the
dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.

This article focuses on increasing power through a frequentist assisted by
Bayes (FAB) procedure. This FAB approach boosts power by including prior
information on the correlation parameters. In particular, we suppose there is
one of two sources of prior information: (i) a prior dataset that is distinct
from the current data but related enough that it may contain valuable
information about the correlation structure in the current data; and (ii)
knowledge about a tendency for the correlations in different parameters to be
similar so that it is appropriate to consider a hierarchical model. When the
prior information is relevant, the proposed FAB approach can have significant
gains in power. A divide-and-conquer algorithm is developed to reduce
computational complexity in massive testing dimensions. We show improvements in
power for detecting correlated gene pairs in genomic studies while maintaining
control of Type I error or false discover rate (FDR).

longitudinally asymmetric stratospheric wind oscillation (LASO), analogous to
Earth's quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). In our simulations, the LASO has a
vertical extent of 35--55 km, a period of 5--6.5 months, and a peak-to-peak
wind speed amplitude of -70 to +130 m/s with a maximum at an altitude of 41 km.
Unlike the QBO, the LASO displays longitudinal asymmetries related to the
asymmetric thermal forcing of the planet and to interactions with the resulting
stationary Rossby waves. The equatorial gravity wave sources driving the LASO
are localised in the deep convection region at the substellar point and in a
jet exit region near the western terminator, unlike the QBO, for which these
sources are distributed uniformly around the planet. Longitudinally, the
western terminator experiences the highest wind speeds and undergoes reversals
earlier than other longitudes. The antistellar point only experiences a weak
oscillation with a very brief, low-speed westward phase. The QBO on Earth is
associated with fluctuations in the abundances of water vapour and trace gases
such as ozone which are also likely to occur on exoplanets if these gases are
present. Strong fluctuations in temperature and the abundances of atmospheric
species at the terminators will need to be considered when interpreting
atmospheric observations of tidally locked exoplanets.

non-repeating FRBs. We fit the cumulative burst rate-energy distribution with a
broken power-law and find that it flattens out toward higher energies. The
sample shows a diverse zoo of burst morphologies. Notably, burst emission seems
to be more common at the top than the bottom of our 1150 - 1730 MHz observing
band. We also observe that bursts from the same day appear to be more similar
to each other than to those of other days, but this observation requires
confirmation. The wait times and burst rates that we measure are consistent
with previous studies. We discuss these results, primarily in the context of
magnetar models.

goes to infinity. This behavior depends on the regularity (deterministic or

$f_d$ is the spectral density of a deterministic process that has a very high

are significant challenges in obtaining high-quality, large-scale and
accurately labelled datasets. In such a context, how to learn in the presence
of noisy labels has received more and more attention. As a relatively complex
problem, in order to achieve good results, current approaches often integrate
components from several fields, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised
learning, transfer learning and resulting in complicated methods. Furthermore,
they often make multiple assumptions about the type of noise of the data. This
affects the model robustness and limits its performance under different noise
conditions. In this paper, we consider a novel problem setting, Learning with
Unknown Label Noise}(LULN), that is, learning when both the degree and the type
of noise are unknown. Under this setting, unlike previous methods that often
introduce multiple assumptions and lead to complex solutions, we propose a
simple, efficient and robust framework named Sample Selection and
Relabelling(SSR), that with a minimal number of hyperparameters achieves SOTA
results in various conditions. At the heart of our method is a sample selection
and relabelling mechanism based on a non-parametric KNN classifier~(NPK) $g_q$

clean samples and gradually relabel the noisy samples. Without bells and

utilizing both the location information of the user equipment (UE), which is
readily available in contemporary wireless systems with ever-increasing

achieves efficient beam selection with either no real-time training required

(light-training beam selection). Numerical results based on practical channels
obtained using commercial ray tracing software are presented, which demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed scheme over various benchmark schemes.

measuring the deposited dose, thus isolating signal variations resulting from
the angular dependency. The Cerenkov probe is composed of a 10-mm long
sensitive volume of clear PMMA optical fiber separated by an absorptive filter
from a 1-mm diameter transport fiber. Filtered and raw Cerenkov signals from
the sensitive volume and transport fiber, respectively, were collected using
the Hyperscint RP-200 scintillation dosimetry platform. The total signal was
unmixed using a hyperspectral approach. Dose calibration of the detector signal
was accomplished with photon and electron beams. Using a solid-water phantom,
measurements at fixed incident angles covering a wide range of doses and output
factors were realized. For fixed incident angle, signal characterization of the
Cerenkov detector displays a linear dose-light relationship. As expected, the
sensitive volume signal was found to be energy dependent. Output factors were
accurately measured within 0.8 % for field size up to 25 cm x 25 cm with both
photons and electrons. First validation of the Cerenkov angular dependency
shows a linear dose-light relationship for the whole range of angles tested. As
expected, the Cerenkov signal intensity per dose unit varies based on the
irradiation angle due to the angular dependency. Results showed that using
calibration conditions where the electron energy spectrum is similar to the
measurement conditions allows to rely on deposited dose to account for this
dependency. These preliminary results constitute a first step toward
experimental irradiation angle measurements.

we let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training

consists of 23 840 alerts from the ZTF with confirmed classification via
cross-match with SIMBAD database and the Transient name server (TNS), 1 600 of
which were SNe Ia (1 021 unique objects). The data configuration, after the
learning cycle was completed, consists of 310 alerts for training and 23 530

present a generic solution for this problem by a methodology that allows the

either employ meta-heuristics, or try to develop problem-specific optimization
techniques. Instead, we exploit recent advances in generic NLP solvers and
explore a rich set of model refinement techniques. The networks that we study
contain a single source and multiple demand nodes with residual pressure
constraints. Indeterminism of flow values and flow direction in the network
leads to non-linearity in these constraints making the optimization problem
non-convex. While the physical network is cyclic, flow through the network is
necessarily acyclic and thus enforces an acyclic orientation. We devise
different strategies of finding acyclic orientations and explore the benefit of
enforcing such orientations explicitly as a constraint. Finally, we propose a
parallel link formulation that models flow in each link as two separate flows
with opposing directions. This allows us to tackle numerical difficulties in
optimization when flow in a link is near zero. We find that all our proposed
formulations give results at par with least cost solutions obtained in the
literature on benchmark networks. We also introduce a suite of large test
networks since existing benchmark networks are small in size, and find that the
parallel link approach outperforms all other approaches on these bigger

systems where a number of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices interact

MG energy management, most studies assume a perfect communication environment,
where communication failures are not considered. In this paper, we consider the
MG as a multi-agent environment with IoT devices in which AI agents exchange
information with their peers for collaboration. However, the collaboration
information may be lost due to communication failures or packet loss. Such
events may affect the operation of the whole MG. To this end, we propose a
multi-agent Bayesian deep reinforcement learning (BA-DRL) method for MG energy
management under communication failures. We first define a multi-agent
partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP) to describe agents
under communication failures, in which each agent can update its beliefs on the
actions of its peers. Then, we apply a double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
architecture for Q-value estimation in BA-DRL, and propose a belief-based
correlated equilibrium for the joint-action selection of multi-agent BA-DRL.
Finally, the simulation results show that BA-DRL is robust to both power supply
uncertainty and communication failure uncertainty. BA-DRL has 4.1% and 10.3%
higher reward than Nash Deep Q-learning (Nash-DQN) and alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) respectively under 1% communication failure

Prior, this paper introduces a different use of deep architectures as

subject-specific deformable registration method called MIRRBA, relying on a
deep pyramidal architecture to be the prior parametric model constraining the
deformation field. Diverging from the supervised learning paradigm, MIRRBA does
not require a learning database, but only the pair of images to be registered
to optimize the network's parameters and provide a deformation field. We
demonstrate the regularizing power of deep architectures and present new
elements to understand the role of the architecture in deep learning methods
for registration. Hence, to study the impact of the network parameters, we ran
our method with different architectural configurations on a private dataset of
110 metastatic breast cancer full-body PET images with manual segmentations of
the brain, bladder and metastatic lesions. We compared it against conventional
iterative registration approaches and supervised deep learning-based models.
Global and local registration accuracies were evaluated using the detection
rate and the Dice score respectively, while registration realism was evaluated
using the Jacobian's determinant. Moreover, we computed the ability of the
different methods to shrink vanishing lesions with the disappearing rate.
MIRRBA significantly improves the organ and lesion Dice scores of supervised
models. Regarding the disappearing rate, MIRRBA more than doubles the best
performing conventional approach SyNCC score. Our work therefore proposes an
alternative way to bridge the performance gap between conventional and deep
learning-based methods and demonstrates the regularizing power of deep
architectures.

quantities of data. There is a growing need to transmit this data faster and
more securely such that it cannot be accessed by malicious individuals. Edge
computing has emerged in previous research as a method capable of improving
data transmission times and security before the data ends up in the cloud. Edge
computing has an impressive transmission speed based on fifth generation (5G)
communication which transmits data with low latency and high bandwidth. While
edge computing is sufficient to extract important features from the raw data to
prevent large amounts of data requiring excessive bandwidth to be transmitted,
cloud computing is used for the computational processes required for developing
algorithms and modeling the data. Edge computing also improves the quality of
the user experience by saving time and integrating quality of life (QoL)
features. QoL features are important for the healthcare sector by helping to
provide real-time feedback of data produced by healthcare devices back to
patients for a faster recovery. Edge computing has better energy efficiency,
can reduce the electricity cost, and in turn help people reduce their living
expenses. This paper will take a detailed look into edge computing applications
around Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart city infrastructure, and
benefits to healthcare.

  Vertexing through the Application of Machine Learning Methods","43 pages",,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The purpose of this work is to examine the application of a deep learning
model in event reconstruction of neutrino interactions. The challenges faced in
event reconstruction include the placement of an accurate primary neutrino
interaction vertex which is used to support the particle track and prong
algorithms. The result of accurate primary vertex ensures all particles
involved in a neutrino interaction are included. We propose a regression-based
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method to predict the primary vertex of a
particle interaction. We show that with raw two-dimensional pixel map views as
input, the regression-based CNN can predict the primary vertex in all three
coordinates. This work is applied as part of the NOvA (NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$
Appearance) near detector reconstruction efforts. The primary vertex predicted
by the regression-based CNN model shows promising results for future
applications. This deep learning method can be extended to secondary vertexing
through a Kernel Density Estimate algorithm discussed in this work.

essential tool for categorizing, summarizing, and exploring large collections
of documents. Probabilistic topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA), describe how words in documents are generated via a set of latent
distributions called topics. Recently, the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) has
extended LDA to utilize the semantic information in word embeddings to derive
semantically richer topics. As LDA and its extensions are unsupervised models,
they aren't defined to make efficient use of a user's prior knowledge of the
domain. To this end, we propose the Keyword Assisted Embedded Topic Model
(KeyETM), which equips ETM with the ability to incorporate user knowledge in
the form of informative topic-level priors over the vocabulary. Using both
quantitative metrics and human responses on a topic intrusion task, we
demonstrate that KeyETM produces better topics than other guided, generative
models in the literature.

large-scale linked open data (LOD) to support the construction of domain

method defines search entities by linking the LOD vocabulary with technical
terms related to the target domain. The search entities are then used as a
starting point for obtaining upper-level concepts in the LOD, and the
occurrences of common upper-level entities and the chain-of-path relationships
are examined to determine the range of conceptual connections in the target
domain. A technical dictionary index and natural language processing are used
to evaluate whether the extracted concepts cover the domain. As an example of
extracting a class hierarchy from LOD, we used Wikidata to construct a domain
ontology for polymer materials and physical properties. The proposed method can
be applied to general datasets with class hierarchies, and it allows ontology
developers to create an initial model of the domain ontology for their own
purposes.

standard format for this purpose. As a list of individually compressed records
of HTTP requests and responses, it allows for constant-time random access to
all kinds of web data via off-the-shelf open source parsers in many programming
languages, such as WARCIO, the de-facto standard for Python. When processing
web archives at the terabyte or petabyte scale, however, even small
inefficiencies in these tools add up quickly, resulting in hours, days, or even
weeks of wasted compute time. Reviewing the basic components of WARCIO and
analyzing its bottlenecks, we proceed to build FastWARC, a new high-performance
WARC processing library for Python, written in C++/Cython, which yields
performance improvements by factors of 1.6-8x.

insights from text. However, while many models have been proposed, none are
able to model topic temporality and hierarchy jointly. Modelling time provide
more precise topics by separating lexically close but temporally distinct
topics while modelling hierarchy provides a more detailed view of the content
of a document corpus. In this study, we therefore propose a novel method,
HTMOT, to perform Hierarchical Topic Modelling Over Time. We train HTMOT using
a new implementation of Gibbs sampling, which is more efficient. Specifically,
we show that only applying time modelling to deep sub-topics provides a way to
extract specific stories or events while high level topics extract larger
themes in the corpus. Our results show that our training procedure is fast and
can extract accurate high-level topics and temporally precise sub-topics. We
measured our model's performance using the Word Intrusion task and outlined
some limitations of this evaluation method, especially for hierarchical models.
As a case study, we focused on the various developments in the space industry
in 2020.

  Strategies","accepted at EvoApplications2022",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) is a promising framework for black-box
continuous optimization problems. NES optimizes the parameters of a probability
distribution based on the estimated natural gradient, and one of the key
parameters affecting the performance is the learning rate. We argue that from
the viewpoint of the natural gradient method, the learning rate should be
determined according to the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient. To do
so, we propose a new learning rate adaptation mechanism for NES. The proposed
mechanism makes it possible to set a high learning rate for problems that are
relatively easy to optimize, which results in speeding up the search. On the
other hand, in problems that are difficult to optimize (e.g., multimodal
functions), the proposed mechanism makes it possible to set a conservative
learning rate when the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient seems to be
low, which results in the robust and stable search. The experimental
evaluations on unimodal and multimodal functions demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism works properly depending on a search situation and is effective over
the existing method, i.e., using the fixed learning rate.

and Asian countries. As humans overutilize natural resources for their
development, elephants' living area continues to decrease; this leads elephants
to invade the human living area and raid crops more frequently, costing
millions of dollars annually. To mitigate EHC, in this paper, we propose an
original solution that comprises of three parts: a compact custom low-power GPS
tag that is installed on the elephants, a receiver stationed in the human
living area that detects the elephants' presence near a farm, and an autonomous
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system that tracks and herds the elephants away
from the farms. By utilizing proportional-integral-derivative controller and
machine learning algorithms, we obtain accurate tracking trajectories at a
real-time processing speed of 32 FPS. Our proposed autonomous system can save
over 68 % cost compared with human-controlled UAVs in mitigating EHC.
