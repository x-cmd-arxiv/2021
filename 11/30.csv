  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The task of semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has been greatly
advanced and state-of-the-art performance has been made by dense matching-based
methods. The recent methods leverage space-time memory (STM) networks and learn
to retrieve relevant information from all available sources, where the past
frames with object masks form an external memory and the current frame as the
query is segmented using the mask information in the memory. However, when
forming the memory and performing matching, these methods only exploit the
appearance information while ignoring the motion information. In this paper, we
advocate the return of the \emph{motion information} and propose a motion
uncertainty-aware framework (MUNet) for semi-supervised VOS. First, we propose
an implicit method to learn the spatial correspondences between neighboring
frames, building upon a correlation cost volume. To handle the challenging
cases of occlusion and textureless regions during constructing dense
correspondences, we incorporate the uncertainty in dense matching and achieve
motion uncertainty-aware feature representation. Second, we introduce a
motion-aware spatial attention module to effectively fuse the motion feature
with the semantic feature. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks
show that \textbf{\textit{using a small amount of data and combining it with
powerful motion information can bring a significant performance boost}}. We
achieve ${76.5\%}$ $\mathcal{J} \& \mathcal{F}$ only using DAVIS17 for
training, which significantly outperforms the \textit{SOTA} methods under the
low-data protocol. \textit{The code will be released.}

distinct objectives, ""simulatability"" and ""counterfactual relevance"", but it is
not clear how the objectives can jointly influence the human understanding of
an explanation. We design a user study to investigate such joint effects and
use the findings to design a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm to

single-objective baselines that use first-order continuous optimization or
discrete combinatorial search. The explanations are further evaluated in
robustness and sensitivity to show their capability of revealing convincing

is present in the continuum model when $g_x^2=g_y^2$, has a mixed 't~Hooft
anomaly with the charge conservation symmetry, which guarantees the existence
of a massless mode. However, the same 't~Hooft anomaly also implies that the
continuous chiral symmetry is broken explicitly in our lattice model.
Nevertheless, from numerical matrix product state simulations we find that, for
certain parameters of the lattice model, the continuous chiral symmetry
reemerges in the infrared fixed point theory, even at strong coupling. We argue
that, to understand this phenomenon, it is crucial to go beyond mean-field
theory (or, equivalently, beyond the leading order term in a $1/N$ expansion).
Interestingly, on the lattice, the chiral Gross-Neveu model appears at a
Landau-forbidden second order phase transition separating two distinct and

different 't Hooft anomalies or Lieb-Schultz-Mattis obstructions for this

then corresponds to playing an auction against a budgeted adversary with budget
$B_2$. We present worst-case guarantees for two simple and widely-studied
combinatorial auctions, namely, the sequential and simultaneous auctions, for

realistic reactions using such models. We showed that a simultaneous M-fold
increase of the initiation probability $p_{i}$ and an M-fold decrease of the
termination probability $p_{t}$ does not result in significant changes in the
chain length distribution. If the RAFT/initiator ratio is small, a simplified
model with no termination and immediate radical formation can be used with good
enough accuracy. After that we directly compared the reaction behavior within
the kinetic model and DPD. We showed that steric restrictions, which were not
present in the kinetic model, can introduce noticeable changes in the system
behavior. Finally, we studied the influence of the incompatibility on the RAFT
polymerization process on an example classical implementation of
polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). We showed that in systems with
incompatible species number of activation-deactivation cycles does not always
reflect the dispersity of the resulting chain ensemble. Moreover, we
demonstrated that specifically the incompatibility between the RAFT end group

taking into account the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space in multifield

crucial for the ongoing experimental search for this critical point through the
beam energy scan program at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). In the
expanding fireball created in a heavy-ion collision, critical fluctuations
would inescapably fall out of equilibrium, and require a systematic description
within a dynamical framework. In this paper, we employ newly developed
effective field theory (EFT) for fluctuating hydrodynamics to study the
real-time critical non-Gaussian fluctuations of a conserved charge density. In
particular, we derive the evolution equations for multi-point correlators of
density fluctuations and obtain the closed-form solutions with arbitrary
initial conditions that can readily be implemented in realistic simulations for
heavy-ion collisions. We find that non-linear interactions among noise fields,
which are missing in traditional stochastic hydrodynamics, could potentially
contribute to the quartic (fourth order) fluctuations in scaling regime even at

Four dimensions are considered: Task, interaction, performance, and experience.
First, human and machine work together to accomplish a common task

each partner possesses an internal representation of own as well as the other
partner's intentions and influence on the environment. This alignment, which is
the core of the interaction, constitutes the symbiotic understanding between
both partners, being the basis of a joint, highly coordinated and effective

synergetic effects regarding the intention recognition and complementary
strengths of the partners, resulting in a higher overall performance

user's experiences, like flow, acceptance, sense of agency, and embodiment

However, this assumption needs to be elaborated by identifying specifically

usually have huge parametric space and consist of a large number of weights. In
this study, we make a deep gradient-level analysis on the expected variations

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Excessive sleepiness in attention-critical contexts can lead to adverse
events, such as car crashes. Detecting and monitoring sleepiness can help
prevent these adverse events from happening. In this paper, we use the Voiceome
dataset to extract speech from 1,828 participants to develop a deep transfer
learning model using Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) speech representations to detect
sleepiness from individuals. Speech is an under-utilized source of data in
sleep detection, but as speech collection is easy, cost-effective, and
non-invasive, it provides a promising resource for sleepiness detection. Two
complementary techniques were conducted in order to seek converging evidence
regarding the importance of individual speech tasks. Our first technique,
masking, evaluated task importance by combining all speech tasks, masking
selected responses in the speech, and observing systematic changes in model
accuracy. Our second technique, separate training, compared the accuracy of
multiple models, each of which used the same architecture, but was trained on a
different subset of speech tasks. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing
model utilizes the memory recall task and categorical naming task from the
Boston Naming Test, which achieved an accuracy of 80.07% (F1-score of 0.85) and
81.13% (F1-score of 0.89), respectively.

variables is an intriguing idea to tackle the sign problem. In thimble
regularization the domain of integration is deformed into an union of manifolds
called Lefschetz thimbles. On each thimble the imaginary part of the action
stays constant and the sign problem disappears. A long standing issue of this
approach is how to determine the relative weight to assign to each thimble
contribution in the (multi)-thimble decomposition. Yet this is an issue one has
to face, as previous work has shown that different theories exist for which the
contributions coming from thimbles other than the dominant one cannot be
neglected. Historically, one of the first examples of such theories is the
one-dimensional Thirring model. Here we discuss how Taylor expansions can be
used to by-pass the need for multi-thimble simulations. If multiple, disjoint
regions can be found in the parameters space of the theory where only one
thimble gives a relevant contribution, multiple Taylor expansions can be
carried out in those regions to reach other regions by single thimble
simulations. Better yet, these Taylor expansions can be bridged by Pad\'e
interpolants. Not only does this improve the convergence properties of the
series, but it also gives access to information about the analytical structure
of the observables. The true singularities of the observables can be recovered.
We show that this program can be applied to the one-dimensional Thirring model
and to a (simple) version of HDQCD. But the general idea behind our strategy
can be helpful beyond thimble regularization itself, i.e. it could be valuable
in studying the singularities of QCD in the complex $\mu_B$ plane. Indeed this
is a program that is currently being carried out by the Bielefeld-Parma
collaboration.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. With a RSOL, some
""in-code"" speed-of-light $\tilde{c}$ is set to much lower values than the true
$c$, allowing simulations to take larger timesteps (which are restricted by the
Courant condition given the large CR speeds). However, due to the absence of a
well-formulated RSOL implementation from the literature, with naive
substitution of the true $c$ with a RSOL, the CR properties in MHD-PIC
simulations (e.g.\ CR energy or momentum density, gyro radius) vary
artificially with respect to each other and with respect to the converged
($\tilde{c} \rightarrow c$) solutions with different choices of a RSOL. Here,
we derive a new formulation of the MHD-PIC equations with a RSOL, and show that
(1) it guarantees all steady-state properties of the CR distribution function
and background plasma/MHD quantities are {\em independent} of the RSOL
$\tilde{c}$ even for $\tilde{c} \ll c$, (2) ensures that the simulation can
{\em simultaneously} represent the real physical values of CR number, mass,
momentum, and energy density, (3) retains the correct physical meaning of
various terms like the electric field, and (4) ensures the numerical timestep
for CRs can always be safely increased by a factor $\sim c/\tilde{c}$. This new
RSOL formulation should enable greater self-consistency and reduced CPU cost in
simulations of CR-MHD interactions.

produce augmented texts by five simple text editing operations (or DA
techniques), largely irrespective of language generation rules, but one is
enhanced with a pre-trained n-gram language model to fuse it with prior
linguistic knowledge. We then trained four neural network models (BOW, CNN,
LSTM, and GRU) and a pre-trained model (ERNIE-Gram) on the LCQMCs train sets of
varying size as well as the related augmented train sets produced by the two DA

differences between the models trained on the two types of augmented train
sets, both when the five DA techniques are applied together or separately.
Moreover, due to the inability of the five DA techniques to make strictly
paraphrastic augmented texts, the results indicate the need of sufficient
amounts of training examples for the classification models trained on them to
mediate the negative impact of false matching augmented text pairs and improve
performance, a limitation of random text editing perturbations used as a DA

  One of the main ideas of this work is that the basic entities of our world
are various types of particles, elementary or composite. It follows that each
elementary process, hence each measurement process at its core, is a spacetime,
pointlike, event. Another key idea is that, when a microsystem $\psi$ gets into
contact with the experimental device, factorization of $\psi$ rapidly fails and
entangled mixed states appear. The wave functions for the microsystem-apparatus
coupled systems for different measurement outcomes then lack overlapping
spacetime support. It means that the aftermath of each measurement is a single
term in the sum: a ""wave-function collapse"".
  Our discussion leading to a diagonal density matrix, $\rho= {\rm diag} (
|c_1|^2, \ldots, |c_n|^2, \ldots )$ shows how the information encoded in the
wave function $|\psi\rangle = \sum_n c_n | n \rangle$ gets transcribed, via
entanglement with the experimental device and environment, into the relative
frequencies ${\cal P}_n = |c_n|^2$ for various experimental results $F=f_n$.
  These results represent new, significant steps towards filling in the logical
gaps in the standard interpretation based on Born's rule, and replacing it with
a more natural one. Accepting objective reality of quantum fluctuations,
independent of any experiments, and independently of human presence, one
renounces the idea that in a fundamental, complete theory of Nature the result
of each single experiment must necessarily be predictable.
  A few well-known puzzles such as the Schr\""odinger cat conundrum and the EPR
paradox are briefly reviewed: they can all be naturally explained away.

explain and predict the dynamics of more fine-grained systems. Naturally, such
models require appropriate macrovariables. Automated procedures to detect
suitable variables would be useful to leverage increasingly available
high-dimensional observational datasets. This work introduces a novel
algorithmic approach that is inspired by a new characterisation of causal
macrovariables as information bottlenecks between microstates. Its general form
can be adapted to address individual needs of different scientific goals. After
a further transformation step, the causal relationships between learned
variables can be investigated through additive noise models. Experiments on
both simulated data and on a real climate dataset are reported. In a synthetic
dataset, the algorithm robustly detects the ground-truth variables and
correctly infers the causal relationships between them. In a real climate
dataset, the algorithm robustly detects two variables that correspond to the
two known variations of the El Nino phenomenon.

vision tasks such as recognition and detection, and thus been attracting
fast-growing efforts on manually designing more effective architectures. In
this paper, we propose to use neural architecture search to automate this

central idea is to gradually evolve different search dimensions guided by their
E-T Error computed using a weight-sharing supernet. Moreover, we provide design
guidelines of general vision transformers with extensive analysis according to
the space searching process, which could promote the understanding of vision
transformer. Remarkably, the searched models, named S3 (short for Searching the

proposed models, such as Swin, DeiT and ViT, when evaluated on ImageNet. The
effectiveness of S3 is also illustrated on object detection, semantic

the invariances captured by representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) are
shared with humans. We identify challenges in measuring these invariances.
Prior works used gradient-based methods to generate identically represented
inputs (IRIs), ie, inputs which have identical representations (on a given
layer) of a neural network, and thus capture invariances of a given network.
One necessary criterion for a network's invariances to align with human
perception is for its IRIs look 'similar' to humans. Prior works, however, have
mixed takeaways; some argue that later layers of DNNs do not learn human-like
invariances (\cite{jenelle2019metamers}) yet others seem to indicate otherwise
(\cite{mahendran2014understanding}). We argue that the loss function used to
generate IRIs can heavily affect takeaways about invariances of the network and
is the primary reason for these conflicting findings. We propose an adversarial
regularizer on the IRI generation loss that finds IRIs that make any model
appear to have very little shared invariance with humans. Based on this
evidence, we argue that there is scope for improving models to have human-like
invariances, and further, to have meaningful comparisons between models one
should use IRIs generated using the regularizer-free loss. We then conduct an
in-depth investigation of how different components (eg architectures, training
losses, data augmentations) of the deep learning pipeline contribute to
learning models that have good alignment with humans. We find that
architectures with residual connections trained using a (self-supervised)
contrastive loss with $\ell_p$ ball adversarial data augmentation tend to learn
invariances that are most aligned with humans. Code:

interacting superconducting qubits arrays (SQAs) in the presence of a spread of
individual qubit frequencies. The interaction is provided by mutual inductive
coupling between adjacent qubits (short-range Ising interaction) or inductive
coupling to a low-dissipative resonator (long-range exchange interaction). In
the absence of interaction the Fourier transform of temporal correlation
function of the total polarization ($z$-projection of the total spin), i.e. the
dynamic susceptibility $C(\omega)$, demonstrates a set of sharp small magnitude
resonances corresponding to the transitions of individual superconducting
qubits. We show that even a weak interaction between qubits can overcome the
disorder with a simultaneous formation of the collective excited states. This
collective behavior manifests itself by a single large resonance in
$C(\omega)$. In the presence of a weak non-resonant microwave photon field in
the low-dissipative resonator, the positions of dominant resonances depend on
the number of photons, i.e. the collective ac Stark effect. Coupling of an SQA

striking features of not only the Sun, but other stars as well. This phenomenon
is known as the FIP effect (FIP stands for first ionization potential), and its
strength can be characterized by the FIP bias, the logarithmic abundance
difference between low- and high-FIP elements in the corona, compared to the
photosphere. The FIP bias was shown to depend on the surface temperature of the
star. We compiled FIP bias and other parameters for 59 stars for which coronal
composition is available, now including evolved stars. Using principal
component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, we searched for
correlations with other astrophysical parameters within the sample which may
influence the stellar FIP bias. Adding stars to the $T_{\rm eff}-$FIP bias
diagram unveiled new features in its structure. In addition to the previously
known relationship, there appears to be a second branch, a parallel sequence
about 0.5 dex above it. While the $T_{\rm eff}$ remains the main determinant of
the FIP bias, other parameters such as stellar activity indicators also have
influence. We find three clusters in the FIP bias determinant parameter space.
One distinct group is formed by the evolved stars. Two groups contain main
sequence stars in continuation separated roughly by the sign change of the
FIP-bias value. The new branch of the $T_{\rm eff}-$FIP bias diagram contains
stars with higher activity level, in terms of X-ray flux and rotational
velocity. The two main sequence clusters run from the earliest spectral types
of A-F with shallow convection zones through G-K-early M stars with gradually
deeper convection zones, and end up with the fully convective M dwarf stars,
depicting the change of the dynamo type with the internal differences of the
main sequence stars in connection with the FIP-bias values.

Multiplicative Weights Updates (CMWU) for regret minimization in general games.
CMWU effectively corresponds to the standard MWU algorithm but where all
agents, when updating their mixed strategies, use the payoff profiles based on
tomorrow's behavior, i.e. the agents are clairvoyant. CMWU achieves constant
regret of $\ln(m)/\eta$ in all normal-form games with m actions and fixed
step-sizes $\eta$. Although CMWU encodes in its definition a fixed point
computation, which in principle could result in dynamics that are neither
computationally efficient nor uncoupled, we show that both of these issues can
be largely circumvented. Specifically, as long as the step-size $\eta$ is upper
bounded by $\frac{1}{(n-1)V}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $[0,V]$ is
the payoff range, then the CMWU updates can be computed linearly fast via a
contraction map. This implementation results in an uncoupled online learning
dynamic that admits a $O (\log T)$-sparse sub-sequence where each agent
experiences at most $O(nV\log m)$ regret. This implies that the CMWU dynamics
converge with rate $O(nV \log m \log T / T)$ to a \textit{Coarse Correlated

classes, which poses great challenges to modern visual systems. Existing
approaches either perform class re-balancing strategies or directly improve
network modules to address the problem. However, they still train models with a
finite set of predefined labels, limiting their supervision information and
restricting their transferability to novel instances. Recent advances in
large-scale contrastive visual-language pretraining shed light on a new pathway
for visual recognition. With open-vocabulary supervisions, pretrained
contrastive vision-language models learn powerful multimodal representations
that are promising to handle data deficiency and unseen concepts. By
calculating the semantic similarity between visual and text inputs, visual
recognition is converted to a vision-language matching problem. Inspired by
this, we propose BALLAD to leverage contrastive vision-language models for
long-tailed recognition. We first continue pretraining the vision-language
backbone through contrastive learning on a specific long-tailed target dataset.
Afterward, we freeze the backbone and further employ an additional adapter
layer to enhance the representations of tail classes on balanced training
samples built with re-sampling strategies. Extensive experiments have been
conducted on three popular long-tailed recognition benchmarks. As a result, our
simple and effective approach sets the new state-of-the-art performances and
outperforms competitive baselines with a large margin. Code is released at

static, in the sense that the estimate of the quantity of interest does not
change the future evolution of the quantity. In some sequential estimation
problems however, we encounter the situation where the future values of the
quantity to be estimated depend on the estimate of its current value. Examples
include stock price prediction by big investors, interactive product
recommendation, and behavior prediction in multi-agent systems. We may call
such problems as dynamic inference. In this work, a formulation of this problem
under a Bayesian probabilistic framework is given, and the optimal estimation
strategy is derived as the solution to minimize the overall inference loss. How
the optimal estimation strategy works is illustrated through two examples,
stock trend prediction and vehicle behavior prediction. When the underlying
models for dynamic inference are unknown, we can consider the problem of
learning for dynamic inference. This learning problem can potentially unify
several familiar machine learning problems, including supervised learning,
imitation learning, and reinforcement learning.

systematically, we follow a programming-by-optimization approach and search
over the space of algorithm candidates via Bayesian optimization. We challenge
whether the found design choices are necessary or could be replaced by more
naive and simpler ones by performing an ablation analysis. We observe that
using a relatively simple configuration, in some ways simpler than established

by guiding the DSE, taking into account performance and cost estimates. The
proposed method outperforms traditional HLS-driven DSE approaches, by
accounting for arbitrary length of computer programs and the invariant
properties of the input. We propose a novel hybrid control and data flow graph
representation that enables training the graph neural network on specifications
of different hardware accelerators; the methodology naturally transfers to
unseen data-processing applications too. Moreover, we show that our approach
achieves prediction accuracy comparable with that of commonly used simulators
without having access to analytical models of the HLS compiler and the target
FPGA, while being orders of magnitude faster. Finally, the learned
representation can be exploited for DSE in unexplored configuration spaces by
fine-tuning on a small number of samples from the new target domain.

Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ), and the hybrid
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) exchange-correlation functionals and potentials
for the calculation of effective masses with perturbation theory. We introduce
the mstar60 dataset, which contains 60 effective masses derived from 18
semiconductors. The ratio between experimental and calculated effective masses
is $1.70 \pm 0.20$ for PBE, $0.76 \pm 0.04$ for TB-mBJ, $0.99 \pm 0.04$ for
HSE06. We reveal that the nonlocal exchange in HSE06 enlarges the optical
transition matrix elements leading to the superior accuracy of the hybrid
functional in the calculation of effective masses. The omission of nonlocal
exchange in the transition operator for HSE leads to serious errors. For the
semilocal PBE functional, the errors in the bandgap and the optical transition
matrix elements partially cancel out in the calculation of effective masses.
The TB-mBJ functional yields PBE-like matrix elements paired with realistic
bandgaps leading to a consistent overestimation of effective masses. However,
if only limited computational resources are available, experimental masses can
be estimated by multiplying TB-mBJ masses with the factor of 0.76. We then
compare effective masses of transition metal dichalcogenide bulk and monolayer
materials: we show that changes in the matrix elements are important in
understanding the layer-dependent effective mass renormalization.

learning model, D^2-SONATA, built upon a stochastic advection-diffusion

a model of transport atypicality, which isolates abnormal differences between

need to be adapted to the situation to maximize the rewards. We propose a new
bandit model called Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Bandits with Group
Thresholds to address these challenges. Our model subsumes combinatorial
bandits by considering super arms to be subsets of groups of base arms. We seek
to maximize super arm rewards while satisfying thresholds of all base arm
groups that constitute a super arm. To this end, we define a new notion of
regret that merges super arm reward maximization with group reward
satisfaction. To facilitate learning, we assume that the mean outcomes of base
arms are samples from a Gaussian Process indexed by the context set ${\cal X}$,
and the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes.
We propose an algorithm, called Thresholded Combinatorial Gaussian Process
Upper Confidence Bounds (TCGP-UCB), that balances between maximizing cumulative
reward and satisfying group reward thresholds and prove that it incurs
$\tilde{O}(K\sqrt{T\overline{\gamma}_{T}} )$ regret with high probability,

the set of base arm contexts that appeared in the first $T$ rounds and $K$ is
the maximum super arm cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds. We

point-like skyrmions emerge and play a central role in the corresponding
quantum Hall ferromagnetic phase. In this work, we show that in six spatial

to a SO(5) order parameter and give rise to an higher-dimensional generalizaton
of the quantum Hall ferromagnetism. We show that skyrmionic membranes naturally
couple to the curved background through a generalized Wen-Zee term and can give
us some insights about the chiral conformal field theory on the boundary. We
then present a generalization of the Witten effect in six spatial dimensions by
showing that one-dimensional extended monopoles (magnetic strings) in the bulk

This is motivated by the low cost of the radar sensors, their ability to
efficiently capture important features such as the range, angle, velocity of
the moving scatterers (candidate blockages), and their capability to capture
radar frames at relatively high speed. We formulate the radar-aided proactive
blockage prediction problem and develop two solutions for this problem based on

designed to leverage domain knowledge and the understanding of the blockage

  It turns out that the sequence of del Pezzo surfaces is not the only sequence
of objects in mathematics that gives rise to the same $E_k$ symmetry pattern.
We present a sequence of topological spaces, starting with the four-sphere
$S^4$, and then forming its iterated cyclic loop spaces $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$,
within which we discover the $E_k$ symmetry pattern via rational homotopy
theory. For this sequence of spaces, the correspondence between its $E_k$
symmetry pattern and that of toroidal compactifications of M-theory is no
longer a mystery, as each space $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ is naturally related to
the compactification of M-theory on the $k$-torus via identification of the
equations of motion of $(11-k)$-dimensional supergravity as the defining
equations of the Sullivan minimal model of $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$. This gives an
explicit duality between algebraic topology and physics.
  Thereby, we extend Iqbal-Neitzke-Vafa's Mysterious Duality between algebraic
geometry and physics into a triality, also involving algebraic topology. Via
this triality, duality between physics and mathematics is demystified, and the
mystery is transferred to the mathematical realm as duality between algebraic
geometry and algebraic topology. Now the question is: Is there an explicit
relation between the del Pezzo surfaces $\mathbb{B}_k$ and iterated cyclic loop
spaces of $S^4$ which would explain the common $E_k$ symmetry pattern?

an important problem in many applications. Most methods proposed in the
literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of
degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search
(All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once.
However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to
cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its
performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the
all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a
transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder
that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we
utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to
enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather
degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather
type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather
achieves improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One
network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. TransWeather is also
validated on real world test images and found to be more effective than
previous methods. Implementation code can be accessed at

allows to use techniques based on the maximum principle, unlike the
infinitesimal model operator used in other studies with sexual reproduction. In
an asymptotic regime where initially the population has a small phenotypic
variance, we analyse the long-term dynamics of the phenotypic distributions
according to the methodology of small variance (Diekmann et al. 2005). Under
some assumptions on the limit equation, we show that the population remains
monomorphic, that is the phenotypic distribution remains concentrated as a
moving Dirac mass. Moreover, in the case of a monomorphic distribution we
derive a canonical equation describing the dynamics of the dominant alleles.

invariance loss encouraging the model to suppress spurious correlations; (ii)
we devise a modular architecture that factorizes the representations of
invariant mechanisms and style confounders to approximate a sparse causal

typically rely on sophisticated pipelines in order to tackle it. In this paper,
we propose a simple Transformer-based approach to RVOS. Our framework, termed
Multimodal Tracking Transformer (MTTR), models the RVOS task as a sequence
prediction problem. Following recent advancements in computer vision and
natural language processing, MTTR is based on the realization that video and
text can be processed together effectively and elegantly by a single multimodal
Transformer model. MTTR is end-to-end trainable, free of text-related inductive
bias components and requires no additional mask-refinement post-processing
steps. As such, it simplifies the RVOS pipeline considerably compared to

significantly outperforms previous art across multiple metrics. In particular,
MTTR shows impressive +5.7 and +5.0 mAP gains on the A2D-Sentences and
JHMDB-Sentences datasets respectively, while processing 76 frames per second.

variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional
variant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image
generation tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with
existing methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion
strategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with
existing methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces
significantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with
conventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters.
Compared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can
handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large
margin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method
can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR
methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output
image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images.
The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and

reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while
achieving a better image quality.

implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs
non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study,
we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can
maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being
hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model
inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input
thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these
real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized
network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized
straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative

quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly

using the mean and spread of an ensemble forecast as target, the other ones
rely on an indirect training strategy using an analyzed state as target in
which the uncertainty is implicitly learned from the data. Experiments using
the Lorenz'96 model show that the ANNs are able to emulate some of the
properties of ensemble forecasts like the filtering of the most unpredictable

Moreover, ANNs provide a reliable estimation of the forecast uncertainty in the

potential applications. Recently Aaronson (Aaronson 2018, 2020) proposed a
novel certified randomness protocol based on existing random circuit sampling
(RCS) experiments -- placing this application within the reach of near-term
quantum devices. The security of his protocol, however, relies on non-standard
complexity-theoretic conjectures which were not previously studied in the
literature. In this work we provide strong complexity-theoretic evidence in
support of these conjectures. In particular we prove two versions of Aaronson's
conjectures unconditionally in a black-box Fourier sampling setting. This
mirrors earlier complexity-theoretic evidence for quantum advantage, bringing
the security of Aaronson's protocol up to the same level of evidence we have
for quantum advantage from heavy output generation.

pre-existing, circumstellar shells of material by rebrightening and forming
spectral lines, and can even change types as Hydrogen appears in previously
Hydrogen-poor spectra. However, a recently observed core-collapse supernova --
SN 2019tsf -- was found to brighten after roughly 100 days after it was first
observed, suggesting that the supernova ejecta was interacting with surrounding
material, but it lacked any observable emission lines and thereby challenged
the standard supernova-interaction picture. We show through linear perturbation
theory that delayed rebrightenings without the formation of spectral lines are
generated as a consequence of the finite sound crossing time of the post-shock
gas left in the wake of a supernova explosion. In particular, we demonstrate
that sound waves -- generated in the post-shock flow as a consequence of the
interaction between a shock and a density enhancement -- traverse the shocked
ejecta and impinge upon the shock from behind in a finite time, generating
sudden changes in the shock properties in the absence of ambient density
enhancements. We also show that a blastwave dominated by gas pressure and
propagating in a wind-fed medium is unstable from the standpoint that small
perturbations lead to the formation of reverse shocks within the post-shock
flow, implying that the gas within the inner regions of these blastwaves should
be highly turbulent.

three to four times more than any previously known galaxy with a similar

for a doped Mott insulator stands as a grand challenge. We have recently shown
that this can be done starting from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model which can
be understood generally as the minimal model that breaks the non-local $\mathbb
Z_2$ symmetry of a Fermi liquid, thereby constituting a new quartic fixed point
for Mott physics [Phillips et al., Nature Physics 16, 1175 (2020); Huang et
al., Nature Physics (2022)]. In the current work, we compute the
thermodynamics, condensation energy, and electronic properties such as the NMR
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ and ultrasonic attenuation rate. Key differences arise
with the standard BCS analysis from a Fermi liquid: 1) the free energy exhibits
a local minimum at $T_p$ where the pairing gap turns on discontinuously above a
critical value of the repulsive HK interaction, thereby indicating a
first-order transition, 2) a tri-critical point emerges, thereby demarcating
the boundary between the standard second-order superconducting transition and
the novel first-order regime, 3) Mottness changes the sign of the quartic
coefficient in the Landau-Ginzburg free-energy fuctional relative to that in
BCS, 4) as this obtains in the strongly interacting regime, it is Mott physics
that underlies the generic first-order transition, 5) the condensation energy
exceeds that in BCS theory suggesting that multiple Mott bands might be a way
of enhancing superconducting, 6) the heat-capacity jump is non-universal and
increases with the Mott scale, 7) Mottness destroys the Hebel-Slichter peak in
NMR, and 8) Mottness enhances the fall-off of the ultrasonic attenuation at the
pairing temperature $T_p$. As several of these properties are observed in the
cuprates, our analysis here points a way forward in computing superconducting
properties of strongly correlated electron matter.

implementation for computing radiative accelerations and Rosseland mean
opacities that requires significantly less CPU time. Second, the inclusion of
shear mixing based on rotation profiles computed with the 2D stellar structure

chemical mixing profile resulting from shear mixing in combination with atomic
diffusion and radiative levitation does allow for mode trapping, while the
diffusion coefficient in the outer envelope is large ($>10^{6}\,{\rm

abundances for which radiative accelerations can be computed. We find that the
N/C and C/O abundance ratios correlate with stellar age. We predict that these

significance. The off-axis nature of Nucleus 2 makes modeling the system
challenging; but a number of robustness tests suggest that a black hole is
required to explain the kinematics. The SMBH in the offset Nucleus 2 makes up
3.0% of its total mass, which means its SMBH is over-massive compared to the
$M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm Bulge}$ scaling relation. This confirms it as the surviving
nuclear star cluster of a galaxy that has merged with NGC7727. This discovery
is the first dynamically confirmed dual SMBH system with a projected separation
of less than a kiloparsec and the nearest dynamically confirmed dual SMBH at a

and it will eventually result in a 1:24 mass ratio SMBH merger. Optical
emission lines suggest Nucleus 2 is a Seyfert galaxy, making it a

H$\alpha$ luminosity of the best-fit models is an order of magnitude higher

suggests a high escape fraction of ionising photons, a high relative
attenuation of nebular to stellar dust, or a complex SFH. The metallicity
appears lower than the metallicity in more massive galaxies at z=3-5,
consistent with the scenario according to which younger galaxies have lower
metallicities. This chemical immaturity likely facilitates Ly$\alpha$ escape,
explaining why the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width is anti-correlated with stellar

expectations and previous simulations by other groups using similar schemes. We

series of idealized dusty HII regions created by a single star, in order to
assess the impact of grain properties on the resulting spatial distribution of
charges. Second, we perform a realistic radiative transfer simulation of a star
forming region extracted from a dusty galaxy evolving in the Epoch of
Reionization. We find that $\sim 13$ % of the total dust mass gets negatively
charged, mainly silicate and graphite grains of radius micron. A complex
spatial distribution of grain charges is also found, primarily depending on the
exposure to stellar radiation and strongly varying along different lines of
sight, as a result of radiative transfer effects. We finally assess the impact
of grain properties (both chemical composition and size) on the resulting

disruptions of JFCs may supply the zodiacal cloud. We present a model for the
dust produced in comet fragmentations and its evolution. Using results from
dynamical simulations, the model follows individual comets drawn from a size
distribution as they evolve and undergo recurrent splitting events. The
resulting dust is followed with a kinetic model which accounts for the effects
of collisional evolution, Poynting-Robertson drag, and radiation pressure. This
allows to model the evolution of both the size distribution and radial profile
of dust, and we demonstrate the importance of including collisions (both as a
source and sink of dust) in zodiacal cloud models. With physically-motivated
free parameters this model provides a good fit to zodiacal cloud observables,
supporting comet fragmentation as the plausibly dominant dust source. The model
implies that dust in the present zodiacal cloud likely originated primarily
from disruptions of $\sim$ 50 km comets, since larger comets are ejected before
losing all their mass. Thus much of the dust seen today was likely deposited as
larger grains $\sim$ 0.1 Myr in the past. The model also finds the dust level
to vary stochastically; e.g., every $\sim$ 50 Myr large (>100 km) comets with
long dynamical lifetimes inside Jupiter cause dust spikes with order of
magnitude increases in zodiacal light brightness lasting $\sim$ 1 Myr. If
exozodiacal dust is cometary in origin, our model suggests it should be
similarly variable.

bubbles of the intergalactic medium (IGM) around overdense regions of galaxies.
Recent Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) studies during the epoch of reionization show
growing evidence that ionized bubbles formed earlier around brighter galaxies,
suggesting higher IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from these galaxies. We
investigate this problem using IR slitless spectroscopy from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G102 grism observations of 148
galaxies selected via photometric redshifts at $6.0<z<8.2$. These galaxies have
spectra extracted from the CANDELS Ly$\alpha$ Emission at Reionization (CLEAR)

dataset from the Texas Spectroscopic Search for Ly$\alpha$ Emission at the End

distribution at $6.0<z<8.2$, which is described by an exponential form,
$dN/d\text{EW}\propto\text{exp(-EW)}/W_0$, with the characteristic $e$-folding
scale width ($W_0$). We confirm a significant drop of the Ly$\alpha$ strength
(or $W_0$) at $z>6$. Furthermore, we compare the redshift evolution of $W_0$
between galaxies at different UV luminosities. The UV-bright

with a decrease of 0.4 ($\pm$0.2) dex in $W_0$ at $z>6$ while UV-faint
($M_{\text{UV}}>-21$, or $L_{\text{UV}}<L^{*}$) galaxies exhibit a significant
drop by a factor of 0.7-0.8 ($\pm0.2$) dex in $W_0$ from $z<6$ to $z>6$. Our
results add to the accumulating evidence that UV-bright galaxies exhibit
boosted Ly$\alpha$ transmission in the IGM, suggesting that reionization

of black holes and neutron stars, remains rare and limited to special cases,
such as when these objects reside in close binaries with bright companions.
Here we examine the potential of microlensing detections to further constrain
these dark populations. Based on state-of-the-art GC models from the CMC
Cluster Catalog, we estimate the microlensing event rates for black holes,
neutron stars, white dwarfs, and, for comparison, also for M dwarfs in Milky
Way GCs, as well as the effects of different initial conditions on these rates.
Among compact objects, we find that white dwarfs dominate the microlensing
rates, simply because they largely dominate by numbers. We show that
microlensing detections are in general more likely in GCs with higher initial
densities, especially in clusters that undergo core collapse. We also estimate
microlensing rates in the specific cases of M22 and 47 Tuc using our
best-fitting models for these GCs. Because their positions on the sky lie near
the rich stellar backgrounds of the Galactic bulge and the Small Magellanic
Cloud, respectively, these clusters are among the Galactic GCs best-suited for
dedicated microlensing surveys. The upcoming 10-year survey with the Rubin

are known in the mathematical community as state-sum constructions or lattice
topological quantum field theories. All of the established ansatzes for
fixed-point models imply the existence of a gapped boundary as well as a
commuting-projector Hamiltonian. Thus, they fail to capture topological phases
without a gapped boundary or commuting-projector Hamiltonian, most notably
chiral topological phases in $2+1$ dimensions. In this work, we present a more
general fixed-point ansatz not affected by the aforementioned restrictions.
Thus, our formalism opens up a possible way forward towards a microscopic
fixed-point description of chiral phases and we present several strategies that
may lead to concrete examples. Furthermore, we argue that our more general

established ansatzes are universal only for fixed-points of phases which admit

by the PTOLEMY project. Crucial parameters for this measurement are the

test several observational star formation rate (SFR) tracers and find that $24$
$\mu$m, total infrared and H$\alpha$ trace the underlying SFR during the

formation during quiescent phases prior to and after the merger. We then place
the simulated galaxy at distances of $10$ and $50$ Mpc and use aperture
photometry at Hubble Space Telescope resolution to analyse the simulated SC
population. During the starburst phase, a hierarchically forming set of SCs
leads inaccurate source separation because of crowding. This results in
estimated SC mass function slopes that are up to $\sim0.3$ shallower than the

resolves the ionised interstellar medium at ${\sim}50$ pc resolution in 19
nearby spiral galaxies, to study the origin of the diffuse ionised gas (DIG).
We examine the physical conditions of the diffuse gas by first removing
morphologically-defined HII regions and then binning the low-surface-brightness
areas to achieve significant detections of the key nebular lines. A simple
model for the leakage and propagation of ionising radiation from HII regions is
able to reproduce the observed distribution of H$\alpha$ in the DIG. Leaking
radiation from HII regions also explains the observed decrease in line ratios
of low-ionisation species ([SII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\alpha$)
with increasing H$\alpha$ surface brightness ($\Sigma_{H\alpha}$). Emission
from hot low-mass evolved stars, however, is required to explain: (1) the
enhanced low-ionisation line ratios observed in the central regions of some
galaxies; (2) the observed trends of a flat or decreasing [OIII]/H$\beta$ with
$\Sigma_{H\alpha}$; and (3) the offset of some DIG regions from the locus of
HII regions in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, extending into the
area of low-ionisation (nuclear) emission-line regions (LI[N]ERs). Hot low-mass
evolved stars make a small contribution to the energy budget of the DIG (2% of
the galaxy-integrated H$\alpha$ emission), but their harder spectra make them
fundamental contributors to [OIII] emission. The DIG might result from a
superposition of two components, an energetically dominant contribution from
young stars and a more diffuse background of harder ionising photons from old
stars. This unified framework bridges observations of the Milky Way DIG with
LI(N)ER-like emission observed in nearby galaxy bulges.

Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic samples (DR14) based on their spectral shapes,
as part of the SQuIGGLE program. Early results showed that two post-starburst
galaxies host large H$_2$ reservoirs despite their low inferred star formation
rates. Here we expand this analysis to a larger statistical sample of 13
galaxies. Six of the primary targets (45%) are detected, with
$M_{H_2}\gtrsim10^9 M_{\odot}$. Given their high stellar masses, this mass
limit corresponds to an average gas fraction of $\langle f_{H_2} \equiv
M_{H_2}/M_{\star} \rangle \sim7\%$, or ${\sim}14\%$ using lower stellar masses
estimates derived from analytic, exponentially declining star formation
histories. The gas fraction correlates with the $D_n4000$ spectral index,
suggesting that the cold gas reservoirs decrease with time since burst, as
found in local K+A galaxies. Star formation histories derived from flexible
stellar population synthesis modeling support this empirical finding: galaxies
that quenched $\lesssim 150$ Myr prior to observation host detectable CO(2-1)
emission, while older post-starburst galaxies are undetected. The large
$\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs and low star formation rates in the sample imply that
the quenching of star formation precedes the disappearance of the cold gas
reservoirs. However, within the following 100-200 Myrs, the SQuIGGLE galaxies
require the additional and efficient heating or removal of cold gas to bring
their low star formation rates in line with standard $\mathrm{H_2}$ scaling
relations.

Interestingly, the Heisenberg picture also allows us to derive analogue of

extend our study for the case of non-Markovian dynamics and report the
modifications to the standard quantum regression theorem. We illustrate all of

the backward scattering of neutrinos off the nuclei at relatively large

not large enough. Indeed, the scattering-induced instabilities can mostly
impact the neutrinos traveling in the backward direction, which represent only
a small fraction of neutrinos at large radii. We show that this can be
explained by the shape of the unstable flavor eigenstates, which can be

spectra ever observed in integrated starlight. The authors studied the stellar
populations of the shell, of the center of the galaxy and of its globular

prominent galaxy however still remained unclear.
  Here, we add further clues on their formation from the radii of the shells,
and we present a scenario for the formation of the tidal features that seems to
be unique and explaining all available data.
  Shell radii are analyzed with the shell identification method, and we run
self-consistent simulations of the formation of the tidal features. We consider
Newtonian as well as MOND gravity.
  Observations suggest that the tidal features originate from the accretion of
a spiral galaxy. The shell identification method yields that the merging
galaxies collided first 1.3Gyr ago and then again 0.9Gyr ago, thereby forming
the shells in two generations. This would also explain the young ages of
stellar populations in the center of the galaxy and the young age of the
globular clusters. The analytic models of shell propagation, that underlie the
shell identification method, are verified by a simulation. The simulations
reproduce well the observed morphology of the tidal features. The accreted
spiral likely reached NGC474 nearly radially, in the plane of the sky, from the
south, its rotation axis pointing toward us. It should have had a stellar mass
of around 1/6 of NGC474, i.e. $10^{9.8}\,M_\odot$. It seems that all tidal

Even though a large number of methods propose new adaptation strategies, they
are mostly based on outdated network architectures. As the influence of recent
network architectures has not been systematically studied, we first benchmark
different network architectures for UDA and newly reveal the potential of
Transformers for UDA semantic segmentation. Based on the findings, we propose a
novel UDA method, DAFormer. The network architecture of DAFormer consists of a
Transformer encoder and a multi-level context-aware feature fusion decoder. It
is enabled by three simple but crucial training strategies to stabilize the
training and to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class
Sampling on the source domain improves the quality of the pseudo-labels by
mitigating the confirmation bias of self-training toward common classes, (2) a
Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote
feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining. DAFormer represents a major advance
in UDA. It improves the state of the art by 10.8 mIoU for GTA-to-Cityscapes and
5.4 mIoU for Synthia-to-Cityscapes and enables learning even difficult classes
such as train, bus, and truck well. The implementation is available at

tens of thousands of images to be combined. We here present a new approach,
tailored for VLT/NaCo observations performed with the Annular Groove Phase Mask
(AGPM) coronagraph at $L'$ filter. Our pipeline aims at improving the
post-processing of the observations on two fronts: identifying the location of
the star behind the AGPM to better align the science frames and performing
frame selection. Our method relies on finding the position of the AGPM in the
sky frame observations, and correlate it with the circular aperture of the
coronagraphic mask. This relationship allows us to retrieve the location of the
AGPM in the science frames, in turn allowing us to estimate the position of the
star. In the process we also gather additional information useful for our frame
selection approach. We tested our pipeline on several targets, and find that we
improve the S/N of companions around $\beta$ Pictoris and R CrA by $24\pm3$ \%
and $117\pm11$ \% respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reductions.
The astrometry of the point sources is slightly different but remains
compatible within $3\sigma$ compared to published values. Finally, we find that
even for NaCo observations with tens of thousands of frames, frame selection
yields just marginal improvement for point sources but may improve the final
images for objects with extended emission such as disks. We proposed a novel
approach to identify the location of the star behind a coronagraph even when it
cannot easily be determined by other methods, leading to better S/N for nearby
point sources, and led a thorough study on the importance of frame selection,
concluding that the improvements are marginal in most case.

nonlinear dynamical systems, making their spectral information valuable for
understanding dynamics. However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra
and infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral
information a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven
algorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral
information of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual
dynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for
computing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from
snapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and
ResDMD, we compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with
general measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence
theorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for
chaotic systems when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the
discrete spectrum. Since our algorithms come with error control, ResDMD allows
aposteri verification of spectral quantities, Koopman mode decompositions, and
learned dictionaries. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, circle
rotations, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, and Lorenz
system. Finally, we provide kernelized variants of our algorithms for dynamical
systems with a high-dimensional state space. This allows us to compute the

used to constrain the initial density, spatial and kinematic substructure when
compared to predictions from $N$-body simulations. We search for runaway and
slower walkaway stars using $Gaia$ DR2 within 100 pc of NGC 2264, which
contains subclustered regions around higher-mass OB-stars (S Mon, IRS 1 and IRS
2). We find five runaways and nine walkaways that trace back to S Mon and six
runaways and five walkaways that trace back to IRS 1/2 based on their
3D-kinematics. We compare these numbers to a range of $N$-body simulations with
different initial conditions. The number of runaways/walkaways is consistent
with initial conditions with a high initial stellar density ($\sim$10 000
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$), a high initial amount of spatial substructure and
either a subvirial or virialised ratio for all subclusters. We also confirm the
trajectories of our ejected stars using the data from $Gaia$ EDR3, which
reduces the number of runaways from IRS 1/2 from six to four but leaves the
number of runaways from S Mon unchanged. The reduction in runaways is due to
smaller uncertainties in the proper motion and changes in the parallax/distance
estimate for these stars in $Gaia$ EDR3. We find further runaway/walkaway
candidates based on proper motion alone in $Gaia$ DR2, which could increase
these numbers once radial velocities are available. We also expect further
changes in the candidate list with upcoming $Gaia$ data releases.

circuits in the low-fidelity regime. We show that, for local noise that is
sufficiently weak and unital, correlations (measured by the linear
cross-entropy benchmark) between the output distribution $p_{\text{noisy}}$ of
a generic noisy circuit instance and the output distribution $p_{\text{ideal}}$
of the corresponding noiseless instance shrink exponentially with the expected
number of gate-level errors, as $F=\text{exp}(-2s\epsilon \pm O(s\epsilon^2))$,
where $\epsilon$ is the probability of error per circuit location and $s$ is
the number of two-qubit gates. Furthermore, if the noise is incoherent, the
output distribution approaches the uniform distribution $p_{\text{unif}}$ at
precisely the same rate and can be approximated as $p_{\text{noisy}} \approx
Fp_{\text{ideal}} + (1-F)p_{\text{unif}}$, that is, local errors are scrambled
by the random quantum circuit and contribute only white noise (uniform output).
Importantly, we upper bound the total variation error (averaged over random
circuit instance) in this approximation as $O(F\epsilon \sqrt{s})$, so the
""white-noise approximation"" is meaningful when $\epsilon \sqrt{s} \ll 1$, a
quadratically weaker condition than the $\epsilon s\ll 1$ requirement to
maintain high fidelity. The bound applies when the circuit size satisfies $s
\geq \Omega(n\log(n))$ and the inverse error rate satisfies $\epsilon^{-1} \geq
\tilde{\Omega}(n)$. The white-noise approximation is useful for salvaging the
signal from a noisy quantum computation; it was an underlying assumption in
complexity-theoretic arguments that low-fidelity random quantum circuits cannot
be efficiently sampled classically. Our method is based on a map from
second-moment quantities in random quantum circuits to expectation values of
certain stochastic processes for which we compute upper and lower bounds.

numerical simulations performed in a previous study - to 1 AU and to analyse
the effects of different background solar winds on their dynamics and structure
at Earth. We also aim to improve the understanding of why some consecutive
eruptions do not result in the expected geoeffectiveness, and how a secondary
coronal mass ejection (CME) can affect the configuration of the preceding one.
Methods: Using the 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) package of the code
MPI-AMRVAC, we numerically modeled consecutive CMEs inserted in two different
solar winds by imposing shearing motions onto the inner boundary. The initial
magnetic configuration depicts a triple arcade structure shifted southward, and
embedded into a bimodal solar wind. We compared our simulated signatures with
those of a multiple CME event in Sept 2009 using data from spacecraft around
Mercury and Earth. We computed and analysed the Dst index for all the
simulations performed. Results: The observed event fits well at 1 AU with two
of our simulations, one with a stealth CME and the other without. This
highlights the difficulty of attempting to use in situ observations to
distinguish whether or not the second eruption was stealthy, because of the
processes the flux ropes undergo during their propagation in the interplanetary
space. We simulate the CMEs propagated in two different solar winds, one slow
and another faster one. Only in the first case, plasma blobs arise in the trail
of eruptions. Interestingly, the Dst computation results in a reduced
geoeffectiveness in the case of consecutive CMEs when the flux ropes arrive
with a leading positive Bz. When the Bz component is reversed, the
geoeffectiveness increases, meaning that the magnetic reconnections with the
trailing blobs and eruptions strongly affect the impact of the arriving
interplanetary CME.

boundary towards strongly scattering materials. The results for materials with
Zener anisotropy indices A>1 show a good agreement between the theoretical and

agreement is reasonable for common structural materials with 1<A<3.2 but it
deteriorates as A increases. The wavefields and signals from FE modelling show
the emergence of very strong scattering at low frequencies for strongly
scattering materials that cannot be fully accounted for by the theoretical

is proposed by iterating the far-field Born approximation and optimising the

at 3 T and to demonstrate its feasibility to acquire artefact free images of
the central nervous system with 1 mm spatial resolution in < 200 ms. Theory and
Methods: Spiral TSE sequences with annulated spiral segmentation have been
implemented with different acquisition modes. In fixed mode the duration of
each spiral segment is fixed to fill the available acquisition time tacq. In
tangential mode, the beginning of each spiral segment is reached via a straight
tangential trajectory. Tangential mode allows faster transition and thus longer
tacq for a given echo spacing ESP, but less data points can be acquired per
acquisition interval. Alternating between spiral-in and spiral-out readout in
alternating echoes leads to a somewhat different point spread function for
off-resonant spins. Results: Images of the brain with 1 mm spatial resolution
acquired with a variable density spiral with ~45 % undersampling can be
acquired in a single shot. All acquisition modes produce comparable image
quality. Only mild artifacts in regions of strong susceptibility effects can be
observed for ESP of 10 ms and below. The use of variable flip angle schemes
allows seamless acquisition of consecutive slices and/or dynamic scans without
waiting time between consecutive acquisitions. Comparison with images acquired
at 1.5 T shows reduced susceptibility artifacts within the brain and facial
structures.. Conclusion: Single shot spiral TSE has been demonstrated to enable
highly efficient acquisition of high-resolution images of the brain in < 200 ms

requires reasoning about random variables where when one variable gets larger
(such as the number of elements hashed into one bucket), the others tend to be

example of negative dependence, a generalization of probabilistic independence
that has recently found interesting applications in algorithm design and
machine learning. Despite the usefulness of negative dependence for the
analyses of probabilistic data structures, existing verification methods cannot
establish this property for randomized programs.
  To fill this gap, we design LINA, a probabilistic separation logic for
reasoning about negative dependence. Following recent works on probabilistic
separation logic using separating conjunction to reason about the probabilistic
independence of random variables, we use separating conjunction to reason about
negative dependence. Our assertion logic features two separating conjunctions,
one for independence and one for negative dependence. We generalize the logic
of bunched implications (BI) to support multiple separating conjunctions, and
provide a sound and complete proof system. Notably, the semantics for
separating conjunction relies on a non-deterministic, rather than partial,
operation for combining resources. By drawing on closure properties for
negative dependence, our program logic supports a Frame-like rule for negative
dependence and monotone operations. We demonstrate how LINA can verify
probabilistic properties of hash-based data structures and balls-into-bins
processes.

emission and absorption components, which are often fitted manually with models
chosen on a case-by-case basis. However, it becomes very hard for a survey with
a large number of sources. In addition, when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is
low, there is a tendency to adopt an overly simplistic model, biasing the
parameters and making their uncertainties unrealistic. We developed a Bayesian
method for automatically fitting XMM-Newton AGN X-ray spectra with a consistent
and physically motivated model including all spectral components, even when the
data quality is low. An empirical model is used for the non-X-ray background.
Noninformative priors were applied on the photon index (Gamma) and the hydrogen
column density (N_H), while informative priors obtained from deep surveys were
used to marginalize the remaining parameters. We tested this method using a
realistically simulated sample of 5000 spectra reproducing typical population
properties. Spectral parameters were randomly drawn from the priors, taking the
luminosity function into account. Meaningful posterior probability density
distributions were obtained for, for instance, N_H, Gamma, and L_X, even at low
S/N, but in this case, we were unable to constrain the parameters of secondary
components such as the reflection and soft excess. As a comparison, a
maximum-likelihood approach with model selection among six models of different
complexities was also applied to this sample. We find clear failures in the
measurement of Gamma in most cases, and of N_H when the source is unabsorbed
(N_H < 10^22 cm-2). The results can hardly be used to reconstruct the parent
distributions of the spectral parameters, while our Bayesian method provides
meaningful multidimensional posteriors that will be used in a subsequent paper
to infer the population. (abridged)

performed between each step. Together with the as-grown film, this gives four
different levels of disorder. The transport scattering rate that is measured
directly in the THz experiments is an approximately linear function of the
radiation dose at all temperatures. This is consistent with a proportionate
increase in elastic scattering. In the superconducting state we find that the
relation between $T_c$, the superfluid density, and the scattering rates are
quantitatively at odds with the predictions based on the extant theory of
Abrikosov-Gorkov-like pair breaking in a dirty $d$-wave superconductor.
Increasing disorder causes only a small change in the superconducting

are the Nullstellensatz and Positivstellensatz. Over the last two decades the
basic analogous theorems for matrix and operator theory (noncommutative
variables) have emerged. This paper concerns commuting operator strategies for
nonlocal games, recalls NC Nullstellensatz which are helpful, extends these,
and applies them to a very broad collection of games. In the process it brings
together results spread over different literatures, hence rather than being
terse, our style is fairly expository.
  The main results of this paper are two characterizations, based on
Nullstellensatz, which apply to games with perfect commuting operator
strategies. The first applies to all games and reduces the question of whether
or not a game has a perfect commuting operator strategy to a question involving
left ideals and sums of squares. Previously, Paulsen and others translated the
study of perfect synchronous games to problems entirely involving a
$*$-algebra.The characterization we present is analogous, but works for all
games. The second characterization is based on a new Nullstellensatz we derive
in this paper. It applies to a class of games we call torically determined
games, special cases of which are XOR and linear system games. For these games
we show the question of whether or not a game has a perfect commuting operator
strategy reduces to instances of the subgroup membership problem and, for
linear systems games, we further show this subgroup membership characterization
is equivalent to the standard characterization of perfect commuting operator
strategies in terms of solution groups. Both the general and torically
determined games characterizations are amenable to computer algebra techniques,
which we also develop.

performance by exploiting a small clean dataset. In particular, model agnostic
meta-learning-based label correction methods further improve performance by
correcting noisy labels on the fly. However, there is no safeguard on the label
miscorrection, resulting in unavoidable performance degradation. Moreover,
every training step requires at least three back-propagations, significantly
slowing down the training speed. To mitigate these issues, we propose a robust

Employing the transition matrix makes the classifier skeptical about all the
corrected samples, which alleviates the miscorrection issue. We also introduce
a two-head architecture to efficiently estimate the label transition matrix
every iteration within a single back-propagation, so that the estimated matrix
closely follows the shifting noise distribution induced by label correction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach shows the best performance

for performing specific functionalities. The structure and topology of cities
is no exception, as it is critically important to ensure effective access to
the several resources as well as overall mobility. The present work addresses
the important subject of improving the plan of a given city through the
incorporation of avenues and other express ways such as bridges and tunnels.
More specifically, we start with the topology of a real city and consider the
incorporation of a express way between any two locations in the city, keeping
one location fixed and varying the angle of the other. The whole city area is
covered in this manner, which allows us to derive a respective energy surface
indicating the gain obtained regarding the average shortest path length for
each of the possible situations. These surfaces therefore provide a complete
picture of how much each city can be improved regarding minimal distances.
Quite distinct surfaces have been obtained for 18 considered European cities.
These surfaces are then characterized in terms of the number of local extrema
and respective spatial complexity, expressed in terms of a raggedness
measurement. Measurements are also obtained respectively to the geometry and
topology of the considered cities. It is shown that the shortest path gain
depends strongly on some of the considered measurements, especially lacunarity
and transitivity. Interestingly, the intricacy of the energy surfaces resulted
in relatively little correlation with the topological and geometrical
measurements.

recent work on real-time control of forced turbulent jets [1,2], we here assess
the effect of jet upstream conditions and nonlinearity on wave-cancellation
performance. The experiments are performed in jets with laminar and turbulent
boundary layers inside the nozzle. An open-loop campaign is first conducted, in
which the goal is to analyse the jet response to stochastic forcing with
variable bandwidth. The upstream conditions of the jet are found to have a
strong influence on the jet response. For narrow forcing bandwidths, both jets
present a clear response regime. However, in the initially-laminar jet, as
bandwidth is increased, high growth rates and transition to turbulence in the
initial region underpin the onset of nonlinear effects in jet response. In the
initially-turbulent jet, on the other hand, lower growth rates allow a linear
response regime to be maintained for a broader range of forcing parameters. As
the wave cancellation strategy is linear, reactive control is found to be more
effective in the initially turbulent jet, consistent with the results of the
open-loop analysis.

optimizer and a parameterized quantum circuit, emerges as one of the most
promising approaches for harvesting the power of quantum computers in the noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the deployment of VQAs on
contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant
noise and prohibitively slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive
supporting resources and infrastructure make quantum computers extremely keen
on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized way of building up
a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on a
single physical device which tends to introduce temporal-dependant
device-specific noise with worsening performance as time-since-calibration
grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble, which dynamically
distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices, and
adjusting the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In
addition to reduced machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide
significant speedups for VQA training. With this idea, we build a novel VQA
training framework called EQC that comprises: (i) a system architecture for
asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytic model for
assessing the quality of the returned VQA gradient over a particular device
concerning its architecture, transpilation, and runtime conditions; (iii) a
weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational contribution
according to the systems' current performance. Evaluations comprising 500K
circuit evaluations across 10 IBMQ devices using a VQE and a QAOA applications
demonstrate that EQC can attain error rates close to the most performant device
of the ensemble, while boosting the training speed by 10.5x on average (up to
86x and at least 5.2x).

vicinities and come from both, the vector and chiral multiplet contributions,
and combinations thereof. We will call these intersections vector and chiral
bits, and the complementary region bulk, and show that, in the corresponding
limit, the integrals along the infinitesimal bits include, among other
contributions, factorized products of either Chern-Simons and 3d topologically
twisted partition functions.
  In particular, we find that the leading asymptotic contribution to the index,
which comes from collecting all contributions coming from vector bits, reduces
to an average over a set of $N$ copies of three-dimensional $SU(N)$
Chern-Simons partition functions in Lens spaces $L(m,1)$ with $m>1\,$, in the

discriminative features at different granularity as well as a decoupled
spectral information, we leverage wavelet domain analysis to gain insight into
the spatial-frequency content of a morphed face. As such, instead of using

to provide a schedule that makes the decisions. This is challenging because
schedulers must anticipate the interaction between sparse formats, loop
structure, potential sparsity patterns, and the compiler itself. Automating
this decision making process stands to finally make sparse tensor compilers
accessible to end users.
  We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first automatic asymptotic
scheduler for sparse tensor programs. We provide an approach to abstractly
represent the asymptotic cost of schedules and to choose between them. We
narrow down the search space to a manageably small ""Pareto frontier"" of
asymptotically undominated kernels. We test our approach by compiling these
kernels with the TACO sparse tensor compiler and comparing them with those
generated with the default TACO schedules. Our results show that our approach
reduces the scheduling space by orders of magnitude and that the generated
kernels perform asymptotically better than those generated using the default
schedules.

principle to effectively recover image content from noisy images. Current
state-of-the-art methods use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
effectively learn the mapping from noisy to clean images. Deep denoising CNNs
manifest a high learning capacity and integrate non-local information owing to
the large receptive field yielded by numerous cascade of hidden layers.
However, deep networks are also computationally complex and require large data
for training. To address these issues, this study draws the focus on the
Self-organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) empowered by a novel
neuron model that can achieve a similar or better denoising performance with a
compact and shallow model. Recently, the concept of super-neurons has been
introduced which augment the non-linear transformations of generative neurons
by utilizing non-localized kernel locations for an enhanced receptive field
size. This is the key accomplishment which renders the need for a deep network
configuration. As the integration of non-local information is known to benefit
denoising, in this work we investigate the use of super neurons for both
synthetic and real-world image denoising. We also discuss the practical issues
in implementing the super neuron model on GPUs and propose a trade-off between
the heterogeneity of non-localized operations and computational complexity. Our
results demonstrate that with the same width and depth, Self-ONNs with super
neurons provide a significant boost of denoising performance over the networks
with generative and convolutional neurons for both denoising tasks. Moreover,
results demonstrate that Self-ONNs with super neurons can achieve a competitive

denoisers for synthetic and real-world denoising, respectively.

containing a rapidly spinning (33.08 s) white dwarf (WD). Its radio emission is
believed to be a superposition of synchrotron emitting plasmoids, because it
has a positive spectral index spanning three orders of magnitude (~2-2000 GHz)
and is unpolarized. Both characteristics are unusual for MCVs. Recently,
Thorstensen has suggested that the cataclysmic variable LAMOST
J024048.51+195226.9 (henceforth, J0240+19) is a twin of AE Aqr based on its
optical spectra. Optical photometry shows the star to be a high-inclination,
eclipsing binary with a spin period of 24.93 s, making it the fastest spinning
WD. This paper presents three hours of Very Large Array radio observations of
J0240+19. These observations show that the persistent radio emission from
J0240+19 is dissimilar to that of AE Aqr in that it shows high circular
polarization and a negative spectral index. The emission is most similar to the
nova-like CV V603 Aql. We argue that the radio emission is caused by a
superposition of plasmoids emitting plasma radiation or electron cyclotron
maser emission from the lower corona of the donor star and not from the
magnetosphere near the WD, because the latter site is expected to be modulated
at the orbital period of the binary and to show eclipses of which there is no
evidence. The radio source J0240+19, although weak (<1 mJy), is a persistent
source in a high-inclination eclipsing binary, making it a good laboratory for
studying radio emission from CVs.

but for cooler stars such as M dwarfs, the determination is much more
complicated due to forests of molecular lines that are present. Several methods
have been developed in recent years to determine accurate stellar parameters
for these cool stars ($T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 4000 K). However, significant
differences can be found at times when comparing metallicities for the same
star derived using different methods. In this work, we determine the effective
temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of 18 well-studied M dwarfs
observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph following different
approaches, including synthetic spectral fitting, analysis of pseudo-equivalent
widths, and machine learning. We analyzed the discrepancies in the derived
stellar parameters, including metallicity, in several analysis runs. Our goal
is to minimize these discrepancies and find stellar parameters that are more
consistent with the literature values. We attempted to achieve this consistency
by standardizing the most commonly used components, such as wavelength ranges,
synthetic model spectra, continuum normalization methods, and stellar
parameters. We conclude that although such modifications work quite well for
hotter main-sequence stars, they do not improve the consistency in stellar
parameters for M dwarfs, leading to mean deviations of around 50-200 K in
temperature and 0.1-0.3 dex in metallicity. In particular, M dwarfs are much
more complex and a standardization of the aforementioned components cannot be
considered as a straightforward recipe for bringing consistency to the derived
parameters. Further in-depth investigations of the employed methods would be
necessary in order to identify and correct for the discrepancies that remain.

ascertain how rotational degrees of freedom affect packing behavior. Here, we
study superballs, a large family of deformations of the sphere, defined in
three dimensions by $|x_1|^{2p}+|x_2|^{2p}+|x_3|^{2p}\leq1$, where $p>0$ is a
deformation parameter indicating to what extent the shape deviates from a
sphere. As $p$ increases from the sphere point ($p=1$), the superball attains
cubic symmetry, and attains octahedral symmetry when $p<1$. Previous
characterization of superball packings has shown that they have a maximally
random jammed (MRJ) state, whose properties (e.g., packing fraction $\phi$)
vary nonanalytically as $p$ diverges from unity. Here, we use an event-driven
molecular dynamics algorithm to produce MRJ superball packings. We characterize
their large-scale structure by examining the small-$Q$ behavior of their
structure factors and spectral densities, which indicate these packings are
effectively hyperuniform. We show that the mean width $\bar{w}$ is a useful
length scale to make distances dimensionless in order to compare systematically
superballs of different shape. We also compute the complementary cumulative
pore-size distribution $F(\delta)$ and find the pore sizes tend to decrease as
$|1-p|$ increases. From $F(\delta)$, we estimate the fluid permeability, mean
survival time, and principal diffusion relaxation time of the packings.
Additionally, we compute the diffusion spreadability and find the long-time
power-law scaling indicates these packings are hyperuniform. Our results can be

challenges. First, they do not guide us to an optimal choice of features that

model. Even if a set of trusted designs are available for training, the suspect
IP could be inherently very different from the set of trusted designs, which
may negatively impact the verification outcome. Third, these techniques only
identify a set of suspect Trojan nets that require manual intervention to

common to several previous works. Where possible, we calculate the classical

CircaCP -- to detect sleep-wake cycles from minute-by-minute actigraphy data.
It first uses a robust cosinor model to estimate circadian rhythm, then
searches for a single change point (CP) within each cycle. We used CircaCP to
estimate sleep/wake onset times (S/WOTs) from 2125 indviduals' data in the MESA
Sleep study and compared the estimated S/WOTs against self-reported S/WOT event
markers. Lastly, we quantified the biases between estimated and self-reported
S/WOTs, as well as variation in S/WOTs contributed by the two methods, using
linear mixed-effects models and variance component analysis.
  On average, SOTs estimated by CircaCP were five minutes behind those reported
by event markers, and WOTs estimated by CircaCP were less than one minute
behind those reported by markers. These differences accounted for less than
0.2% variability in SOTs and in WOTs, taking into account other sources of
between-subject variations. By focusing on the commonality in human circadian
rhythms captured by actigraphy, our algorithm transferred seamlessly from
hip-worn ActiGraph data collected from children in our previous study to
wrist-worn Actiwatch data collected from adults. The large between- and
within-subject variability highlights the need for estimating individual-level
S/WOTs when conducting actigraphy research. The generalizability of our
algorithm also suggests that it could be widely applied to actigraphy data
collected by other wearable sensors.

be well-aligned with the orbit of the planet. We furthermore find evidence for

computation whose power sits between nondeterministic branching programs and
general circuits. Despite having been studied for nearly three decades, the
first superlinear lower bound against comparator circuits was proved only
recently by G\'al and Robere (ITCS 2020), who established a $\Omega((n/\log
n)^{1.5})$ lower bound on the size of comparator circuits computing an explicit
function of $n$ bits.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of average-case complexity and circuit
analysis algorithms for comparator circuits. Departing from previous
approaches, we exploit the technique of shrinkage under random restrictions to
obtain a variety of new results for this model. Among them, we show
  - Average-case Lower Bounds. For every $k = k(n)$ with $k \geq \log n$, there
exists a polynomial-time computable function $f_k$ on $n$ bits such that, for
every comparator circuit $C$ with at most $n^{1.5}/O(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$
gates, we have \[ \text{Pr}_{x\in\left\{ 0,1
\right\}^n}\left[C(x)=f_k(x)\right]\leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{\Omega(k)}}.
\] This average-case lower bound matches the worst-case lower bound of G\'al
and Robere by letting $k=O(\log n)$.
  - #SAT Algorithms. There is an algorithm that counts the number of satisfying
assignments of a given comparator circuit with at most $n^{1.5}/O\!\left(k\cdot
\sqrt{\log n}\right)$ gates, in time $2^{n-k}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$, for any
$k\leq n/4$. The running time is non-trivial when $k=\omega(\log n)$.
  - Pseudorandom Generators and MCSP Lower Bounds. There is a pseudorandom
generator of seed length $s^{2/3+o(1)}$ that fools comparator circuits with $s$
gates. Also, using this PRG, we obtain an $n^{1.5-o(1)}$ lower bound for MCSP
against comparator circuits.

by the evolution of two phase fields that indicate the locations of segregated

driven by the driving forces that capture the physical mechanisms of ice and
crack growths respectively, while the phase field governing equations are
coupled with the balance laws such that the coupling among heat transfer, solid

extended to time-dependent problems by adopting the concept of continuous cGAN

incorporate the time domain through either element-wise addition or conditional
batch normalization. We note that this approach can accommodate other
continuous variables (e.g., Young's modulus) similar to the time domain, which
makes this framework highly flexible and extendable. Moreover, this framework
can handle training data that contain different timestamps and then predict
timestamps that do not exist in the training data. As a numerical example, the
transient response of the coupled poroelastic process is studied in two
different permeability fields: Zinn \& Harvey transformation and a bimodal

helical topological edge states. Upon the introduction of Mn into the
structure, it has been predicted to host a quantized anomalous Hall effect.
Here, we show that dilute Mn doping on InAs in InAs/GaSb, allows a tuning of
the Fermi level, the introduction of paramagnetism, but also has a non-trivial
impact on the band alignment of the system. The measurement of
Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations, cyclotron resonance, and a non-linear Hall
effect in Mn-doped samples indicate the coexistence of a high mobility
two-dimensional electron gas and a hole gas. Conversely, in undoped InAs/GaSb,
pure-n-type transport is observed. We hypothesize that Mn acceptor levels can
pin the Fermi energy near the valence band edge of InAs, far from the
interface, which introduces a strong band bending to preserve the band offset
at the InAs/GaSb interface. The realization of the QAHE in this structure will
thus require a careful control of the band alignment to preserve topological
insulating character.

the packet sizes and timing information of Internet of Things (IoT) network
traffic, we establish a rigorous event-level differential privacy (DP) model on
infinite packet streams. We propose a memoryless traffic shaping mechanism
satisfying a first-come-first-served queuing discipline that outputs traffic
dependent on the input using a DP mechanism. We show that in special cases the
proposed mechanism recovers existing shapers which standardize the output
independently from the input. To find the optimal shapers for given levels of
privacy and transmission efficiency, we formulate the constrained problem of
minimizing the expected delay per packet and propose using the expected queue
size across time as a proxy. We further show that the constrained minimization
is a convex program. We demonstrate the effect of shapers on both synthetic
data and packet traces from actual IoT devices. The experimental results reveal
inherent privacy-overhead tradeoffs: more shaping overhead provides better
privacy protection. Under the same privacy level, there naturally exists a
tradeoff between dummy traffic and delay. When dealing with heavier or less
bursty input traffic, all shapers become more overhead-efficient. We also show
that increased traffic from a larger number of IoT devices makes guaranteeing
event-level privacy easier. The DP shaper offers tunable privacy that is
invariant with the change in the input traffic distribution and has an
advantage in handling burstiness over traffic-independent shapers. This
approach well accommodates heterogeneous network conditions and enables users
to adapt to their privacy/overhead demands.

qualitatively reproduce the ratios and signs of all experimentally observed
magnetic couplings. The relative strength of all antiferromagnetic exchange
couplings, both in MnPS$_3$ as well as in NiPS$_3$, can successfully be
explained using an effective direct exchange model: they reveal that the
third-neighbor exchange dominates in NiPS$_3$ due to the filling of the
$t_{2g}$ subshell, whereas for MnPS$_3$ the first neighbor exchange is
prevailed owing to the presence of the $t_{2g}$ magnetism. On the other hand,
the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic coupling in NiPS$_3$ can only be explained
using a more complex superexchange model and is (also) largely triggered by the
absence of the $t_{2g}$ magnetism. For the doped systems, the DFT+U
calculations revealed that magnetic impurities do not affect the magnetic
ordering observed in the pure phases and thus in general in these systems
ferromagnetism may not be easily induced by such a kind of elemental doping.
However, unlike for the hosts, the first and second (dopant-host) exchange
couplings are of similar order of magnitude. This leads to frustration in case
of antiferromagnetic coupling and may be one of the reasons of the observed
lower magnetic ordering temperature of the doped systems.

tetrad in the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. Next, we separate the Dirac
equation into radial and angular sets. The angular set is solved in terms of
associated Legendre functions. With the radial set, we obtain the decoupled
radial wave equations and derive the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger wave
equations together with effective potentials. Then, we discuss the potentials
by plotting them as a function of radial distance in a physically acceptable
region. We also study the Klein-Gordon equation to compute the greybody factors
(GFs) for both bosons and fermions. The influence of the NUT parameter on the
GFs of the NUT spacetime is investigated in detail.

pivotal how these resources are used. Installed antennas and their
corresponding hardware at the Base Station (BS) are of these resources. In this
paper, we address the problem of antenna selection to minimize Cramer-Rao Lower
Bound (CRLB) of a planar antenna array when fewer antennas than total available
antennas have to be used for a UT. First, the optimal antenna selection
strategy to minimize the expected CRLB is proposed. Then, using this strategy
as a preliminary step, we present a two-stage greedy antenna selection method
whose goal is to minimize the instantaneous CRLB. The optimal start point of
the greedy algorithm is presented alongside some methods to reduce the
algorithm's computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of
proposed solutions. They demonstrate that the proposed antenna selection method
only requires a small proportion of the total available antennas to accomplish
a significant amount of the total performance, enhancing hardware utilization

search for signals of dark matter annihilation with Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes, given their high mass-to-light ratios and the fact that
they are free of astrophysical gamma-ray emitting sources. Since 2011, MAGIC
has performed a multi-year observation program in search for Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) in dSphs. Results on the observations of Segue 1 and
Ursa Major II dSphs have already been published and include some of the most
stringent upper limits (ULs) on the velocity-averaged cross-section $\langle
\sigma_{\mathrm{ann}} v \rangle$ of WIMP annihilation from observations of
dSphs. In this work, we report on the analyses of 52.1 h of data of Draco dSph
and 49.5 h of Coma Berenices dSph observed with the MAGIC telescopes in 2018
and in 2019 respectively. No hint of a signal has been detected from either of
these targets and new constraints on the $\langle \sigma_{\mathrm{ann}} v
\rangle$ of WIMP candidates have been derived. In order to improve the
sensitivity of the search and reduce the effect of the systematic uncertainties
due to the $J$-factor estimates, we have combined the data of all dSphs
observed with the MAGIC telescopes. Using 354.3 h of dSphs good quality data,
95 % CL ULs on $\langle \sigma_{\mathrm{ann}} v \rangle$ have been obtained for
9 annihilation channels. For most of the channels, these results reach values
of the order of $10^{-24} $cm$^3$/s at ${\sim}1$ TeV and are the most stringent
limits obtained with the MAGIC telescopes so far.

One critical point is whether a measurement can be regarded as an absolute

ideas from the gedankenexperiment of Wigner's friend it has been argued that,
when combined with the assumptions of locality and no-superdeterminism,
regarding a measurement as an absolute event is incompatible with the universal
validity of quantum mechanics. We consider a weaker assumption: is the
measurement event realised relatively to the observer when he only partially

simultaneously available for evaluating the effect of an intervention. The
randomized data typically allows for reliable estimation of average treatment
effects but may be limited in sample size and patient heterogeneity for
estimating conditional average treatment effects for a broad range of patients.
Estimates from the observational study can potentially compensate for these
limitations, but there may be concerns about whether confounding and treatment
effect heterogeneity have been adequately addressed. We propose an approach for
combining conditional treatment effect estimators from each source such that it
aggressively weights toward the randomized estimator when bias in the
observational estimator is detected. This allows the combination to be
consistent for a conditional causal effect, regardless of whether assumptions
required for consistent estimation in the observational study are satisfied.
When the bias is negligible, the estimators from each source are combined for
optimal efficiency. We show the problem can be formulated as a penalized least
squares problem and consider its asymptotic properties. Simulations demonstrate
the robustness and efficiency of the method in finite samples, in scenarios
with bias or no bias in the observational estimator. We illustrate the method
by estimating the effects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of
developing coronary heart disease in data from the Women's Health Initiative.

a novel manner integrates emerging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) techniques into existing Q-learning-based routing protocols and their
variants and achieves persistently higher performance across a wide range of
topology and mobility configurations. While keeping the overall protocol
structure of the Q-learning-based routing protocols, DeepCQ+ replaces
statically configured parameterized thresholds and hand-written rules with
carefully designed MADRL agents such that no configuration of such parameters
is required a priori. Extensive simulation shows that DeepCQ+ yields
significantly increased end-to-end throughput with lower overhead and no
apparent degradation of end-to-end delays (hop counts) compared to its
Q-learning based counterparts. Qualitatively, and perhaps more significantly,
DeepCQ+ maintains remarkably similar performance gains under many scenarios
that it was not trained for in terms of network sizes, mobility conditions, and
traffic dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful
application of the MADRL framework for the MANET routing problem that
demonstrates a high degree of scalability and robustness even under
environments that are outside the trained range of scenarios. This implies that
our MARL-based DeepCQ+ design solution significantly improves the performance
of Q-learning based CQ+ baseline approach for comparison and increases its
practicality and explainability because the real-world MANET environment will
likely vary outside the trained range of MANET scenarios. Additional techniques
to further increase the gains in performance and scalability are discussed.

  Algorithmic Data Compression","Submitted to Physical Review D",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is considerable interest in inflationary models with multiple inflaton
fields. The inflaton field $\boldsymbol\phi$ has a corresponding potential
function $V$, the details of which, such as the number of dimensions and shape,
are free parameters of the theory. We consider a natural hypothesis that $V$
ought to be maximally random. We realize this idea by defining $V$ as a
Gaussian random field in some number $N$ of dimensions. Given a model set of
parameters that statistically determine the shape of $V$, we repeatedly evolve
$\boldsymbol\phi$ through the end of inflation from various initial conditions,
cataloguing a representative sample of trajectories associated with that model.
In order to impose the anthropic constraint of a universe in which inflation
ends and normal expansion takes over, we impose a minimum with $V=0$ and only
consider trajectories that reach that minimum. We simulate each path evolution
stepwise through $\boldsymbol\phi$-space while simultaneously computing $V$ and
its derivatives along the path via a constrained Gaussian random process. When
$N$ is large, this method significantly reduces computational load as compared
to methods which generate the potential landscape all at once. Even so, the
covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Gamma$ of constraints on $V$ can quickly become
large and cumbersome. To solve this problem, we present data compression
algorithms to prioritize the necessary information already simulated, then keep
an arbitrarily large portion. With these optimizations, we simulate thousands
of trajectories with various parameter sets, extract tensor and scalar
perturbation spectra from each, then assemble statistical predictions of these
quantities through repeated trials. We find that the Gaussian random potential
is a highly versatile inflationary model with a rich volume of parameter space
capable of reproducing modern observations.

Instead of offering a comprehensive review of all prior work on deep image

the task of image captioning in deep learning models. The most successful deep
learning models used for image captioning follow the encoder-decoder
architecture, although there are differences in the way these models employ
attention mechanisms. Via analysis on performance results from different

Soft attention, bottom-up attention, and multi-head attention are the types of

models for image captioning. At the current time, the best results are achieved
from variants of multi-head attention with bottom-up attention.

discussion and debate about this technology. In particular, Hirsch et al. argue
that all the recently discovered superconducting hydrides are incorrect,
incorrectly interpreted, or point to BCS theory being wrong. A recent
publication regarding the RTSC discovery argues that more detailed information
about the RTSC discovery is needed. This manuscript aims to respond to this
concern by providing the raw data under question as well as providing
discussion regarding other aspects of this new RTSC for the sake of the broader
scientific community.

applications and impact in areas including environmental science, weather, and

processing is the extraction of spectral-spatial features. Leveraging on the
recent-developed graph signal processing over multilayer networks (M-GSP), this
work proposes several approaches to HSI segmentation based on M-GSP feature
extraction. To capture joint spectral-spatial information, we first customize a
tensor-based multilayer network (MLN) model for HSI, and define a MLN singular
space for feature extraction. We then develop an unsupervised HSI segmentation
method by utilizing MLN spectral clustering. Regrouping HSI pixels via
MLN-based clustering, we further propose a semi-supervised HSI classification
based on multi-resolution fusions of superpixels. Our experimental results
demonstrate the strength of M-GSP in HSI processing and spectral-spatial
information extraction.

applications in real life. High utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is
one kind of utility-driven mining. HUSPM aims to discover all sequential
patterns with high utility. However, the existing algorithms of HUSPM can not
provide an accurate probability to deal with some scenarios for prediction or
recommendation. High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) was proposed to
discover all sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. There is
only one algorithm proposed for HUSRM, which is not enough efficient. In this
paper, we propose a faster algorithm, called US-Rule, to efficiently mine
high-utility sequential rules. It utilizes rule estimated utility co-occurrence
pruning strategy (REUCP) to avoid meaningless computation. To improve the
efficiency on dense and long sequence datasets, four tighter upper bounds
(LEEU, REEU, LERSU, RERSU) and their corresponding pruning strategies (LEEUP,
REEUP, LERSUP, RERSUP) are proposed. Besides, US-Rule proposes rule estimated
utility recomputing pruning strategy (REURP) to deal with sparse datasets. At
last, a large number of experiments on different datasets compared to the
state-of-the-art algorithm demonstrate that US-Rule can achieve better
performance in terms of execution time, memory consumption and scalability.

theory. Due to the different symmetry structure of hypercubic lattices compared
to the continuum space-time, lattice correlation functions are described by
different tensor structures. Therefore, form factors describing lattice
correlation functions have, in principle, non-trivial relations with the
continuum counterparts. The use of several tensor bases respecting lattice
symmetries, and the analysis of its completeness allows to quantify the
deviations of the lattice results from the continuum theory, and also estimate
the theoretical uncertainty in the propagator. Furthermore, our analysis tests
continuum based relations with the lattice data and shows that the lattice
Landau gauge gluon propagator is suitably described by a unique form factor, as
in the continuum formulation. Additionally, we identified classes of kinematic
configurations where these deviations are minimal and the continuum description
of lattice tensors is improved.

additional workloads. This has been accomplished by augmenting the VTA
micro-architecture and instruction set architecture (ISA), as well as by
enhancing the TVM compilation stack to support a wide range of VTA configs.
  The VTA tsim implementation (CHISEL-based) has been enhanced with fully
pipelined versions of the ALU/GEMM execution units. In tsim, memory width can
now range between 8-64 bytes. Field widths have been made more flexible to
support larger scratchpads. New instructions have been added: element-wise
8-bit multiplication to support depthwise convolution, and load with a choice
of pad values to support max pooling. Support for more layers and better double
buffering has also been added.
  Fully pipelining ALU/GEMM helps significantly: 4.9x fewer cycles with minimal
area change to run ResNet-18 under the default config. Configs featuring a
further 11.5x decrease in cycle count at a cost of 12x greater area can be
instantiated. Many points on the area-performance pareto curve are shown,
showcasing the balance of execution unit sizing, memory interface width, and
scratchpad sizing. Finally, VTA is now able to run Mobilenet 1.0 and all layers

fission by propagating the nucleons independently toward scission and beyond.

naive arguments about screening electric fields in determining the value of the

exhibit chaotic behavior as evidenced by fractal basin boundaries between

real-world data and semantics. While high-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings
lead to better representations, most hyperbolic models utilize low-dimensional
embeddings, due to non-trivial optimization and visualization of
high-dimensional hyperbolic data.
  We propose CO-SNE, which extends the Euclidean space visualization tool,
t-SNE, to hyperbolic space. Like t-SNE, it converts distances between data
points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data $X$ and
low-dimensional embedding $Y$. However, unlike Euclidean space, hyperbolic
space is inhomogeneous: A volume could contain a lot more points at a location
far from the origin. CO-SNE thus uses hyperbolic normal distributions for $X$
and hyperbolic \underline{C}auchy instead of t-SNE's Student's t-distribution
for $Y$, and it additionally seeks to preserve $X$'s individual distances to
the \underline{O}rigin in $Y$.
  We apply CO-SNE to naturally hyperbolic data and supervisedly learned
hyperbolic features. Our results demonstrate that CO-SNE deflates
high-dimensional hyperbolic data into a low-dimensional space without losing
their hyperbolic characteristics, significantly outperforming popular
visualization tools such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and HoroPCA which is also
designed for hyperbolic data.

of transforming conventional radiographic reading to the stereographic

are measured at nodes $A$ and $B$, called shared phase values hereafter. Each
shared phase value is used to mask points of a Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

shared phase value. Rotation of constellation is equivalent to adding phases
modulo-$2\pi$, and as the channel phase is uniformly distributed in $[0,2\pi)$,
the result of summation conveys zero information about summands. To enlarge the
key size over a static or slow fading channel, the Radio Frequency (RF)
propagation path is perturbed to create several independent realizations of
multi-path fading, each used to share a new phase value. To eavesdrop a phase

galaxies in the eXtended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS). We focus on the
dependence of the Fall relation's slope on galaxy type and the galaxy
properties regulating its scatter. Stellar specific AM is determined by
combining single-dish H{\sc i} velocity widths and stellar mass profiles for
all H{\sc i} detections in the xGASS sample. At fixed morphology (or
bulge-to-total ratio), we find that the power law slope of the Fall relation is
consistent with 2/3. However, when all galaxy types are combined, we recover a
much shallower slope of $\sim$0.47. We show that this is a consequence of the
change in galaxy morphology as a function of mass, highlighting that caution
should be taken when using the slope of the Fall relation to constrain galaxy
formation models without taking sample selection into account. We quantify the
Fall relations scatter and show that H{\sc i} gas fraction is the strongest
correlated parameter for low stellar masses (Spearman correlation: $\rho_{s} =
0.61$), while the bulge-to-total ratio becomes slightly more dominant at higher
masses ($\rho_{s} = -0.29$). Intriguingly, when only the disc components of
galaxies are considered, H{\sc i} gas fraction remains the strongest correlated
parameter with the scatter of the relation (regardless of disc stellar mass).

subject to shearing flow. The size of the overshoot depends on the applied
shear rate and is related to relaxation mechanisms such as reptation, chain
stretch and convective constraint release. Previous experimental work shows
that melts subjected to interrupted shear flows exhibit a smaller overshoot
when sheared after partial relaxation. This has been shown to be consistent
with predictions by constitutive models. Here, we report molecular dynamics
simulations of interrupted shear of polymer melts where the shear flow after
the relaxation stage is orthogonal to the original applied flow. We observe
that, for a given relaxation time, the size of the stress overshoot under
orthogonal interrupted shear is larger than observed during parallel
interrupted shear, which is not captured by constitutive models. Differences in
maxima are also observed for overshoots in the first normal stress and chain
end-to-end distance. We also show that measurements of the average number of
entanglements per chain and average orientation at different scales along the
chain are affected by the change in shear direction, leading to non-monotonic
relaxation of the off-diagonal components of orientation and an appearance of a
'double peak' in the average number of entanglements during the transient. We
propose that such complex behavior of entanglements is responsible for the
increase in the overshoots of stress components, and that models of the
dynamics of entanglements might be improved upon by considering a tensorial
measurement of entanglements that can be coupled to orientation.

distortion as a single task of MAML. However, due to the absence of a
large-scale dataset in a distorted environment, we propose an efficient method
to generate synthetic distorted data from undistorted 2D keypoints. For the
evaluation, we assume two practical testing situations depending on whether a
motion capture sensor is available or not. In particular, we propose Inference
Stage Optimization using bone-length symmetry and consistency. Extensive
evaluation shows that our proposed method successfully adapts to various
degrees of distortion in the testing phase and outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method is useful in practice because
it does not require camera calibration and additional computations in a testing

this paper adopts the data-driven distributionally robust (DR) approach and
proposes a novel multi-period FLCP model under the $\infty$-Wasserstein joint
chance constraints (MFLCP-W). Specifically, we sequentially decide locations
from a candidate set to build facilities with supply capacities, which are
expanded if more economical, and use a finite number of historical demand
samples in chance constraints to ensure a high probability of on-time delivery.
To solve the MFLCP-W model, we equivalently reformulate it as a mixed integer
second-order cone program and then solve it by designing an effective outer
approximation algorithm with two tailored valid cuts. Finally, a case study
under hurricane threats shows that MFLCP-W outperforms its counterparts in the
terms of the cost and service quality, and that our algorithm converges
significantly faster than the commercial solver CPLEX 12.8 with a better

homological structures such as generalized persistence diagrams. Naturally,
computing these rank invariants efficiently is a prelude to computing any of
these derived structures efficiently. We show that the generalized rank over a
finite interval $I$ of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-indexed persistence module $M$ is equal
to the generalized rank of the zigzag module that is induced on a certain path
in $I$ tracing mostly its boundary. Hence, we can compute the generalized rank
over $I$ by computing the barcode of the zigzag module obtained by restricting
the bifiltration inducing $M$ to that path. If the bifiltration and $I$ have at
most $t$ simplices and points respectively, this computation takes
$O(t^\omega)$ time where $\omega\in[2,2.373)$ is the exponent of matrix
multiplication. Among others, we apply this result to obtain an improved
algorithm for the following problem. Given a bifiltration inducing a module
$M$, determine whether $M$ is interval decomposable and, if so, compute all

of cosmic rays is challenging. Based on the current understanding of
anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we use test particles to
examine the cosmic rays' superdiffusion in the direction perpendicular to the
mean magnetic field. By changing Alfven Mach number $M_A$ and sonic Mach number
$M_S$ of compressible MHD simulations, our study covers a wide range of
astrophysical conditions including subsonic warm gas phase and supersonic cold
molecular gas. We show that freely streaming cosmic rays' perpendicular
displacement increases as 3/2 to the power of the time traveled along local
magnetic field lines. This power-law index changes to 3/4 if the parallel
propagation is diffusive. We find that the cosmic rays' parallel mean free path
decreases in a power-law relation of $M_A^{-2}$ in supersonic turbulence. We
investigate the energy fraction of slow, fast, and Alfvenic modes and confirm
the dominance of Alfvenic modes in the perpendicular superdiffusion. In
particular, the energy fraction of fast mode, which is the main agent for
pitch-angle scattering, increases with $M_A$ but is insensitive to $M_S \ge 2$.
Accordingly, our results suggest that the suppressed diffusion in supersonic
molecular clouds arises primarily due to the variations of $M_A$ instead of
$M_S$.

interactions are highly sparse with respect to the feature space), label noise
(i.e., the collected user-item interactions are usually noisy), and the
underuse of domain knowledge (i.e., the pairwise correlations between samples).
To address these challenging problems, we propose a novel Multi-Interest
Self-Supervised learning (MISS) framework which enhances the feature embeddings
with interest-level self-supervision signals. With the help of two novel
CNN-based multi-interest extractors,self-supervision signals are discovered
with full considerations of different interest representations (point-wise and
union-wise), interest dependencies (short-range and long-range), and interest
correlations (inter-item and intra-item). Based on that, contrastive learning
losses are further applied to the augmented views of interest representations,
which effectively improves the feature representation learning. Furthermore,
our proposed MISS framework can be used as an plug-in component with existing
CTR prediction models and further boost their performances. Extensive
experiments on three large-scale datasets show that MISS significantly

to improve PoA of the overall network. Unfortunately, practical transportation
systems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical
approaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment.
In this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing
idiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well
as improving network efficiency using strategic information design.
Specifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a
Stackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We
model the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop
a novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social
welfare using strategic Information design (in short, LoRI). We demonstrate the
performance of LoRI on a Wheatstone network with multi-modal route choices at
the travelers. In our simulation experiments, we find that LoRI outperforms
SSSP in terms of system utility, especially when there is a motive mismatch
between the two systems and improves social welfare. For instance, we find that
LoRI persuades a traveler towards a socially optimal route for 66.66% of the
time on average, when compared to SSSP, when the system has 0.3 weight on
carbon emissions. However, we also present a tradeoff between system
performance and runtime in our simulation results.

compressed signals at the PS, we put forth an approximate minimum mean square

  Domain-specific Adaptive Framework","Accepted to Pattern Recognition (PR)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain generalization (DG) has attracted much attention in person
re-identification (ReID) recently. It aims to make a model trained on multiple
source domains generalize to an unseen target domain. Although achieving
promising progress, existing methods usually need the source domains to be
labeled, which could be a significant burden for practical ReID tasks. In this
paper, we turn to investigate unsupervised domain generalization for ReID, by
assuming that no label is available for any source domains.
  To address this challenging setting, we propose a simple and efficient
domain-specific adaptive framework, and realize it with an adaptive
normalization module designed upon the batch and instance normalization
techniques. In doing so, we successfully yield reliable pseudo-labels to
implement training and also enhance the domain generalization capability of the
model as required. In addition, we show that our framework can even be applied
to improve person ReID under the settings of supervised domain generalization
and unsupervised domain adaptation, demonstrating competitive performance with
respect to relevant methods. Extensive experimental study on benchmark datasets
is conducted to validate the proposed framework. A significance of our work
lies in that it shows the potential of unsupervised domain generalization for
person ReID and sets a strong baseline for the further research on this topic.

modify an image based on input sketches from users. Existing methods typically
formulate this task as a conditional inpainting problem, which requires users
to draw an extra mask indicating the region to modify in addition to sketches.
The masked regions are regarded as holes and filled by an inpainting model
conditioned on the sketch. With this formulation, paired training data can be
easily obtained by randomly creating masks and extracting edges or contours.
Although this setup simplifies data preparation and model design, it
complicates user interaction and discards useful information in masked regions.
To this end, we investigate a new paradigm of sketch-based image manipulation:
mask-free local image manipulation, which only requires sketch inputs from
users and utilizes the entire original image. Given an image and sketch, our
model automatically predicts the target modification region and encodes it into
a structure agnostic style vector. A generator then synthesizes the new image
content based on the style vector and sketch. The manipulated image is finally
produced by blending the generator output into the modification region of the
original image. Our model can be trained in a self-supervised fashion by
learning the reconstruction of an image region from the style vector and
sketch. The proposed method offers simpler and more intuitive user workflows
for sketch-based image manipulation and provides better results than previous
approaches. More results, code and interactive demo will be available at

remains rare because of the drawbacks of current approaches and packages. These
drawbacks include incorrect global Type I error rate, lack of power to detect

the equal local levels global testing method, which we have implemented in the

simultaneous testing bands rapidly created using recently-developed algorithms.
qqconf can easily be used to add global testing bands to Q-Q plots made by
other packages. In addition to being quick to compute, these bands have a
variety of desirable properties, including accurate global levels, equal
sensitivity to deviations in all parts of the null distribution (including the
tails), and applicability to a range of null distributions. We illustrate the
use of qqconf in several applications: assessing normality of residuals from

Unlike the water-rich geysers observed on Enceladus, Europa's geysers appear to
be an intermittent phenomenon, and the dynamical mechanism permitting water to
sporadically erupt through a kilometers-thick ice sheet is not well understood.
Here we outline and explore the hypothesis that the Europan geysers are driven
by CO$_2$ gas released by dissociation and depressurization of CO$_2$ clathrate
hydrates initially sourced from the subsurface ocean. We show that CO$_2$
hydrates can become buoyant to the upper ice-water interface under plausible
oceanic conditions, namely, if the temperature or salinity conditions of a
density-stratified two-layer water column evolve to permit the onset of
convection that generates a single mixed layer. To quantitatively describe the
eruptions once the CO$_2$ has been released from the hydrate state, we extend a
one-dimensional hydrodynamical model that draws from the literature on volcanic
magma explosions on Earth. Our results indicate that for a sufficiently high
concentration of exsolved CO$_2$, these eruptions develop vertical velocities
of $\sim$700 m s$^{-1}$. These high velocities permit the ejecta to reach
heights of $\sim$200 km above the Europan surface, thereby explaining the
intermittent presence of water vapor at these high altitudes. Molecules ejected
via this process will persist in the Europan atmosphere for a duration of about
10 minutes, limiting the timescale over which geyser activity above the Europan
surface may be observable. Our proposed mechanism requires Europa's ice shell
thickness to be d$\lesssim$ 10 km.

low temperature and high density. On the basis of the lattice perturbation
theory, a possible parameter region in which the CSC occurs has been predicted.
In this work, we perform complex Langevin simulation on an $8^3\times 128$
lattice using four-flavor staggered fermions. We find, in particular, that the
quark number has plateaux with respect to the chemical potential similar to our
previous study, indicating the formation of the Fermi sphere. A
diquark-antidiquark operator, which is an order parameter of color
superconductivity, is formulated on the lattice using the U(1) noise. Our
result for this operator is found to fluctuate violently when the Fermi surface
coincides with the energy levels of quarks. We also discuss partial restoration
of the chiral symmetry at high density.

generation tasks. However, GAN training is inherently unstable. Although many
works try to stabilize it by manually modifying GAN architecture, it requires
much expertise. Neural architecture search (NAS) has become an attractive
solution to search GANs automatically. The early NAS-GANs search only
generators to reduce search complexity but lead to a sub-optimal GAN. Some
recent works try to search both generator (G) and discriminator (D), but they
suffer from the instability of GAN training. To alleviate the instability, we
propose an efficient two-stage evolutionary algorithm-based NAS framework to
search GANs, namely EAGAN. We decouple the search of G and D into two stages,
where stage-1 searches G with a fixed D and adopts the many-to-one training
strategy, and stage-2 searches D with the optimal G found in stage-1 and adopts
the one-to-one training and weight-resetting strategies to enhance the
stability of GAN training. Both stages use the non-dominated sorting method to
produce Pareto-front architectures under multiple objectives (e.g., model size,
Inception Score (IS), and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)). EAGAN is applied
to the unconditional image generation task and can efficiently finish the
search on the CIFAR-10 dataset in 1.2 GPU days. Our searched GANs achieve
competitive results (IS=8.81$\pm$0.10, FID=9.91) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and
surpass prior NAS-GANs on the STL-10 dataset (IS=10.44$\pm$0.087, FID=22.18).

(TTC), a new algorithm for generative modelling. This algorithm eliminates the
trainable generator from a Wasserstein GAN; instead, it iteratively modifies
the source data using gradient descent on a sequence of trained critic
networks. This is motivated in part by the misalignment which we observed
between the optimal transport directions provided by the gradients of the
critic and the directions in which data points actually move when parametrized
by a trainable generator. Previous work has arrived at similar ideas from
different viewpoints, but our basis in optimal transport theory motivates the
choice of an adaptive step size which greatly accelerates convergence compared
to a constant step size. Using this step size rule, we prove an initial
geometric convergence rate in the case of source distributions with densities.
These convergence rates cease to apply only when a non-negligible set of
generated data is essentially indistinguishable from real data. Resolving the
misalignment issue improves performance, which we demonstrate in experiments
that show that given a fixed number of training epochs, TTC produces higher
quality images than a comparable WGAN, albeit at increased memory requirements.
In addition, TTC provides an iterative formula for the transformed density,
which traditional WGANs do not. Finally, TTC can be applied to map any source
distribution onto any target; we demonstrate through experiments that TTC can
obtain competitive performance in image generation, translation, and denoising
without dedicated algorithms.

prescription anomaly detection algorithm that utilizes historical data to
predict anomalous cases. Such a tool can serve as an electronic peer who will
assist the peer-review process providing extra safety to the patients. In our
primary model, we created two dissimilarity metrics, R and F. R defining how
far a new patient's prescription is from historical prescriptions. F represents
how far away a patient's feature set is from the group with an identical or
similar prescription. We flag prescription if either metric is greater than
specific optimized cut-off values. We used thoracic cancer patients (n=2356) as
an example and extracted seven features. Here, we report our testing f1 score,

this quantitative strategy as the hardware descriptor, MAPLE can generalize to

  field","accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac3df4",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Large-scale magnetic field is crucial in launching and collimating the
jets/outflows. It is found that the magnetic flux can be efficiently
transported inward by the fast moving corona above a thin disk. In this work we
investigate the dynamical structure of the outflows driven by the large-scale
magnetic field advected by the hot corona. With derived large-scale magnetic
field, the outflow solution along every field line is obtained by solving a set
of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) Equations self-consistently with boundary
conditions at the upper surface of the corona. We find that the terminal speeds
of the outflows driven from the inner region of the disk are $\sim 0.01c-0.1c$.
The temperatures of the outflows at the large distance from the black hole are
still as high as several ten keV. The properties of the magnetic outflows
derived in this work are roughly consistent with the fast outflows detected in
some luminous quasars and X-ray binaries. The total mass loss rate in the
outflows from the corona is about $7\%-12\%$ of the mass accretion rate of the
disk. The three dimension field geometry, the velocity, temperature and density
of the outflows derived in this work can be used for calculating the emergent
spectra and their polarization of the accretion disk/corona/outflow systems.
Our results may help understand the features of the observed spectra of X-ray
binaries and active galactic nuclei.

Space Telescope. In comparison with the canonical iron template object I Zw 1,
Mrk 493 has narrower broad-line widths, lower reddening, and a less extreme
Eddington ratio, making it a superior choice for template construction. We
carried out a multicomponent spectral decomposition to produce a template
incorporating all permitted and forbidden lines of Fe II identified in the Mrk
493 spectrum over this wavelength range, as well as lines from Ti II, Ni II,
and Cr II. We tested the template by fitting it to AGN spectra spanning a broad
range of iron emission properties, and we present a detailed comparison with
fits using other widely used monolithic and multi-component iron emission
templates. The new template generally provides the best fit (lowest $\chi^2$)
compared to other widely used monolithic empirical templates. In addition, the
new template yields more accurate spectral measurements including a
significantly better match of the derived Balmer line profiles (H$\beta$,
H$\gamma$, H$\delta$), in contrast with results obtained using the other

introduce a systematic bias in measurements of the H$\beta$ line width, which
consequently impacts single-epoch black hole mass estimates by $\sim0.1$ dex on

applications in urban development and expansion estimation. Nevertheless,
conventional methods either only utilized the limited information of aerial

thus cannot well recognize unconstrained roads. To facilitate this problem, we
introduce a novel neural network framework termed Cross-Modal Message
Propagation Network (CMMPNet), which fully benefits the complementary different
modal data (i.e., aerial images and crowdsourced trajectories). Specifically,
CMMPNet is composed of two deep Auto-Encoders for modality-specific
representation learning and a tailor-designed Dual Enhancement Module for
cross-modal representation refinement. In particular, the complementary
information of each modality is comprehensively extracted and dynamically
propagated to enhance the representation of another modality. Extensive
experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
CMMPNet for robust road extraction benefiting from blending different modal

following question: can we perturb any discrete-time sequential stochastic
control problem by adding some arbitrarily small additive (e.g. Gaussian or
otherwise) noise to the measurements to make the system measurements absolutely
continuous, so that a change-of-measure (or static reduction) can be applicable

stochastic (single-agent or decentralized multi-agent) problems $\epsilon$-away

also note that the solution and the cost obtained for the perturbed system is
realizable (under a randomized policy) for the original model.

high-capacity wireless communication systems by constructing favorable channels

outage analysis for IRS-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is
not available in the literature. In this paper, we first characterize the
mutual information (MI) of IRS-aided MIMO systems by capitalizing on large
random matrix theory (RMT). Based on this result, a closed-form approximation
for the outage probability is derived and a gradient-based algorithm is
proposed to minimize the outage probability with statistical channel state
information (CSI). We also investigate the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
(DMT) with the finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on these theoretical
results, we further study the impact of the IRS size on system performance. In
the high SNR regime, we provide closed-form expressions for the ergodic mutual
information (EMI) and outage probability as a function of the IRS size, which
analytically reveal that the benefit of increasing the IRS size saturates
quickly. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis
and confirm the increasing cost for deploying larger IRSs to improve system
performance. For example, for an IRS-aided MIMO system with 20 antennas at both

from missing modalities seen during training. This approach is used with HRNet
to enable single modality inference for in-bed pose estimation. Through
extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that body positions can be effectively
recognized from the available modality, achieving on par results with baseline

interactions become irrelevant at long distances. At strong couplings, based on
previous studies, we argue that our lattice model contains two different
massive fermion phases with different mechanisms of fermion mass generation. In
one phase, fermions become massive through Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)
via the formation of a fermion bilinear condensate. In the other phase, fermion
mass arises through a more exotic mechanism without the formation of any
fermion bilinear condensate. Our lattice model is free of sign problems and can
be studied using the fermion bag algorithm. The longer term goal here is to
study both these mass generation phenomena in a single model and understand how
different phases come together.

multidimensional continuous signals, overcoming many drawbacks associated with
discrete grid-based approximations. However, coordinate-MLPs with ReLU
activations, in their rudimentary form, demonstrate poor performance in
representing signals with high fidelity, promoting the need for positional
embedding layers. Recently, Sitzmann et al. proposed a sinusoidal activation
function that has the capacity to omit positional embedding from
coordinate-MLPs while still preserving high signal fidelity. Despite its
potential, ReLUs are still dominating the space of coordinate-MLPs; we
speculate that this is due to the hyper-sensitivity of networks -- that employ
such sinusoidal activations -- to the initialization schemes. In this paper, we
attempt to broaden the current understanding of the effect of activations in
coordinate-MLPs, and show that there exists a broader class of activations that
are suitable for encoding signals. We affirm that sinusoidal activations are
only a single example in this class, and propose several non-periodic functions
that empirically demonstrate more robust performance against random
initializations than sinusoids. Finally, we advocate for a shift towards
coordinate-MLPs that employ these non-traditional activation functions due to
their high performance and simplicity.

$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ nanowires along [110] direction (growing direction) with

More specifically, an angular-dependent thermal conductivity is observed, due
to the magnetic field induced movement of magnetic domain wall. The angle
corresponding to the maximum of thermal conductivity varies near the Morin
transition temperature, due to the different magnetic easy axis as suggested by
our calculation based on magnetic anisotropy energy. This angular dependence of

the number of iterations as a means to reduce the overall running time. In this

numerical simulations (DNS) to identify mechanisms for oblique transition in a
Mach 5 hypersonic flow over an adiabatic slender double-wedge. Even though the
laminar separated flow is globally stable, resolvent analysis demonstrates
significant amplification of unsteady external disturbances to the linearized
flow equations. These disturbances are introduced upstream of the separation
zone and they lead to the appearance of oblique waves further downstream. We
demonstrate that large amplification of oblique waves arises from the growth of
fluctuation shear stress due to streamline curvature of the laminar base flow
in the separated shear layer. This is in contrast to the attached boundary
layers, where no such mechanism exists. We also use a weakly nonlinear analysis
to show that the resolvent operator associated with linearization around the
laminar base flow governs the evolution of steady reattachment streaks that
arise from quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves. These quadratic
interactions generate vortical excitations in the reattaching shear layer which
lead to the formation of streaks in the recirculation zone and their subsequent
amplification, breakdown, and transition to turbulence downstream. Our analysis
of the energy budget shows that deceleration of the base flow near reattachment
is primarily responsible for amplification of steady streaks. Finally, we
employ DNS to examine latter stages of transition to turbulence and demonstrate
the predictive power of a weakly nonlinear input-output framework in uncovering
triggering mechanisms for oblique transition in separated high-speed boundary
layer flows.

formation of star clusters. Recent studies have shown that ONC has three
distinct age populations and anisotropy in velocity dispersions, which are key
characteristics for understanding the formation history of the ONC. In this
study, we perform a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics/$N$-body simulation of star
cluster formation from a turbulent molecular cloud. In this simulation, stellar
orbits are integrated using a high-order integrator without gravitational
softening; therefore, we can follow the collisional evolution of star clusters.
We find that hierarchical formation causes episodic star formation that is
observed in the ONC. In our simulation, star clusters evolve due to mergers of
subclumps. The mergers bring cold gas with the clumps into the forming cluster.
This enhances the star formation in the cluster centre. The dense cold gas in
the cluster centre continues to form stars until the latest time. This explains
the compact distribution of the youngest stars observed in the ONC. Subclump
mergers also contribute to the anisotropy in the velocity dispersions and the
formation of runaway stars. However, the anisotropy disappears within 0.5 Myr.
The virial ratio of the cluster also increases after a merger due to the
runaways. These results suggest that the ONC recently experienced a clump
merger. We predict that most runaways originated from the ONC have already been
found, but walkaways have not.

However, the cost of creating a high-quality multi-camera tracking dataset with

view using camera parameters to create 2D tracking results. Then, we manually
check and correct the 3D tracking results to ensure the label quality, which is
much cheaper than fully manual annotation. We have conducted extensive

popularity. Recent work points out that for SVR, most cutting-edge NNs have
limited performance on reconstructing unseen objects because they rely
primarily on recognition (i.e., classification-based methods) rather than shape
reconstruction. To understand this issue in depth, we provide a systematic
study on when and why NNs prefer recognition to reconstruction and vice versa.
Our finding shows that a leading factor in determining recognition versus
reconstruction is how dispersed the training data is. Thus, we introduce the
dispersion score, a new data-driven metric, to quantify this leading factor and
study its effect on NNs. We hypothesize that NNs are biased toward recognition
when training images are more dispersed and training shapes are less dispersed.
Our hypothesis is supported and the dispersion score is proved effective
through our experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets. We show that the
proposed metric is a principal way to analyze reconstruction quality and
provides novel information in addition to the conventional reconstruction
score.

  Different Users",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper,
we consider the scenario where a model is distributed to multiple buyers, among
which a malicious buyer attempts to attack another buyer. The malicious buyer
probes its copy of the model to search for adversarial samples and then
presents the found samples to the victim's copy of the model in order to
replicate the attack. We point out that by distributing different copies of the
model to different buyers, we can mitigate the attack such that adversarial
samples found on one copy would not work on another copy. We observed that
training a model with different randomness indeed mitigates such replication to
a certain degree. However, there is no guarantee and retraining is
computationally expensive. A number of works extended the retraining method to
enhance the differences among models. However, a very limited number of models
can be produced using such methods and the computational cost becomes even
higher. Therefore, we propose a flexible parameter rewriting method that
directly modifies the model's parameters. This method does not require
additional training and is able to generate a large number of copies in a more
controllable manner, where each copy induces different adversarial regions.
Experimentation studies show that rewriting can significantly mitigate the
attacks while retaining high classification accuracy. For instance, on GTSRB
dataset with respect to Hop Skip Jump attack, using attractor-based rewriter
can reduce the success rate of replicating the attack to 0.5% while
independently training copies with different randomness can reduce the success
rate to 6.5%. From this study, we believe that there are many further
directions worth exploring.

walking-motion-adaptive leg kinematic constraints that change with body motion
for localization of quadruped robots, is proposed. Quadruped robots primarily
use VIO because they require fast localization for control and path planning.
However, since quadruped robots are mainly used outdoors, extraneous features
extracted from the sky or ground cause tracking failures. In addition, the
quadruped robots' walking motion cause wobbling, which lowers the localization
accuracy due to the camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU). To overcome
these limitations, many researchers use VIO with leg kinematic constraints.
However, since the quadruped robot's walking motion varies according to the
controller, gait, quadruped robots' velocity, and so on, these factors should
be considered in the process of adding leg kinematic constraints. We propose
VIO that can be used regardless of walking motion by adjusting the leg
kinematic constraint factor. In order to evaluate WALK-VIO, we create and
publish datasets of quadruped robots that move with various types of walking
motion in a simulation environment. In addition, we verified the validity of
WALK-VIO through comparison with current state-of-the-art algorithms.

components of the optical emission. After the end of the prompt gamma-ray
emission, we observed the afterglow rise slowly in the optical and
near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and peak at around T+1450s in all filters. This
was followed by an early decay, a clear plateau from T+5000s to T+11000s, and
then a regular late decay. We also present evidence of the jet break at later

most fundamental problems in online optimization. Let $M$ be an $n$-point
metric space. Consider a resource that can be allocated in arbitrary fractions
to the points of $M$. At each time $t$, a convex monotone cost function $c_t:
[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}_+$ appears at some point $r_t\in M$. In response, an
algorithm may change the allocation of the resource, paying movement cost as
determined by the metric and service cost $c_t(x_{r_t})$, where $x_{r_t}$ is
the fraction of the resource at $r_t$ at the end of time $t$. For example, when
the cost functions are $c_t(x)=\alpha x$, this is equivalent to randomized MTS,
and when the cost functions are $c_t(x)=\infty\cdot 1_{x<1/k}$, this is
equivalent to fractional $k$-server.
  We give an $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm for weighted star metrics. Due
to the generality of allowed cost functions, classical multiplicative update
algorithms do not work for the metric allocation problem. A key idea of our
algorithm is to decouple the rate at which a variable is updated from its
value, resulting in interesting new dynamics. This can be viewed as running
mirror descent with a time-varying regularizer, and we use this perspective to
further refine the guarantees of our algorithm. The standard analysis
techniques run into multiple complications when the regularizer is
time-varying, and we show how to overcome these issues by making various
modifications to the default potential function.
  We also consider the problem when cost functions are allowed to be
non-convex. In this case, we give tight bounds of $\Theta(n)$ on tree metrics,
which imply deterministic and randomized competitive ratios of $O(n^2)$ and
$O(n\log n)$ respectively on arbitrary metrics. Our algorithm is based on an
$\ell_2^2$-regularizer.

can be employed to the existing state-of-the-art generators without modifying
the network architecture. To reveal the superiority of GConv, this paper
provides extensive experiments using various standard datasets including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN-Church, CelebA, and tiny-ImageNet. Quantitative
evaluations prove that GConv significantly boosts the performances of the
unconditional and conditional GANs in terms of Inception score (IS) and Frechet
inception distance (FID). For example, the proposed method improves both FID
and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 35.13 to 29.76 and 20.23 to

peculiarities: an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio due to single-shot
measurements, and a high dimensionality due to the high number of spectra
acquired for imaging. This is all the truer as lateral resolution gets higher:
in this case, the ablation spot diameter is reduced, as well as the ablated
mass and the emission signal, while the number of spectra for a given surface
increases. Therefore, efficient extraction of physico-chemical information from
a noisy and large dataset is a major issue. Multivariate approaches were
introduced by several authors as a means to cope with such data, particularly
Principal Component Analysis. This technique is useful to analyse correlations
between different elements, but it is limited to low signal-to-noise ratios. In
this paper, we introduce HyperPCA, a new analysis tool for hyperspectral images
based on a sparse representation of the data using Discrete Wavelet Transform
and kernel-based sparse PCA to reduce the impact of noise on the data and to
consistently extract the spectroscopic signal, with a particular emphasis on
LIBS data. The method is first illustrated using simulated LIBS mapping
datasets to emphasise its performances with an extremely low shot-to-shot
signal-to-noise ratio, and with a variable degree of spectral interference.
Comparisons to standard PCA and to traditional univariate data analyses are
provided. Finally, it is used to process real data in two cases that clearly

PlantStereo contains 812 image pairs covering a diverse set of plants: spinach,
tomato, pepper and pumpkin. We firstly evaluated our PlantStereo dataset on
four different stereo matching methods. Extensive experiments on different
models and plants show that compared with ground truth in integer accuracy,
high accuracy disparity images provided by PlantStereo can remarkably improve
the training effect of deep learning models. This paper provided a feasible and

across various computer vision tasks, thanks to their competence in modeling
long-range dependencies of image patches or tokens via self-attention. These
models, however, usually designate the similar receptive fields of each token
feature within each layer. Such a constraint inevitably limits the ability of
each self-attention layer in capturing multi-scale features, thereby leading to
performance degradation in handling images with multiple objects of different
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic strategy, termed
shunted self-attention~(SSA), that allows ViTs to model the attentions at
hybrid scales per attention layer. The key idea of SSA is to inject
heterogeneous receptive field sizes into tokens: before computing the
self-attention matrix, it selectively merges tokens to represent larger object
features while keeping certain tokens to preserve fine-grained features. This
novel merging scheme enables the self-attention to learn relationships between
objects with different sizes and simultaneously reduces the token numbers and
the computational cost. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the superiority of SSA. Specifically, the SSA-based transformer achieves 84.0\%
Top-1 accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art Focal Transformer on
ImageNet with only half of the model size and computation cost, and surpasses
Focal Transformer by 1.3 mAP on COCO and 2.9 mIOU on ADE20K under similar
parameter and computation cost. Code has been released at

infer the planet mass from radio dust continuum images. Substructures induced
by young planets in protoplanetary disks can be used to infer the potential
young planets' properties. Hydrodynamical simulations have been used to study
the relationships between the planet's properties and these disk features.
However, these attempts either fine-tuned numerical simulations to fit one
protoplanetary disk at a time, which was time-consuming, or azimuthally
averaged simulation results to derive some linear relationships between the gap
width/depth and the planet mass, which lost information on asymmetric features
in disks. To cope with these disadvantages, we developed Planet Gap neural
Networks (PGNets) to infer the planet mass from 2D images. We first fit the
gridded data in Zhang et al. (2018) as a classification problem. Then, we
quadrupled the data set by running additional simulations with near-randomly
sampled parameters, and derived the planet mass and disk viscosity together as
a regression problem. The classification approach can reach an accuracy of
92\%, whereas the regression approach can reach 1$\sigma$ as 0.16 dex for
planet mass and 0.23 dex for disk viscosity. We can reproduce the degeneracy
scaling $\alpha$ $\propto$ $M_p^3$ found in the linear fitting method, which
means that the CNN method can even be used to find degeneracy relationship. The
gradient-weighted class activation mapping effectively confirms that PGNets use
proper disk features to constrain the planet mass. We provide programs for
PGNets and the traditional fitting method from Zhang et al. (2018), and discuss
each method's advantages and disadvantages.

while it requires a long acquisition time. To reduce the acquisition time,
various methods have been proposed. However, these methods failed to
reconstruct images with a clear structure for two main reasons. Firstly,
similar patches widely exist in MR images, while most previous deep
learning-based methods ignore this property and only adopt CNN to learn local
information. Secondly, the existing methods only use clear images to constrain
the upper bound of the solution space, while the lower bound is not
constrained, so that a better parameter of the network cannot be obtained. To
address these problems, we propose a Contrastive Learning for Local and Global
Learning MRI Reconstruction Network (CLGNet). Specifically, according to the
Fourier theory, each value in the Fourier domain is calculated from all the
values in Spatial domain. Therefore, we propose a Spatial and Fourier Layer
(SFL) to simultaneously learn the local and global information in Spatial and
Fourier domains. Moreover, compared with self-attention and transformer, the
SFL has a stronger learning ability and can achieve better performance in less
time. Based on the SFL, we design a Spatial and Fourier Residual block as the
main component of our model. Meanwhile, to constrain the lower bound and upper
bound of the solution space, we introduce contrastive learning, which can pull
the result closer to the clear image and push the result further away from the
undersampled image. Extensive experimental results on different datasets and
acceleration rates demonstrate that the proposed CLGNet achieves new
state-of-the-art results.

network is trained under a semi-supervised setting with perturbation
consistency regularization (SPCR). The regularization works by enforcing an
invariance of the bounding box predictions over different perturbations applied
to the input point clouds, to provide self-supervision for network learning.
For stage two, the bounding box proposals with SPCR are grouped into some
subsets, and the instance masks are mined inside each subset with a novel
semantic propagation module and a property consistency graph module. Moreover,
we introduce a novel occupancy ratio guided refinement module to refine the
instance masks. Extensive experiments on the challenging ScanNet v2 dataset

We show that the tightly wound main spiral arms in the N-body model can be
successfully identified using overdensities in angular momentum (AM) or guiding
space, as well as in the distribution of dynamically cold stars close to their
guiding centers. Stars in the AM overdensities that travel over many kpc in
radius trace extended density ridges in RVphi space and overdensities in the UV
plane of a SNd-like region, similar to those observed in the Gaia data.
Similarly, the AM space of the MW contains several overdensities which
correlate with a wave-like radial velocity pattern; this pattern is also
reproduced by stars well beyond the SNd. We find that the fraction of Gaia
stars located near their guiding centers shows three large-scale structures
that approximately coincide with the MW spiral arms traced by distributions of
maser sources in the Sagittarius, Local, and Perseus arms. Similar to the
model, the stars in the AM overdensities follow the main RVphi ridges. When
these ridges cross the SNd, they can be matched with the main UV features. Thus
we suggest that the Hat is the inner tail of the Perseus arm, one of the
Hercules components is the Sagittarius arm and the Arcturus stream is likely to
be the outermost tail of the Scutum-Centaurus arm. Based on previous work, the
bar corotation is suggested to coincide with the Hercules stream, and the OLR
with the Sirius stream. The latter is supported by a sharp decrease of the mean
metallicity beyond the Sirius stream, which is an expected behaviour of the
OLR. In various phase-space coordinates the AM overdensities stars have
systematically higher mean metallicity...(Abridged)

engineering, medicine, chemical and food industries due to their unique
photocatalytic and biocidal properties. NPs may generate reactive oxygen
species and, hence, have the toxic effect on the living cells via oxidative
stress. An external UV irradiation may magnify the photocatalytic properties of
$TiO_{2}$ NPs. In this regard, we have analyzed the influence of $TiO_{2}$ NPs
on the conformation and thermal stability of native DNA in a buffer solution
without and under UV irradiation exploiting absorption spectroscopy with DNA
thermal denaturation in the range of 20-94 degrees Celsius. Upon DNA heating
from about 25 to 44 degrees Celsius, we have observed the stabilization of DNA
duplex in the presence of $TiO_{2}$ NPs. This additional biopolymer
stabilization indicates that partial DNA unwinding appears as a result of the
direct binding of the biopolymer to NPs. We showed that the performed UV
treatment of DNA during 3 hours leads to partial unwinding of the biopolymer
structure. The NPs injection to the biopolymer solution induced the additional
effect on the DNA thermal stability under UV irradiation. The performed
analysis of the experimental data suggests that the nature of the impact of NPs
on the biopolymer is complex.

grow by accretion of single pebble species. The growing planet may reach the
so-called pebble isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that
blocks inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling core
growth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic simulations, pebble
filtration by the pressure bump depends on several parameters including core
mass, disc structure, turbulent viscosity and pebble size. We investigated how
accretion of multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth
rates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on turbulent viscosity
and pebble size sets the final core masses. We performed numerical simulations
in viscous 1D disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth,
fragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates and final
core masses are sensitive to three key parameters: threshold velocity at which
pebbles fragment on collision, turbulent viscosity and distribution of pebble
species, which yield a diversity of planetary cores. With accretion of multiple
pebble species, planetary cores can grow pretty fast, reaching over 30 -- 40

numerical tables with associated uncertainty estimation, as well as analytical
formulae that can be directly implemented into stellar evolution codes. This
article further describes the impact of these new rates on C-burning in stars.
We determine reaction rates for two cross-section extrapolation models: one
based on the fusion-hindrance phenomenon, and the other on fusion-hindrance
plus a resonance, and compare our results to previous data. Using the GENEC
stellar evolution code, we study how these new rates impact the C-burning
phases in two sets of stellar models for stars with 12 M$_{\odot}$ and 25
M$_{\odot}$ initial masses chosen to be highly representative of the diversity
of massive stars. The effective temperatures of C-burning in both sets of
stellar models are entirely covered by the sensitivity of the present
experimental data, and no extrapolation of the rates is required. Although, the
rates may differ by more than an order of magnitude for temperatures typical of
C-burning, the impacts on the stellar structures during that phase remain
modest. This is a consequence of the readjustment of the stellar structure to a
change of nuclear reaction rate for reactions important for energy production.
For the hindrance case, the C-burning phase is found to occur at central
temperatures 10\% higher than with the hindrance plus resonance rate. Its
C-burning lifetime is reduced by a factor of two. This model, nevertheless,
loses more entropy than the other one thus enters earlier into the degeneracy
regime which will impact the last stages of the evolution at the pre-core
collapse time. The hindrance model produces up to 60% more neon. The impact of
the different rates on the s-process occurring during the C-burning phase is
modest, changing final abundances of s-processed elements by at most 20%
(cobalt).

dynamical phase transition with different boundary conditions in a ring from
AdS/CFT correspondence. According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, quenching the
system across the critical point to symmetry-breaking phase will result in
topological defects -- winding numbers -- in a compact ring. By setting two
different boundary conditions, i.e., Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
for the spatial component of the gauge fields in the AdS boundary, we achieve
the holographic superfluid and holographic superconductor models, respectively.
In the final equilibrium state, different configurations of the order parameter
phases for these two models indicate a persistent superflow in the holographic
superfluid, however, the holographic superconductor lacks this superflow due to
the existence of local gauge fields. The two-point correlation functions of the
order parameter also behave differently. In particular, for holographic
superfluid the correlation function is a cosine function depending on the
winding number. The correlation function for the holographic superconductor,
however, decays rapidly at short distances and vanishes at long distance, due
to the random localities of the gauge fields. These results are consistent with
our theoretical analysis.

covariates and mediators simultaneously. We provide the efficient influence
functions and the corresponding semiparametric efficiency bounds that hold
under these assumptions, and their combinations. We demonstrate that neither of
the identification models provides uniformly the most efficient estimation and
give conditions under which some bounds are lower than others. We show when
semiparametric estimating equation estimators based on influence functions
attain the bounds, and study the robustness of the estimators to
misspecification of the nuisance models. The theory is complemented with
simulation experiments on the finite sample behavior of the estimators. The
results obtained are relevant for an analyst facing a choice between several
plausible identifying assumptions and corresponding estimators. Our results
show that this choice implies a trade-off between efficiency and robustness to
misspecification of the nuisance models.

quality using coordinate-based neural scene representations. However, NeRF's
view dependency can only handle simple reflections like highlights but cannot
deal with complex reflections such as those from glass and mirrors. In these
scenarios, NeRF models the virtual image as real geometries which leads to
inaccurate depth estimation, and produces blurry renderings when the multi-view
consistency is violated as the reflected objects may only be seen under some of
the viewpoints. To overcome these issues, we introduce NeRFReN, which is built
upon NeRF to model scenes with reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a
scene into transmitted and reflected components, and model the two components
with separate neural radiance fields. Considering that this decomposition is
highly under-constrained, we exploit geometric priors and apply
carefully-designed training strategies to achieve reasonable decomposition
results. Experiments on various self-captured scenes show that our method
achieves high-quality novel view synthesis and physically sound depth
estimation results while enabling scene editing applications.

of X-ray spectral parameters of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in large surveys.
The method uses the probability distribution function (PDF) of posteriors
obtained by fitting a consistent physical model to each object with a Bayesian
method. The PDFs are often broadly distributed and may present systematic
biases, such that naive point estimators or even some standard parametric
modeling are not sufficient to reconstruct the parent population without
obvious bias. Our method uses a transfer function computed from a large
realistic simulation with the same selection as in the actual sample to
redistribute the stacked PDF and then forward-fit a nonparametric model to it
in a Bayesian way, so that the biases in the PDFs are properly taken into
account. In this way, we are able to accurately reconstruct the parent
distributions. We apply our spectral fitting and population inference methods
to the XMM-COSMOS survey as a pilot study. For the 819 AGN detected in the
COSMOS field, 663 (8%) of which have spectroscopic redshifts (spec-z) and the
others high-quality photometric redshifts (photo-z), we find prominent
bi-modality with widely separated peaks in the distribution of the absorbing
hydrogen column density (N_H) and an indication that absorbed AGN have harder
photon indices. A clear decreasing trend of the absorbed AGN fraction versus
the intrinsic 2-10keV luminosity is observed, but there is no clear evolution
in the absorbed fraction with redshift. Our method is designed to be readily
applicable to large AGN samples such as the XXL survey, and eventually eROSITA.

network reconstruction from partial information, which have been devised for

treat all pairs of nodes as potentially interacting, thereby overestimating the

of the model, being related to the entropy, proxies the rewiring capability of

addition, weight information plays a significant role in dynamic information

Firstly, fuzzy semantic integration, DFPILTS definition, its preference

Then, a fuzzy linguistic Markov matrix with its network is developed. Then, a
weight determination method based on distance measure and information entropy
to reducing the inconsistency of DFPILPR and obtain collective priority vector

is developed, and an optimal investment case from a financial risk is used to

information about the solar atmosphere structure and temperature. The solar
radius increases as the observation at radio frequency decreases, indicating
that each emission originates higher in the atmosphere. Thus, different layers
of the solar atmosphere can be probed by observing at multiple wavelengths. In
this work, we determined the average radius and limb brightening at 100, 212,
230, and 405 GHz, using data from the Solar Submillimeter Telescope and ALMA's
single-dish observations. For the first time, limb brightening values for
frequencies of 212 and 405 GHz were estimated. At sub-THz frequencies, the
observed limb brightening may affect the solar radius measurements. We use two
different and well known approaches to determine the radius: the half-power
method and the inflection-point method. We investigate how the antenna beam
size and the limb brightening level, LB, can affect the radius measurements
using both methods. Our results showed that the inflection-point method is the
least affected by these parameters, and should thus be used for solar radius
estimates at radio wavelengths. The measured average radii are 968""~$\pm$~3""
(100 GHz), 963""~$\pm$~3"" (212 GHz), 963""~$\pm$~2"" (230 GHz), and 963""~$\pm$~5""

the solar disk resulting in 5%-19% (100 GHz), 2%-12% (212 GHz), 6%-18% (230

text recognition. This paper introduces a novel method, called Multi-modAl Text

identifies visual and semantic feature pairs and encodes spatial information

Furthermore, MATRN stimulates combining semantic features into visual features
by hiding visual clues related to the character in the training phase. Our

seven benchmarks with large margins, while naive combinations of two modalities
show less-effective improvements. Further ablative studies prove the

A wide range of
planetary climate systems involve understanding non-dilute condensable
substances and their influence on climate dynamics. There has been progress on
large-scale dynamical effects and on 1D convection parameterization, but
resolved 3D moist convection remains unexplored in non-dilute conditions,
though it can have a profound impact on temperature/humidity profiles and cloud
structure. We tackle this problem for pure-steam atmospheres using
three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of convection in
post-runaway atmospheres where the water reservoir at the surface has been
exhausted. We show that the atmosphere is comprised of two characteristic
regions, an upper condensing region dominated by gravity waves and a lower
noncondensing region characterized by convective overturning cells. Velocities
in the condensing region are much smaller than those in the lower noncondensing
region, and the horizontal temperature variation is small overall. Condensation
in the thermal photosphere is largely driven by radiative cooling and tends to
be statistically homogeneous. Some condensation also happens deeper, near the
boundary of the condensing region, due to triggering by gravity waves and
convective penetrations and exhibit random patchiness. This qualitative
structure is insensitive to varying model parameters, but quantitative details
may differ. Our results confirm theoretical expectations that atmospheres close
to the pure-steam limit do not have organized deep convective plumes in the
condensing region. The generalized convective parameterization scheme discussed
in Ding & Pierrehumbert (2016) is appropriate to handle the basic structure of
atmospheres near the pure-steam limit but is difficult to capture gravity waves
and their mixing that appear in 3D convection-resolving models.

  Recognition using Graph Representation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Video-based automatic depression analysis provides a fast, objective and
repeatable self-assessment solution, which has been widely developed in recent
years. While depression clues may be reflected by human facial behaviours of
various temporal scales, most existing approaches either focused on modelling
depression from short-term or video-level facial behaviours. In this sense, we
propose a two-stage framework that models depression severity from multi-scale
short-term and video-level facial behaviours. The short-term depressive
behaviour modelling stage first deep learns depression-related facial
behavioural features from multiple short temporal scales, where a Depression
Feature Enhancement (DFE) module is proposed to enhance the depression-related
clues for all temporal scales and remove non-depression noises. Then, the
video-level depressive behaviour modelling stage proposes two novel graph
encoding strategies, i.e., Sequential Graph Representation (SEG) and Spectral
Graph Representation (SPG), to re-encode all short-term features of the target
video into a video-level graph representation, summarizing depression-related
multi-scale video-level temporal information. As a result, the produced graph
representations predict depression severity using both short-term and long-term
facial beahviour patterns. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014
datasets show that the proposed DFE module constantly enhanced the depression
severity estimation performance for various CNN models while the SPG is
superior than other video-level modelling methods. More importantly, the result
achieved for the proposed two-stage framework shows its promising and solid
performance compared to widely-used one-stage modelling approaches.

However, the rising granularity and refinements of the human emotional spectrum
through novel psychological theories and the increased consideration of
emotions in context brings considerable pressure to data collection and
labeling work. In this paper, we conceptualize one-shot recognition of emotions
in context -- a new problem aimed at recognizing human affect states in finer
particle level from a single support sample. To address this challenging task,
we follow the deep metric learning paradigm and introduce a multi-modal emotion
embedding approach which minimizes the distance of the same-emotion embeddings
by leveraging complementary information of human appearance and the semantic
scene context obtained through a semantic segmentation network. All streams of
our context-aware model are optimized jointly using weighted triplet loss and
weighted cross entropy loss. We conduct thorough experiments on both,
categorical and numerical emotion recognition tasks of the Emotic dataset
adapted to our one-shot recognition problem, revealing that categorizing human
affect from a single example is a hard task. Still, all variants of our model
clearly outperform the random baseline, while leveraging the semantic scene

low-level utility functions to describe physical processes relevant to
synchrotron sources, which are written in C for performance and parallelised

which goals to pursue. We review nature's solution to the time allocation
problem, which is based on a continuously readjusted categorical weighting
mechanism we experience introspectively as emotions. One observes
phylogenetically that the available number of emotional states increases hand
in hand with the cognitive capabilities of animals and that raising levels of
intelligence entail ever larger sets of behavioral options. Our ability to
experience a multitude of potentially conflicting feelings is in this view not
a leftover of a more primitive heritage, but a generic mechanism for
attributing values to behavioral options that can not be specified at birth. In
this view, emotions are essential for understanding the mind.
  For concreteness, we propose and discuss a framework which mimics emotions on
a functional level. Based on time allocation via emotional stationarity (TAES),
emotions are implemented as abstract criteria, such as satisfaction, challenge
and boredom, which serve to evaluate activities that have been carried out. The
resulting timeline of experienced emotions is compared with the `character' of
the agent, which is defined in terms of a preferred distribution of emotional
states. The long-term goal of the agent, to align experience with character, is
achieved by optimizing the frequency for selecting individual tasks. Upon
optimization, the statistics of emotion experience becomes stationary.

applications, e.g., understanding the global structure, or identifying
central/critical nodes, of a network. A malicious attacker with jamming ability
can exploit the vulnerability of the k-core structure to attack the network and
invalidate the network analysis methods, e.g., reducing the k-shell values of
nodes can deceive graph algorithms, leading to the wrong decisions. In this
paper, we investigate the robustness of the k-core structure under adversarial
attacks by deleting edges, for the first time. Firstly, we give the general
definition of targeted k-core attack, map it to the set cover problem which is
NP-hard, and further introduce a series of evaluation metrics to measure the
performance of attack methods. Then, we propose $Q$ index theoretically as the
probability that the terminal node of an edge does not belong to the innermost
core, which is further used to guide the design of our heuristic attack
methods, namely COREATTACK and GreedyCOREATTACK. The experiments on a variety
of real-world networks demonstrate that our methods behave much better than a
series of baselines, in terms of much smaller Edge Change Rate (ECR) and False
Attack Rate (FAR), achieving state-of-the-art attack performance. More
impressively, for certain real-world networks, only deleting one edge from the
k-core may lead to the collapse of the innermost core, even if this core
contains dozens of nodes. Such a phenomenon indicates that the k-core structure
could be extremely vulnerable under adversarial attacks, and its robustness
thus should be carefully addressed to ensure the security of many graph
algorithms.

previously extended to the bilingual setting. A fundamental modeling assumption
in several of these extensions is that the input corpora are in the form of
document pairs whose constituent documents share a single topic distribution.
However, this assumption is strong for comparable corpora that consist of
documents thematically similar to an extent only, which are, in turn, the most
commonly available or easy to obtain. In this paper we relax this assumption by
proposing for the paired documents to have separate, yet bound topic
distributions. % a binding mechanism between the distributions of the paired

mechanism by extending two topic models: a bilingual adaptation of LDA that
assumes bag-of-words inputs and a model that incorporates part of the text

assess the performance of the novel topic models we conduct intrinsic and
extrinsic experiments on five bilingual, comparable corpora of English

leads us to explicit formulae for the probability density function (PDF) of the

confirm that the PDFs feature heavy, exponential tails, with an additional
cubic suppression in the case of the curvature perturbation. The large-mass end

stochastic-contamination effects, which produce black holes more massive than

Substantial studies have found that radiative-mode AGNs primarily reside in

this study, through S{\'e}rsic profile fitting and non-parametric morphological
parameter measurements, we investigated the morphology of host galaxies of 485
optical variability-selected low luminosity AGNs at $z\lesssim4.26$ in the
COSMOS field. We analyzed high-resolution images of the Hubble Space Telescope
to measure these morphological parameters. We only successfully measured the
morphological parameters for 76 objects and most AGN hosts ($\sim70\%$) were
visually compact point-like sources. We examined the obtained morphological
information as a function of redshift and compared them with literature data.
We found that these AGN host galaxies showed no clear morphological preference.
However, the merger rate increased with the higher hosts' SFRs and AGN
luminosity. Interestingly, we found ongoing star formation consistent with the
typical star forming populations in both elliptical and spiral galaxies while
these two types of galaxies were more symmetric than normal star forming
galaxies. These results suggested that optical variability-selected AGNs have}
higher probabilities to reside in elliptical galaxies than infrared-selected
AGNs (IR-AGNs), whose host galaxies had a strong disk-dominance, and supported
recent studies that the AGN feedback could enhance star forming activities in
host galaxies.

  Mn-Cr chronometry","Accepted for publication in Geochemical Perspective Letters",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Magmatic iron meteorite groups such as IIAB, IIIAB and IVA, represent the
largest sampling of extraterrestrial core material from the earliest accreted
distinct planetary bodies in the solar system. Chromium isotope compositions of
chromite/daubreelite from seven samples, translated into 53Cr/52Cr model ages,
provide robust time information on planetary core formation. These ages range
within 1.5 Ma after formation of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) and
define the time of metal core formation in the respective parent bodies,
assuming metal-silicate separation was an instantaneous event that induced
strong chemical fractionation of Mn from the more siderophile Cr. The early
core formation ages support accretion and differentiation of the magmatic iron
meteorite parent bodies to have occurred prior to the chondrule formation
interval. The calibration of Mn-Cr ages with established Hf-W ages of samples
from the same magmatic iron meteorite groups constrains the initial E53Cr of
the solar system to -0.30, and thus lower than previously estimated.

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a general one-dimensional centered
Gaussian process $(G_t)_{t\ge 0}$. The second order mixed partial derivative of
the covariance function $ R(t,\, s)=\mathbb{E}[G_t G_s]$ can be decomposed into
two parts, one of which coincides with that of fractional Brownian motion and
the other is bounded by $(ts)^{H-1}$ with $H\in (\frac12,\,1)$, up to a
constant factor.
  In this paper, we investigate the same problem but with the assumption of
$H\in (0,\,\frac12)$. It is well known that there is a significant difference
between the Hilbert space associated with the fractional Gaussian processes in
the case of $H\in (\frac12, 1)$ and that of $H\in (0, \frac12)$. The starting
point of this paper is a new relationship between the inner product of
$\mathfrak{H}$ associated with the Gaussian process $(G_t)_{t\ge 0}$ and that
of the Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}_1$ associated with the fractional Brownian
motion $(B^{H}_t)_{t\ge 0}$. Then we prove the strong consistency with $H\in
(0, \frac12)$, and the asymptotic normality and the Berry-Ess\'{e}en bounds
with $H\in (0,\frac38)$ for both the least squares estimator and the moment
estimator of the drift parameter constructed from the continuous observations.
A good many inequality estimates are involved in and we also make use of the
estimation of the inner product based on the results of $\mathfrak{H}_1$ in Hu,
Nualart and Zhou 2019.

during software development. Ignoring values can lead to values violations in
software that can result in financial losses, reputation damage, and widespread
social and legal implications. However, embedding human values in software is
not only non-trivial but also generally an unclear process. Commencing as early
as during the Requirements Engineering (RE) activities promises to ensure
fit-for-purpose and quality software products that adhere to human values. But
what is the impact of considering human values explicitly during early RE
activities? To answer this question, we conducted a scenario-based survey where
56 software practitioners contextualised requirements analysis towards a
proposed mobile application for the homeless and suggested values-laden
software features accordingly. The suggested features were qualitatively
analysed. Results show that explicit considerations of values can help
practitioners identify applicable values, associate purpose with the features
they develop, think outside-the-box, and build connections between software
features and human values. Finally, drawing from the results and experiences of
this study, we propose a scenario-based values elicitation process -- a simple
four-step takeaway as a practical implication of this study.

utilize Angle Diversity Transmitters (ADTs) mounted on the room ceiling to
facilitate inter-rack communication. Two different optical receiver types are
considered, namely Angle Diversity Receivers (ADRs) and Wide Field-of-View

in reciprocal space, namely an asymmetry in the conduction band population left
after the laser excitation. However, the corresponding real-space perspective
has not been explored so far although it could yield knowledge about the atomic
origin of the macroscopic currents. In this work, by adapting the

to the light-induced changes of charge densities. The atomic-scale currents
flow dominantly through the network of the {\pi} bonds and are the strongest at
the bonds parallel to the field polarization, where an increase of the charge
density is observed. The real-space maps of the currents and changes in charge

encoding and image reconstruction. For the neural spike encoding task, the
features derived from a specific hidden layer of the encoder are transformed by
a mapping function to predict the ground-truth neural response under the
constraint of image reconstruction. Simultaneously, for the image
reconstruction task, the latent representation obtained by the encoder is
assigned to a decoder to restore the original image under the guidance of
neural information. In DAE-NR, the learning process of encoder, mapping
function and decoder are all implicitly constrained by these two tasks. Our
experiments demonstrate that if and only if with the joint learning, DAE-NRs
can improve the performance of visual image reconstruction and increase the

examine charmonium-like states with hidden charm and quark content
$c\bar{c}q\bar{q}$, open-charm states with quark content $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}$ and
all-charm states with $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$. In particular we study the internal
competition between meson-meson components and diquark-antidiquark components
in the wave functions of these states. Our results indicate that the
$\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and the $Z_c(3900)$ are predominantly $D\bar D^*$ states and
that the recently discovered open-charm state $T_{cc}^+$ is dominated by an
internal $DD^*$ component. In both cases the diquark components are negligible.
For the all-charm state $X(6900)$ with as yet unknown quantum numbers we
identify candidates in the excitation spectra of $0^+$ and $1^+$ states.
Furthermore, our framework serves to provide predictions for further, yet
undiscovered open and hidden charm four-quark states.

scalar field in a one-dimensional cavity with a time dependent boundary
condition that can be externally controlled to perform and extract work
unitarily from the system. We study the performance of this machine when acting
as a heat engine as well as a refrigerator. It is shown that, in a
non-adiabatic regime, the efficiency of the quantum cycle is affected by the
dynamical Casimir effect, that induces a sort of quantum friction that
diminishes the efficiency. We also find regions of parameters where the effect
is so strong that the machine can no longer function as an engine since the
work that would be produced is completely consumed by the quantum friction.
However, this effect can be avoided for some particular temporal evolutions of
the boundary conditions that do not change the occupation number of the modes
in the cavity, leading to a highly improved efficiency.

  Drop","12 figures, 23 pages",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern deep learning (DL) architectures are trained using variants of the SGD
algorithm that is run with a $\textit{manually}$ defined learning rate
schedule, i.e., the learning rate is dropped at the pre-defined epochs,
typically when the training loss is expected to saturate. In this paper we
develop an algorithm that realizes the learning rate drop
$\textit{automatically}$. The proposed method, that we refer to as AutoDrop, is
motivated by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters,
i.e., the velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed
learning rate initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft
saturation. At saturation the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity
saturation is a good indicator for dropping the learning rate. After the drop,
the angular velocity ""resets"" and follows the previously described pattern - it
increases again until saturation. We show that our method improves over SOTA
training approaches: it accelerates the training of DL models and leads to a
better generalization. We also show that our method does not require any extra
hyperparameter tuning. AutoDrop is furthermore extremely simple to implement
and computationally cheap. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework for
analyzing our algorithm and provide convergence guarantees.

control and coordinate smart devices in order to manage assets and resources,
and to guarantee efficient behaviours. For this class of systems, which
interact extensively with humans and with their environment, it is thus crucial
to guarantee their correct behaviour in order to avoid unexpected and possibly
dangerous situations. In this paper we will present a framework that allows us
to measure the robustness of systems. This is the ability of a program to
tolerate changes in the environmental conditions and preserving the original
behaviour. In the proposed framework, the interaction of a program with its
environment is represented as a sequence of random variables describing how
both evolve in time. For this reason, the considered measures will be defined
among probability distributions of observed data. The proposed framework will
be then used to define the notions of adaptability and reliability. The former
indicates the ability of a program to absorb perturbation on environmental
conditions after a given amount of time. The latter expresses the ability of a
program to maintain its intended behaviour (up-to some reasonable tolerance)
despite the presence of perturbations in the environment. Moreover, an
algorithm, based on statistical inference, it proposed to evaluate the proposed
metric and the aforementioned properties. Throughout the paper, two case
studies are used to the describe and evaluate the proposed approach.

existence of the utility of local governments. This paper refers to this

and intractable problems in big data computing has been shifted. Sublinear
time, rather than polynomial time, has recently been regarded as the new
standard of tractability in big data computing. This change brings the demand
for new methodologies in computational complexity theory in the context of big
data. Based on the prior work for sublinear-time complexity classes
\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/GaoLML20}, this paper focuses on sublinear-time
reductions specialized for problems in big data computing. First, the
pseudo-sublinear-time reduction is proposed and the complexity classes
\Pproblem and \PsT are proved to be closed under it. To establish
\PsT-intractability for certain problems in \Pproblem, we find the first
problem in $\Pproblem \setminus \PsT$. Using the pseudo-sublinear-time
reduction, we prove that the nearest edge query is in \PsT but the algebraic

processing models and is rapidly gaining popularity in many vision tasks.
Recently, self-supervised pretraining has shown to outperform supervised
pretraining for many downstream vision applications, marking a milestone in the
area. This superiority is attributed to the negative impact of incomplete
labelling of the training images, which convey multiple concepts, but are
annotated using a single dominant class label. Although Self-Supervised
Learning (SSL), in principle, is free of this limitation, the choice of pretext
task facilitating SSL is perpetuating this shortcoming by driving the learning
process towards a single concept output. This study aims to investigate the
possibility of modelling all the concepts present in an image without using
labels. In this aspect the proposed SSL frame-work MC-SSL0.0 is a step towards
Multi-Concept Self-Supervised Learning (MC-SSL) that goes beyond modelling
single dominant label in an image to effectively utilise the information from
all the concepts present in it. MC-SSL0.0 consists of two core design concepts,
group masked model learning and learning of pseudo-concept for data token using
a momentum encoder (teacher-student) framework. The experimental results on
multi-label and multi-class image classification downstream tasks demonstrate
that MC-SSL0.0 not only surpasses existing SSL methods but also outperforms
supervised transfer learning. The source code will be made publicly available

propose an end-to-end method for autonomous racing that takes in as inputs
video information from an onboard camera and determines final steering and
throttle control actions. We use the following split to construct such a method
(1) learning a low dimensional representation of the scene, (2) pre-generating
the optimal trajectory for the given scene, and (3) tracking the predicted
trajectory using a classical control method. In learning a low-dimensional
representation of the scene, we use intermediate representations with a novel
unsupervised trajectory planner to generate expert trajectories, and hence
utilize them to directly predict race lines from a given front-facing input
image. Thus, the proposed algorithm employs the best of two worlds - the
robustness of learning-based approaches to perception and the accuracy of
optimization-based approaches for trajectory generation in an end-to-end
learning-based framework. We deploy and demonstrate our framework on CARLA, a

spectrum, detailed modelling of the physical state and accurate radiative
transfer solution schemes are required. In the analysis of stellar spectra, the
numerical model often needs to account for binary companions and 3D structures
in the stellar envelopes. The enigmatic binary (or multiple) system LB-1
constitutes a perfect example of such a complex multi-D problem. Aims: To
improve our understanding of the LB-1 system, we directly modelled the
phase-dependent H-alpha line profiles of this system. To this end, we developed
a multi-purpose binary-object spectral-synthesis code in 3D (BOSS-3D). Methods:
BOSS-3D calculates synthetic line profiles for a given state of the
circumstellar material. The standard pz-geometry commonly used for single stars
is extended by defining individual coordinate systems for each involved object
and by accounting for the appropriate coordinate transformations. The code is
then applied to the LB-1 system, considering two main hypotheses, a binary
containing a stripped star and Be star, or a B star and a black hole with a
disc. Results: Comparing these two scenarios, neither model can reproduce the
detailed phase-dependent shape of the H-alpha line profiles. A satisfactory
match with the observations, however, is obtained by invoking a disc around the
primary object in addition to the Be-star disc or the black-hole accretion
disc. Conclusions: The developed code can be used to model synthetic line
profiles for a wide variety of binary systems, ranging from transit spectra of
planetary atmospheres, to post-asymptotic giant branch binaries including
circumstellar and circumbinary discs and massive-star binaries with stellar
winds and disc systems. For the LB-1 system, our modelling provides strong
evidence that each object in the system contains a disc-like structure.

improve the noise figure in the circuit as efficiently as possible. The results
indicated the possibility of reaching the noise figure around 0.009 dB for a
unique design of the circuit operating at 10 K. Unlike the traditional way,
herein, the circuit is analyzed using quantum mechanical theory to analyze the

which quantities the design should focus on to optimize the noise figure. For
instance, the circuit gain power as a critical quantity dependent on the

directly affected. Finally, merging quantum theory with engineering approaches
leads to designing a highly efficient circuit for strongly minimizing noise

standing challenge for various engineering and atmospheric boundary-layer
flows. In this paper, we address this challenge by utilizing a stochastic
one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model. ODT aims to resolve all relevant scales
of a turbulent flow for a one-dimensional domain. Here ODT is applied to
turbulent channel flow as stand-alone tool. The ODT domain is a wall-normal
line that is aligned with the mean shear. The free model parameters are
calibrated once for the turbulent velocity boundary layer at a fixed Reynolds
number. After that, we use ODT to investigate the Schmidt ($Sc$), Reynolds
($Re$), and Peclet ($Pe$) number dependence of the scalar boundary-layer
structure, turbulent fluctuations, transient surface fluxes, mixing, and
transfer to a wall. We demonstrate that the model is able to resolve relevant
wall-normal transport processes across the turbulent boundary layer and that it
captures state-space statistics of the surface scalar-flux fluctuations. In
addition, we show that the predicted mean scalar transfer, which is quantified
by the Sherwood ($Sh$) number, self-consistently reproduces established scaling
regimes and asymptotic relations. For high asymptotic $Sc$ and $Re$, ODT
results fall between the Dittus--Boelter, $Sh\sim Re^{4/5}\,Sc^{2/5}$, and

Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods with strong domain adaptability,
i.e., the ability to recognize the Micro-Expressions (MEs) of different
subjects captured by different imaging devices in different scenes. The
development of CDMER is faced with two key problems: 1) the severe feature
distribution gap between the source and target databases; 2) the feature
representation bottleneck of ME such local and subtle facial expressions. To
solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel Transfer Group Sparse
Regression method, namely TGSR, which aims to 1) optimize the measurement and
better alleviate the difference between the source and target databases, and 2)
highlight the valid facial regions to enhance extracted features, by the
operation of selecting the group features from the raw face feature, where each
region is associated with a group of raw face feature, i.e., the salient facial
region selection. Compared with previous transfer group sparse methods, our
proposed TGSR has the ability to select the salient facial regions, which is
effective in alleviating the aforementioned problems for better performance and
reducing the computational cost at the same time. We use two public ME
databases, i.e., CASME II and SMIC, to evaluate our proposed TGSR method.
Experimental results show that our proposed TGSR learns the discriminative and
explicable regions, and outperforms most state-of-the-art
subspace-learning-based domain-adaptive methods for CDMER.

in terms of the phase-independent effective Hamiltonian and the complementary

construct a flow generator that prevents the appearance of additional Fourier

By analysing the SCUBA-2 data with self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations to

$\mu$m-selected submillimeter sources around all the four ELANe, by a factor of

the excessive number of submillimeter sources are likely to be part of the

the ELAN fields. If the current form of the underlying count models continues

that the Slug-DSFG and UM287 appear low in both gas fraction and gas-to-dust

inverter-based generation (IBG) and proposes a sufficient stability criterion.
In low-inertia grids, transient interactions are induced between the
electromagnetic dynamics of the IBG and the electromechanical dynamics of the
synchronous generator (SG) under a fault. For this, a hybrid IBG-SG system is
established and a delta-power-frequency model is developed. Based on this
model, new mechanisms of transient instability different from those of
conventional power systems from the energy perspective are discovered. First,
two loss-of-synchronization (LOS) types are identified based on the relative
power imbalance owing to the mismatch between the inertia of the IBG and SG
under a fault. Second, the relative angle and frequency will jump at the moment
of a fault, thus affecting the system energy. Third, the cosine damping
coefficient induces a positive energy dissipation, thereby contributing to the
system stability. A unified criterion for identifying the two LOS types is
proposed using the energy function method. This criterion is proved to be a
sufficient stability condition for addressing the effects of the jumps and
cosine damping coefficient on the system stability. The new mechanisms and
effectiveness of the criterion are verified based on simulation results.

conditions, employing the configurations of 1802.05243, while valence quarks
are regularised using nonperturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions with
chirally rotated Schr\""odinger functional boundary conditions ($\chi$SF). Our
result is compatible with its SF counterpart of ref.1802.05243, confirming the
universality of $\chi$SF and SF in the continuum limit. We also establish the
optimal tuning strategy for the critical hopping parameter $\kappa_c$ and the
$\chi$SF boundary counterterm coefficient $z_{\rm f}$. We work in two energy
regimes with two different definitions of the coupling: SF-coupling for 2 GeV
$\lessapprox\mu\lessapprox M_W$ and GF-coupling for $\Lambda_{QCD}
\lessapprox\mu\lessapprox 2 GeV$.

discovery of the valley selective optical population of either $K_{+}$ or $

incoming light. We use group theoretical selection rules, as well as ab initio
DFT calculations, to investigate whether this valence/conduction valley
selectivity effect is also present in x-ray optical transitions from a core
level of the metal atom to the valence and conduction band $K$ valleys. Valley
selectivity is predicted for $s$, $p_{1/2}$ and $p_{3/2}$ edges in transitions
to and from the valence band edges with circularly polarised radiation.
Possible novel applications to the diagnostics of valleytronic properties and
intervalley dynamics are investigated and the feasibility of time-resolved

correlations have often been employed, not only to model photochemical events,
but also to provide reference values for vertical transition energies, hence
allowing to benchmark lower-order models. In this category, both CASPT2 and
NEVPT2 are certainly popular, the latter presenting the advantage of not
requiring the application of the empirical
ionization-potential-electron-affinity (IPEA) and level shifts. However, the
actual accuracy of these multiconfigurational approaches is not settled yet. In
this context, to assess the performances of these approaches the present work
relies on highly-accurate ($\pm 0.03$ eV) \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ vertical
transition energies for 284 excited states of diverse character (174 singlet,
110 triplet, 206 valence, 78 Rydberg, 78 $n \to \pi^*$, 119 $\pi \to \pi^*$,
and 9 double excitations) determined in 35 small- to medium-sized organic
molecules containing from three to six non-hydrogen atoms. The CASPT2
calculations are performed with and without IPEA shift and compared to the
partially-contracted (PC) and strongly-contracted (SC) variants of NEVPT2. We
find that both CASPT2 with IPEA shift and PC-NEVPT2 provide fairly reliable
vertical transition energy estimates, with slight overestimations and mean
absolute errors of $0.11$ and $0.13$ eV, respectively. These values are found
to be rather uniform for the various subgroups of transitions. The present work
completes our previous benchmarks focussed on single-reference wave function
methods (\textit{J.~Chem. Theory Comput.} \textbf{14}, 4360 (2018);
\emph{ibid.}, \textbf{16}, 1711 (2020)), hence allowing for a fair comparison
between various families of electronic structure methods. In particular, we
show that ADC(2), CCSD, and CASPT2 deliver similar accuracies for excited
states with a dominant single-excitation character.

initiate ""a multiwavelength study of ELAN environments"" (AMUSE$^2$) focusing on
the ELAN around the $z\sim3$ quasar SDSS J1040+1020, a.k.a. the Fabulous ELAN.

and 2mm observations and compare them to previously published VLT/MUSE data.
The continuum and line detections enable a first estimate of the star-formation
rates, dust, stellar and molecular gas masses in four objects associated with
the ELAN (three AGNs and one Ly$\alpha$ emitter), confirming that the quasar
host is the most star-forming (${\rm SFR}\sim500$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) and
massive galaxy ($M_{\rm star}\sim10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the system, and thus
can be assumed as central. All four embedded objects have similar molecular gas
reservoirs ($M_{\rm H_2}\sim10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), resulting in short depletion
time scales. This fact together with the estimated total dark-matter halo mass,
$M_{\rm DM}=(0.8-2)\times10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, implies that this ELAN will
evolve into a giant elliptical galaxy. Consistently, the constraint on the
baryonic mass budget for the whole system indicates that the majority of
baryons should reside in a massive warm-hot reservoir (up to $10^{12}$
M$_{\odot}$), needed to complete the baryons count. Additionally, we discuss
signatures of gas infall on the compact objects as traced by Ly$\alpha$
radiative transfer effects and the evidence for the alignment between the
satellites' spins and their directions to the central.

achieved huge progress in the contig-level assembly, but it is still
challenging to assemble large contigs into chromosomes with available Hi-C
scaffolding software, which all compute the contact value between contigs using
the Hi-C links from the whole contig regions. As the Hi-C links of two adjacent
contigs concentrate only at the neighbor ends of the contigs, larger contig
size will reduce the power to differentiate adjacent (signal) and non-adjacent
(noise) contig linkages, leading to a higher rate of mis-assembly.
  Results: We present a software package EndHiC, which is suitable to assemble
large contigs (> 1-Mb) into chromosomal-level scaffolds, using Hi-C links from
only the contig end regions instead of the whole contig regions. Benefiting
from the increased signal to noise ratio, EndHiC achieves much higher
scaffolding accuracy compared to existing software LACHESIS, ALLHiC, and
3D-DNA. Moreover, EndHiC has few parameters, runs 10-1000 times faster than
existing software, needs trivial memory, provides robustness evaluation, and
allows graphic viewing of the scaffold results. The high scaffolding accuracy
and user-friendly interface of EndHiC, liberate the users from labor-intensive
manual checks and revision works.

treating both structures at equal footing (i.e., employing the same
computational supercell and k grid sampling), our RPA+rSE calculations show
that, at zero temperature, the FCC structure is lower in energy than the HCP
structure over a wide pressure range. The influence of zero-point energy (ZPE)
is also studied and and it is found that ZPE only plays a secondary role in
determining the relative stability of the two structures, whereas the electron
correlation effect dominates. We further examine the equation of states in the
high pressure regime, and our RPA+rSE results, complemented with phonon
contributions, show excellent agreement with available experimental data.
Finally, by computing the Gibbs free energies for both the FCC and HCP at
different temperatures, we are able to generate a $T$-$P$ phase diagram for the

attention has been paid to the more practical continual learning scenario in
which new categories of nodes (e.g., new research areas in citation networks,
or new types of products in co-purchasing networks) and their associated edges
are continuously emerging, causing catastrophic forgetting on previous
categories. Existing methods either ignore the rich topological information or
sacrifice plasticity for stability. To this end, we present Hierarchical
Prototype Networks (HPNs) which extract different levels of abstract knowledge
in the form of prototypes to represent the continuously expanded graphs.
Specifically, we first leverage a set of Atomic Feature Extractors (AFEs) to
encode both the elemental attribute information and the topological structure
of the target node. Next, we develop HPNs to adaptively select relevant AFEs
and represent each node with three levels of prototypes. In this way, whenever
a new category of nodes is given, only the relevant AFEs and prototypes at each
level will be activated and refined, while others remain uninterrupted to
maintain the performance over existing nodes. Theoretically, we first
demonstrate that the memory consumption of HPNs is bounded regardless of how
many tasks are encountered. Then, we prove that under mild constraints,
learning new tasks will not alter the prototypes matched to previous data,
thereby eliminating the forgetting problem. The theoretical results are
supported by experiments on five datasets, showing that HPNs not only
outperform state-of-the-art baseline techniques but also consume relatively
less memory.

Galactic halo, whose properties are a matter of debate. For example, previous
studies do not necessarily agree on the chemical abundances of Sequoia stars,
which are important for understanding its nature. Aim: We characterize the
chemical properties of a sample of stars from Sequoia by determining
high-precision abundances. Methods: We measure abundances of Na, Mg, Si, Ti,
Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba from a differential abundance analysis on high
signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution spectra from new observations and from
archival data. We compare precisely-measured chemical abundances of 12 Sequoia
candidates with those of typical halo stars from literature, which include also
stars from Gaia-Enceladus. This allows us to characterize Sequoia and compare
it to another Galactic building block. The comparison is made after putting all
the abundances onto the same scale using standard stars. Results: There are
significant difference in [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and
[Y/Fe] between Sequoia and Gaia-Enceladus stars at $-1.8\lesssim
[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.4$ in the sense that these abundance ratios are
lower in Sequoia. These differences are similar to those seen between
Gaia-Enceladus and in-situ stars at higher metallicity, suggesting that Sequoia
is affected by type~Ia supernovae at lower metallicity than Gaia-Enceladus. We
also confirm that the low [Mg/Fe] of Sequoia is seen in literature and in
surveys, namely APOGEE DR16 and GALAH DR3, if the stars are kinematically
selected in the same way. Conclusion: Sequoia stars have a distinct chemical
abundance pattern and can be chemically separated from in-situ stars or
Gaia-Enceladus stars if abundances are measured with sufficient precision,
namely $\sigma([\mathrm{X/Fe}])\lesssim 0.07\,\mathrm{dex}$.

  nonlinear primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithms","15 pages",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Logistic regression is a widely used statistical model to describe the
relationship between a binary response variable and predictor variables in data
sets. It is often used in machine learning to identify important predictor
variables. This task, variable selection, typically amounts to fitting a
logistic regression model regularized by a convex combination of $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_{2}^{2}$ penalties. Since modern big data sets can contain hundreds of
thousands to billions of predictor variables, variable selection methods depend
on efficient and robust optimization algorithms to perform well.
State-of-the-art algorithms for variable selection, however, were not
traditionally designed to handle big data sets; they either scale poorly in
size or are prone to produce unreliable numerical results. It therefore remains
challenging to perform variable selection on big data sets without access to
adequate and costly computational resources. In this paper, we propose a
nonlinear primal-dual algorithm that addresses these shortcomings.
Specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm that provably computes a
solution to a logistic regression problem regularized by an elastic net penalty
in $O(T(m,n)\log(1/\epsilon))$ operations, where $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ denotes
the tolerance and $T(m,n)$ denotes the number of arithmetic operations required
to perform matrix-vector multiplication on a data set with $m$ samples each
comprising $n$ features. This result improves on the known complexity bound of
$O(\min(m^2n,mn^2)\log(1/\epsilon))$ for first-order optimization methods such
as the classic primal-dual hybrid gradient or forward-backward splitting
methods.

detect a $2.96\sigma$ deviation between the observations and simulations at $N

observe a high deviation between the observation and simulations in the number
of loops at $FWHM = 320'$, at a low dimensionless threshold $\nu = -2.5$, for
the NPIPE dataset. Under a Gaussian assumption, this would amount to a
deviation of $\sim 4\sigma$ . However, the distribution in this bin is
manifestly non-Gaussian and does not obey Poisson statistics either. In the
absence of a true theoretical understanding, we simply note that the
significance is higher than what may be resolved by $600$ simulations. The
FFP10 dataset, indicates a $2.77\sigma$ deviation at this resolution and
threshold. The Euler characteristic reflects the deviations in the components
and loops. To assess the significance of combined levels for a given scale, we
employed the empirical and theoretical versions of the $\chi^2$ test as well as
the nonparametric Tukey depth test. Although all statistics exhibit a stable
distribution, we favor the empirical version of the $\chi^2$ test in the final
interpretation, as it indicates the most conservative differences. Even though
both datasets exhibit mild to significant discrepancies, they also exhibit
contrasting behaviors at various instances. Therefore, we do not find it
feasible to convincingly accept or reject the null hypothesis. Disregarding the
large-scale anomalies that persist at similar scales in WMAP and Planck,
observations of the cosmic microwave background are largely consistent with the
standard cosmological model within $2\sigma$.

minimization of the cross-entropy during training, as it promotes the predicted
softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments. This yields a
pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than
the remaining activations. Recent evidence from the literature suggests that
loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of
predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. We provide a
unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current state-of-the-art
calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed as
approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian) imposing equality
constraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such
underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push
towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best
compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model
during gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a
simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which
imposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on
a variety of image classification, semantic segmentation and NLP benchmarks

essentially be destroyed by the binarization. Interestingly, the model allows
for closed-form likelihood by employing the cumulative distribution function of

local magnetization of GaAs nuclei should also experience spatial fluctuations.
The motion of the macroscopic spin-rotation state is studied microscopically by
solving a non-stationary Schr\""odinger equation. Comparison with the previously
studied channel of transverse spin relaxation (attenuation of Kerr oscilations)
shows that relaxation via nuclei involves a longer quadratic stage of

problem with unit capacities in a flow network $\mathcal{N}$. Consequently, we
ask for a collection of $k$ node-disjoint paths from the source $s$ to the sink

$\Sigma_{\rm{LDR}}$ and the cumulative distribution of stellar positions.
INDICATE detects significant differences in the clustering tendencies of the

learned from modelling such observations with cosmic-ray transport, paying
particular attention to the question to what extent we can exploit radio haloes
when studying galactic winds. We have developed the user-friendly framework
SPINNAKER to model radio haloes with either pure advection or diffusion,
allowing us to study both diffusion coefficients and advection speeds in nearby
galaxies. Using these models, we show that we can identify galaxies with winds
using both morphology and radio spectral indices of radio haloes. Advective
radio haloes are ubiquitous, indicating that already fairly low values of the
star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) can trigger
galactic winds. The advection speeds scale with SFR, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and
rotation speed as expected for stellar feedback-driven winds. Accelerating
winds are in agreement with our radio spectral index data, but this is
sensitive to the magnetic field parametrisation, so that constant wind speeds
cannot be ruled out either. The question to what extent cosmic rays can be a
driving force behind winds is still an open issue and we discuss only in
passing how a simple iso-thermal wind model could fit our data. Nevertheless,
the comparison with inferences from observations and theory looks promising
with radio continuum offering a complementary view on galactic winds. We finish
with a perspective on future observations and challenges lying ahead.

J0305-6225, a z=0.58 major merging galaxy cluster with a large BCG-SZ centroid
separation and a highly disturbed X-ray morphology. The galaxy density
distribution shows two main overdensities with separations of 0.144 and 0.017
arcmin to their respective BCGs. We characterize the central regions of the two
colliding structures, namely 0307-6225N and 0307-6225S, finding velocity
derived masses of $M_{200,N}=$ 2.44 $\pm$ 1.41 $\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ and
$M_{200,S}=$ 3.16 $\pm$ 1.88 $\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, with a line-of-sight
velocity difference of $|\Delta v| = 342$ km s$^{-1}$. The total dynamically
derived mass is consistent with the SZ derived mass of 7.63 h$_{70}^{-1}$ $\pm$
1.36 $\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We model the merger using the Monte Carlo
Merger Analysis Code, estimating a merging angle of 36$^{+14}_{-12}$ degrees
with respect to the plane of the sky. Comparing with simulations of a merging
system with a mass ratio of 1:3, we find that the best scenario is that of an
ongoing merger that began 0.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$ Gyr ago. We also characterize
the galaxy population using H$\delta$ and [OII] $\lambda 3727$ \AA \ lines. We
find that most of the emission-line galaxies belong to 0307-6225S, close to the
X-ray peak position, with a third of them corresponding to red-cluster sequence
galaxies, and the rest to blue galaxies with velocities consistent with recent
periods of accretion. Moreover, we suggest that 0307-6225S suffered a previous
merger, evidenced through the two equally bright BCGs at the center with a
velocity difference of $\sim$674 km s$^{-1}$.

very important physical information about the pre-recombination era and serves
as a cosmic standard ruler. On the other hand, the absolute magnitude of
supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa), $M$, is pivotal to infer the distances to these
standard candles. Having access to (at least) one of these two quantities is
crucial to measure the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from BAO/SNIa data. In this work
we present a new method to measure how long is the cosmic ruler and how bright
are the standard candles independently from the main drivers of the $H_0$
tension, namely by avoiding (i) the use of CMB data; (ii) the calibration of
SNIa in the first steps of the cosmic distance ladder; and (iii) the assumption
of any concrete cosmological model. We only assume that SNIa can be safely
employed as standard candles and $r_d$ as a standard ruler, together with the
validity of the Cosmological Principle and the metric description of gravity,
with photons propagating in null geodesics and the conservation of the photon
number. Our method is based on the minimization of a loss function that
represents the level of inconsistency between the low-redshift data sets
employed in this study, to wit: SNIa, BAO and cosmic chronometers. In our main
analysis we obtain: $r_d=(146.0^{+4.2}_{-5.1})$ Mpc,
$M=-19.362^{+0.078}_{-0.067}$. The former is fully compatible with Planck's
$\Lambda$CDM best-fit cosmology, but still leaves plenty of room for new
physics before the decoupling, whereas our constraint on $M$ lies closer to the
value preferred by the concordance model, although it is only $\sim 1.4\sigma$
below the SH0ES measurement.

exact diagonalizations on the spherical as well as toroidal geometry by taking
into account the effect of realistic anisotropies that break the spin/valley
symmetry of the pure Coulomb interaction. We also use a variational method
based on eigenstates of the fully $SU(4)$ symmetric limit. For all the
fractions we study there are two-component states for which the competing
phases are generalizations of those occurring at neutrality $\nu_G=0$. They are
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, charge-density wave and K\'ekul\'e phases,
depending on the values of Ising or XY anisotropies in valley space. The
varying spin-valley content of the states leads to ground state quantum numbers
that are different from the $\nu_G=0$ case. For filling factor $\nu_G=-2+5/3$
there is a parent state in the $SU(4)$ limit which has a flavor content
$(1,1/3,1/3,0)$ where the two components that are one-third filled form a
two-component singlet. The addition of anisotropies leads to the formation of
new states that have no counterpart at $\nu_G=0$. While some of them are
predicted by the variational approach, we find notably that negative Ising-like
valley anisotropy leads to the formation of a state which is a singlet in both
spin and valley space and lies beyond the reach of the variational method. Also
fully spin polarized two-component states at $\nu=-2+4/3$ and $\nu=-2+5/3$
display an emergent $SU(2)$ valley symmetry because they do not feel
point-contact anisotropies. We discuss implications for current experiments
concerning possible spin transitions.

corruption in MRI. Spikes occur as point-like disturbances of $k$-space that
lead to global sinusoidal intensity errors in the image domain. Depending on
the amplitude of the disturbances and their locations in $k$-space, the effect
of a spike can be significant, often ruining the reconstructed images. Here we
present both a spike detection method and a related data correction method for
automatic correction of RF spike noise. To detect spikes, we found the
$k$-space points that have the most significant effect on the total variation
of the image. To replace the spikes, we used a compressed sensing
reconstruction in which only the points thought to be corrupted are
unconstrained. We demonstrated our technique in two cases: (1) in vivo gradient
echo brain data with artificially corrupted points and (2) actual, complex
scanner data from a whole-body fat-water imaging gradient echo protocol
corrupted by spikes at uncertain locations. Our method allowed near-perfect
detection and correction with no human intervention. We calculated Matthews
correlation coefficients and sensitivities above 0.95 for a maximum of 0.78\%
corruption in synthetically corrupted in vivo brain data. We also found
specificities above 0.9994.

However, the traditional measurement-based modeling approach has increasing
challenges for the scenarios with insufficient measurement data. To obtain
enough data for channel modeling, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used
in this paper to predict channel data. The high mobility railway channel is
considered, which is a typical scenario where it is challenging to obtain
enough data for modeling within a short sampling interval. Three types of ANNs,
the Back Propagation Network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Extreme
Learning Machine, are considered to predict channel path loss and shadow
fading. The Root-Mean-Square error is used to evaluate prediction accuracy. The
factors that may influence prediction accuracy are compared and discussed,
including the type of network, number of neurons and proportion of training
data. It is found that a larger number of neurons can significantly reduce
prediction error, whereas the influence of proportion of training data is
relatively small. The results can be used to improve modeling accuracy of path
loss and shadow fading when measurement data is reduced.

bulbs in almost every application, from flashlights in smartphones to
automotive headlights. Illuminating nightly streets requires LEDs to emit a
light spectrum that is perceived as pure white by the human eye. The power
associated with such a white light spectrum is not only distributed over the
contributing wavelengths but also over the angles of vision. For many
applications, the usable light rays are required to exit the LED in forward
direction, namely under small angles to the perpendicular. In this work, we
demonstrate that a specifically designed multi-layer thin film on top of a

Therefore, the deduced multi-objective optimization problem is reformulated via
a real-valued physics-guided objective function that represents the
hierarchical structure of our engineering problem. Variants of Bayesian
optimization are employed to maximize this non-deterministic objective function
based on ray tracing simulations. Eventually, the investigation of optical

these aims is important for critical systems in safety, security, and defence.
In parallel, OoD detection is challenging since deep neural network classifiers
set high confidence to OoD samples away from the training data. To address such
limitations, we propose the Few-shot ROBust (FROB) model for classification and
few-shot OoD detection. We devise FROB for improved robustness and reliable
confidence prediction for few-shot OoD detection. We generate the support
boundary of the normal class distribution and combine it with few-shot Outlier
Exposure (OE). We propose a self-supervised learning few-shot confidence
boundary methodology based on generative and discriminative models. The
contribution of FROB is the combination of the generated boundary in a
self-supervised learning manner and the imposition of low confidence at this
learned boundary. FROB implicitly generates strong adversarial samples on the
boundary and forces samples from OoD, including our boundary, to be less
confident by the classifier. FROB achieves generalization to unseen OoD with
applicability to unknown, in the wild, test sets that do not correlate to the
training datasets. To improve robustness, FROB redesigns OE to work even for
zero-shots. By including our boundary, FROB reduces the threshold linked to the
model's few-shot robustness; it maintains the OoD performance approximately
independent of the number of few-shots. The few-shot robustness analysis
evaluation of FROB on different sets and on One-Class Classification (OCC) data
shows that FROB achieves competitive performance and outperforms benchmarks in

the procedure of the maximum entropy principle and by using an appropriate BGK
model for the collisional term. The entropy principle with a convex entropy
density is proved in a neighborhood of equilibrium state, and, as a
consequence, the system is symmetric hyperbolic and the Cauchy problem is
well-posed. The ultra-relativistic and classical limits are also studied. The
theories with $14$ and $6$ moments are deduced as principal subsystems.
Particularly interesting is the subsystem with $6$ fields in which the
dissipation is only due to the dynamical pressure. This simplified model can be
very useful when bulk viscosity is dominant and might be important in

hydrosulfide (NH$_4$SH) and water at pressures of tens to hundreds of bars,
forming extended deep weather layers. Because of hydrogen's small molecular

that the Purely Wild Inertia Conjecture is true for any product of perfect

parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give
genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input
varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of
autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input.
  This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in
multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future
limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are
equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular
thresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact
hyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable
manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define
R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special
solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that
is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge
state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the
associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of
edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and
degenerate cases.
  The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the
future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This
allows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in
terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation,
and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and
irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic)
connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.

Images and thereby accelerate acquisition, which is of paramount importance to
the clinical workflow. Physics-informed networks incorporate the forward model
of accelerated MRI reconstruction in the learning process. With increasing
network complexity, robustness is not ensured when reconstructing data unseen
during training. We aim to embed data consistency (DC) in deep networks while
balancing the degree of network complexity. While doing so, we will assess
whether either explicit or implicit enforcement of DC in varying network
architectures is preferred to optimize performance. We propose a scheme called
Cascades of Independently Recurrent Inference Machines (CIRIM) to assess DC
through unrolled optimization. Herein we assess DC both implicitly by gradient
descent and explicitly by a designed term. Extensive comparison of the CIRIM to
CS as well as to other methods is performed: the E2EVN, CascadeNet, KIKINet,
LPDNet, RIM, IRIM, and UNet. Models were trained and evaluated on T1-weighted
and FLAIR contrast brain data, and T2-weighted knee data. Both 1D and 2D
undersampling patterns were evaluated. Robustness was tested by reconstructing
7.5x prospectively undersampled 3D FLAIR MRI data of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
patients with white matter lesions. The CIRIM performed best when implicitly
enforcing DC, while the E2EVN required an explicit DC formulation. In
reconstructing MS patient data, prospectively acquired with a sampling pattern
unseen during model training, the CIRIM maintained lesion contrast while
efficiently denoising the images. The CIRIM showed highly promising
generalization capabilities maintaining a very fair trade-off between
reconstructed image quality and fast reconstruction times, which is crucial in
the clinical workflow.

$\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological invariant $\nu\in \{ 0; 1\}$ in terms of a
non-Hermitian part of the total Hamiltonian, we calculate $\langle\nu\rangle$

(ii) finite size fluctuations of $\nu$ for arbitrary disorder strength.
Numerical simulations of the edge modes formation and gap suppression at the

be significantly enhanced in a new dark photon model in which dark photons are
copiously produced in the hidden radiation process. We investigate the
capability of various lifetime frontier detectors in probing the parameter
space of this model, including the far forward detectors FACET and FASER, the
far transverse detector MATHUSLA, and the precision timing detector CMS-MTD. We
find that the accessible parameter space is significantly enlarged by the
hidden radiation process so that FACET, MATHUSLA, and CMS-MTD can probe a much
larger parameter space than the so-called minimal model. The parameter space
probed by FACET is found to be much larger than FASER, which is largely due to
the fact that the former has a larger decay volume and is closer to the
interaction point. There also exists some parameter space that can be probed
both by the far detectors and by precision timing detectors, so that different
experiments can be complementary to each other. A brief overview of the
lifetime frontier detectors is also given.

data structures across scales. Here, we focus on the t-SNE algorithm and show
that a simplified parameter setup with a single control parameter, namely the
perplexity, can effectively balance local and global data structure
visualization. We also designed a chunk\&mix protocol to efficiently
parallelize t-SNE and explore data structure across a much wide range of scales
than currently available. Our parallel version of the BH-tSNE, namely pt-SNE,
converges to good global embedding, comparable to state-of-the-art solutions,
though the chunk\&mix protocol adds little noise and decreases the accuracy at
the local scale. Nonetheless, we show that simple post-processing can
efficiently restore local scale visualization, without any loss of precision at
the global scales. We expect the same approach to apply to faster embedding
algorithms other than BH-tSNE, like FIt-SNE or UMAP, thus, extending the
state-of-the-art and leading to more comprehensive data structure visualization

quasi-monochromatic gravitational-wave signals emitted by ultralight scalar
boson clouds around spinning black holes using data from the third observing
run of Advanced LIGO. We analyze the frequency range from 20~Hz to 610~Hz, over
a small frequency derivative range around zero, and use multiple frequency
resolutions to be robust towards possible signal frequency wanderings. Outliers
from this search are followed up using two different methods, one more suitable
for nearly monochromatic signals, and the other more robust towards frequency
fluctuations. We do not find any evidence for such signals and set upper limits
on the signal strain amplitude, the most stringent being $\approx10^{-25}$ at
around 130~Hz. We interpret these upper limits as both an ""exclusion region"" in
the boson mass/black hole mass plane and the maximum detectable distance for a
given boson mass, based on an assumption of the age of the black hole/boson
cloud system.

diffusion operator on complete smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold
having a lower bound of modified $m$-Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor under $m\leq 1$
in terms of vector fields. As consequences, we give the optimal conditions for
modified $m$-Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor under $m\leq1$ such that the (weighted)
Myers' theorem, Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem, Ambrose-Myers'
theorem, Cheng's maximal diameter theorem, and the Cheeger-Gromoll type
splitting theorem hold. Some of these results were well-studied for
$m$-Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature under $m\geq n$ if the vector field is a
gradient type. When $m<1$, our results are new in the literature.

  and Dimitris Visvikis","Regularized directional representations for medical image registration",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In image registration, many efforts have been devoted to the development of
alternatives to the popular normalized mutual information criterion.
Concurrently to these efforts, an increasing number of works have demonstrated
that substantial gains in registration accuracy can also be achieved by
aligning structural representations of images rather than images themselves.
Following this research path, we propose a new method for mono- and multimodal
image registration based on the alignment of regularized vector fields derived
from structural information such as gradient vector flow fields, a technique we
call \textit{vector field similarity}. Our approach can be combined in a
straightforward fashion with any existing registration framework by

to tackle the problem of accurate and high-speed depth sensing. Our setup
consists of an event camera and a laser-point projector that uniformly
illuminates the scene in a raster scanning pattern during 16 ms. Previous
methods match events independently of each other, and so they deliver noisy
depth estimates at high scanning speeds in the presence of signal latency and
jitter. In contrast, we optimize an energy function designed to exploit event
correlations, called spatio-temporal consistency. The resulting method is
robust to event jitter and therefore performs better at higher scanning speeds.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can deal with high-speed motion and
outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods based on event cameras,
reducing the RMSE by 83% on average, for the same acquisition time.

Advanced deep generative methods attempt to optimize the molecules in the

between the original and latent spaces is always kept unchanged during the
entire optimization process. The unchanged mapping makes those methods
challenging to fast adapt to various optimization scenes and leads to the great
demand for assessed molecules (samples) to provide optimization direction,
which is a considerable expense for drug discovery. To this end, we design a
sample-efficient molecular generative method, HelixMO, which explores the
scene-sensitive latent space to promote sample efficiency. The scene-sensitive
latent space focuses more on modeling the promising molecules by dynamically
adjusting the space mapping by leveraging the correlations between the general

only a few assessed samples on four molecular optimization scenes. Ablation

pile may fall out of the grasp when the hand is lifted. This occurs because
they were supported by other objects in the pile instead of the fingers of the
hand. Therefore, a robotic hand should sense the number of objects in a grasp
using its tactile sensors before lifting. This paper presents novel
multi-object grasping analyzing methods for solving this problem. They include
a grasp volume calculation, tactile force analysis, and a data-driven deep
learning approach. The methods have been implemented on a Barrett hand and then
evaluated in simulations and a real setup with a robotic system. The evaluation
results conclude that once the Barrett hand grasps multiple objects in the
pile, the data-driven model can predict, before lifting, the number of objects
that will remain in the hand after lifting. The root-mean-square errors for our
approach are 0.74 for balls and 0.58 for cubes in simulations, and 1.06 for
balls, and 1.45 for cubes in the real system.

allows a set of agents to collaboratively train a model without sharing their

is desired. However, it has been observed that the performance of FL is closely
related to the similarity of the local data distributions of agents.
Particularly, as the data distributions of agents differ, the accuracy of the
trained models drop. In this work, we look at how variations in local data
distributions affect the fairness and the robustness properties of the trained
models in addition to the accuracy. Our experimental results indicate that, the
trained models exhibit higher bias, and become more susceptible to attacks as
local data distributions differ. Importantly, the degradation in the fairness,

that small variations that have little impact on the accuracy could still be
important if the trained model is to be deployed in a fairness/security

dynamical sequential games with large numbers of agents. So far, results have
been largely limited to graphon mean field systems with continuous-time
diffusive or jump dynamics, typically without control and with little focus on
computational methods. We propose a novel discrete-time formulation for graphon
mean field games as the limit of non-linear dense graph Markov games with weak
interaction. On the theoretical side, we give extensive and rigorous existence
and approximation properties of the graphon mean field solution in sufficiently
large systems. On the practical side, we provide general learning schemes for
graphon mean field equilibria by either introducing agent equivalence classes
or reformulating the graphon mean field system as a classical mean field
system. By repeatedly finding a regularized optimal control solution and its
generated mean field, we successfully obtain plausible approximate Nash
equilibria in otherwise infeasible large dense graph games with many agents.
Empirically, we are able to demonstrate on a number of examples that the
finite-agent behavior comes increasingly close to the mean field behavior for
our computed equilibria as the graph or system size grows, verifying our
theory. More generally, we successfully apply policy gradient reinforcement

a $O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ regret by a logarithmic factor, and also provide 2-pass
algorithms with some initial conditions to incur a similar order of regret.

Langevin dynamics as a sampling tool is given by taking the gradient of the
associated asymptotic variance with respect to friction. We give an expression
for this gradient in terms of the solution to an appropriate Poisson equation
and show that it can be approximated by short simulations of the associated
first variation/tangent process under concavity assumptions on the log density.
Our algorithm is applied to the estimation of posterior means in Bayesian
inference problems and reduced variance is demonstrated when compared to the
original underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics in both full and
stochastic gradient cases.

lack of medical data due to privacy concerns and the lack of methods and
approaches on processing the French language. One of these challenges is
structuring drug-related information in French clinical documents. To our
knowledge, over the last decade, there are less than five relevant papers that
study French prescriptions. This paper proposes a new approach for extracting
drug-related information from French clinical scanned documents while
preserving patients' privacy. In addition, we deployed our method in a health
data management platform where it is used to structure drug medical data and
help patients organize their drug schedules. It can be implemented on any web
or mobile platform. This work closes the gap between theoretical and practical
work by creating an application adapted to real production problems. It is a
combination of a rule-based phase and a Deep Learning approach. Finally,
numerical results show the outperformance and relevance of the proposed
methodology.

constitutive saturation functions that govern capillary pressure and relative
permeability. The term wettability alteration refers to the change of this
property over time by processes such as CO$_2$ interactions with the rock. In
this work, we perform numerical simulations considering a two-phase
two-component flow model including time-dependent wettability alteration in a
two-dimensional aquifer-caprock system using the open porous media framework.
Particularly, we study the spatial distribution over time of injected CO$_2$
into the aquifer neglecting and including wettability alteration effects. The
numerical simulations show that wettability alteration on the caprock results
in a loss of containment; however, the CO$_2$ front into the caprock advances
very slow since the unexposed caprock along the vertical migration path also
needs to be changed by the slow wettability alteration process. The simulations
also show that wettability alteration on the aquifer results in an enhancement
of storage efficiency; this since the CO$_2$ front migrates more slowly and the
capillary entry pressure decreases after wettability alteration.

is a non-unique inverse problem. Current work presents a proof-of-concept
approach to multi-modal probabilistic inversion of logs using a single
evaluation of an artificial deep neural network (DNN). A mixture density DNN
(MDN) is trained using the ""multiple-trajectory-prediction"" (MTP) loss
functions, which avoids mode collapse typical for traditional MDNs, and allows
multi-modal prediction ahead of data. The proposed approach is verified on the
real-time stratigraphic inversion of gamma-ray logs. The multi-modal predictor
outputs several likely inverse solutions/predictions, providing more accurate
and realistic solutions than a deterministic regression using a DNN. For these
likely stratigraphic curves, the model simultaneously predicts their
probabilities, which are implicitly learned from the training geological data.
The stratigraphy predictions and their probabilities obtained in milliseconds
from the MDN can enable better real-time decisions under geological
uncertainties.

technology, have unmatched potential for pioneering applications in a wide
range of disciplines. In particular, in the field of cognitive radio (CR),
which is a key aspect in the implementation of the new 5G telecommunication
technology. The integration between the drone and CR consolidates the drone's
capabilities at the heart of the remarkably promising Internet-of-Things (IoT)
technology supported by CR. The highly dynamic network topologies, weakly
networked communication links, reliable line-of-sight (LOS) communication
links, and orbital or flight paths are characteristic features of UAV
communication compared to terrestrial wireless networks. Nevertheless, the
implementation of this system is constrained by several severe challenges, such
as energy efficiency, battery power limitation, spectrum handover, propagation
channel modeling, routing protocols, security policy, and delay setbacks. In
this paper, we consider the impact of energy scarcity faced by the UAV in
various CR applications. We also analyze the impact of energy scarcity on
communication-based applications and present the general problem of battery
limitation. Finally, we give an overview and comparison between recent
solutions proposed by researchers both in the field of communication and based
on batteries and consider possible future directions according to the state of
the art, such as novel Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and machine learning (ML).
