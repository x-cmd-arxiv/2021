approach in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. The Ricochet
experiment aims to perform a precision measurement of the CE$\nu$NS spectrum at
the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) nuclear reactor with cryogenic solid-state
detectors. The experiment will employ an array of cryogenic thermal detectors,
each with a mass of around 30 g and an energy threshold of 50 eV. One section
of this array will contain 9 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) based calorimeters.
The design will not only fulfill requirements for Ricochet, but also act as a
demonstrator for future neutrino experiments that will require thousands of
macroscopic detectors. In this article we present an updated TES chip design as
well as performance predictions based on a numerical modeling.

where $i$ appears $m_i$ times, a multipermutation $\pi$ of $\mathcal{M}$ is
called {\em quasi-Stirling}, if it contains no subword of the form $abab$ with
$a\neq b$. We designate exactly one entry of $\pi$, say $k\in \mathcal{M}$,
which is not the leftmost entry among all entries with the same value, by
underlining it in $\pi$, and we refer to the pair $(\pi,k)$ as a quasi-Stirling
multipermutation of $\mathcal{M}$ rooted at $k$. By introducing certain vertex
and edge labeled trees, we give a new bijective proof of an identity due to
Yan, Yang, Huang and Zhu, which links the enumerator of rooted quasi-Stirling
multipermutations by the numbers of ascents, descents, and plateaus, with the
exponential generating function of the {\em bivariate Eulerian polynomials}.
This identity can be viewed as a natural extension of Elizalde's result on
$k$-quasi-Stirling permutations, and our bijective approach to proving it
enables us to: (1) prove bijectively a Carlitz type identity involving
quasi-Stirling polynomials on multisets that was first obtained by Yan and Zhu;
(2) confirm a recent partial $\gamma$-positivity conjecture due to Lin, Ma and
Zhang, and find a combinatorial interpretation of the $\gamma$-coefficients in
terms of two new statistics defined on quasi-Stirling multipermutations called
sibling descents and double sibling descents.

follow a language instruction to navigate to the goal position, which relies on
the ongoing interactions with the environment during moving. Recent
Transformer-based VLN methods have made great progress benefiting from the
direct connections between visual observations and the language instruction via
the multimodal cross-attention mechanism. However, these methods usually
represent temporal context as a fixed-length vector by using an LSTM decoder or
using manually designed hidden states to build a recurrent Transformer.
Considering a single fixed-length vector is often insufficient to capture
long-term temporal context, in this paper, we introduce Multimodal Transformer
with Variable-length Memory (MTVM) for visually-grounded natural language
navigation by modelling the temporal context explicitly. Specifically, MTVM
enables the agent to keep track of the navigation trajectory by directly
storing previous activations in a memory bank. To further boost the
performance, we propose a memory-aware consistency loss to help learn a better
joint representation of temporal context with random masked instructions. We
evaluate MTVM on popular R2R and CVDN datasets, and our model improves Success
Rate on R2R unseen validation and test set by 2% each, and reduce Goal Process
by 1.6m on CVDN test set.

interstellar bands (DIBs), a set of several hundred broad absorption features

largely remain unidentified. The close match both in wavelengths and in
relative strengths recently found between the experimental absorption spectra
of gas-phase buckminsterfullerene ions (C60+) and four DIBs at 9632, 9577, 9428

intensity ratios of the 9632 and 9577 DIBs. In this work, we search for these
DIBs in the ESO VLT/X-shooter archival data and identify the 9632, 9577, 9428

Angstrom DIBs are too noisy to allow any reliable analysis, the 9632 and 9577
Angstrom DIBs are unambiguously detected and, after correcting for telluric
water vapor absorption, their correlation can be used to probe their origin. To
this end, we select a sub-sample of nine hot, O- or B0-type stars of which the
stellar Mg II contamination to the 9632 Angstrom DIB is negligibly small. We
find their equivalent widths, after normalized by reddening to eliminate their
common correlation with the density of interstellar clouds, exhibit a tight,
positive correlation. This supports C60+ as the carrier of the 9632 and 9577

metric space that are partitioned into clusters of size at most 2, find a tree
that contains exactly one point from each cluster and minimizes the largest
edge length. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem by a factor
better than 2, and present a 3-approximation algorithm.
  3. The partitioned bottleneck spanning tree problem: Given $kn$ points in

minimize the largest edge length (over all edges of the $k$ trees). We show
that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem by a factor better than 2 for
any $k\ge 2$. We present an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for this problem
where $\alpha=2$ for $k=2,3$ and $\alpha=3$ for $k\ge 4$. Towards obtaining
these approximation ratios we present tight upper bounds on the edge lengths of
$k$ equal-size disjoint trees that can be obtained from the nodes of a given
tree. This result is of independent interest.
  Our hardness proofs imply that it is NP-hard to approximate the non-metric
version of the above problems within any constant factor.

called gadgets are chained together to execute some payload. Code-reuse attacks
can exploit vulnerabilities in the presence of operating system protection that
prohibits data memory execution. The ROP chain construction task is the code
generation for the virtual machine defined by an exploited executable. It is
crucial to understand how powerful ROP attacks can be. Such knowledge can be
used to improve software security. We implement MAJORCA that generates ROP and
JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner and thoroughly consider
restricted symbols such as null bytes that terminate data copying via strcpy.
The paper covers the whole code-reuse payloads construction pipeline:
cataloging gadgets, chaining them in DAG, scheduling, linearizing to the
ready-to-run payload. MAJORCA automatically generates both ROP and JOP payloads
for x86 and MIPS. MAJORCA constructs payloads respecting restricted symbols
both in gadget addresses and data. We evaluate MAJORCA performance and accuracy
with rop-benchmark and compare it with open-source compilers. We show that
MAJORCA outperforms open-source tools. We propose a ROP chaining metric and use
it to estimate the probabilities of successful ROP chaining for different
operating systems with MAJORCA as well as other ROP compilers to show that ROP
chaining is still feasible. This metric can estimate the efficiency of OS
defences.

obtained by A. Postnikov [45] introducing the boundary measurement map in terms
of discrete path integration on planar bicolored (plabic) graphs in the disk.
An alternative parametrization was proposed by T. Lam [38] introducing systems
of relations on vectors on such graphs, depending on some signatures defined on
edges. The problem of characterizing the signatures corresponding to the
totally non-negative cells, was left open in [38]. In our paper we provide an
explicit construction of such signatures, satisfying both the full rank
condition and the total non-negativity property on the full positroid cell. If
the graph $\mathcal G$ satisfies the following natural constraint: each edge
belongs to some oriented path from the boundary to the boundary, then such
signature is unique up to a vertex gauge transformation. Such signature is
uniquely identified by geometric indices (local winding and intersection
number) ruled by the orientation $\mathcal O$ and gauge ray direction
$\mathfrak l$ on $\mathcal G$. Moreover, we provide a combinatorial
representation of geometric signatures by showing that the total signature of
every finite face just depends on the number of white vertices on it. The
latter characterization is a Kasteleyn-type property [7,1] and we conjecture a
mechanical-statistical interpretation of such relations. An explicit connection
between the solution of Lam system of relations and the value of Postnikov
boundary measurement map is established using the generalization of Talaska
formula [50] obtained in [6]. In particular, the components of the edge vectors
are rational in the edge weights with subtraction-free denominators. Finally,
we provide explicit formulas for transformations of signatures under Postnikov
moves and reductions, and amalgamations of networks.

benefits to the local economy, though the empirical evidence is mixed: mineral
assets are advantageous in some circumstances but lead to corruption and
violence in others. To shed light on this apparent discrepancy, we
significantly extend the coverage of previous work in this area by gathering
satellite data that spans several decades and encompasses several institutional
environments. Our dataset consists of one million 30m-resolution Landsat images
between 1984 and 2019 from a 40km radius around 1,658 mineral deposits across

translate these images into economically meaningful indicators measuring urban
growth and material wealth. We then use stacked event studies and
difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of mine openings and
closings. We find strong evidence of a political resource curse at the local
level. Although mining boosts the local economy in democratic countries, these
gains are meagre in autocracies and come at the expense of an increase in
localized conflict. Furthermore, our results show that the growth acceleration
in mining areas is only temporary. While former mining areas maintain their
increased wealth and urban size with respect to non-mining areas, there is no
sustained divergence.

used for the determination of parton distributions (PDFs) by the NNPDF
collaboration, we discuss some analytical results that can be obtained for
linear problems and use these results as a guidance for the more complicated
non-linear problems. We show that, in the case of Gaussian distributions, the
posterior probability density of the parametrized PDFs is fully determined by
the results of the NNPDF fitting procedure. In the particular case that we
consider, the fitting procedure and the Bayesian analysis yield exactly the
same result. Building on the insight that we obtain from the analytical
results, we introduce new estimators to assess the statistical faithfulness of
the fit results in closure tests. These estimators are defined in data space,
and can be studied analytically using the Bayesian formalism in a linear model
in order to clarify their meaning. Finally we present numerical results from a
number of closure tests performed with current NNPDF methodologies. These
further tests allow us to validate the NNPDF4.0 methodology and provide a
quantitative comparison of the NNPDF4.0 and NNPDF3.1 methodologies. As PDFs
determinations move into precision territory, the need for a careful validation
of the methodology becomes increasingly important: the error bar has become the
focal point of contemporary PDFs determinations. In this perspective,
theoretical assumptions and other sources of error are best formulated and
analysed in the Bayesian framework, which provides an ideal language to address
the precision and the accuracy of current fits.

two-temperature spectral decomposition and light curve analysis to constrain
starspot properties over a multi-year time frame. Using a high-resolution
near-infrared IGRINS spectrum and photometric data from K2 and ASAS-SN, we find
a projected spot filling factor of 32 $\pm$ 7% with a spot temperature of 4000
$\pm$ 200 K. This value anchors the variability seen in the light curve,
indicating the spot filling factor of S1063 ranged from 20% to 45% over a
four-year time period with an average spot filling factor of 30%. These values
are generally lower than those determined from photometric model comparisons
but still indicate that S1063, and likely other sub-subgiants, are magnetically
active spotted stars. We find observational and theoretical comparisons of
spotted stars are nuanced due to the projected spot coverage impacting
estimates of the surface-averaged effective temperature. The starspot
properties found here are similar to those found in RS CVn systems, supporting
classifying sub-subgiants as another type of active giant star binary system.
This technique opens the possibility of characterizing the surface conditions
of many more spotted stars than previous methods, allowing for larger future

can propagate and dissipate energy in the chromosphere, but also because they
carry information about the structure of the atmosphere in which they
propagate. The nature of the three-minute oscillations observed in the umbral
region of sunspots is considered to be an effect of propagation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves upward from below the photosphere. We present a
study of sunspot oscillations and wave propagation in NOAA AR 12470 using an
approximately one-hour long data set acquired on 2015 December 17 by the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Goode Solar Telescope
(GST) operating at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The ALMA data are unique in
providing a time-series of direct temperature measurements in the sunspot
chromosphere. The two-second cadence of ALMA images allows us to well resolve
the three-minute periods typical of sunspot oscillations in the chromosphere.
Fourier analysis is applied to ALMA Band 3 ($\sim$100 GHz, $\sim$3 mm) and GST
H$\alpha$ data sets to obtain power spectra as well as oscillation phase
information. We analysed properties of the wave propagation by combining
multiple wavelengths that probe physical parameters of solar atmosphere at
different heights. We find that the ALMA temperature fluctuations are
consistent with that expected for a propagating acoustic wave, with a slight
asymmetry indicating non-linear steepening.

the corresponding instances in the other modality (i.e., swapping the pseudo

and desire the discrete-time Markov chain with smallest mixing time $\tau$
subject to having equilibrium distribution uniform on $V$ and non-zero
transition probabilities only across edges of the graph.
  It is well-known that the mixing time $\tau_\textsf{RW}$ of the lazy random
walk on $G$ is characterised by the edge conductance $\Phi$ of $G$ via
Cheeger's inequality: $\Phi^{-1} \lesssim \tau_\textsf{RW} \lesssim \Phi^{-2}

via a Cheeger-type inequality but for a different geometric quantity, namely
the vertex conductance $\Psi$ of $G$: $\Psi^{-1} \lesssim \tau^\star \lesssim
\Psi^{-2} (\log |V|)^2$.
  This characterisation forbids fast mixing for graphs with small vertex
conductance. To bypass this fundamental barrier, we consider Markov chains on
$G$ with equilibrium distribution which need not be uniform, but rather only
$\varepsilon$-close to uniform in total variation. We show that it is always
possible to construct such a chain with mixing time $\tau \lesssim

Euclidean projections can be performed efficiently. For other sets, the cost of
the projections can be too high. To circumvent these issues, alternative
methods based on the famous Frank-Wolfe algorithm have been studied and used.
Such methods use a Linear Optimization Oracle at each iteration instead of
Euclidean projections; the former can often be performed efficiently. Such
methods have also been extended to the online and stochastic optimization
settings. However, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants do not achieve
the optimal performance, in terms of regret or rate, for general convex sets.
What is more, the Linear Optimization Oracle they use can still be
computationally expensive in some cases. In this paper, we move away from
Frank-Wolfe style algorithms and present a new reduction that turns any
algorithm A defined on a Euclidean ball (where projections are cheap) to an
algorithm on a constrained set C contained within the ball, without sacrificing
the performance of the original algorithm A by much. Our reduction requires O(T

optimization on C is needed. Using our reduction, we recover optimal regret

on conditional diffusion models and evaluates this framework on four
challenging image-to-image translation tasks, namely colorization, inpainting,
uncropping, and JPEG restoration. Our simple implementation of image-to-image
diffusion models outperforms strong GAN and regression baselines on all tasks,
without task-specific hyper-parameter tuning, architecture customization, or
any auxiliary loss or sophisticated new techniques needed. We uncover the
impact of an L2 vs. L1 loss in the denoising diffusion objective on sample
diversity, and demonstrate the importance of self-attention in the neural
architecture through empirical studies. Importantly, we advocate a unified
evaluation protocol based on ImageNet, with human evaluation and sample quality
scores (FID, Inception Score, Classification Accuracy of a pre-trained
ResNet-50, and Perceptual Distance against original images). We expect this
standardized evaluation protocol to play a role in advancing image-to-image
translation research. Finally, we show that a generalist, multi-task diffusion
model performs as well or better than task-specific specialist counterparts.

progress, and is being adopted in production development pipelines. However,
reliability concerns, especially whether the models are actually learning
task-related aspects of source code, are being raised. While recent
model-probing approaches have observed a lack of signal awareness in many
AI-for-code models, i.e. models not capturing task-relevant signals, they do
not offer solutions to rectify this problem. In this paper, we explore
data-driven approaches to enhance models' signal-awareness: 1) we combine the
SE concept of code complexity with the AI technique of curriculum learning; 2)
we incorporate SE assistance into AI models by customizing Delta Debugging to
generate simplified signal-preserving programs, augmenting them to the training
dataset. With our techniques, we achieve up to 4.8x improvement in model signal
awareness. Using the notion of code complexity, we further present a novel
model learning introspection approach from the perspective of the dataset.

C$^{18}$O line emission is an effective measure of the gas mass, and despite
its complex chemistry, a possibly better tracer than HD. Our models are able to
reproduce C$^{18}$O emission from recent ALMA surveys and the TW Hya disk to
within a factor of $\sim 2-3$ using carbon and oxygen abundances characteristic
of the interstellar medium (C/H$=1.4 \times 10^{-4}$; O/H$=3.2\times 10^{-4}$)
without having to invoke unusual chemical processing. Our gas and dust disk
structure calculations considering hydrostatic pressure equilibrium and our
treatment of the CO conversion on grains are primarily responsible for the very
different conclusions on disk masses and CO depletion. As did previous studies,
we find that a gas phase C/O of $\sim 1-2$ can explain observed hydrocarbon
emission from the TW Hya disk; but significantly, we find that CO isotopologue
emission is only marginally affected by the C/O ratio. We therefore conclude
that C$^{18}$O emission provides estimates of disk masses that are uncertain

another. However, community values are challenging to measure as they are
rarely explicitly stated. In this work, we measure community values through the
first large-scale survey of community values, including 2,769 reddit users in
2,151 unique subreddits. Through a combination of survey responses and a
quantitative analysis of public reddit data, we characterize how these values
vary within and across communities. Amongst other findings, we show that
community members disagree about how safe their communities are, that
longstanding communities place 30.1% more importance on trustworthiness than

important implications, including suggesting that care must be taken to protect

downsampled guess and fed into the low-fidelity simulator. In this way, by
incorporating the limited physical knowledge from the differentiable
low-fidelity model ''layer'', we ensure that the conservation laws and

$\alpha_\rm{CO}{\sim}0.5{-}2.0$ $\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$ with a
decreasing trend with galactocentric radius in the central $\sim$1 kpc. The
inflows show a substantially lower $\alpha_\rm{CO} < 0.1$
$\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$, likely due to lower optical depths
caused by turbulence or shear in the inflows. Over the whole region, this gives
an intensity-weighted $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ of ${\sim}1.5$
$\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$, which is similar to previous dust
modeling based results at kpc scales. This suggests that low $\alpha_\rm{CO}$
on kpc scales in the centers of some barred galaxies may be due to the
contribution of low optical depth CO emission in bar-driven inflows.

graphics and has been the focus of decades of research. Traditionally,
synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as
rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations
of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define
the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene
representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene
representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by
an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g.,
from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance
fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations
using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse
rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from
classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for
synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap
forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video
content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through
hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable
components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on
advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical
rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred
to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that
they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint
synthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static
scenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly
deforming objects...

emerged as a novel environment for studies of new physics beyond the Standard
Model (SM). As a case study, we consider the simplest extension of the SM
scalar sector involving a light CP-even scalar singlet $S$ mixing with the SM
Higgs boson. These $S$ particles can be produced abundantly in neutron star
mergers via the nucleon bremsstrahlung process. We show that the $S$ particles
may either be trapped in or stream freely out of the merger remnant, depending
on the $S$ mass, its mixing with the SM Higgs boson, and the temperature and
baryon density in the merger. In the free-streaming region, the scalar $S$ will
provide an extra channel to cool down the merger remnant, with cooling
timescales as small as ${\cal O}$(ms). On the other hand, in the trapped
region, the Bose gas of $S$ particles could contribute a larger thermal
conductivity than the trapped neutrinos in some parts of the parameter space,
thus leading to faster thermal equilibration than expected. Therefore, future
observations of the early postmerger phase of a neutron star merger could
effectively probe a unique range of the $S$ parameter space, largely
complementary to the existing and future laboratory and supernova limits. In
view of these results, we hope the merger simulation community will be
motivated to implement the effects of light CP-even scalars into their

significantly less massive. Furthermore, for the underlying distribution of

theoretical models predict that a larger number of quasars in this epoch should
be lensed, implying further overestimates of early black hole masses. To

we re-analyzed archival XMM-Newton observations of the quasar and compared the
expected ratios of X-ray luminosity to rest-frame UV and IR luminosities. For
both cases, J0100+2802's X-ray flux is consistent with the no-lensing scenario;
while this could be explained by J0100+2802 being X-ray faint, we find it does
not have the X-ray or optical spectral features expected for an X-ray faint
quasar. Finally, we compare the overall distribution of X-ray fluxes for known,

studies have demonstrated that the multidimensional nature of exoplanet
atmospheres -- due to non-uniformities across the day-night transition and
between the morning and evening terminators -- can strongly influence
transmission spectra. However, the computational demands of 3D radiative
transfer techniques have precluded their usage within atmospheric retrievals.
Here we introduce TRIDENT, a new 3D radiative transfer model which rapidly
computes transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres with day-night,
morning-evening, and vertical variations in temperature, chemical abundances,
and cloud properties. We also derive a general equation for transmission
spectra, accounting for 3D atmospheres, refraction, multiple scattering,
ingress/egress, grazing transits, stellar heterogeneities, and nightside
thermal emission. After introducing TRIDENT's linear algebra-based approach to
3D radiative transfer, we propose new parametric prescriptions for 3D
temperature and abundance profiles and 3D clouds. We show that multidimensional
transmission spectra exhibit two significant observational signatures: (i)
day-night composition gradients alter the relative amplitudes of absorption
features; and (ii) morning-evening composition gradients distort the
peak-to-wing contrast of absorption features. Finally, we demonstrate that
these signatures of multidimensional atmospheres incur residuals > 100 ppm
compared to 1D models, rendering them potentially detectable with JWST.
TRIDENT's rapid radiative transfer, coupled with parametric multidimensional
atmospheres, unlocks the final barrier to 3D atmospheric retrievals.

perform simulations of the local Milky Way pulsar population, for interstellar
medium assumptions in agreement with a range of cosmic-ray nuclei measurements.
Each such simulation contains $\sim 10^{4}$ pulsars of unique age, location,

fraction of spin-down power going to cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and v)
their propagation through the interstellar medium and the Heliosphere. We find
that pulsars of ages $\sim 10^{5}-10^{7}$ yr, have a braking index that on
average has to be 3 or larger. Given that electromagnetic spectrum observations
of young pulsars find braking indices lower than 3, our work provides strong
hints that pulsars' braking index increases on average as they age, allowing
them to retain some of their rotational energy. Moreover, we find that pulsars
have relatively uniform properties as sources of cosmic-ray electrons and
positrons in terms of the spectra they produce and likely release O($10\%$) of
their rotational energy to cosmic-rays in the ISM. Finally, we find at

matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies embedded in cuspy
Navarro-Frenk-White subhalos. Tides gradually peel off stars and dark matter
from a subhalo, trimming it down according to their initial binding energy.
This process strips preferentially particles with long orbital times, and comes
to an end when the remaining bound particles have crossing times shorter than a
fraction of the orbital time at pericentre. The properties of the final stellar
remnant thus depend on the energy distribution of stars in the progenitor
subhalo, which in turn depends on the initial density profile and radial
segregation of the initial stellar component. The stellar component may
actually be completely dispersed if its energy distribution does not extend all
the way to the subhalo potential minimum, although a bound dark remnant may
remain. These results imply that 'tidally-limited' galaxies, defined as systems
whose stellar components have undergone substantial tidal mass loss, neither
converge to a unique structure nor follow a single tidal track, as claimed in
earlier work. On the other hand, tidally limited dwarfs do have characteristic
sizes and velocity dispersions that trace directly the characteristic radius
($r_{max}$) and circular velocity ($V_{max}$) of the subhalo remnant. This
result places strong upper limits on the size of satellites whose unusually low
velocity dispersions are often ascribed to tidal effects. In particular, the
large size of kinematically-cold 'feeble giant' satellites like Crater 2 or
Antlia 2 cannot be explained as due to tidal effects alone in the Lambda Cold
Dark Matter scenario.

background that can be anisotropic and circularly polarized. We use the
expansion of the intensity and the circular polarization in terms of spherical

We propose an unbiased real-space estimator that can separate the intensity and
circular-polarization contributions of the SGWB to pulsar-timing-residual

signal-to-noise ratio of a circular-polarization component that has a dipole
pattern under different assumptions about the PTA. We find that a
nearly-maximal circular-polarization dipole may be detectable, which can aid in
determining whether or not the background is dominated by a handful of bright

supernovae (CCSN). Employing recent results of multi-dimensional CCSN
simulations, we delve into a relation between total emitted neutrino energy
(TONE) and PNS mass/radius, and we find that they are strongly correlated with
each other. We fit the relation by simple polynomial functions connecting TONE
to PNS mass and radius as a function of time. By combining another fitting
function representing the correlation between TONE and cumulative number of
event at each neutrino observatory, PNS mass and radius can be retrieved from
purely observed neutrino data. We demonstrate retrievals of PNS mass and radius
from mock data of neutrino signal, and we assess the capability of our proposed
method. While underlining the limitations of the method, we also discuss the
importance of the joint analysis with gravitational wave signal. This would
reduce uncertainties of parameter estimations in our method, and may narrow
down the possible neutrino oscillation model. The proposed method is a very
easy and inexpensive computation, which will be useful in real data analysis of
CCSN neutrino signal.

we focus on the interplay between topological domain wall states and quantum
Hall edge transport within the eight-fold degenerate zeroth Landau level of
high-quality suspended bilayer graphene. We find that the two-terminal
conductance remains approximately constant for low magnetic fields throughout
the distinct quantum Hall states since the conduction channels are traded
between domain wall and device edges. For high magnetic fields, however, we
observe evidence of transport suppression at the domain wall, which can be
attributed to the emergence of spectral minigaps. This indicates that stacking

systems and dynamics, which is of great importance in physics and chemistry.
Many state-of-the-art learning algorithms require access to an additional
external quantum memory. While such a quantum memory is not required a priori,
in many cases, algorithms that do not utilize quantum memory require much more
data than those which do. We show that this trade-off is inherent in a wide
range of learning problems. Our results include the following:
  (1) We show that to perform shadow tomography on an $n$-qubit state rho with
$M$ observables, any algorithm without quantum memory requires $\Omega(\min(M,
2^n))$ samples of rho in the worst case. Up to logarithmic factors, this
matches the upper bound of [HKP20] and completely resolves an open question in
[Aar18, AR19].
  (2) We establish exponential separations between algorithms with and without
quantum memory for purity testing, distinguishing scrambling and depolarizing
evolutions, as well as uncovering symmetry in physical dynamics. Our
separations improve and generalize prior work of [ACQ21] by allowing for a
broader class of algorithms without quantum memory.
  (3) We give the first tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity.
We prove that to estimate absolute values of all $n$-qubit Pauli observables,
algorithms with $k < n$ qubits of quantum memory require at least
$\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ samples, but there is an algorithm using $n$-qubit
quantum memory which only requires $O(n)$ samples.
  The separations we show are sufficiently large and could already be evident,
for instance, with tens of qubits. This provides a concrete path towards
demonstrating real-world advantage for learning algorithms with quantum memory.

(moist-air entropy potential temperature and total water content) into a
one-dimensional variational data assimilation system (1D-Var) to demonstrate
the benefit for future operational assimilation schemes. This system is
assessed using microwave brightness temperatures from a ground-based radiometer
installed during the field campaign SOFOG3D dedicated to fog forecast
improvement.
  An underlying objective is to ease the specification of background error
covariance matrices that are highly dependent on weather conditions when using
classical variables, making difficult the optimal retrievals of cloud and
thermodynamic properties during fog conditions. Background error covariance
matrices for these new conservative variables have thus been computed by an
ensemble approach based on the French convective scale model AROME, for both
all-weather and fog conditions. A first result shows that the use of these
matrices for the new variables reduces some dependencies to the meteorological
conditions (diurnal cycle, presence or not of clouds) compared to usual
variables (temperature, specific humidity).
  Then, two 1D-Var experiments (classical vs. conservative variables) are
evaluated over a full diurnal cycle characterized by a stratus-evolving
radiative fog situation, using hourly brightness temperatures.
  Results show, as expected, that analysed brightness temperatures by the
1D-Var are much closer to the observed ones than background values for both
variable choices. This is especially the case for channels sensitive to water
vapour and liquid water. On the other hand, analysis increments in model space
(water vapour, liquid water) show significant differences between the two sets

fundamental concept of computer games research. Turing's chess algorithm from
1950 was able to think two moves ahead, and Shannon's work on chess from $1950$
includes an extensive section on evaluation functions to be used within a
search. Samuel's checkers program from 1959 already combines search and value
functions that are learned through self-play and bootstrapping. TD-Gammon
improves upon those ideas and uses neural networks to learn those complex value
functions -- only to be again used within search. The combination of
decision-time search and value functions has been present in the remarkable
milestones where computers bested their human counterparts in long standing
challenging games -- DeepBlue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go. Until recently,
this powerful framework of search aided with (learned) value functions has been
limited to perfect information games. As many interesting problems do not
provide the agent perfect information of the environment, this was an
unfortunate limitation. This thesis introduces the reader to sound search for
imperfect information games.

been studied and debated extensively in recent years. Under this assumption,
the hot spots and cold spots of the CMB are expected to be uniformly
distributed over a 2-sphere. We use the orientation matrix, first proposed by
Watson (1965) and Scheidegger (1965) and associated shape and strength
parameters (Woodcock, 1977) to analyse whether the hot and cold spots of the
observed CMB temperature anisotropy field are uniformly placed. We demonstrate
the usefulness of our estimators by using simulated toy models containing
non-uniform data. We apply our method on several foreground minimized CMB maps
observed by WMAP and Planck over large angular scales. The shape and strength
parameters constrain geometric features of possible deviations from uniformity
(isotropy) and the power of the anomalous signal. We find that distributions of
hot or cold spots in cleaned maps show no unusual signature of clustering or
girdling. Instead, we notice a strikingly uniform distribution of hot spots
over the full sky. The signal remains robust with respect to the four cleaned
maps used and presence or absence of the non-Gaussian cold spot (NGCS). On the
partial sky with WMAP KQ75 and Planck U73 masks we find anomalously low
strength of non-uniformity for cold spots which is found to be robust with
respect to various cleaning methods, masks applied, instruments, frequencies,
and the presence or absence of the NGCS. Interestingly we find that the signal
of anomalously weak non-uniformity could be due to contributions from the
quadrupole and octupole and may be related with the low CMB temperature
variance anomaly.

these cases. We compare our numerical estimate with a model that includes, in
addition to the Gaussian one, only the non-Gaussian terms that are large for

many new phenomena, including an ADE classification when the Jacobi ring has
dimension zero and, by suitably taking limits, a further ADE classification in

and those with infinite multiplicity in Arnold's classification. We obtain
normal forms away from some exceptional Type E cases. Remarkably these normal
forms have no moduli, and the key new feature is that the noncommutative world
affords larger families, and there are many more examples of each type.
  The first application of noncommutative singularity theory is to the
birational geometry of 3-folds. We prove that all local normal forms of Type A

algebra of some smooth 3-fold flop or divisor-to-curve contraction. The general
elephant of the corresponding contraction has matching type, and so this fully
classifies contraction algebras of flops of length one and two. In the process,
we describe the first and conjecturally only infinite family of length two

noncommutative obstructions forcing gaps in the invariants that can arise.

unity, it is clear that the system will, after a few cycles, converge on some
single population, extinguishing the other two."" Here, we explore different
ways of introducing discrete stochastic dynamics based on May and Leonard's ODE
model, with application to ecological population dynamics, and to a neuromotor
central pattern generator system. We study examples of several quantitatively
distinct asymptotic behaviors, including total extinction of all species,
extinction to a single species, and persistent cyclic dominance with finite

the shock front, which induce electrostatic plasma waves (wakefield) and
transverse filamentary structures in the upstream region via the

a new graph parameter, which we call weak degeneracy. By definition, every
$d$-degenerate graph is also weakly $d$-degenerate. On the other hand, if $G$
is weakly $d$-degenerate, then $\chi(G) \leq d + 1$ (and, moreover, the same
bound holds for the list-chromatic and even the DP-chromatic number of $G$). It
turns out that several upper bounds in graph coloring theory can be phrased in
terms of weak degeneracy. For example, we show that planar graphs are weakly
$4$-degenerate, which implies Thomassen's famous theorem that planar graphs are
$5$-list-colorable. We also prove a version of Brooks's theorem for weak
degeneracy: a connected graph $G$ of maximum degree $d \geq 3$ is weakly
$(d-1)$-degenerate unless $G \cong K_{d + 1}$. (By contrast, all $d$-regular
graphs have degeneracy $d$.) We actually prove an even stronger result, namely
that for every $d \geq 3$, there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that if $G$ is a graph
of weak degeneracy at least $d$, then either $G$ contains a $(d+1)$-clique or
the maximum average degree of $G$ is at least $d + \epsilon$. Finally, we show
that graphs of maximum degree $d$ and either of girth at least $5$ or of
bounded chromatic number are weakly $(d - \Omega(\sqrt{d}))$-degenerate, which
is best possible up to the value of the implied constant.

coupled to a boundary magnetic impurity. Our main finding is that quantum
fluctuations lead to the destruction of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) intra-gap
bound-states in all but a narrow region of the phase diagram. We carry out our
analysis in three stages, increasing the role of the quantum fluctuations at
each stage. First we consider the limit of a classical impurity and study the
bulk semiclassically, finding YSR states throughout the phase diagram, a
situation similar to conventional BCS superconductors. In the second stage, we
reintroduce quantum fluctuations in the bulk and find that the YSR state is
suppressed over half of the phase diagram, existing only around the quantum
critical point separating the unscreened and the partially screened phases. In
the final stage we solve exactly the full interacting model with arbitrary
coupling constants using Bethe Ansatz. We find that including both the quantum
fluctuating bulk and quantum impurity destabilizes the YSR state over most of
the phase diagram allowing it to exist only in a small region, the YSR regime,
between a Kondo-screened and an unscreened regime. Within the YSR regime a
first order phase transition occurs between a spin singlet and doublet ground
state. We also find that for large enough impurity spin exchange interaction a
renormalized Kondo-screened regime is established. In this regime, not found
for BCS superconductors, there is no YSR state and a renormalized Kondo
temperature scale is generated.

differences in anatomical features, acquisition parameters, and preprocessing
techniques, as factors that contribute to functional connectivity. Homologous
functional networks are compared across species, and aspects of the BOLD
fluctuations such as the topography of the global signal and the relationship
between structural and functional connectivity are examined. Time-varying
features of functional connectivity, obtained by sliding windowed approaches,
quasi-periodic patterns, and coactivation patterns, are compared across
species. Applications demonstrating the use of rs-fMRI as a translational tool

a classical potential plus a quantum deformation. Using exact WKB, we derive
exact quantization condition and its median resummation. The solution of median
resummed form gives physical Borel-Ecalle resummed results, as we show
explicitly in quantum deformed double- and triple- well potentials. Despite the
fact that instantons are finite action, for generic quantum deformation, they
do not contribute to the energy spectrum at leading order in semi-classics. For
certain quantized quantum deformations, where the alignment of levels to all
order in perturbation theory occurs, instantons contribute to the spectrum. If
deformation parameter is not properly quantized, their effect disappears, but
higher order effects in semi-classics survive. In this sense, we classify
saddle contributions as fading and robust. Finally, for quantum deformed
triple-well potential, we demonstrate the P-NP relation, by computing period
integrals and Mellin transform.

  Reachability",,,,,"cs.PL cs.FL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dyck reachability is the standard formulation of a large domain of static
analyses, as it achieves the sweet spot between precision and efficiency, and
has thus been studied extensively. Interleaved Dyck reachability (denoted
$D_k\odot D_k$) uses two Dyck languages for increased precision (e.g., context
and field sensitivity) but is well-known to be undecidable. As many static
analyses yield a certain type of bidirected graphs, they give rise to
interleaved bidirected Dyck reachability problems. Although these problems have
seen numerous applications, their decidability and complexity has largely
remained open. In a recent work, Li et al. made the first steps in this
direction, showing that (i) $D_1\odot D_1$ reachability (i.e., when both Dyck
languages are over a single parenthesis and act as counters) is computable in
$O(n^7)$ time, while (ii) $D_k\odot D_k$ reachability is NP-hard.
  In this work we address the decidability and complexity of all variants of
interleaved bidirected Dyck reachability. First, we show that $D_1\odot D_1$
reachability can be computed in $O(n^3\cdot \alpha(n))$ time, significantly
improving over the existing $O(n^7)$ bound. Second, we show that $D_k\odot D_1$
reachability (i.e., when one language acts as a counter) is decidable, in
contrast to the non-bidirected case where decidability is open. We further
consider $D_k\odot D_1$ reachability where the counter remains linearly
bounded. Our third result shows that this bounded variant can be solved in
$O(n^2\cdot \alpha(n))$ time, while our fourth result shows that the problem
has a (conditional) quadratic lower bound, and thus our upper bound is
essentially optimal. Fifth, we show that full $D_k\odot D_k$ reachability is
undecidable. This improves the recent NP-hardness lower-bound, and shows that
the problem is equivalent to the non-bidirected case.

between two points (i.e., microstructures) in the microstructure space and
quantifying the pathway associated with microstructural evolution, based on a
recently introduced set of hierarchical $n$-point polytope functions $P_n$. The
$P_n$ functions provide the probability of finding particular $n$-point
configurations associated with regular $n$-polytopes in the material system,
and a special sub-set of the standard $n$-point correlation functions $S_n$
that effectively decomposes the structural features in the systems into regular
polyhedral basis with different symmetry. The $n$-th order metric $\Omega_n$ is
defined as the $\mathbb{L}_1$ norm associated with the $P_n$ functions of two
distinct microstructures. By choosing a reference initial state (i.e., a
microstructure associated with $t_0 = 0$), the $\Omega_n(t)$ set quantifies the
evolution of distinct polyhedral symmetries and can in principle capture
emerging polyhedral symmetries that are not apparent in the initial state. To
demonstrate their utility, we apply the $\Omega_n$ metrics to a 2D binary
system undergoing spinodal decomposition to extract the phase separation
dynamics via the temporal scaling behavior of the corresponding $\Omega_n(t)$,
which reveals mechanisms governing the evolution. Moreover, we employ
$\Omega_n(t)$ to analyze pattern evolution during vapor-deposition of
phase-separating alloy films with different surface contact angles, which
exhibit rich evolution dynamics including both unstable and oscillating
patterns. The $\Omega_n$ metrics have potential applications in establishing
quantitative processing-structure-property relationships, as well as real-time

carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the distribution and global properties of

the technologies and techniques needed for this goal, a Pathfinder instrument
has been constructed and fielded. Sensitive to CO(1-0) emission from
$z=2.4$-$3.4$ and a fainter contribution from CO(2-1) at $z=6$-8, the
Pathfinder is surveying $12$ deg$^2$ in a 5-year observing campaign to detect
the CO signal from $z\sim3$. Using data from the first 13 months of observing,
we estimate $P_\mathrm{CO}(k) = -2.7 \pm 1.7 \times 10^4\mu\mathrm{K}^2
\mathrm{Mpc}^3$ on scales $k=0.051-0.62 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ - the first direct
3D constraint on the clustering component of the CO(1-0) power spectrum. Based
on these observations alone, we obtain a constraint on the amplitude of the
clustering component (the squared mean CO line temperature-bias product) of
$\langle Tb\rangle^2<49$ $\mu$K$^2$ - nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement
on the previous best measurement. These constraints allow us to rule out two
models from the literature. We forecast a detection of the power spectrum after
5 years with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 9-17. Cross-correlation with an
overlapping galaxy survey will yield a detection of the CO-galaxy power
spectrum with S/N of 19. We are also conducting a 30 GHz survey of the Galactic

delivering early science products. With 19 receiver channels in a hexagonal

frequency range with 2 MHz resolution, it is ideally suited to measuring
CO($J$=1-0) from $z\sim3$. In this paper we discuss strategies for designing
and building the Pathfinder and the challenges that were encountered. The
design of the instrument prioritized LIM requirements over those of ancillary
science. After a couple of years of operation, the instrument is well
understood, and the first year of data is already yielding useful science
results. Experience with this Pathfinder will drive the design of the next

detector readouts to calibrated sky maps. This pipeline implements four main
steps: gain calibration, filtering, data selection, and map-making. Absolute
gain calibration relies on a combination of instrumental and astrophysical
sources, while relative gain calibration exploits real-time total-power
variations. High efficiency filtering is achieved through spectroscopic
common-mode rejection within and across receivers, resulting in nearly
uncorrelated white noise within single-frequency channels. Consequently,
near-optimal but biased maps are produced by binning the filtered time stream
into pixelized maps; the corresponding signal bias transfer function is
estimated through simulations. Data selection is performed automatically
through a series of goodness-of-fit statistics, including $\chi^2$ and
multi-scale correlation tests. Applying this pipeline to the first-season COMAP
data, we produce a dataset with very low levels of correlated noise. We find
that one of our two scanning strategies (the Lissajous type) is sensitive to
residual instrumental systematics. As a result, we no longer use this type of
scan and exclude data taken this way from our Season 1 power spectrum
estimates. We perform a careful analysis of our data processing and observing
efficiencies and take account of planned improvements to estimate our future
performance. Power spectrum results derived from the first-season COMAP maps
are presented and discussed in companion papers.

Array Project aimed at extending CO intensity mapping to the Epoch of

two additional 30 GHz instruments and a new 16 GHz receiver. This combination
of frequencies will be able to simultaneously map CO(1--0) and CO(2--1) at
reionization redshifts ($z\sim5-8$) in addition to providing a significant
boost to the $z\sim3$ sensitivity of the Pathfinder. We examine a set of
existing models of the EoR CO signal, and find power spectra spanning several
orders of magnitude, highlighting our extreme ignorance about this period of
cosmic history and the value of the COMAP-EoR measurement. We carry out the
most detailed forecast to date of an intensity mapping cross-correlation, and
find that five out of the six models we consider yield signal to noise ratios
(S/N) $\gtrsim20$ for COMAP-EoR, with the brightest reaching a S/N above 400.
We show that, for these models, COMAP-EoR can make a detailed measurement of
the cosmic molecular gas history from $z\sim2-8$, as well as probe the
population of faint, star-forming galaxies predicted by these models to be
undetectable by traditional surveys. We show that, for the single model that
does not predict numerous faint emitters, a COMAP-EoR-type measurement is
required to rule out their existence. We briefly explore prospects for a
third-generation Expanded Reionization Array (COMAP-ERA) capable of detecting
the faintest models and characterizing the brightest signals in extreme detail.

design stages can significantly reduce the design cycle. Especially during

attempts using Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to tackle congestion
prediction during the logic synthesis stage. However, they require informative
cell features to achieve reasonable performance since the core idea of GNNs is
built on the message passing framework, which would be impractical at the early
logic synthesis stage. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that

Node2vec, LINE, and DeepWalk suffer from the issue of cross-graph alignment and
poor generalization to unseen netlist graphs, yielding inferior performance and

the memory restriction for large-scale netlists. We present results utilizing
open-source EDA tools such as DREAMPLACE and OPENROAD frameworks on a variety

to new circuit lines, and is efficient in training, potentially saving over $90

arises from cooperative effects. Thus, the total rectification current cannot
be obtained from an effective one-component active fluid with the same average
self-propulsion speed, highlighting the importance of considering diversity in
active matter. Finally, rectification alters particle evaporation and
absorption by the layer, making the density of the dilute phase increase with
the global density. Therefore, the steady state violates the lever rule, a
result which is valid even for systems of identical particles.

We design a spiking version of the successful residual network architecture and

Oversampling instances of the tail classes attempts to solve this imbalance.
However, the limited visual diversity results in a network with poor
representation ability. A simple counter to this is decoupling the
representation and classifier networks and using oversampling only to train the
classifier. In this paper, instead of repeatedly re-sampling the same image
(and thereby features), we explore a direction that attempts to generate
meaningful features by estimating the tail category's distribution. Inspired by
ideas from recent work on few-shot learning, we create calibrated distributions
to sample additional features that are subsequently used to train the
classifier. Through several experiments on the CIFAR-100-LT (long-tail) dataset
with varying imbalance factors and on mini-ImageNet-LT (long-tail), we show the

its squared Hamiltonian which removes the particle-hole symmetry and thus one
bipartite lattice, allowing to write the Hamiltonian in terms of a $2\times 2$
matrix. This brings to the front the three main physical actors of twisted
systems: kinetic energy, confinement potential and an interlayer interaction
operator which is divided in two parts: a non-Abelian interlayer operator and
an operator which contains an interaction energy between layers. Here, each of
these components is analyzed as a function of the angle of rotation, as well as
in terms of the wave-function localization properties. In particular, it is
proved that the non-Abelian operator represents interlayer currents between
each layer triangular sublattices, i.e., a second-neighbor interlayer current
between bipartite sublattices. A crossover is seen between such contributions
and thus the first magic angle is different from other higher order magic
angles. Such angles are determined by a balance between the negative energy
contribution from interlayer currents and the positive contributions from the
kinetic and confinement energies. A perturbative analysis performed around the
first magic angle allows to explore analytically the details of such energy
balance.

Lazy Random Walk: with probability p (called the laziness parameter), they

they move to a random adjacent node. The team seeks the common value of p which
achieves social distance in the least expected time, which is the absorption
time of a Markov chain.

bijections from $s$ input blocks to $s$ output blocks such that no information
can be obtained about any input block in the absence of any output block.
Numerous generalizations and extensions of all-or-nothing transforms have been
discussed in recent years, many of which are motivated by diverse applications
in cryptography, information security, secure distributed storage, etc. In
particular, $t$-AONTs, in which no information can be obtained about any $t$
input blocks in the absence of any $t$ output blocks, have received
considerable study.
  In this paper, we study three generalizations of AONTs that are motivated by
applications due to Pham et al. and Oliveira et al. We term these
generalizations rectangular, range, and restricted AONTs. Briefly, in a
rectangular AONT, the number of outputs is greater than the number of inputs. A
range AONT satisfies the $t$-AONT property for a range of consecutive values of
$t$. Finally, in a restricted AONT, the unknown outputs are assumed to occur
within a specified set of ""secure"" output blocks. We study existence and
non-existence and provide examples and constructions for these generalizations.
We also demonstrate interesting connections with combinatorial structures such
as orthogonal arrays, split orthogonal arrays, MDS codes and difference

subset of houses in a community while still eliminating enough infestations to
interrupt disease transfer. Here we develop a sequential sampling framework
that adapts to information specific to a community as more houses are visited,
thereby allowing us to efficiently find homes with domiciliary vectors while
minimizing sampling bias. The method fits Bayesian geostatistical models to
make spatially informed predictions, while gradually transitioning from
prioritizing houses based on prediction uncertainty to targeting houses with a
high risk of infestation. A key feature of the method is the use of a single
exploration parameter, $\alpha$, to control the rate of transition between
these two design targets. In a simulation study using empirical data from five
villages in southeastern Guatemala, we test our method using a range of values
for $\alpha$, and find it can consistently select fewer homes than random
sampling, while still bringing the village infestation rate below a given
threshold. We further find that when additional socioeconomic information is

cofinal Bourbaki-completeness (equivalently, uniform strong-paracompactness) of
uniform spaces. In particular, we solve several primary problems related to
products, subspaces, hyperspaces, metric spaces and fine spaces. Moreover, we
show that completeness and cofinal completeness are, respectively, equivalent
to Bourbaki-completeness and cofinal Bourbaki-completeness whenever we consider
uniformities having a base of star-finite covers. In the second part, we embed
the Bourbaki-complete metric spaces (and after, the Bourbaki-complete uniform
spaces) into an universal space. Next, we characterized those metric spaces
which are metrizable by a Bourbaki-complete metric or cofinally
Bourbaki-complete metric. In the third part we characterize the Samuel
realcompact spaces, that is, those uniform spaces which are complete with the
weak uniformity induced by all the real-valued uniformly continuous functions

natural step in order to generalize the above result, we study which kind of

positive trace-preserving (PTP) channels and associated master equations. The
models are defined in any finite Hilbert space, but the main results are for
dimension $N = 2$. For every normalizable linear or nonlinear positive map
$\phi$ on bounded linear operators $X$, there is an associated normalized PTP
channel $ \phi(X) / {\rm tr}[\phi(X)]$. Normalized PTP channels include unitary
mean field theories, such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for interacting
bosons, as well as models of linear and nonlinear dissipation. They classify
into 4 types, yielding 3 distinct forms of nonlinearity whose computational
power we explore. In the qubit case these channels support Bloch ball torsion
and other distortions studied previously, where it has been shown that such
nonlinearity can be used to increase the separation between a pair of close
qubit states, resulting in an exponential speedup for state discrimination.
Building on this idea, we argue that this operation can be made robust to noise
by using dissipation to induce a bifurcation to a phase where a pair of stable
fixed points create an intrinisically fault-tolerant nonlinear state

owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness
of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment
in the clinic. Most models produce point estimates without further information
about model uncertainty or confidence. This paper introduces a new Bayesian DL
framework for uncertainty quantification in segmentation neural networks:
SUPER-Net: trustworthy medical image Segmentation with Uncertainty Propagation
in Encoder-decodeR Networks. SUPER-Net analytically propagates, using Taylor
series approximations, the first two moments (mean and covariance) of the
posterior distribution of the model parameters across the nonlinear layers. In
particular, SUPER-Net simultaneously learns the mean and covariance without
expensive post-hoc Monte Carlo sampling or model ensembling. The output
consists of two simultaneous maps: the segmented image and its pixelwise
uncertainty map, which corresponds to the covariance matrix of the predictive
distribution. We conduct an extensive evaluation of SUPER-Net on medical image
segmentation of Magnetic Resonances Imaging and Computed Tomography scans under
various noisy and adversarial conditions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SUPER-Net is more robust to noise and adversarial
attacks than state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreover, the uncertainty
map of the proposed SUPER-Net associates low confidence (or equivalently high
uncertainty) to patches in the test input images that are corrupted with noise,
artifacts, or adversarial attacks. Perhaps more importantly, the model exhibits
the ability of self-assessment of its segmentation decisions, notably when
making erroneous predictions due to noise or adversarial examples.

reduce distortion and margin cropping to a minimum while enhancing stability.

advantage of the known properties of Hamiltonian dynamics and are more
discriminative of the model's ability to capture the underlying dynamics than
reconstruction error. Using SyMetric, we identify a set of architectural

  Learning","RL in Games Workshop AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The creation and destruction of agents in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) is a critically under-explored area of research.
Current MARL algorithms often assume that the number of agents within a group
remains fixed throughout an experiment. However, in many practical problems, an
agent may terminate before their teammates. This early termination issue
presents a challenge: the terminated agent must learn from the group's success
or failure which occurs beyond its own existence. We refer to propagating value
from rewards earned by remaining teammates to terminated agents as the
Posthumous Credit Assignment problem. Current MARL methods handle this problem
by placing these agents in an absorbing state until the entire group of agents
reaches a termination condition. Although absorbing states enable existing
algorithms and APIs to handle terminated agents without modification, practical
training efficiency and resource use problems exist.
  In this work, we first demonstrate that sample complexity increases with the
quantity of absorbing states in a toy supervised learning task for a fully
connected network, while attention is more robust to variable size input. Then,
we present a novel architecture for an existing state-of-the-art MARL algorithm
which uses attention instead of a fully connected layer with absorbing states.
Finally, we demonstrate that this novel architecture significantly outperforms

high quality solutions of NP-hard problems. This is done by mapping a problem
onto the physical qubits of the quantum chip, from which a solution is obtained
after quantum annealing. However, since the connectivity of the physical qubits
on the chip is limited, a minor embedding of the problem structure onto the

qubits will stay unused. We propose a novel method, called parallel quantum
annealing, to make better use of available qubits, wherein either the same or
several independent problems are solved in the same annealing cycle of a
quantum annealer, assuming enough physical qubits are available to embed more
than one problem. Although the individual solution quality may be slightly
decreased when solving several problems in parallel (as opposed to solving each
problem separately), we demonstrate that our method may give dramatic speed-ups

resulting definition of exploration can be applied in infinite problems and
non-dynamic learning methods, which the dynamic notion of exploration cannot
tolerate. To understand the way that modifications of an agent affect learning,
we describe a novel structure on the set of agents: a collection of distances

measure dynamical masses within their half-light radius. We supplement our data

system richness. We do not find the correlation between GC numbers and UDG

if all agents in a multi-player general-sum normal-form game employ Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU), the external regret of every player is
$O(\textrm{polylog}(T))$ after $T$ repetitions of the game. We extend their
result from external regret to internal regret and swap regret, thereby
establishing uncoupled learning dynamics that converge to an approximate
correlated equilibrium at the rate of $\tilde{O}(T^{-1})$. This substantially
improves over the prior best rate of convergence for correlated equilibria of
$O(T^{-3/4})$ due to Chen and Peng (NeurIPS`20), and it is optimal -- within
the no-regret framework -- up to polylogarithmic factors in $T$.
  To obtain these results, we develop new techniques for establishing
higher-order smoothness for learning dynamics involving fixed point operations.
Specifically, we establish that the no-internal-regret learning dynamics of
Stoltz and Lugosi (Mach Learn`05) are equivalently simulated by
no-external-regret dynamics on a combinatorial space. This allows us to trade
the computation of the stationary distribution on a polynomial-sized Markov
chain for a (much more well-behaved) linear transformation on an
exponential-sized set, enabling us to leverage similar techniques as DFG to
near-optimally bound the internal regret.
  Moreover, we establish an $O(\textrm{polylog}(T))$ no-swap-regret bound for
the classic algorithm of Blum and Mansour (BM) (JMLR`07). We do so by
introducing a technique based on the Cauchy Integral Formula that circumvents
the more limited combinatorial arguments of DFG. In addition to shedding
clarity on the near-optimal regret guarantees of BM, our arguments provide
insights into the various ways in which the techniques by DFG can be extended
and leveraged in the analysis of more involved learning algorithms.

with few transmit/receive antennas, where additional sparsity due to large
number of antennas is not a possibility. For such systems the sparsity of the
effective delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel is adversely affected in the
presence of channel path delay and Doppler shifts which are non-integer
multiples of the delay and Doppler domain resolution. The sparsity is also
adversely affected when practical transmit and receive pulses are used. In this
paper we propose a Modified Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation (M-MLE)
method for OTFS based systems which exploits the fine delay and Doppler domain
resolution of the OTFS modulated signal to decouple the joint estimation of the
channel parameters (i.e., channel gain, delay and Doppler shift) of all channel
paths into separate estimation of the channel parameters for each path. We
further observe that with fine delay and Doppler domain resolution, the
received DD domain signal along a particular channel path can be written as a
product of a delay domain term and a Doppler domain term where the delay domain
term is primarily dependent on the delay of this path and the Doppler domain
term is primarily dependent on the Doppler shift of this path. This allows us
to propose another method termed as the two-step method (TSE), where the joint
two-dimensional estimation of the delay and Doppler shift of a particular path
in the M-MLE method is further decoupled into two separate one-dimensional
estimation for the delay and for the Doppler shift of that path. Simulations
reveal that the proposed methods (M-MLE and TSE) achieve better channel
estimation accuracy at lower complexity when compared to other known methods
for accurate OTFS channel estimation.

diffusion equation and as a result, it is widely used for modeling climate. On
the other hand, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are to learn a
latent governing equation of ODE from data. In our presented method, we combine
them into a single framework and propose a concept, called neural diffusion
equation (NDE). Our NDE, equipped with the diffusion equation and one more
additional neural network to model inherent uncertainty, can learn an
appropriate latent governing equation that best describes a given climate
dataset. In our experiments with two real-world and one synthetic datasets and
eleven baselines, our method consistently outperforms existing baselines by
non-trivial margins.

desirable to have a single model that works across a range of tasks. In the
medical domain, sequential training on tasks may sometimes be the only way to
train models, either because access to the original (potentially sensitive)
data is no longer available, or simply owing to the computational costs
inherent to joint retraining. A major issue inherent to sequential learning,
however, is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a substantial drop in accuracy on
prior tasks when a model is updated for a new task. Elastic Weight
Consolidation is a recently proposed method to address this issue, but scaling
this approach to the modern large models used in practice requires making
strong independence assumptions about model parameters, limiting its
effectiveness. In this work, we apply Kronecker Factorization--a recent
approach that relaxes independence assumptions--to prevent catastrophic
forgetting in convolutional and Transformer-based neural networks at scale. We
show the effectiveness of this technique on the important and illustrative task
of medical entity linking across three datasets, demonstrating the capability
of the technique to be used to make efficient updates to existing methods as
new medical data becomes available. On average, the proposed method reduces
catastrophic forgetting by 51% when using a BERT-based model, compared to a 27%
reduction using standard Elastic Weight Consolidation, while maintaining
spatial complexity proportional to the number of model parameters.

them with the power of remote learning solutions? In this case study, we
present observations of in-person and online versions of 2 introductory

Road-boundary is one of the most important information contained in HD maps
since it distinguishes between road areas and off-road areas, which can guide
vehicles to drive within road areas. But it is labor-intensive to annotate road
boundaries for HD maps at the city scale. To enable automatic HD map
annotation, current work uses semantic segmentation or iterative graph growing
for road-boundary detection. However, the former could not ensure topological

continuous road-boundary graph (i.e., vertices and edges) from this image. To
generate the city-scale road-boundary graph, we stitch the obtained graphs from
all the image patches. Our csBoundary is evaluated and compared on a public

$\ell_{2}$ normalization. For domain adaptation tasks, however, we find that
contrastive learning with the standard paradigm does not perform well. The
reason is mainly that the class weights (weights of the final fully connected
layer) are not involved during optimization, which does not guarantee the
produced features to be clustered around the class weights learned from source
data. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful probabilistic
contrastive learning (PCL) in this paper, which not only produces compact
features but also enforces them to be distributed around the class weights.
Specifically, we break the traditional contrastive learning paradigm
(feature+$\ell_{2}$ normalization) by replacing the features with probabilities
and removing $\ell_{2}$ normalization. In this way, we can enforce the
probability to approximate the one-hot form, thereby narrowing the distance
between the features and the class weights. PCL is generic due to conciseness,
which can be used for different tasks. In this paper, we conduct extensive
experiments on five tasks, \textit{i.e.}, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),
semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), semi-supervised learning (SSL), UDA
detection, and UDA semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate that our PCL
can bring significant gains for these tasks. In particular, for segmentation
tasks, with the blessing of PCL, our method achieves or even surpasses CPSL-D

studying the innate immune response and combating antibiotic resistance, and
more broadly, precision medicine and public health. There have been extensive
studies on the statistical and computational approaches to identify (i) whether
a peptide is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) or a non-AMP and (ii) which targets
are these sequences effective to (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, etc.). Despite
the existing deep learning methods on this problem, most of them are unable to
handle the small AMP classes (anti-insect, anti-parasite, etc.). And more
importantly, some AMPs can have multiple targets, which the previous methods
fail to consider. In this study, we build a diverse and comprehensive
multi-label protein sequence database by collecting and cleaning amino acids
from various AMP databases. To generate efficient representations and features
for the small classes dataset, we take advantage of a protein language model
trained on 250 million protein sequences. Based on that, we develop an
end-to-end hierarchical multi-label deep forest framework, HMD-AMP, to annotate
AMP comprehensively. After identifying an AMP, it further predicts what targets
the AMP can effectively kill from eleven available classes. Extensive
experiments suggest that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in
both the binary classification task and the multi-label classification task,
especially on the minor classes.The model is robust against reduced features
and small perturbations and produces promising results. We believe HMD-AMP
contributes to both the future wet-lab investigations of the innate structural
properties of different antimicrobial peptides and build promising empirical
underpinnings for precise medicine with antibiotics.

into four epochs, we search for periodic signals that are persistent throughout
any of these epochs, using two independent methods: Lomb-Scargle periodogram
and Gregory-Loredo Algorithm. No statistically significant periodic signal is
found with either method on any of the four epochs. Our extensive simulations
of source light curves suggest that this non-detection is primarily due to a
moderate sensitivity of the CDF-S data in QPO detection. Using the
simulation-predicted detection efficiency, we are able to provide a meaningful
constraint on the intrinsic occurrence rate of persistent QPOs, < (15-20) %,
provided that they share a similar power spectral density with a handful of
currently known AGN QPOs. The true intrinsic occurrence rate might be
significantly below this upper limit, however, given the non-detection among
the CDF-S sources. Our additional search for short-lived QPOs that are only

distinctly decouples the image and noise in the latent space and losslessly
reconstructs them via a series of invertible transformations. We further
present a variable swapping strategy to align structural information in images
and a noise correlation matrix to constrain the noise based on spatially
minimized correlation information. Experimental results demonstrate FINO's
capacity to remove both synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and real
noise. Furthermore, the generalization of FINO to the removal of spatially
variant noise and noise with inaccurate estimation surpasses that of the
popular and state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

unit) for brain activity, how can we predict their health outcomes as early as
possible? Early decision-making is critical in many applications, e.g.
monitoring patients may assist in early intervention and improved care. On the
other hand, early prediction on EEG data poses several challenges: (i)
earliness-accuracy trade-off; observing more data often increases accuracy but
sacrifices earliness, (ii) large-scale (for training) and streaming (online
decision-making) data processing, and (iii) multi-variate (due to multiple
electrodes) and multi-length (due to varying length of stay of patients) time
series. Motivated by this real-world application, we present BeneFitter that
infuses the incurred savings from an early prediction as well as the cost from
misclassification into a unified domain-specific target called benefit.
Unifying these two quantities allows us to directly estimate a single target
(i.e. benefit), and importantly, dictates exactly when to output a prediction:
when benefit estimate becomes positive. BeneFitter (a) is efficient and fast,
with training time linear in the number of input sequences, and can operate in
real-time for decision-making, (b) can handle multi-variate and variable-length
time-series, suitable for patient data, and (c) is effective, providing up to
2x time-savings with equal or better accuracy as compared to competitors.

In principle, the decrease in the post-selection probability will increase the
sensitivity. Besides, the sensitivity which characterizes the pointer position
shift is proportional to the real part of $\rm A_w$, and the sensitivity which
characterizes the pointer shift in momentum space is proportional to the
imaginary part of $\rm A_w$. However, we find that the relationship between the
post-selection probability and the sensitivity is true when $\rm A_w$ is a
purely real number or a purely imaginary number. The plural $\rm A_w$ will lead
to the abnormal behavior where the decrease in the post-selection probability
reduce the sensitivity at certain pre- and post-selection. In addition,
considering the device imperfections and the environmental instability in the
WVA protocol, this anomaly raised from plural $\rm A_w$ will reduce the
sensitivity and generate a systematic error of the measurement compared with
the original scheme. Finally, three feasible methods are proposed to reduce
these negative effects when the weak measurement inevitably changes into

bisection-style iterations, is recommended to convert the matrix to positive

suggested as the proxy for the unobservable stochastic variance. When the
implied volatility is not available, a simple trick is provided to fill in the
missing correlations. Numerical study shows that the estimates are reasonably
accurate, when using more than 1,000 data points. In addition, the algorithm is
robust to misspecified interest rate model parameters and the

extended to the open locus of objects without extra automorphisms. The
existence of tautological families on a Zariski open set of its coarse moduli
can be interpreted in terms of rationality of the stack if the coarse moduli
space is rational. Combining our results with known results on the rationality
of the coarse moduli of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and the coarse moduli of plane

homogeneous varieties which are rational if $\textrm{char}(\mathbb{k}) = 0$.

systematic approach allows us to describe key physical properties of solar
flare magnetism, including distributions of magnetic flux, magnetic shear,
vertical current and net current over flaring versus non-flaring parts of the
active region, and compare these with flare/CME properties. Our analysis
suggests that while flares are guided by the physical properties that scale
with AR size, like the total amount of magnetic flux that participates in the
reconnection process and the total current (extensive properties), CMEs are
guided by mean properties, like the fraction of the AR magnetic flux that
participates (intensive property), with little dependence on the amount of
shear at polarity inversion line (PIL) or the net current. We find that the
non-neutralized current is proportional to the amount of shear at PIL,
providing direct evidence that net vertical currents are formed as a result of
any mechanism that could generate magnetic shear along PIL. We also find that
eruptive events tend to have smaller PIL fluxes and larger magnetic shears than
confined events. Our analysis provides a reference for more realistic solar and
stellar flare models. The database is available online and can be used for

potential applications in biomedical sensing and wearable devices. Among
flexible and wearable pressure sensors, capacitive pressure sensors show
significant advantages, owing to their potential low cost, ultra-low power
consumption, tolerance to temperature variations, high sensitivity, and low
hysteresis. In this work, we develop capacitive flexible pressure sensors using
graphene based conductive foams. In these soft and porous conductive foams,
graphene is present either as a coating of the pores in the foam, inside the
structure of the foam itself, or a combination of both. We demonstrate that
they are durable and sensitive at low pressure ranges (<10 kPa). Systematic
analysis of the different pressure sensors revealed that the porous foams with
graphene coated pores are the most sensitive (~ 0.137/kPa) in the pressure
range 0-6kPa. Additionally, we achieved very low limit of detection of 0.14 Pa,
which is one of the lowest values reported. Further, we demonstrated the
potential applications of our pressure sensors by showing detection of weak
physiological signals of the body. Our work is highly relevant for research in
flexible pressure sensors based on conductive foams as it shows the impact of
different ways of incorporating conductive material on performance of pressure

in controlling the strength of twinned metallic nanopillars. One of the reasons
attributed to this strengthening behaviour is the force exerted by the TBs on
dislocations. Since the TBs exert repulsive force on dislocations and the
plasticity in nanopillars is surface controlled, it is interesting to know
whether the TB position from the nanowire surface has any effect on the
strength of twinned nanopillars. Using atomistic simulations, here we show that
the TB position significantly influences the strength of twinned nanopillars.
Atomistic simulations have been performed on nanopillar containing one and two
TBs and their position is varied within nanopillar from the center to the
surface. The results indicate that in nanopillar containing a single TB, the
strength is maximum when the TB is located at the center of the nanopillar and
it decreases as the TB is shifted towards the nanopillar surface. On the other
hand in nanopillar containing two TBs, the maximum strength is observed when
the twin boundaries are placed at distance of one fourth or one fifth the
pillar size from the surfaces and it decreases when TBs are moved on either
side. The present study demonstrates that the mechanical properties of the
twinned nanopillars can be controlled by carefully tailoring the position of
the TBs within the nanopillars.

In contrast, the LM does not seem to perform as well when dealing with pattern

large (e.g. with more than 500 weights). In this paper, we exploit the true
power of LM algorithm using some real world aircraft datasets. On these

paper uses two experiments to study how message senders are affected by
receivers' motivated beliefs. Experiment 1, conducted using an online sample of
social media users, analyzes the effect of incentivizing senders to be
perceived as truthful. These incentives cause senders to send less truthful
messages. When incentivized, senders send more false information when it aligns
with receivers' politically-motivated beliefs, controlling for receivers'
current beliefs. However, receivers do not anticipate the adverse effects of
senders' incentives. Experiment 2 further isolates the role that information
processing plays by analyzing an environment in which receivers assess the
truthfulness of messages from a computer and senders choose one of the
computer's messages to determine their earnings. Senders predict that receivers
distort information processing in the direction of their politics, demand
information about receivers' political preferences, and condition on the
receivers' politics to strategically choose less truthful computer messages.

splashing during the impact process is obtained based on the theory of
aerodynamics analysis of the lamella. At increased environmental pressure, the
threshold speed of the impact decreases with increasing the environmental
pressure because the wedge of the lamella is prevented from moving forward and
is driven to detach from the substrate by the air ahead, which has a higher

rapidly collect data from an object that is moving or changing with time.
Tomographic acquisition is generally assumed to be step-and-shoot, where the
object is rotated to each desired angle, and a view is taken. However,
step-and-shoot acquisition is slow and can waste photons, so in practice
fly-scanning is done where the object is continuously rotated while collecting
data. However, this can result in motion-blurred views and consequently
reconstructions with severe motion artifacts.
  In this paper, we introduce CodEx, a modular framework for joint de-blurring
and tomographic reconstruction that can effectively invert the motion blur
introduced in sparse view fly-scanning. The method is a synergistic combination
of a novel acquisition method with a novel non-convex Bayesian reconstruction
algorithm. CodEx works by encoding the acquisition with a known binary code
that the reconstruction algorithm then inverts. Using a well chosen binary code
to encode the measurements can improve the accuracy of the inversion process.
The CodEx reconstruction method uses the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to split the inverse problem into iterative deblurring and
reconstruction sub-problems, making reconstruction practical to implement. We
present reconstruction results on both simulated and binned experimental data
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Douglas-Rachford algorithm for the problem $\min_x \{f(x)+g(x)\}$, where $f$
and $g$ are convex functions. Our approach relies on and highlights the natural
primal-dual symmetry between the above problem and its Fenchel dual $\min_{u}
\{ f^*(u) + g_*(u)\}$ where $g_*(u):=g^*(-u)$. Our main development is to show
the linear convergence of the algorithm when a natural error bound condition on
the Douglas-Rachford operator holds. We leverage our error bound condition
approach to show and estimate the algorithm's linear rate of convergence for
three special classes of problems. The first one is when $f$ or$g$ and $f^*$ or
$g_*$ are strongly convex relative to the primal and dual optimal sets
respectively. The second one is when~$f$ and~$g$ are piecewise linear-quadratic
functions. The third one is when~$f$ and~$g$ are the indicator functions of
closed convex cones. In all three cases the rate of convergence is determined
by a suitable measure of well-posedness of the problem. In the conic case, if
the two closed convex cones are a linear subspace $L$ and $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, we
establish the following stronger {\em finite termination} result: the
Douglas-Rachford algorithm identifies the {\em maximum support sets} for $L\cap
\mathbb{R}^n_+$ and $L^{\perp}\cap\mathbb{R}^n_+$ in finitely many steps. Our
developments have straightforward extensions to the more general linearly
constrained problem $\min_{x,y} \{f(x) + g( y):Ax + By = b\}$ thereby
highlighting a direct and straightforward relationship between the
Douglas-Rachford algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers

dynamics of the Hopf instabilities and traveling waves at a nonequilibrium
steady state of a spatially extended glycolysis model is assessed here by
implementing an analytically tractable scheme incorporating a complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). In the presence of self and cross diffusion, a
more general amplitude equation exploiting the multiscale Krylov-Bogoliubov
averaging method serves as an essential tool to reveal the various dynamical
instability criteria, especially Benjamin-Feir (BF) instability, to estimate
the corresponding nonlinear dispersion relation of the traveling wave pattern.
The critical control parameter, wave-number selection criteria, and magnitude
of the complex amplitude for traveling waves are modified by self- and
cross-diffusion coefficients within the oscillatory regime, and their
variabilities are exhibited against the amplitude equation. Unlike the
traveling waves, a low-amplitude broad region appears for the Hopf instability
in the concentration dynamics as the system phase passes through minima during
its variation with the control parameter. The total entropy production rate of
the uniform Hopf oscillation and glycolysis wave not only qualitatively
reflects the global dynamics of concentrations of intermediate species but
almost quantitatively. Despite the crucial role of diffusion in generating and
shaping the traveling waves, the diffusive part of the entropy production rate
has a negligible contribution to the system's total entropy production rate.
The Hopf instability shows a more complex and colossal change in the energy
profile of the open nonlinear system than in the traveling waves. A detailed
analysis of BF instability shows a contrary nature of the semigrand Gibbs free
energy with discrete and continuous wave numbers for the traveling wave.

observation of applying the deep learning-based reduced order model (DL-ROM) to

approximation for some special model parameters, but it cannot approximate the
drastic changes of the solution as time evolves. Based on this fact, we
classify the dataset according to the magnitude of the solutions and construct
corresponding subnets dependent on different types of data. Then we train a
classifier to integrate different subnets together to obtain the MC-ROM. When
subsets have the same architecture, we can use transfer learning techniques to
accelerate offline training. Numerical experiments show that the MC-ROM
improves the generalization ability of the DL-ROM both for diffusion- and
convection-dominant problems, and maintains the DL-ROM's advantage of good
approximation ability. We also compare the approximation accuracy and
computational efficiency of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which is
not suitable for convection-dominant problems. For diffusion-dominant problems,
the MC-ROM has better approximation accuracy than the POD in a small
dimensionality reduction space, and its computational performance is more
efficient than the POD.

timing jitter, making them useful for many optical measurement techniques such
as optical ranging and spectroscopy. However, the characterization of
low-jitter dual-comb systems is challenging because it requires measurement
techniques with high sensitivity. Motivated by this challenge, we developed a
technique based on an optical heterodyne detection approach for measuring the
relative timing jitter of two pulse trains. The method is suitable for
dual-comb systems with essentially any repetition rate difference. Furthermore,
the proposed approach allows for continuous and precise tracking of the
sampling rate. To demonstrate the technique, we perform a detailed
characterization of a single-mode-diode pumped $\mathrm{Yb:CaF_2}$ dual-comb
laser from a free-running polarization-multiplexed cavity. This new laser
produces 115 fs pulses at 160 MHz repetition rate, with 130 mW of average power
in each comb. The detection noise floor for the relative timing jitter between
the two pulse trains reaches $8.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{fs}^2/\mathrm{Hz}
\; ( \sim 896 \: \mathrm{zs}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}} )$, and the relative root mean
square (rms) timing jitter is 13 fs when integrating from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. This
performance indicates that the demonstrated laser is highly compatible with
practical dual-comb spectroscopy, ranging, and sampling applications.
Furthermore, our results show that the relative timing noise measurement
technique can characterize dual-comb systems operating in free-running mode or
with finite repetition rate differences while providing a sub-attosecond
resolution, which was not feasible with any other approach before.

revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by such
significant achievements, some pioneering works have recently been done on
employing Transformer-liked architectures in the computer vision (CV) field,
which have demonstrated their effectiveness on three fundamental CV tasks
(classification, detection, and segmentation) as well as multiple sensory data
stream (images, point clouds, and vision-language data). Because of their
competitive modeling capabilities, the visual Transformers have achieved
impressive performance improvements over multiple benchmarks as compared with
modern Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). In this survey, we have reviewed
over one hundred of different visual Transformers comprehensively according to
three fundamental CV tasks and different data stream types, where a taxonomy is
proposed to organize the representative methods according to their motivations,
structures, and application scenarios. Because of their differences on training
settings and dedicated vision tasks, we have also evaluated and compared all
these existing visual Transformers under different configurations. Furthermore,
we have revealed a series of essential but unexploited aspects that may empower
such visual Transformers to stand out from numerous architectures, e.g., slack
high-level semantic embeddings to bridge the gap between the visual
Transformers and the sequential ones. Finally, three promising research
directions are suggested for future investment. We will continue to update the

wave-based structural health monitoring (GW-SHM) rely on physics-defined
features of GW signals. In addition to requiring domain knowledge of the
interaction of various GW modes with various types of damages, they also suffer
from errors due to variations in environmental and operating conditions (EOCs)
in practical use cases. While several machine learning tools have been reported
for EOC compensation, they need to be custom-designed for each combination of
damage and structure due to their dependence on physics-defined feature
extraction. In this work, we propose a CNN-based automated feature extraction
framework coupled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based EOC compensation and
damage classification and localization method. Features learnt by the CNNs are
used for damage classification and localization of damage by modeling the
probability distribution of the features using GMMs. The Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence of these GMMs with respect to corresponding baseline GMMs are used
as signal difference coefficients (SDCs) to compute damage indices (DIs) along
various GW sensor paths, and thus for damage localization. The efficacy of the
proposed method is demonstrated using FE generated GW-data for an aluminum
plate with a network of six lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors, for three
different types of damages (rivet hole, added mass, notch) at various
temperatures, with added white noise and pink noise to incorporate errors due
to EOCs. We also present experimental validation of the method through
characterization of notch damage in an aluminum panel under varying and
non-uniform temperature profiles, using a portable custom-designed field
programmable gate array (FPGA) based signal transduction and data acquisition

are one of our best insights into the atmospheric escape process. However, due
to ISM absorption, we typically only observe the transit signature in the
blue-wing, making them challenging to interpret. This challenge has been
recently highlighted by non-detections from planets thought to be undergoing
vigorous escape. Pioneering 3D simulations have shown that escaping hydrogen is
shaped into a cometary tail receding from the planet. Motivated by this work,
we develop a simple model to interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ transits. Using this
framework, we show that the Lyman-$\alpha$ transit depth is primarily
controlled by the properties of the stellar tidal field rather than details of
the escape process. Instead, the transit duration provides a direct measurement
of the velocity of the planetary outflow. This result arises because the
underlying physics is the distance a neutral hydrogen atom can travel before it
is photoionized in the outflow. Thus, higher irradiation levels, expected to
drive more powerful outflows, produce weaker, shorter Lyman-$\alpha$ transits
because the outflowing gas is ionized more quickly. Our framework suggests that
the generation of energetic neutral atoms may dominate the transit signature
early, but the acceleration of planetary material produces long tails. Thus,
Lyman-$\alpha$ transits do not primarily probe the mass-loss rates. Instead,
they inform us about the velocity at which the escape mechanism is ejecting
material from the planet, providing a clean test of predictions from
atmospheric escape models.

this parameter represents a coupling constant of the gauge symmetry group. The

originating from certain imperfection in the sample. The former component,
attributable to vortex flow effect, is weakened at low temperatures where

systems help prevent occlusions in open surgery video data. Furthermore,
combining multiple views such as a Top-view camera covering the full operative

more comprehensive view of the surgical workflow. However, multi-camera data
fusion poses a new challenge: a tool may be visible in one camera and not the

regardless their visibility. Therefore, tools that are out of the image should
be remembered for extensive periods of time while the system responds quickly
to changes visible in the video.
  Methods: Participants (n=48) performed a simulated open bowel repair. A
Top-view and a Close-up cameras were used. YOLOv5 was used for tool and hand
detection. A high frequency LSTM with a 1 second window at 30 frames per second
(fps) and a low frequency LSTM with a 40 second window at 3 fps were used for
spatial, temporal, and multi-camera integration.
  Results: The accuracy and F1 of the six systems were: Top-view (0.88/0.88),
Close-up (0.81,0.83), both cameras (0.9/0.9), high fps LSTM (0.92/0.93), low

AI-related applications. Despite the large sizes, existing KGs are far from
complete and comprehensive. In order to continuously enrich KGs, automatic
knowledge construction and update mechanisms are usually utilized, which
inevitably bring in plenty of noise. However, most existing knowledge graph
embedding (KGE) methods assume that all the triple facts in KGs are correct,
and project both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space without
considering noise and knowledge conflicts. This will lead to low-quality and
unreliable representations of KGs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a
general multi-task reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly
alleviate the noisy data problem. In our framework, we exploit reinforcement
learning for choosing high-quality knowledge triples while filtering out the
noisy ones. Also, in order to take full advantage of the correlations among
semantically similar relations, the triple selection processes of similar
relations are trained in a collective way with multi-task learning. Moreover,
we extend popular KGE models TransE, DistMult, ConvE and RotatE with the
proposed framework. Finally, the experimental validation shows that our
approach is able to enhance existing KGE models and can provide more robust

approach based on polaronic and spin-dependent squeezing transformations
provides an effective Hamiltonian for the quantum Rabi model up to the second

and counter-rotating terms, going therefore beyond the rotating wave
approximation. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed
Hamiltonian performs better than the Bloch-Siegert model when calculating
operator averages (e.g.\, the mean photon number and number of excitations).
This improvement is due to a refined calculation of the dressed states within
the present model. Regarding the frequency shift induced by the qubit-photon

influences the eigenstates structure in a non-trivial way and ensures the
correct calculation of the number of excitations associated to a given dressed

equation as well as Ginzburg-Landau theory. By further extending the
path-integral approach to include electromagnetic effects from the scalar
potential and phase mode, in the second-order response, a finite contribution
from the drive effect of scalar potential to the Higgs-mode generation at clean
limit as well as the vanishing charge-density fluctuation are derived, also
recovering the results from the gauge-invariant kinetic equation. Particularly,
we show that the phase mode is excited in the second-order response, and
exactly cancels the previously reported unphysical excitation of the
charge-density fluctuation, guaranteeing the charge conservation.

protocol for massive machine-type communications, where a large number of users
sporadically send their data packets to a base station (BS). IRSA is a
completely distributed multiple access protocol: in any given frame, a small
subset of the users, i.e., the active users, transmit replicas of their packet
in randomly selected resource elements (REs). The first step in the decoding
process at the BS is to detect which users are active in each frame. To this
end, a novel Bayesian user activity detection (UAD) algorithm is developed,
which exploits both the sparsity in user activity as well as the underlying
structure of IRSA-based transmissions. Next, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the
mean squared error in channel estimation is derived. It is empirically shown
that the channel estimates obtained as a by-product of the proposed UAD
algorithm achieves the CRB. Then, the signal to interference plus noise ratio
achieved by the users is analyzed, accounting for UAD, channel estimation
errors, and pilot contamination. The impact of these non-idealities on the
throughput of IRSA is illustrated via Monte Carlo simulations. For example, in
a system with 1500 users and 10% of the users being active per frame, a pilot
length of as low as 20 symbols is sufficient for accurate user activity
detection. In contrast, using classical compressed sensing approaches for UAD
would require a pilot length of about 346 symbols. The results also reveal
crucial insights into dependence of UAD errors and throughput on parameters
such as the length of the pilot sequence, the number of antennas at the BS, the
number of users, and the signal to noise ratio.

GPS sources, with FWHM > 2 like in blazars. Most spectral indices at the
frequencies below and above the peak do not correspond to the values typical of
canonical GPS sources. We classified 3 FR0s as low-power GPS sources according
to the canonical criteria. The key issue is the variability properties of FR0s.
Some FR0s demonstrate a variability level of up to 25 % on a time scale of one
year according to the RATAN-600 measurements. The flare phenomena in FR0

deterministic reversible transform proposals inspired by the Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo method. The deterministic transform is relatively easy to reconcile with
the local information (gradient etc.) of the target distribution. However, as
the ergodic theory suggests, these deterministic proposal methods seem to be
incompatible with robustness and lead to poor convergence, especially in the
case of target distributions with heavy tails. On the other hand, the Markov
kernel using the Haar measure is relatively robust since it learns global
information about the target distribution introducing global parameters.
However, it requires a density preserving condition, and many deterministic
proposals break this condition. In this paper, we carefully select
deterministic transforms that preserve the structure and create a Markov
kernel, the Weave-Metropolis kernel, using the deterministic transforms. By
combining with the Haar measure, we also introduce the Haar-Weave-Metropolis
kernel. In this way, the Markov kernel can employ the local information of the
target distribution using the deterministic proposal, and thanks to the Haar
measure, it can employ the global information of the target distribution.
Finally, we show through numerical experiments that the performance of the
proposed method is superior to other methods in terms of effective sample size
and mean square jump distance per second.

approaches that are generally class-agnostic. To tackle this new task, we first
exploit user clicks to identify different human parts in the given image. These

interferes with gradient noise, often leading to specific step size and
momentum choices in order to guarantee convergence, set aside acceleration.
Proximal point methods, on the other hand, have gained much attention due to
their numerical stability and elasticity against imperfect tuning. Their
stochastic accelerated variants though have received limited attention: how
momentum interacts with the stability of (stochastic) proximal point methods
remains largely unstudied. To address this, we focus on the convergence and
stability of the stochastic proximal point algorithm with momentum (SPPAM), and
show that SPPAM allows a faster linear convergence to a neighborhood compared
to stochastic proximal point algorithm (SPPA) with a better contraction factor,
under proper hyperparameter tuning. In terms of stability, we show that SPPAM
depends on problem constants more favorably than SGDM, allowing a wider range
of step size and momentum that lead to convergence.

vascular injury caused by balloon dilation and stent placement. It may lead to
the relapse of angina symptoms or to an acute coronary syndrome. An uncertainty
quantification of a model for In-Stent Restenosis with four uncertain
parameters (endothelium regeneration time, the threshold strain for smooth
muscle cells bond breaking, blood flow velocity and the percentage of
fenestration in the internal elastic lamina) is presented. Two quantities of
interest were studied, namely the average cross-sectional area and the maximum
relative area loss in a vessel. Due to the computational intensity of the model
and the number of evaluations required in the uncertainty quantification, a
surrogate model, based on Gaussian process regression with proper orthogonal
decomposition, was developed which subsequently replaced the original In-Stent
Restenosis model in the uncertainty quantification. A detailed analysis of the
uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis is presented. Around 11% and
16% of uncertainty are observed on the average cross-sectional area and maximum
relative area loss respectively, and the uncertainty estimates show that a
higher fenestration mainly determines uncertainty in the neointimal growth at
the initial stage of the process. On the other hand, the uncertainty in blood
flow velocity and endothelium regeneration time mainly determine the
uncertainty in the quantities of interest at the later, clinically relevant
stages of the restenosis process. The uncertainty in the threshold strain is
relatively small compared to the other uncertain parameters.

random fluctuations on the antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between spins on
the checkerboard lattice. The replica framework is adopted within a cluster
mean-field approach, resulting in an effective single-cluster model. This
effective model is treated within a one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB)
approach with exact evaluations for all intracluster interactions. Competing
interactions are introduced by tuning the ratio $J_2/J_1$ (where $J_1$ and
$J_2$ are first-neighbour and second-neighbor interactions, respectively),
which can lead to a highly frustrated scenario when $J_2/J_1\rightarrow 1$,
where a phase transition between AF orders takes place in the absence of
disorder. In particular, the AF order appears at lower values of $J_2/J_1$,
with the Neel temperature decreasing as the frustration increases. However,
quenched disorder changes this description, introducing a RSB spin glass phase
for strong enough disorder intensity $J$. In fact, for low levels of disorder,
a RSB solution with staggered magnetization (mixed phase) emerges from the
maximum frustration region. It suggests that, in the presence of weak quenched
disorder, systems with competing interactions are prone to present a glassy
behavior instead of conventional orders.

the core of reasoning and by that paradigm human communication consists of
transferring representations from one mind to another. However, one finds that

language. People communicate by mind reading it seems. Systems with speech
interfaces such as Alexa and Siri are of course common, but they are limited.
Rather than adding mind reading skills, we introduced a ""cheat"" that enabled
our systems to fake it. The cheat is simple and only slightly interesting to

reading about the enactivist idea that we ""directly perceive"" the intentions of

EMP resistant. A simple water phantom equipped with only one ultrasound
transducer positioned on the ion axis allows for reconstructing a rather
complex energy spectrum that is typical for (manipulated) laser-accelerated ion

added, for example perpendicular to the ion beam axis. This established setup
has been adapted for use closely behind the laser target and tested at the
PHELIX laser at GSI. The capability of the system to retrieve information about
the broad proton spectrum close to the source despite the harsh conditions has

Kimber et al (KMR) method to calculate the unintegrated parton fragmentation

fragmentation functions (FFs), which satisfy the similar DGLAP evolution
equations, such as those of parton distribution functions (PDFs). Also, by
utilizing the different angular ordering constraints the results corresponding
to the Martin et al (MRW) in the leading order (LO) and the
next-to-leading-order (NLO) are obtained. The LO sets of DSS library for the
input FFs is used. The numerical results are compared with the experimental
data in the different energies which are reported by the different
collaborations, such as TASSO, AMY, MARK II, CELLO, DELPHI, SLD, ALEPH and
Belle with the other QCD+fragmentation models such as Pythia 6.4 and 8.2 parton

multiplicity versus the ""transverse momentum"" ($p_\bot$) are discussed. The
final results demonstrate that the KMR and MRW UFFs give a good description of

schemes. On the other hand, our results become closer to the data for the lower
values of $p_\bot$ and the higher values of center of mass energies.

  Optimization with Least Constraint Violation","22 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There are many important practical optimization problems whose feasible
regions are not known to be nonempty or not, and optimizers of the objective
function with the least constraint violation prefer to be found. A natural way
for dealing with these problems is to extend the nonlinear optimization problem
as the one optimizing the objective function over the set of points with the
least constraint violation. This leads to the study of the shifted problem.
This paper focuses on the constrained convex optimization problem. The
sufficient condition for the closedness of the set of feasible shifts is
presented and the continuity properties of the optimal value function and the
solution mapping for the shifted problem are studied. Properties of the
conjugate dual of the shifted problem are discussed through the relations
between the dual function and the optimal value function. The solvability of
the dual of the optimization problem with the least constraint violation is
investigated. It is shown that, if the least violated shift is in the domain of
the subdifferential of the optimal value function, then this dual problem has
an unbounded solution set. Under this condition, the optimality conditions for
the problem with the least constraint violation are established in term of the
augmented Lagrangian. It is shown that the augmented Lagrangian method has the
properties that the sequence of shifts converges to the least violated shift
and the sequence of multipliers is unbounded. Moreover, it is proved that the
augmented Lagrangian method is able to find an approximate solution to the
problem with the least constraint violation.

sub-atmospheric pressures. Numerical studies of streamers are important for
practical applications but are challenging due to the multiscale nature of this
discharge type. This paper introduces a spectral element method for modelling
streamer discharges. The method is developed for Cartesian grids but can be
extended to be used on unstructured meshes. The streamer model is based on the
Poisson equation for the electric potential and the electron continuity
equation. The Poisson equation is discretized via a spectral method based on
the integral representation of the solution. The hierarchical Poincare-Steklov
(HPS) scheme is used to solve the resulting set of equations. The electron
continuity equation is solved by means of the discontinuous Galerkin spectral
element method (DGSEM). The DGSEM is extended by an alternative definition of
the diffusion flux. A subcell finite volume method is used to stabilize the
DGSEM scheme, if required. The entire simulation scheme is validated by solving
a number of test problems and reproducing the results of previous studies.
Adaptive mesh refinement is used to reduce the number of unknowns. The proposed
method is found to be sufficiently fast for being used in practical
applications. The flexibility of the method provides an interesting opportunity
to broaden the range of problems that can be addressed in numerical studies of
low-temperature plasma discharges.

nonlinear modeling and control that lends an explicit hierarchical structure to

consider a sequence modeling paradigm that captures the temporal structure of
the data and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that
automatically decomposes nonlinear dynamics into stochastic piecewise affine
dynamical systems with nonlinear boundaries. Furthermore, we show that these
time-series models naturally admit a closed-loop extension that we use to
extract local polynomial feedback controllers from nonlinear experts via
behavioral cloning. Finally, we introduce a novel hybrid relative entropy
policy search (Hb-REPS) technique that incorporates the hierarchical nature of
hybrid systems and optimizes a set of time-invariant local feedback controllers
derived from a local polynomial approximation of a global state-value function.

approaches that study the alteration of metabolic pathways in obese children.
In this work, we propose a novel joint modelling approach for the analysis of

related to child obesity. Within a Bayesian framework, we flexibly model the
temporal evolution of growth trajectories and metabolic associations through
the specification of a joint non-parametric random effect distribution which
also allows for clustering of the subjects, thus identifying risk sub-groups.
Growth profiles as well as patterns of metabolic associations determine the
clustering structure. Inclusion of risk factors is straightforward through the
specification of a regression term. We demonstrate the proposed approach on
data from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort
study, based in Singapore. Posterior inference is obtained via a tailored MCMC
algorithm, accommodating a nonparametric prior with mixed support. Our analysis
has identified potential key pathways in obese children that allows for

exhaustive method for Boolean matching is computationally expensive even for
functions with only a few variables, because the time complexity of such an
algorithm for an n-variable Boolean function is $O(2^{n+1}n!)$. Sensitivity is
an important characteristic and a measure of the complexity of Boolean
functions. It has been used in analysis of the complexity of algorithms in
different fields. This measure could be regarded as a signature of Boolean
functions and has great potential to help reduce the search space of Boolean
matching.
  In this paper, we introduce Boolean sensitivity into Boolean matching and
design several sensitivity-related signatures to enhance fast Boolean matching.
First, we propose some new signatures that relate sensitivity to Boolean
equivalence. Then, we prove that these signatures are prerequisites for Boolean
matching, which we can use to reduce the search space of the matching problem.
Besides, we develop a fast sensitivity calculation method to compute and
compare these signatures of two Boolean functions. Compared with the
traditional cofactor and symmetric detection methods, sensitivity is a series
of signatures of another dimension. We also show that sensitivity can be easily
integrated into traditional methods and distinguish the mismatched Boolean
functions faster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
introduces sensitivity to Boolean matching. The experimental results show that
sensitivity-related signatures we proposed in this paper can reduce the search
space to a very large extent, and perform up to 3x speedup over the
state-of-the-art Boolean matching methods.

Volterra-type integral equations, and the result shows the effects of both

certain type of information characterized by, for example, topic, attitude, or
language. Researchers have previously proposed methods to infer these
underlying multilayer diffusion networks from observed spreading patterns, but
little is known about how well these methods perform across the range of
realistic spreading data. In this paper, we first introduce an effective
implementation of the inference method that can achieve higher accuracy than
existing implementations in comparable runtime. Then, we conduct an extensive
series of synthetic data experiments to systematically analyze the performance
of the method, under varied network structure (e.g. density, number of layers)

designed to mimic real-world spreading on social media. Our findings include
that the inference accuracy varies extremely with network density, and that the
method fails to decompose the diffusion network correctly when most cascades in
the data reach a limited audience. In demonstrating the conditions under which
the inference accuracy is extremely low, our paper highlights the need to
carefully evaluate the applicability of the method before running the inference
on real data. Practically, our results serve as a reference for this

galactic nuclei (AGNs). The polarization depends on the geometry of the broad
line region (BLR), and also on the polarization mechanism, or distribution of
the scattering material. Therefore the polarization measurements can indicate
the geometry of the BLR and the mechanism of polarization (equatorial or polar
scattering). In addition, the polarization angle (PA) shape across the line
profile can be used to measure the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, and
constrain the BLR characteristics. We give an overview of ours and other recent
investigations of the polarization in broad lines from both aspects:
theoretical and observational.

at least one time-periodic weak solution for the interaction between a
three-dimensional incompressible fluid, governed by the Navier- Stokes equation
and a two dimensional elastic plate. The challenge is that the Eulerian domain
for the fluid changes in time and is a part of the solution. We introduce a two
fixed-point methodology: First we construct a time-periodic solutions for a
given variable time-periodic geometry. Then in a second step a (set-valued)
fixed point is performed w.r.t.\ the geometry of the domain. The existence
relies on newly developed a-priori estimates applicable for both coupled and
uncoupled variable geometries. Due to the expected weak regularity of the
solutions such Eulerian estimates are unavoidable. Note in particular, that
only the fluid is assumed to be dissipative. But the here produced a-priori
estimates show that its possible to exploit the dissipative effects of the
fluid also for the solid deformation. The existence of periodic solutions for a
given geometry is valid for arbitrary large data. The existence of periodic
coupled solutions to the fluid-structure interaction is valid for all data that
excludes a self-intersection a-priori.

improved handling of one of the predicted variables where the training set was

nuclear states are fundamental ingredients for accurate modeling of compact
object composition and dynamics, but are difficult to obtain either from
experiment or theory. For lack of alternatives, calculations have often fallen
back upon a generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis, that is, assuming the strength
function (transition probability) is independent of the initial nuclear state
but depends only upon the transition energy and the weak interaction properties
of the parent nucleus ground state. Here we present numerical evidence for a
modified `local' Brink-Axel hypothesis for Gamow-Teller transitions for
$pf$-shell nuclei relevant to astrophysical applications. Specifically, while
the original Brink-Axel hypothesis does not hold globally, strength functions
from initial states nearby in energy are similar within statistical
fluctuations. This agrees with previous work on strength function moments.
Using this modified hypothesis, we can tackle strength functions at previously
intractable initial energies, using semi-converged initial states at arbitrary
excitation energy. Our work provides a well-founded method for computing
accurate thermal weak transition rates for medium-mass nuclei at temperatures
occurring in stellar cores near collapse. We finish by comparing to previous
calculations of astrophysical rates.

underlying far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction assumption connects the source,

this assumption neglects phase-curvature due to non-planar illumination from

(e.g., using a single-lens for image-formation). We describe a simple,
efficient, and accurate extension of Fourier ptychography by embedding the
effect of phase-curvature into the underlying forward model. With the improved
forward model proposed here, quantitative phase reconstruction is possible even

rapidly rotating, broad-line component of the system. We apply Least-Squares
Deconvolution (LSD) to infer the longitudinal magnetic field from each Stokes

combination with CoRoT photometry and equivalent width measurements of
magnetospheric spectral lines, we infer the rotation period of the magnetic
star to be equal to $1.21551^{+0.00028}_{-0.00034}$ d. Modeling the Stokes $V$
LSD profiles with Zeeman Doppler Imaging, we produce the first {reliable}
magnetic map of an O-type star. We find a magnetic field that is predominantly
dipolar, but with an important quadrupolar component, and weak higher order
components. The dipolar component has an obliquity near 90 deg and a polar
strength of about 850 G, while the average field strength over the entire
surface is 520 G. We update the calculations of the theoretical magnetospheric
parameters, and in agreement with their predictions we identify clear
variability signatures of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He II $\lambda 4686$
lines confirming the presence of a dense centrifugal magnetosphere surrounding
the star. Finally, we report a lack of detection of radial velocity (RV)
variations of the observed Stokes $V$ profiles, suggesting that historical

surpasses the level of a strong human expert player in such games. In this
context, it is difficult for a human player to enjoy playing the games with the
AI. To keep human players entertained and immersed in a game, the AI is
required to dynamically balance its skill with that of the human player. To
address this issue, we propose AlphaDDA, an AlphaZero-based AI with dynamic
difficulty adjustment (DDA). AlphaDDA consists of a deep neural network (DNN)
and a Monte Carlo tree search, as in AlphaZero. AlphaDDA learns and plays a
game the same way as AlphaZero, but can change its skills. AlphaDDA estimates
the value of the game state from only the board state using the DNN. AlphaDDA
changes a parameter dominantly controlling its skills according to the
estimated value. Consequently, AlphaDDA adjusts its skills according to a game
state. AlphaDDA can adjust its skill using only the state of a game without any
prior knowledge regarding an opponent. In this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4,
Othello, and 6x6 Othello with other AI agents. Other AI agents are AlphaZero,
Monte Carlo tree search, the minimax algorithm, and a random player. This study
shows that AlphaDDA can balance its skill with that of the other AI agents,
except for a random player. The DDA ability of AlphaDDA is based on an accurate
estimation of the value from the state of a game. We believe that the AlphaDDA
approach for DDA can be used for any game AI system if the DNN can accurately
estimate the value of the game state and we know a parameter controlling the
skills of the AI system.

promise for applications in clinical settings as a rapid, sensitive, and
label-free identification method. These approaches perform well in classifying
data that contains classes that occur during the training phase. However, in
practice, there are always substances whose spectra have not yet been taken or
are not yet known and when the input data are far from the training set and
include new classes that were not seen at the training stage, a significant
number of false positives are recorded which limits the clinical relevance of
these algorithms. Here we show that these obstacles can be overcome by
implementing recently introduced Entropic Open Set and Objectosphere loss
functions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this approach, we compiled a
database of Raman spectra of 40 chemical classes separating them into 20
biologically relevant classes comprised of amino acids, 10 irrelevant classes
comprised of bio-related chemicals, and 10 classes that the Neural Network has
not seen before, comprised of a variety of other chemicals. We show that this
approach enables the network to effectively identify the unknown classes while
preserving high accuracy on the known ones, dramatically reducing the number of
false positives while preserving high accuracy on the known classes, which will
allow this technique to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and
clinical applications.

  Maxwell model",,,,,"math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We analyze the inversion of the photo-acoustic imaging modality using
electromagnetic plasmonic nano-particles as contrast agents. We prove that the
generated pressure, before and after injecting the plasmonic nano-particles,
measured at a single point, located away from the targeted inhomogeneity to
image, and at a given band of incident frequencies is enough to reconstruct the
(eventually complex valued) permittivity. Indeed, from these measurements, we
define an indicator function which depends on the used incident frequency and
the time of measurement. This indicator function has differentiating behaviors
in terms of both time and frequency. First, from the behavior in terms of time,
we can estimate the arrival time of the pressure from which we can localize the
injected nano-particle. Second, we show that this indicator function has
maximum picks at incident frequencies close to the plasmonic resonances. This
allows us to estimate these resonances from which we construct the
permittivity.
  To justify these properties, we derive the dominant electric field created by
the injected nano-particle when the incident frequency is close to plasmonic
resonances. This is done for the full Maxwell system. To this end, we use a
natural spectral decomposition of the vector space (L^2(D))^3 based on the
spectra of the Newtonian and the Magnetization operators. As another key
argument, we provide the singularity analysis of the Green's tensor of the
Maxwell problem with varying permittivity. Such singularity is unusual if
compared to the ones of the elliptic case (as the acoustic or elastic models).
In addition, we show how the derived approximation of the electric fields
propagates, as a source, in the induced pressure with the time.

two observables with two possible outcomes each. Probabilities are specified by
four marginals and four correlations. The resulting four-dimensional convex
body of correlations, denoted $\mathcal{Q}$, is fundamental for quantum
information theory. We review and systematize what is known about $\Qm$, and
add many details, visualizations, and complete proofs. In particular, we
provide a detailed description of the boundary, which consists of
three-dimensional faces isomorphic to elliptopes and sextic algebraic manifolds
of exposed extreme points. These patches are separated by cubic surfaces of
non-exposed extreme points. We provide a trigonometric parametrization of all
extreme points, along with their exposing Tsirelson inequalities and quantum
models. All non-classical extreme points (exposed or not) are self-testing,
i.e., realized by an essentially unique quantum model.
  Two principles, which are specific to the minimal scenario, allow a quick and
complete overview: The first is the pushout transformation, i.e., the
application of the sine function to each coordinate. This transforms the
classical correlation polytope exactly into the correlation body $\mathcal{Q}$,
also identifying the boundary structures. The second principle, self-duality,
is an isomorphism between $\Qm$ and its polar dual, i.e., the set of affine
inequalities satisfied by all quantum correlations (``Tsirelson
inequalities''). The same isomorphism links the polytope of classical
correlations contained in $\Qm$ to the polytope of no-signalling correlations,
which contains $\Qm$.
  We also discuss the sets of correlations achieved with fixed Hilbert space
dimension, fixed state or fixed observables, and establish a new non-linear
inequality for $\Qm$ involving the determinant of the correlation matrix.

  Catch 22","4 pages",,,,"cs.GT math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider finite $n$-person deterministic graphical (DG) games. These games
are modelled by finite directed graphs (digraphs) $G$ which may have directed
cycles and, hence, infinite plays. Yet, it is assumed that all these plays are
equivalent and form a single outcome $c$, while the terminal vertices $V_T =
\{a_1, \ldots, a_p\}$ form $p$ remaining outcomes. We study the existence of
Nash equilibria (NE) in pure stationary strategies. It is known that NE exist
when $n=2$ and may fail to exist when $n > 2$. Yet, the question becomes open
for $n > 2$ under the following extra condition: (C) For each of $n$ players,
$c$ is worse than each of $p$ terminal outcomes. In other words, all players
are interested in terminating the play, which is a natural assumption.
Moreover, Nash-solvability remains open even if we replace (C) by a weaker
condition: (C22) There exist no two players for whom $c$ is better than (at
least) two terminal outcomes. We conjecture that such two players exist in each
NE-free DG game, or in other words, that (C22) implies Nash-solvability, for
all $n$. Recently, the DG games were extended to a wider class of the DG
multi-stage (DGMS) games, whose outcomes are the strongly connected components
(SCC) of digraph $G$. Merging all outcomes of a DGMS game that correspond to
its non-terminal SCCs we obtain a DG game. Clearly, this operation respects
Nash-solvability (NS). Basic conditions and conjectures related to NS can be
extended from the DG to DGMS games: in both cases NE exist if $n=2$ and may
fail to exist when $n > 2$; furthermore, we modify conditions (C) and (C22) to
adapt them for the DGMS games. Keywords: $n$-person deterministic graphical

evolution and persistence of life on Earth. Microbial metabolism plays a
primary role in the flow of carbon, nitrogen and other elements through the
biosphere on a global scale. Microbes perform these metabolic activities in the
context of complex communities comprised of many species that interact in
dynamic and spatially-structured environments. Molecular genetics has revealed
many of the metabolic pathways microbes utilize to generate energy and biomass.
However, most of this knowledge is derived from model organisms, so we have a
limited view of role of the massive genomic diversity in the wild on metabolic
phenotypes. Further, we are only beginning to glimpse the principles governing
how the metabolism of a community emerges from the collective action of its
constituent members. As a result, one of the biggest challenges in the field is
to understand how the metabolic activity of a community emerges from the
genomic structure of the constituents. Here we propose an approach to this
problem that rests on the quantitative analysis of metabolic activity in
ensembles of microbial communities. We propose quantifying metabolic fluxes in
diverse communities, either in the laboratory or the wild. We suggest that
using sequencing data to quantify the genomic, taxonomic or transcriptional
variation across an ensemble of communities can reveal low-dimensional
descriptions of community structure that can explain or predict their emergent
metabolic activity. We survey the types of communities for which this approach
might be best suited and then review the analytical techniques available for
quantifying metabolite dynamics in communities. Finally, we discuss what types
of data analysis approaches might be lucrative for learning the
structure-function mapping in communities from these data.

interpretable image synthesis model is still lacking yet necessary for
important applications such as assisting in medical training. In this work, we
leverage the efficient self-attention and contrastive learning modules and
build upon state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve
an attribute-aware image synthesis model, termed AttributeGAN, which can
generate high-quality histopathology images based on multi-attribute inputs. In
comparison to existing single-attribute conditional generative models, our
proposed model better reflects input attributes and enables smoother
interpolation among attribute values. We conduct experiments on a
histopathology dataset containing stained H&E images of urothelial carcinoma
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model via comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art models as well
as different variants of our model. Code is available at

expert annotations that can be expensive and time-consuming to collect.
Meanwhile, accurate classification of image patches cropped from whole-slide
images is essential for standard sliding window based histopathology slide
classification methods. To mitigate these issues, we propose a carefully
designed conditional GAN model, namely HistoGAN, for synthesizing realistic
histopathology image patches conditioned on class labels. We also investigate a
novel synthetic augmentation framework that selectively adds new synthetic
image patches generated by our proposed HistoGAN, rather than expanding
directly the training set with synthetic images. By selecting synthetic images
based on the confidence of their assigned labels and their feature similarity
to real labeled images, our framework provides quality assurance to synthetic
augmentation. Our models are evaluated on two datasets: a cervical
histopathology image dataset with limited annotations, and another dataset of
lymph node histopathology images with metastatic cancer. Here, we show that
leveraging HistoGAN generated images with selective augmentation results in
significant and consistent improvements of classification performance (6.7% and
2.8% higher accuracy, respectively) for cervical histopathology and metastatic
cancer datasets.

algorithms can be simply modified to allow the fully-sampled T1-weighted MR

framework to optimize the under-sampling pattern for MRI acquisition of another
modality that can complement the fully-sampled T1-weighted MR image at
different under-sampling factors, while jointly optimizing the T1-assisted MRI
reconstruction model. Specifically, our proposed method exploits the difference
of latent information between the two modalities for determining the sampling
patterns that can maximize the assistance power of T1-weighted MR image in
improving the MRI reconstruction. We have demonstrated superior performance of
our learned under-sampling patterns on a public dataset, compared to commonly
used under-sampling patterns and state-of-the-art methods that can jointly
optimize both the reconstruction network and the under-sampling pattern, up to
8-fold under-sampling factor.

recently proposed as a heuristic platform to solve hard optimization problems.
These networks, called coherent Ising machines (CIMs), exploit the fact that
the collective nonlinear dynamics of coupled oscillators can drive the system
close to the global minimum of the classical Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the
coupling matrix of the network. To date, realizations of large-scale CIMs have
been demonstrated using hybrid optical-electronic setups, where optical
oscillators simulating different spins are subject to electronic feedback
mechanisms emulating their mutual interaction. While the optical evolution
ensures an ultrafast computation, the electronic coupling represents a
bottleneck that causes the computational time to severely depend on the system
size. Here, we propose an all-optical scalable CIM with fully-programmable
coupling. Our setup consists of an optical parametric amplifier with a spatial
light modulator (SLM) within the parametric cavity. The spin variables are
encoded in the binary phases of the optical wavefront of the signal beam at
different spatial points, defined by the pixels of the SLM. We first discuss
how different coupling topologies can be achieved by different configurations
of the SLM, and then benchmark our setup with a numerical simulation that
mimics the dynamics of the proposed machine. In our proposal, both the spin
dynamics and the coupling are fully performed in parallel, paving the way
towards the realization of size-independent ultrafast optical hardware for
large-scale computation purposes.

cut-set bound for information flow graphs. It is shown that utilizing the
broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the surviving contents at the
partially failed nodes reduces the repair bandwidth per node significantly.
Then, we list a set of invariant conditions that are sufficient for a
functional repair code to be feasible. We further propose a scheme for
functional repair of multiple failed nodes that satisfies the invariant
conditions with high probability, and its extension to the repair of partial

we extend the result of Karpenko to special tori and we completely determine

show that there can be torsion in the Chow ring of such tori.

development of a miniaturized laser-communication terminal that can be
installed in very-small satellites, while also compatible with a variety of
other different platforms, meeting a wide span of bandwidth requirements. The
strategy adopted in this design has been to create a versatile lasercom

of extensive customization. This manuscript describes the current efforts in
NICT towards the development of this terminal, and it shows the prototype that
has been already developed for the preliminary tests, which are described as
well. These tests will include the performance verification using drones first
with the goal of installing the prototype on High-Altitude Platform Systems
(HAPS) to carry out communication links between HAPS and ground, and later with
the Geostationary (GEO) orbit, covering this way a wide range of operating
conditions. For these tests, in the former case the counter terminal is a
simple transmitter in the case of the drone, and a transportable ground station
in the case of the HAPS; and in the latter case the counter terminal is the GEO

  Learning for Personalized Epileptic EEG Detection","Submitted to IEEE Trans",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In clinical practice, electroencephalography (EEG) plays an important role in
the diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG-based computer-aided diagnosis of epilepsy can
greatly improve the ac-curacy of epilepsy detection while reducing the workload
of physicians. However, there are many challenges in practical applications for
personalized epileptic EEG detection (i.e., training of detection model for a
specific person), including the difficulty in extracting effective features
from one single view, the undesirable but common scenario of lacking sufficient
training data in practice, and the no guarantee of identically distributed
training and test data. To solve these problems, we propose a TSK fuzzy
system-based epilepsy detection algorithm that integrates multi-view
collaborative transfer learning. To address the challenge due to the limitation
of single-view features, multi-view learning ensures the diversity of features
by extracting them from different views. The lack of training data for building
a personalized detection model is tackled by leveraging the knowledge from the
source domain (reference scene) to enhance the performance of the target domain
(current scene of interest), where mismatch of data distributions between the
two domains is resolved with adaption technique based on maximum mean
discrepancy. Notably, the transfer learning and multi-view feature extraction
are performed at the same time. Furthermore, the fuzzy rules of the TSK fuzzy
system equip the model with strong fuzzy logic inference capability. Hence, the
proposed method has the potential to detect epileptic EEG signals effectively,
which is demonstrated with the positive results from a large number of
experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset.

CEHR-BERT, to incorporate temporal information using a hybrid approach by
augmenting the input to BERT using artificial time tokens, incorporating time,

for visit type. CEHR-BERT was trained on a subset of Columbia University Irving
Medical Center-York Presbyterian Hospital's clinical data, which includes 2.4M
patients, spanning over three decades, and tested using 4-fold cross-validation

outperformed existing state-of-the-art clinical BERT adaptations and baseline

demonstrated strong transfer learning capability, as our model trained on only
5% of data outperformed comparison models trained on the entire data set.
Ablation studies to better understand the contribution of each time component

for thrombosis events due to modified blood flow in the heart, and thereby a
change in the mechanical stimuli of blood cells passing through the chambers of
the heart. Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced by the
level and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the
blood flow in the left ventricle of the heart through a computational model
constructed from patient-specific data. The blood flow in the ventricle is
modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the mitral valve
by a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A
finite element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation
of the velocity and pressure of the blood flow is constructed. A triple
decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then used to distinguish
between rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear
flow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally
different flow structures, each generating a distinct type of mechanical
stimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare the results to simulations
where a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a
significant modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear
in the simulation cases treated with clips increased more compared to the
untreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease in valve opening
area of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain,
but a 150 % increase in shear. The computational analysis suggests a process
for patient-specific simulation of clinical interventions in the heart with a
detailed analysis of the resulting blood flow, which could support clinical
risk assessment with respect to platelet activation and thrombosis events.

propose a Graph-Guided Deformation Network, which respectively regards the

adaptivity for modeling variation in geometry details. By this means, we also
reduce the gap between the completion task and the mesh deformation algorithms.
