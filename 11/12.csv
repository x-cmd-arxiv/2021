participants and autonomous interactive characters is an achievable goal in the
near future. This possibility is further reinforced by the rapid improvements
in the automated analysis of speech, facial expressions and body language, as
well as improvements in character animation and speech synthesis techniques.
However, we do not have a formal theory that allows us to compare, on one side,
interactive social scenarios among human users and autonomous virtual
characters and, on the other side, pragmatic inference mechanisms as they occur
in non-mediated communication.
  Grices' and Sperbers' model of inferential communication does explain the
nature of everyday communication through cognitive mechanisms that support
spontaneous inferences performed in pragmatic communication. However, such a
theory is not based on a mathematical framework with a precision comparable to
classical information theory.
  To address this gap, in this article we introduce a Mathematical Theory of
Inferential Communication (MaTIC). MaTIC formalises some assumptions of
inferential communication, it explores its theoretical consequences and
outlines the practical steps needed to use it in different application

  Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$S$_{2}$ alloys",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The unique optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) make them promising materials for applications
in (opto-)electronics, catalysis and more. Specifically, alloys of 2D TMDs have
broad potential applications owing to their composition-controlled properties.
Several important challenges remain regarding controllable and scalable
fabrication of these alloys, such as achieving control over their atomic
ordering (i.e. clustering or random mixing of the transition metal atoms within
the 2D layers). In this work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to
synthesize the TMD alloy Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$S$_{2}$ with excellent composition
control along the complete composition range 0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1. Importantly,
this composition control allows us to control the atomic ordering of the alloy
from well-mixed to clustered while keeping the alloy composition fixed, as is
confirmed directly through atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM imaging. The control
over atomic ordering leads to tuning of the bandgap, as is demonstrated using
optical transmission spectroscopy. The relation between this tuning of the
electronic structure and the atomic ordering of the alloy was further confirmed
through ab-initio calculations. Furthermore, as the atomic ordering modulates
from clustered to well-mixed, the typical MoS$_{2}$ and WS$_{2}$ A$_{1g}$
vibrational modes converge. Our results demonstrate that atomic ordering is an
important parameter that can be tuned experimentally to finely tune the
fundamental properties of 2D TMD alloys for specific applications.

discoveries of various correlated and topological phases. In particular,
recently the alternating twisted trilayer graphene is discovered to exhibit
unconventional superconductivity, which motivates us to study the electronic
structures and possible interesting correlation effects of this class of
alternating twisted graphene systems. In this work we consider generic
alternating twisted multilayer graphene (ATMG) systems with $M$-$L$-$N$
stacking configurations, in which the $M$ ($L$) graphene layers and the $L$
($N$) layers are twisted by an angle $\theta$ (-$\theta$). Based on analysis

analytically derive generic partition rules for the low-energy electronic

pair of flat bands, two pairs of flat bands, as well as flat bands co-existing
with with Dirac cones, quadratic bands, or more generally
$E(\mathbf{k})\!\sim\!k^J$ dispersions ($J$ is positive integer) for each spin

unconventional correlation effects. Especially for a mirror symmetric ATMG
system with two pairs of flat bands (per spin per valley), we find that Coulomb
interactions may drive the system into a state breaking both time-reversal and
mirror symmetries, which can exhibit a novel type of orbital magnetoelectric
effect due to the interwining of electric polarization and orbital
magnetization orders in the symmetry-breaking state.

theoretical modeling. We employ inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the
magnetic dynamics as a function of applied field (with respect to both

scattering reveals dispersionless bands of excitations as found in earlier
powder sample studies, in good agreement with a single-tetrahedron model.
However, diffuse neutron scattering at zero field and dc-susceptibility at
finite field exhibit features suggesting the presence of excitations at
low-energy that are not captured by the single tetrahedron model. Analysis of
the local structure down to 2 K via pair distribution function analysis finds
no evidence of structural disorder. We conclude that effects beyond the single

consists in obtaining the solutions of the entire system by solving only the

satisfies the constraints and the constraints are preserved in the evolution.
In this paper, we establish the sufficient conditions required for the PDEs of
the system to guarantee the constraint preservation. This is achieved by
considering quasi-linear first-order PDEs, assuming the sufficient condition
and deriving strongly hyperbolic first-order partial differential evolution
equations for the constraints. We show that, in general, these constraint
evolution equations correspond to a family of equations parametrized by a set
of free parameters. We also explain how these parameters fix the propagation
velocities of the constraints.
  As application examples of this framework, we study the constraint
conservation of the Maxwell electrodynamics and the wave equations in arbitrary
space-times. We conclude that the constraint evolution equations are unique in
the Maxwell case and a family in the wave equation case.

given T vectors in $[-1,1]^n$, find a signing $\sigma(a) \in \{\pm 1\}$ of each
vector $a$ to minimize the discrepancy $\| \sum_{a} \sigma(a) \cdot a
\|_{\infty}$. This problem has been extensively studied in the static/offline
setting. In this paper we initiate its study in the fully-dynamic setting with
recourse: the algorithm sees a stream of T insertions and deletions of vectors,
and at each time must maintain a low-discrepancy signing, while also minimizing
the amortized recourse (the number of times any vector changes its sign) per
update.
  For general vectors, we show algorithms which almost match Spencer's
$O(\sqrt{n})$ offline discrepancy bound, with ${O}(n\cdot poly\!\log T)$
amortized recourse per update. The crucial idea is to compute a basic feasible
solution to the linear relaxation in a distributed and recursive manner, which
helps find a low-discrepancy signing. To bound recourse we argue that only a
small part of the instance needs to be re-computed at each update.
  Since vector balancing has also been greatly studied for sparse vectors, we
then give algorithms for low-discrepancy edge orientation, where we dynamically
maintain signings for 2-sparse vectors. Alternatively, this can be seen as
orienting a dynamic set of edges of an n-vertex graph to minimize the absolute
difference between in- and out-degrees at any vertex. We present a
deterministic algorithm with $O(poly\!\log n)$ discrepancy and $O(poly\!\log
n)$ amortized recourse. The core ideas are to dynamically maintain an
expander-decomposition with low recourse and then to show that, as the
expanders change over time, a natural local-search algorithm converges quickly
(i.e., with low recourse) to a low-discrepancy solution. We also give strong
lower bounds for local-search discrepancy minimization algorithms.

standard Density Functional Theory based on two and three-body correlations to
describe high-symmetry orientational phases in two-dimensional hard

Decomposition (SVD) can find closed-form solutions to convex problems, using
merely a handful of epochs. In this paper, we make GRL more computationally
tractable for those with modest hardware. We design a framework that computes
SVD of \textit{implicitly} defined matrices, and apply this framework to
several GRL tasks. For each task, we derive linear approximation of a SOTA
model, where we design (expensive-to-store) matrix $\mathbf{M}$ and train the
model, in closed-form, via SVD of $\mathbf{M}$, without calculating entries of
$\mathbf{M}$. By converging to a unique point in one step, and without
calculating gradients, our models show competitive empirical test performance
over various graphs such as article citation and biological interaction

architected to be non-linear almost everywhere, though behaves linearly when
its parameters reside on a hyperplane, onto which SVD initializes. The deeper
model can then be fine-tuned within only a few epochs. Overall, our procedure

the CEE. We scale the properties of the ILOT V1309 Scorpii to the properties of
a planet that enters a CEE inside a star on and near the Hertzsprung gap to

estimate that for a planet of Jupiter mass the ILOT will last for several days

are less luminous than classical novae. Because of the small amount of expected
dust and the small amount of energy that an accretion process onto the planet

two decades as it offers many potential benefits, including releasing drivers
from exhausting driving and mitigating traffic congestion, among others.
Despite promising progress, lane-changing remains a great challenge for
autonomous vehicles (AV), especially in mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios.
Recently, reinforcement learning (RL), a powerful data-driven control method,
has been widely explored for lane-changing decision makings in AVs with
encouraging results demonstrated. However, the majority of those studies are
focused on a single-vehicle setting, and lane-changing in the context of
multiple AVs coexisting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have received scarce
attention. In this paper, we formulate the lane-changing decision making of
multiple AVs in a mixed-traffic highway environment as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where each AV makes lane-changing
decisions based on the motions of both neighboring AVs and HDVs. Specifically,
a multi-agent advantage actor-critic network (MA2C) is developed with a novel
local reward design and a parameter sharing scheme. In particular, a
multi-objective reward function is proposed to incorporate fuel efficiency,
driving comfort, and safety of autonomous driving. Comprehensive experimental
results, conducted under three different traffic densities and various levels
of human driver aggressiveness, show that our proposed MARL framework
consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of
efficiency, safety and driver comfort.

important to comprehend the interactions taking place at the nanoscale, where
optical near-fields play a key role. Their phenomenology differs significantly
from the propagative light we experience at the macroscopic level. This is
particularly important in applications such as surface-enhanced spectroscopies
for single-molecule detection, where often the optimization of the plasmonic
structures and surfaces relies on far-field characterizations. The processes
dominating in the far-field picture, though, are not the same dominating in the
near-field. To highlight this, we resort to very simple metallic systems:
Isolated gold nanorods in solution. We show how single-walled nanotubes can be
exploited to read out processes occurring at the near-field level around
metallic nanoparticles and make the information accessible in the far-field
region. This is implemented by monitoring the spectral profile of the
enhancement of the photoluminescence and Raman signal of the nanotubes for
several excitation wavelengths. Through this excitation-resolved study, we show
that the far-field optical read-out detects the transversal and longitudinal
dipolar plasmonic oscillations of gold nanorods, whereas the near-field
read-out through the nanotubes reveals other mechanisms to dominate. The
spectral position of the maximum enhancement of the optical near-field mediated
signals are located elsewhere than the far-field bands. This dichotomy between
near-field and far-field response should be taken into account when optimizing
plasmonic nanostructures for applications such as surface-enhanced

  Asymptotic Characterization",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stochastic approximation (SA) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
algorithms are work-horses for modern machine learning algorithms. Their
constant stepsize variants are preferred in practice due to fast convergence
behavior. However, constant step stochastic iterative algorithms do not
converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but instead have a stationary
distribution, which in general cannot be analytically characterized. In this
work, we study the asymptotic behavior of the appropriately scaled stationary
distribution, in the limit when the constant stepsize goes to zero.
Specifically, we consider the following three settings: (1) SGD algorithms with
smooth and strongly convex objective, (2) linear SA algorithms involving a
Hurwitz matrix, and (3) nonlinear SA algorithms involving a contractive
operator. When the iterate is scaled by $1/\sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is
the constant stepsize, we show that the limiting scaled stationary distribution
is a solution of an integral equation. Under a uniqueness assumption (which can
be removed in certain settings) on this equation, we further characterize the
limiting distribution as a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is the
unique solution of a suitable Lyapunov equation. For SA algorithms beyond these
cases, our numerical experiments suggest that unlike central limit theorem type
results: (1) the scaling factor need not be $1/\sqrt{\alpha}$, and (2) the
limiting distribution need not be Gaussian. Based on the numerical study, we
come up with a formula to determine the right scaling factor, and make
insightful connection to the Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme for
approximating stochastic differential equations.

However, its origin is still not well understood. Here we perform nonlinear

we conclude that there is no strange attractor in the data. Further computing
Higuchi's dimension, we conclude that the hemispheric asymmetry is largely
governed by stochastic noise. However, the behaviour of Hurst exponent reveals
that the time series is not completely determined by a memory-less stochastic
noise, rather there is a long-term persistence, which can go beyond two solar

sunspot cycle is predominantly originated due to some irregular process in the

that the solar magnetic field has some memory in the convection zone.

optimization problems that have been studied extensively in various
computational regimes. The focus of this work is on parameterized complexity,
Parameterized Set Packing (PSP): Given $r \in {\mathbb N}$, is there a
collection $ \mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{S}: |\mathcal{S}'| = r$ such that
the sets in $\mathcal{S}'$ are pairwise disjoint? Unfortunately, the problem is
not fixed parameter tractable unless $\mathsf{W[1] = FPT}$, and, in fact, an
""enumeration"" running time of $|\mathcal{S}|^{\Omega(r)}$ is required unless
the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) fails. This paper is a quest for
tractable instances of Set Packing from parameterized complexity perspectives.
We say that the input $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ is ""compact"" if
$|\mathcal{U}| = f(r)\cdot\Theta(\textsf{poly}( \log |\mathcal{S}|))$, for some
$f(r) \ge r$. In the Compact Set Packing problem, we are given a compact

When $|\mathcal{U}| = f(r)\cdot o(\log |\mathcal{S}|)$, PSP is in
$\textsf{FPT}$, while for $|\mathcal{U}| = r\cdot\Theta(\log (|\mathcal{S}|))$,
the problem is $W[1]$-hard; moreover, assuming ETH, Compact PSP does not even
admit $|\mathcal{S}|^{o(r/\log r)}$ time algorithm. Although certain results in
the literature imply hardness of compact versions of related problems such as
Set $r$-Covering and Exact $r$-Covering, these constructions fail to extend to
Compact PSP. A novel contribution of our work is the identification and
construction of a gadget, which we call Compatible Intersecting Set System

inference on GPUs. The first CPU stage dominates the overall runtime, taking
hours for a single protein due to the large database sizes and I/O bottlenecks.
However, GPUs in this CPU stage remain idle, resulting in low GPU utilization
and restricting the capacity of large-scale structure predictions. Therefore,
we proposed ParaFold, an open-source parallel version of AlphaFold for high
throughput protein structure predictions. ParaFold separates the CPU and GPU
parts to enable large-scale structure predictions. ParaFold also effectively
reduces the CPU and GPU runtime with two optimizations without compromising the
quality of prediction results: using multi-threaded parallelism on CPUs and
using optimized JAX compilation on GPUs. We evaluated ParaFold with three
datasets of different size and protein lengths. We evaluated the accuracy and
efficiency of optimizations on CPUs and GPUs, and showed the large-scale
prediction capability by running ParaFold inferences of 19,704 small proteins

attained a 13.8X average speedup over AlphaFold. ParaFold offers a rapid and
effective approach for high-throughput structure predictions, leveraging the
predictive power by running on supercomputers, with shorter time, and at a
lower cost. The development of ParaFold will greatly speed up high-throughput

strong, transferable image representations, with the majority of research

propose an unsupervised approach to object part discovery and segmentation and
make three contributions. First, we construct a proxy task through a set of
objectives that encourages the model to learn a meaningful decomposition of the
image into its parts. Secondly, prior work argues for reconstructing or
clustering pre-computed features as a proxy to parts; we show empirically that
this alone is unlikely to find meaningful parts; mainly because of their low
resolution and the tendency of classification networks to spatially smear out
information. We suggest that image reconstruction at the level of pixels can
alleviate this problem, acting as a complementary cue. Lastly, we show that the
standard evaluation based on keypoint regression does not correlate well with
segmentation quality and thus introduce different metrics, NMI and ARI, that
better characterize the decomposition of objects into parts. Our method yields
semantic parts which are consistent across fine-grained but visually distinct
categories, outperforming the state of the art on three benchmark datasets.

in these wireless systems to improve the capacity. Several recent studies have
utilised redundancies in the content request along with the spatial diversity

Quality-of-Service (user experienced delay) of downlink in MU-MISO content

be quite unfair to users with good channels. Thus, we propose an improvement to
SMQ called Dual SMQ which addresses this issue. We also provide theoretical

describe how the necessary diffeomorphism invariance of the modified

(for the harmonic gauge), as compared to Einstein gravity. This allows us to
perform a consistent linearization of the gravitational sector in the
weak-field limit, which gives rise to a kinetic mixing between the

that a fifth force can arise between matter fields. We are then able to compute

nonlocality. We construct Bell inequalities tailored to the broadcast scenario,
and show how broadcasting can lead to even stronger notions of Bell nonlocality
activation. In particular, we exploit these ideas to show that bipartite states
admitting a local hidden-variable model for general measurements can lead to
genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations. We then study device-independent
entanglement certification in the broadcast scenario, and show through
semidefinite programming techniques that device-independent entanglement
certification is possible for the two-qubit Werner state in essentially the
entire range of entanglement. Finally, we extend the concept of EPR steering to
the broadcast scenario, and present novel examples of activation of the
two-qubit isotropic state. Our results pave the way for broadcast-based
device-dependent and semi-device-independent protocols.

Keplerian rotation possibly associated with the presence of two giant planets

DISCMINER channel-map modelling framework on $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ DSHARP data. Not
only orbital radius, but also azimuth of the planets are retrieved by our
technique. One of the candidate planets, detected at $R=94\pm6$ au,
$\phi=50\pm3^\circ$ (P94), is near the centre of one of the gaps in dust
continuum emission, and is consistent with a planet mass of 1 $\rm M_{\rm
Jup}$. The other planet, located at $R=261\pm4$ au, $\phi=57\pm1^\circ$ (P261),
is in the region where a velocity kink was previously observed in $^{12}$CO
channel maps. Also, we provide a simultaneous description of the height and
temperature of the upper and lower emitting surfaces of the disc, and propose
the line width as a solid observable to track gas substructure. Using
azimuthally averaged line width profiles we detect gas gaps at $R=38$ au,
$R=88$ au, and $R=136$ au, closely matching the location of their dust and
kinematical counterparts. Furthermore, we observe strong azimuthal asymmetries
in line widths around the gas gap at $R=88$ au, possibly linked to turbulent
motions driven by the P94 planet. Our results confirm that the DISCMINER is
capable of finding localised, otherwise unseen velocity perturbations thanks to
its robust statistical framework, but also that it is well suited for studies
of the gas properties and vertical structure of protoplanetary discs.

with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without
mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original

masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial

train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x

high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model

existing models are generally modality-dependent, requiring custom
architectures and objectives to process different classes of signals. We
leverage neural fields to capture the underlying structure in image, shape,
audio and cross-modal audiovisual domains in a modality-independent manner. We
cast our task as one of learning a manifold, where we aim to infer a
low-dimensional, locally linear subspace in which our data resides. By
enforcing coverage of the manifold, local linearity, and local isometry, our
model -- dubbed GEM -- learns to capture the underlying structure of datasets
across modalities. We can then travel along linear regions of our manifold to
obtain perceptually consistent interpolations between samples, and can further
use GEM to recover points on our manifold and glean not only diverse
completions of input images, but cross-modal hallucinations of audio or image
signals. Finally, we show that by walking across the underlying manifold of
GEM, we may generate new samples in our signal domains. Code and additional

system. The outer body may excite the eccentricity of the inner binary through
the von~Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism, triggering the gravitational wave
(GW) coalescence of the inner binary when its members are compact objects.
Here, we study a sample of hierarchical triples with an inner black hole (BH)
-- BH binary, BH -- neutron star (NS) binary, and BH -- white dwarf (WD)
binary, formed via dynamical interactions in low-mass young star clusters. Our
sample of triples was obtained self-consistently from direct N-body simulations
of star clusters which included up-to-date stellar evolution. We find that the
inner binaries in our triples cannot merge via GW radiation alone, and the ZLK
mechanism is essential to trigger their coalescence. Contrary to binaries
assembled dynamically in young star clusters, binary BHs merging in triples
have preferentially low mass ratios (q ~ 0.3) and higher primary masses (m_p >
40 MSun). We derive a local merger rate density of 0.60, 0.11 and 0.5 yr^-1
Gpc^-3 for BH-BH, BH-NS and BH-WD binaries, respectively. Additionally, we find
that merging binaries have high eccentricities across the GW spectrum,
including the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), LISA, and DECIGO frequencies. About 7% of
BH-BH and 60% of BH-NS binaries will have detectable eccentricities in the LVK

merging binaries are the strongest features for the identification of GW
mergers from triples.

ability of robots and animals alike to plan and control their actions. These
""self-models"" allow robots to consider outcomes of multiple possible future
actions, without trying them out in physical reality. Recent progress in fully
data-driven self-modeling has enabled machines to learn their own forward
kinematics directly from task-agnostic interaction data. However,
forward-kinema\-tics models can only predict limited aspects of the morphology,
such as the position of end effectors or velocity of joints and masses. A key
challenge is to model the entire morphology and kinematics, without prior
knowledge of what aspects of the morphology will be relevant to future tasks.
Here, we propose that instead of directly modeling forward-kinematics, a more
useful form of self-modeling is one that could answer space occupancy queries,
conditioned on the robot's state. Such query-driven self models are continuous
in the spatial domain, memory efficient, fully differentiable and kinematic
aware. In physical experiments, we demonstrate how a visual self-model is
accurate to about one percent of the workspace, enabling the robot to perform
various motion planning and control tasks. Visual self-modeling can also allow
the robot to detect, localize and recover from real-world damage, leading to
improved machine resiliency. Our project website is at:

That
objectness could emerge from continuous visual observations motivates us to
model grouping and movement concurrently from unlabeled videos. Our premise is
that a video has different views of the same scene related by moving
components, and the right region segmentation and region flow would allow
mutual view synthesis which can be checked from the data itself without any
external supervision. Our model starts with two separate pathways: an
appearance pathway that outputs feature-based region segmentation for a single
image, and a motion pathway that outputs motion features for a pair of images.
It then binds them in a conjoint representation called segment flow that pools
flow offsets over each region and provides a gross characterization of moving
regions for the entire scene. By training the model to minimize view synthesis
errors based on segment flow, our appearance and motion pathways learn region
segmentation and flow estimation automatically without building them up from
low-level edges or optical flows respectively. Our model demonstrates the
surprising emergence of objectness in the appearance pathway, surpassing prior
works on zero-shot object segmentation from an image, moving object
segmentation from a video with unsupervised test-time adaptation, and semantic
image segmentation by supervised fine-tuning. Our work is the first truly

estimating the trajectory of a linear dynamical system from noisy measurements.
The celebrated Kalman filter gives an optimal estimator when the measurement
noise is Gaussian, but is widely known to break down when one deviates from
this assumption, e.g. when the noise is heavy-tailed. Many ad hoc heuristics
have been employed in practice for dealing with outliers. In a pioneering work,
Schick and Mitter gave provable guarantees when the measurement noise is a
known infinitesimal perturbation of a Gaussian and raised the important
question of whether one can get similar guarantees for large and unknown
perturbations.
  In this work we give a truly robust filter: we give the first strong provable
guarantees for linear quadratic estimation when even a constant fraction of
measurements have been adversarially corrupted. This framework can model
heavy-tailed and even non-stationary noise processes. Our algorithm robustifies
the Kalman filter in the sense that it competes with the optimal algorithm that
knows the locations of the corruptions. Our work is in a challenging Bayesian
setting where the number of measurements scales with the complexity of what we
need to estimate. Moreover, in linear dynamical systems past information decays
over time. We develop a suite of new techniques to robustly extract information

the model results indicate that the known population of bright cold debris

efficiencies that are consistent with current theories of planetesimal
formation. These results support the possibility that large protoplanetary disk

connection between protoplanetary disks with large rings and mature stars with
cold debris disks implies that the remaining majority population of low-mass

even a perfect lattice has a fundamental resistance limit, given by the
Landauer conductance caused by a finite number of propagating electron modes.
This resistance, shown by Sharvin to appear at the contacts of electronic
devices, sets the ultimate conductance limit of non-interacting electrons.
Recent years have seen growing evidence of hydrodynamic electronic phenomena,
prompting recent theories to ask whether an electronic fluid can radically
break the fundamental Landauer-Sharvin limit. Here, we use single-electron
transistor imaging of electronic flow in high-mobility graphene Corbino disk
devices to answer this question. First, by imaging ballistic flows at
liquid-helium temperatures, we observe a Landauer-Sharvin resistance that does
not appear at the contacts but is instead distributed throughout the bulk. This
underpins the phase-space origin of this resistance - as emerging from spatial
gradients in the number of conduction modes. At elevated temperatures, by
identifying and accounting for electron-phonon scattering, we reveal the
details of the purely hydrodynamic flow. Strikingly, we find that electron
hydrodynamics eliminates the bulk Landuer-Sharvin resistance. Finally, by
imaging spiraling magneto-hydrodynamic Corbino flows, we reveal the key
emergent length scale predicted by hydrodynamic theories - the Gurzhi length.
These observations demonstrate that electronic fluids can dramatically
transcend the fundamental limitations of ballistic electrons, with important
implications for fundamental science and future technologies

perform full manipulation of a quantum system, and such control is only
coherent when the rate of nonlinearity is large compared to the rate of
decoherence. As a result, engineered quantum systems typically rely on a bare
nonlinearity much stronger than all decoherence rates, and this hierarchy is
usually assumed to be necessary. In this work, we challenge this assumption by
demonstrating the universal control of a quantum system where the relevant rate
of bare nonlinear interaction is comparable to the fastest rate of decoherence.
We do this by introducing a novel noise-resilient protocol for the universal
quantum control of a nearly-harmonic oscillator that takes advantage of an
in-situ enhanced nonlinearity instead of harnessing a bare nonlinearity. Our
experiment consists of a high quality-factor microwave cavity with
weak-dispersive coupling to a much lower quality superconducting qubit. By
using strong drives to temporarily excite the oscillator, we realize an
amplified three-wave-mixing interaction, achieving typical operation speeds
over an order of magnitude faster than expected from the bare dispersive
coupling. Our demonstrations include preparation of a single-photon state with
$98\pm 1(\%)$ fidelity and preparation of squeezed vacuum with a squeezing
level of $11.1$ dB, the largest intracavity squeezing reported in the microwave

only on the largest angular scales. Yet, high-statistics observatories like
IceCube and HAWC have found significant deviations from isotropy down to small
angular scales. Here, we explain the formation of small-scale anisotropies by
considering pairs of cosmic rays that get correlated by their transport through
the same realisation of the turbulent magnetic field. We argue that the
formation of small-scale anisotropies is the reflection of the particular
realisation of the turbulent magnetic field experienced by cosmic rays on time
scales intermediate between the early, ballistic regime and the late, diffusive
regime. We approach this problem in two different ways: First, we run test
particle simulations in synthetic turbulence, covering for the first time the
TV rigidities of observations with realistic turbulence parameters. Second, we
extend the recently introduced mixing matrix approach and determine the
steady-state angular power spectrum. Throughout, we adopt magneto-static,
slab-like turbulence. We find excellent agreement between the predicted angular
power spectra in both approaches over a large range of rigidities. In the
future, measurements of small-scale anisotropies will be valuable in
constraining the nature of the turbulent magnetic field in our Galactic

the Holstein model at finite temperature. We exploit the conservation of the
total momentum of the system to formulate the momentum-space HEOM whose
dynamical variables explicitly keep track of momentum exchanges between the
electron and phonons. Our symmetry-adapted HEOM enable us to overcome the
numerical instabilities inherent to the commonly used real-space HEOM. The HEOM
method is then used to study the spectral function and thermodynamic quantities
of chains containing up to ten sites. The HEOM results compare favorably to
existing literature. To provide an independent assessment of the HEOM approach
and to gain insight into the importance of finite-size effects, we devise a
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) procedure to evaluate finite-temperature
single-particle correlation functions in imaginary time and apply it to chains
containing up to twenty sites. QMC results reveal that finite-size effects are
quite weak, so that the results on 5 to 10-site chains, depending on the
parameter regime, are representative of larger systems. A detailed comparison
between the HEOM and QMC data place our HEOM method among reliable methods to
compute real-time finite-temperature correlation functions in parameter regimes
ranging from low- to high-temperature, and weak- to strong-coupling regime.

of the independence polynomial for graphs of bounded degree, for large degree
bounds. In previous work with de Boer, Guerini and Regts it was demonstrated
that this zero-free region coincides with the normality region of the related
occupation ratios. These ratios form a discrete semi-group that is in a certain
sense generated by finitely many rational maps. We will show that as the degree
bound converges to infinity, the properly rescaled normality regions converge
to a limit domain, which can be described as the maximal boundedness component
of a semi-group generated by infinitely many exponential maps.
  We prove that away from the real axis, this boundedness component avoids a
neighborhood of the boundary of the limit cardioid, answering a recent question
by Andreas Galanis. We also give an exact formula for the boundary of the
boundedness component near the positive real boundary point.

  vaccine types","29 pages, 9 figures",,,,"econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than their
populace is willing to take. This abundance and variety of vaccines created a
historical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Never before were
more types of vaccines available for an illness and the intensity of
vaccine-related public discourse is unprecedented. Yet, the heterogeneity of
hesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected so far, even though factual or
believed vaccine characteristics and patient attributes are known to influence
acceptance. We address this problem by analysing acceptance and assessment of
five vaccine types using information collected with a nationally representative
survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary, where
a unique portfolio of vaccines were available to the public in large
quantities. Our special case enables us to quantify revealed preferences across
vaccine types since one could evaluate a vaccine unacceptable and even could
reject an assigned vaccine to wait for another type. We find that the source of
information that respondents trust characterizes their attitudes towards
vaccine types differently and leads to divergent vaccine hesitancy. Believers
of conspiracy theories were significantly more likely to evaluate the mRNA
vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable while those who follow the advice of
politicians evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virus
vaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable with higher likelihood. We illustrate that the
rejection of non-desired and re-selection of preferred vaccines fragments the
population by the mRNA versus other type of vaccines while it generally
improves the assessment of the received vaccine. These results highlight that
greater variance of available vaccine types and individual free choice are
desirable conditions that can widen the acceptance of vaccines in societies.

in a general and comprehensive form and has been implemented in simulating
kinetic Alfv\'en waves in uniform plasma [Chen et al, Science China Phys.
Mechanics & Astronomy 64 (2021)]. In our work, the Chen et al. GK-E&B model has
been expressed in general tokamak geometry explicitly using specific
coordinates. Its reduction to the uniform plasma is verified and the numerical
results show good agreement with the work by Chen et al. The theoretical
dispersion relation and numerical results in the local screw pinch model are in
excellent agreement. Numerical results show excellent performance in a
realistic parameter regime of burning plasmas in terms of high values of $\beta
/( M_e k_\perp^2 \rho_i^2)$, which is challenging for traditional methods due
to the ``cancellation' problem. As one application, the GK-E&B model is
implemented with kinetic electrons in the local limit. With the matched
ITPA-TAE parameters, numerical results show the capability of the GK-E&B in
treating the parallel electron Landau damping for realistic tokamak plasma
parameters. As another application, the global GK-E&B model is implemented with
the dominant electron contribution to $E_\|$ in the cold electron limit. Its
capability in simulating the finite $E_\|$ due to the finite electron mass is
demonstrated.

on heavy compiler optimization to squeeze extra value from noisy machines but
are fundamentally limited by hardware. Alone, these software approaches help to
maximize the use of available hardware but cannot overcome the inherent
limitations posed by the underlying technology. An alternative approach is to
explore the use of new, though potentially less developed, technology as a path
towards scalability. In this work we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages
of a Neutral Atom (NA) architecture. NA systems offer several promising
advantages such as long range interactions and native multiqubit gates which
reduce communication overhead, overall gate count, and depth for compiled
programs. Long range interactions, however, impede parallelism with restriction
zones surrounding interacting qubit pairs. We extend current compiler methods
to maximize the benefit of these advantages and minimize the cost. Furthermore,
atoms in an NA device have the possibility to randomly be lost over the course
of program execution which is extremely detrimental to total program execution
time as atom arrays are slow to load. When the compiled program is no longer
compatible with the underlying topology, we need a fast and efficient coping
mechanism. We propose hardware and compiler methods to increase system
resilience to atom loss dramatically reducing total computation time by
circumventing complete reloads or full recompilation every cycle.

detection of its progenitor (system); however, the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the pre-explosion source appears much cooler and overluminous than an
expected helium-star progenitor. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and
MUSE integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy, we find the SN environment
contains three episodes of star formation; the low ejecta mass suggests the SN
progenitor is most likely from the oldest population, corresponding to an
initial mass of 10.4$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ $M_\odot$. The pre-explosion SED can be
reproduced by two components, one for the hot and compact SN progenitor and one
for a cool and inflated yellow hypergiant (YHG) companion that dominates the
brightness. Thus, SN 2019yvr could possibly be the first Type Ib/c SN for which
the progenitor's binary companion is directly detected on pre-explosion images.
Both the low progenitor mass and the YHG companion suggest significant binary
interaction during their evolution. Similar to SN 2014C, SN 2019yvr exhibits a
metamorphosis from Type Ib to Type IIn, showing signatures of interaction with
hydrogen-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at >150 days; our result supports
enhanced pre-SN mass loss as an important process for hydrogen-poor stars at
the low mass end of core-collapse SN progenitors.

on the other hand is a distributed technique that can train any GNN type
directly on an entire large graph. The key innovation in SAR is the distributed
sequential rematerialization scheme which sequentially re-constructs then frees
pieces of the prohibitively large GNN computational graph during the backward
pass. This results in excellent memory scaling behavior where the memory
consumption per worker goes down linearly with the number of workers, even for
densely connected graphs. Using SAR, we report the largest applications of
full-batch GNN training to-date, and demonstrate large memory savings as the
number of workers increases. We also present a general technique based on
kernel fusion and attention-matrix rematerialization to optimize both the

(c) frames through 8-13 different CT's for the same patient to quantify
expected inter-treatment frame variation. ROC analysis of per-frame error
discrimination based upon (i) frame image differences, (ii) frame histogram
comparisons, (iii) image feature matching, and (iv) image distance were used to
quantify error detectability. $\textbf{Results:}$ Each error detection method
was able to distinguish gross patient miss-alignment and gross rotations from
in-tolerance levels for both H&N and prostate datasets. The image distance
algorithm is the best method based on AUC. $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ In-field
gross error detection was possible for gross patient miss-alignments and
incorrect patients. For prostate cases, the methods used were able to
distinguish different patients from daily patient variations.

fluorescent emission. On the one hand, they locally amplify the electromagnetic
fields, increasing the emitter excitation rate, and on the other hand, they
provide a high local density of states that accelerates spontaneous emission.
However, when the emitter is placed in close proximity to a single metal
nanoparticle, the number of nonradiative states increases dramatically, causing
the fluorescence to quench. It has been predicted theoretically that, through a
judicious placing of the emitter, fluorescence in plasmonic nanocavities can be
increased at monotonically. In this article, we show that such monotonic
increase is due to the use of local response approximation in the description
of the plasmonic response of metal nanoparticles. We demonstrate that taking
into account the electron tunneling and the nonlocality of the surrounding
system via the quantum hydrodynamic theory results eventually in a quenching of
fluorescence enhancement also when the emitter is placed in a nanocavity, as
opposed to local response and Thomas-Fermi hydrodynamic theory results. This
outcome marks the importance of considering the quantum effects, in particular,
the electron tunneling to correctly describe the emission effects in plasmonic
systems at nanoscale.

molecular-level mechanism of this process remains unknown. In this work,

Specifically, we address this problem by examining the individual steps of
hydrogen embrittlement, including surface adsorption, subsurface absorption,
and the inter-layer diffusion of atomic hydrogen. Furthermore, by examining
these processes across different facets, we highlight the importance of both
(1) hydrogen monolayer coverage and (2) applied tensile strain on hydriding
kinetics. Taken together, by studying previously overlooked phenomena, this
study provides foundational insights into the initial steps of this overall
complex process. We anticipate that this work will guide near-term future
development of multiscale kinetic models for uranium hydriding and
subsequently, identify potential strategies to mitigate this undesired process.

theoretical models aiming to understand and predict nuclear fission.
Discontinuities frequently arise in these surfaces in unconstrained collective
coordinates, leading to missing or incorrect results.
  Purpose: This work aims to produce efficient and physically-motivated
computational algorithms to refine potential energy surfaces by removing
discontinuities.
  Method: Procedures based on tree-search algorithms are developed which are
capable of smoothing discontinuities in one and two-dimensional potential
energy surfaces while minimising their overall energy.
  Results: Each of the new methods is applied to smooth candidate
discontinuities in ${}^{252}\mathrm{Cf}$, ${}^{222}\mathrm{Th}$ and
${}^{218}\mathrm{Ra}$. The effectiveness of each case is analysed both
qualitatively and quantitatively. The one-dimensional method is also compared
to the adiabatic and linear interpolation approaches which are commonly used to
remove discontinuities.
  Conclusions: The smoothing methods presented in this work are
resource-efficient and successful for one- and two-dimensional discontinuities;
they will improve the fidelity of potential energy surfaces as well as their
subsequent uses in beyond mean-field applications. Complex discontinuities
occurring in higher dimensions may require alternative approaches which better
utilise prior knowledge of the potential energy surface to narrow their
searches.

approach has advantages over previous approaches. First, the facial expressions
are anatomically consistent as our biomechanical model emulates the relevant
anatomy of the face, head, and neck. Second, by training the neural network
using data generated from the biomechanical model itself, we eliminate the
manual effort of data collection for expression transfer. The success of our

characterise the type II supernovae (SNe~II) from the Carnegie Supernova

SNe~II. We outline our methodology to calculate the bolometric luminosity,
which consists of the integration of the observed fluxes in numerous
photometric bands ($uBgVriYJH$) and black-body (BB) extrapolations to account
for the unobserved flux at shorter and longer wavelengths. BB fits were
performed using all available broadband data except when line blanketing
effects appeared. Photometric bands bluer than $r$ that are affected by line
blanketing were removed from the fit, which makes near-infrared (NIR)
observations highly important to estimate reliable BB extrapolations to the
infrared. BB fits without NIR data produce notably different bolometric light
curves, and therefore different estimates of SN~II progenitor and explosion
properties when data are modelled. We present two methods to address the
absence of NIR observations: (a) colour-colour relationships from which NIR
magnitudes can be estimated using optical colours, and (b) new prescriptions
for bolometric corrections as a function of observed SN~II colours. Using our
74 SN~II bolometric light curves, we provide a full characterisation of their
properties based on several observed parameters. We measured magnitudes at
different epochs, as well as durations and decline rates of different phases of
the evolution. An analysis of the light-curve parameter distributions was
performed, finding a wide range and a continuous sequence of observed

Although topological Anderson insulators have been observed in various

Anderson insulators protected by time-reversal symmetry remains scarce, which
are considered to be more promising in applications such as the integrated
devices. Here, we report the experimental observation of topological Anderson
insulator in a two-dimensional bilayer phononic crystal. The robust

and society. Partly for simplicity's sake, many studies have focused on their
projection onto their unipartite versions where one only needs to care about a
single type of node. When it comes to mesoscale structures such as communities,
however, properly incorporating a priori structural restrictions such as
bipartivity is ever more important. In this paper, as a case study, we take the
community structure of bipartite networks in various scales to examine the
amount of information of bipartivity encoded in the community detection
procedure. In particular, we report the robustness in reliability of detected
community based on consistency by comparing the detection algorithm with or
without the consideration of bipartivity. From the analysis with model networks
embedding prescribed communities and real networks, we find that the community
detection tailored to take the bipartivity into account clearly yields more
robust community structures than the one without such structural information.
This demonstrates the necessity for customizing the community detection
algorithm by encoding whatever information is known about networks of interest
and, at the same time, raises an interesting question on the possibility of
estimating the quantitative amount of information from such a customization.

of columns and a group of rows) within a matrix of data such that the elements
of each sub-matrix (data and features) are related in a particular way, for
instance, that they are similar with respect to some metric. In this paper,
after analyzing the well-known Cheng and Church (CC) bi-clustering algorithm
which has been proved to be an effective tool for mining co-expressed genes.
However, Cheng and Church bi-clustering algorithm and summarizing its
limitations (such as interference of random numbers in the greedy strategy;
ignoring overlapping bi-clusters), we propose a novel enhancement of the
adaptive bi-clustering algorithm, where a shielding complex sub-matrix is
constructed to shield the bi-clusters that have been obtained and to discover
the overlapping bi-clusters. In the shielding complex sub-matrix, the imaginary
and the real parts are used to shield and extend the new bi-clusters,
respectively, and to form a series of optimal bi-clusters. To assure that the
obtained bi-clusters have no effect on the bi-clusters already produced, a unit
impulse signal is introduced to adaptively detect and shield the constructed
bi-clusters. Meanwhile, to effectively shield the null data (zero-size data),
another unit impulse signal is set for adaptive detecting and shielding. In
addition, we add a shielding factor to adjust the mean squared residue score of
the rows (or columns), which contains the shielded data of the sub-matrix, to
decide whether to retain them or not. We offer a thorough analysis of the
developed scheme. The experimental results are in agreement with the
theoretical analysis. The results obtained on a publicly available real
microarray dataset show the enhancement of the bi-clusters performance thanks
to the proposed method.

(STOC'11) proved that the Moser-Tardos algorithm is efficient up to the tight
condition of the abstract Lov{\'a}sz Local Lemma, known as Shearer's bound. A
fundamental problem around LLL is whether the efficient region of the
Moser-Tardos algorithm can be further extended. In this paper, we give a
positive answer to this problem. We show that the efficient region of the
Moser-Tardos algorithm goes beyond the Shearer's bound of the underlying
dependency graph, if the graph is not chordal. Otherwise, the dependency graph
is chordal, and it has been shown that Shearer's bound exactly characterizes
the efficient region for such graphs (Kolipaka and Szegedy, STOC'11; He, Li,
Liu, Wang and Xia, FOCS'17). Moreover, we demonstrate that the efficient region
can exceed Shearer's bound by a constant by explicitly calculating the gaps on
several infinite lattices. The core of our proof is a new criterion on the
efficiency of the Moser-Tardos algorithm which takes the intersection between
dependent events into consideration. Our criterion is strictly better than
Shearer's bound whenever the intersection exists between dependent events.
Meanwhile, if any two dependent events are mutually exclusive, our criterion
becomes the Shearer's bound, which is known to be tight in this situation for

radius), explosion energy, $^{56}$Ni mass, and its degree of mixing within the
ejecta for a large sample of SNe II. This dataset was obtained by the Carnegie
Supernova Project-I and is characterised by a high cadence of their optical and
NIR light curves and optical spectra that were homogeneously observed and
processed. A large grid of hydrodynamical models and a fitting procedure based
on MCMC methods were used to fit the bolometric light curve and the evolution
of the photospheric velocity of 53 SNe II. We infer ejecta masses between 7.9
and 14.8 $M_{\odot}$, explosion energies between 0.15 and 1.40 foe, and
$^{56}$Ni masses between 0.006 and 0.069 $M_{\odot}$. We define a subset of
24~SNe (the `gold sample') with well-sampled bolometric light curves and
expansion velocities for which we consider the results more robust. Most SNe~II
in the gold sample ($\sim$88%) are found with ejecta masses in the range of
$\sim$8-10 $M_{\odot}$, coming from low zero-age main-sequence masses (9-12
$M_{\odot}$). The modelling of the initial-mass distribution of the gold sample
gives an upper mass limit of 21.3$^{+3.8}_{-0.4}$ $M_{\odot}$ and a much
steeper distribution than that for a Salpeter massive-star IMF. This IMF
incompatibility is due to the large number of low-mass progenitors found --
when assuming standard stellar evolution. This may imply that high-mass
progenitors lose more mass during their lives than predicted. However, a deeper
analysis of all stellar evolution assumptions is required to test this
hypothesis.

undirected graph (with no centralized node). The estimation problem is
formulated as the minimization of the sum of the local LASSO loss functions
plus a quadratic penalty of the consensus constraint -- the latter being
instrumental to obtain distributed solution methods. While penalty-based
consensus methods have been extensively studied in the optimization literature,
their statistical and computational guarantees in the high dimensional setting
remain unclear. This work provides an answer to this open problem. Our
contribution is two-fold. First, we establish statistical consistency of the
estimator: under a suitable choice of the penalty parameter, the optimal
solution of the penalized problem achieves near optimal minimax rate
$\mathcal{O}(s \log d/N)$ in $\ell_2$-loss, where $s$ is the sparsity value,
$d$ is the ambient dimension, and $N$ is the total sample size in the network
-- this matches centralized sample rates. Second, we show that the
proximal-gradient algorithm applied to the penalized problem, which naturally
leads to distributed implementations, converges linearly up to a tolerance of
the order of the centralized statistical error -- the rate scales as
$\mathcal{O}(d)$, revealing an unavoidable speed-accuracy dilemma.Numerical

three model compression schemes: pruning, quantization, and knowledge
distillation, we can reduce model complexity further while mitigating the
performance degradation. The proposed system achieves an average test accuracy

compact ones, compression technique appears to be a practical solution to
reducing the storage and memory consumption. In this paper, we develop a
nonlinear tensor ring network (NTRN) in which both fullyconnected and
convolutional layers are compressed via tensor ring decomposition. Furthermore,
to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by compression, a nonlinear activation
function is embedded into the tensor contraction and convolution operations
inside the compressed layer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness

costly-to-evaluate black-box functions. Most BO methods ignore how evaluation
costs may vary over the optimization domain. However, these costs can be highly
heterogeneous and are often unknown in advance. This occurs in many practical
settings, such as hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms or
physics-based simulation optimization. Moreover, those few existing methods
that acknowledge cost heterogeneity do not naturally accommodate a budget
constraint on the total evaluation cost. This combination of unknown costs and
a budget constraint introduces a new dimension to the exploration-exploitation
trade-off, where learning about the cost incurs the cost itself. Existing
methods do not reason about the various trade-offs of this problem in a
principled way, leading often to poor performance. We formalize this claim by
proving that the expected improvement and the expected improvement per unit of
cost, arguably the two most widely used acquisition functions in practice, can
be arbitrarily inferior with respect to the optimal non-myopic policy. To
overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose the budgeted
multi-step expected improvement, a non-myopic acquisition function that
generalizes classical expected improvement to the setting of heterogeneous and
unknown evaluation costs. Finally, we show that our acquisition function
outperforms existing methods in a variety of synthetic and real problems.

condition that guarantees local exponential stability of the two equilibria

existence and finding examples of networks with more than three nodes that

that, for any arbitrary number of nodes, such networks exist. We do this by
proving that given almost any network layer of one virus, there exists a
network layer for the other virus such that the resulting two-layer network
satisfies the aforementioned condition. To operationalize our findings, a
four-step procedure is developed to reliably and consistently design one of the

anomalous sound under domain shifts is proposed. A domain shift occurs when a
machine's physical parameters change. Because a domain shift changes the
distribution of normal sound data, conventional unsupervised anomaly detection
methods can output false positives. To solve this problem, the proposed method
constrains some latent variables of a normalizing flows (NF) model to represent
physical parameters, which enables disentanglement of the factors of domain
shifts and learning of a latent space that is invariant with respect to these
domain shifts. Anomaly scores calculated from this domain-shift-invariant
latent space are unaffected by such shifts, which reduces false positives and
improves the detection performance. Experiments were conducted with sound data
from a slide rail under different operation velocities. The results show that
the proposed method disentangled the velocity to obtain a latent space that was
invariant with respect to domain shifts, which improved the AUC by 13.2% for
Glow with a single block and 2.6% for Glow with multiple blocks.

  fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell: A combined numerical and experimental study","24 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The results from a series of well characterised, unstable, miscible
displacement experiments in a Hele Shaw cell with a quarter five-spot
source-sink geometry are presented, with comparisons to detailed numerical
simulation. We perform repeated experiments at adverse viscosity ratios from 1
- 20 and Peclet numbers from 10$^4$ - 10$^6$ capturing the transition from 2D
to 3D radial fingering and experimental uncertainty. The open-access dataset
provides time-lapse images of the fingering patterns, transient effluent
profiles, and meta-information for use in model validation. We find the
complexity of the fingering pattern increases with viscosity ratio and Peclet
number, and the onset of fingering is delayed compared to linear displacements,
likely due to Taylor dispersion stabilisation. The transition from 2D to 3D
fingering occurs at a critical Peclet number that is consistent with recent
experiments in the literature. 2D numerical simulations with hydrodynamic
dispersion and different mesh orientations provide good predictions of
breakthrough times and sweep efficiency obtained at intermediate Peclet numbers
across the range of viscosity ratios tested, generally within the experimental
uncertainty. Specific finger wavelengths, tip shapes, and growth are hard to
replicate; model predictions using velocity dependent longitudinal dispersion
or simple molecular diffusion bound the fingering evolution seen in the
experiments, but neither fully capture both fine-scale and macroscopic
measures. In both cases simulations predict sharper fingers than the
experiment. A weaker dispersion stabilisation seems necessary to capture the
experimental fingering at high viscosity ratio, which may also require
anisotropic components. 3D models with varying dispersion formulations should
be explored in future developments to capture the full range of effects at high
viscosity ratio and Peclet number.

caused by star-planet tidal interaction which can explain the orbital migration
of hot Jupiters. We report the TTV of XO-3b, using TESS observed timings and
archival timings. We generate a photometric pipeline to produce light curves
from raw TESS images and find the difference between our pipeline and TESS PDC
is negligible for timing analysis. TESS timing presents a shift of 17.6 minutes
(80 $\sigma$), earlier than the prediction from the previous ephemeris. The
best linear fit for all timings available gives a Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) value of 439. A quadratic function is a better model with a BIC
of 56. The period derivative obtained from a quadratic function is
-6.2$\times$10$^{-9}$$\pm$2.9$\times$10$^{-10}$ per orbit, indicating an
orbital decay timescale 1.4 Myr. We find that the orbital period decay can be
well explained by tidal interaction. The `modified tidal quality factor'
$Q_{p}'$ would be 1.8$\times$10$^{4}$$\pm$8$\times$10$^{2}$ if we assume the
decay is due to the tide in the planet; whereas $Q_{*}'$ would be
1.5$\times$10$^{5}$$\pm$6$\times$10$^{3}$ if tidal dissipation is predominantly
in the star. The precession model is another possible origin to explain the
observed TTVs. We note that the follow-up observations of occultation timing
and radial velocity monitoring are needed for fully discriminating the
different models.

low-dissipation properties in order to capture the amplitude and phase of the
wave correctly. To improve the spectral properties of the scheme, the authors
have previously proposed a scale sensor to automatically adjust the numerical
dissipation. In consequence, a fourth-order finite difference scheme with
minimized dispersion and adaptive dissipation (MDAD) has been proposed [1]. In
this study, we further investigate this method for the high-fidelity numerical
simulation of the acoustic problems and a new dispersion control method is
proposed which is different from the traditional dispersion relation preserving
(DRP) approach. Firstly, the scale sensor, which quantifies the local length
scale of the solution as the effective scaled wavenumber, is modified for
better performance on composite waves. Then the scale sensor is applied to
control both the dispersion and dissipation of the scheme. The relationships
between the dispersion/dissipation parameter and the effective scaled
wavenumber are analytically and artificially constructed respectively. Thus, a
fourth-order finite difference scheme with accurate dispersion and adaptive
dissipation (ADAD) is constructed. The approximate dispersion relation (ADR)
shows that the ADAD scheme achieves accurate dispersion property at k < 2.5.
The dissipation is negligible at low wave number and gradually increases after
k = 1 to suppress non-physical oscillations. Several benchmark cases of
computational acoustics are presented to verify the high resolution of the
proposed scheme compared with the conventional spectral optimized schemes.

joint optimizing the active beamforming at the access point and the passive
beamforming vector of the RIS elements. Unlike most existing works, we consider
the more practical situation with the discrete phase shifts and imperfect
channel state information (CSI). Specifically, for the situation that the
discrete phase shifts and perfect CSI are considered, we first develop a deep
quantization neural network (DQNN) to simultaneously design the active and
passive beamforming while most reported works design them alternatively. Then,
we propose an improved structure (I-DQNN) based on DQNN to simplify the
parameters decision process when the control bits of each RIS element are
greater than 1 bit. Finally, we extend the two proposed DQNN-based algorithms
to the case that the discrete phase shifts and imperfect CSI are considered
simultaneously. Our simulation results show that the two DQNN-based algorithms
have better performance than traditional algorithms in the perfect CSI case,

investigation here includes the spherical solutions of the NSs as well as their
perturbative properties, namely the tidal deformability and the moment of
inertia, treated in a unified and extendable way under the framework of
spherical decomposition. We find that while the mass, the radius, and the
moment of inertia of the spontaneously scalarized NSs show very moderate

deformability exhibits significant differences between the solutions in GR and
the solutions of spontaneous scalarization for certain values of the parameters

(TSN) and ultra reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). However, it
still remains an open problem. In this paper, we put our focus on the analysis
of the tail distribution of the queue length from the perspective of
cross-layer design in wireless link transmission. We find that, under the
finite average power consumption constraint, the queue length violation
probability can achieve zero with diversity gains, while it can have a
linear-decay-rate exponent according to large deviation theory (LDT) with
limited receiver sensitivity. Besides, we find that the arbitrary-decay-rate
queue length tail distribution with the finite average power consumption exists
in the Rayleigh fading channel. Then, we generalize the sufficient conditions
for the communication system belonging to these three scenarios, respectively.
Moreover, we apply the above results to analyze the wireless link transmission
in the Nakagami-m fading channel. Numerical results with approximation validate
our analysis.

requires that their emission mechanism must be ""coherent"", either through
concerted particle emission by bunches or through an exponential growth of a
plasma wave mode or radiation amplitude via certain maser mechanisms. The
bunching mechanism has been mostly discussed within the context of curvature
radiation or cyclotron/synchrotron radiation. Here we propose a family of model
invoking coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of bunched particles that
may operate within or just outside of the magnetosphere of a flaring magnetar.
Crustal oscillations during the flaring event may excite low-frequency
electromagnetic waves near the magnetar surface. The X-mode of these waves
could penetrate through the magnetosphere. Bunched relativistic particles in
the charge starved region inside the magnetosphere or in the current sheet
outside of the magnetosphere would upscatter these low-frequency waves to
produce GHz emission to power FRBs. The ICS mechanism has a much larger
emission power for individual electrons than curvature radiation. This greatly
reduces the required degree of coherence in bunches, alleviating several
criticisms to the bunching mechanism raised in the context of curvature
radiation. The emission is $\sim 100\%$ linearly polarized (with the
possibility of developing circular polarization) with a constant or varying
polarization angle across each burst. The mechanism can account for a
narrow-band spectrum and a frequency downdrifting pattern, as commonly observed
in repeating FRBs.

efficiency of a statistical estimation problem with differential privacy
guarantees. Our framework, which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release

statistics, and the Propose-Test-Release mechanism. Gluing all these together
is the concept of resilience, which is central to robust statistical
estimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity
analysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in
Propose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential
mechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional robust statistics,
then the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using
resilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds
readily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We
give a general recipe for applying HPTR to a given instance of a statistical
estimation problem and demonstrate it on canonical problems of mean estimation,
linear regression, covariance estimation, and principal component analysis. We
introduce a general utility analysis technique that proves that HPTR nearly

usually limited by the graph constructed on the original features, it is
attractive to find whether graph neural networks (GNNs) can be applied to
augment the capacity. The core problems mainly come from two aspects: (1) the
graph is unavailable in the most clustering scenes so that how to construct
high-quality graphs on the non-graph data is usually the most important part;
(2) given n samples, the graph-based clustering methods usually consume at
least $\mathcal O(n^2)$ time to build graphs and the graph convolution requires
nearly $\mathcal O(n^2)$ for a dense graph and $\mathcal O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ for
a sparse one with $|\mathcal{E}|$ edges. Accordingly, both graph-based
clustering and GNNs suffer from the severe inefficiency problem. To tackle
these problems, we propose a novel clustering method, AnchorGAE, with the
self-supervised estimation of graph and efficient graph convolution. We first
show how to convert a non-graph dataset into a graph dataset, by introducing
the generative graph model and anchors. We then show that the constructed
bipartite graph can reduce the computational complexity of graph convolution
from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ and $\mathcal O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $\mathcal O(n)$. The
succeeding steps for clustering can be easily designed as $\mathcal O(n)$
operations. Interestingly, the anchors naturally lead to siamese architecture
with the help of the Markov process. Furthermore, the estimated bipartite graph
is updated dynamically according to the features extracted by GNN, to promote
the quality of the graph. However, we theoretically prove that the
self-supervised paradigm frequently results in a collapse that often occurs
after 2-3 update iterations in experiments, especially when the model is
well-trained. A specific strategy is accordingly designed to prevent the
collapse.

underlying the thermodynamic anomalies of ambient liquid water. In this
approach, two sound velocity measurements with different frequencies, namely
inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) in THz band and ultrasonic (US) in MHz band,
are required to investigate the relaxation phenomenon with the characteristic
frequency between the two aforementioned frequencies. We performed IXS
measurements to obtain the IXS sound velocity of liquid water from the ambient
conditions to the supercritical region of liquid-gas phase transition (LGT) and
compared the results with the US sound velocity in the literature. We found
that the ratio of the two sound velocities, Sf, which corresponds to the
relaxation intensity, exhibits a simple but significant change. Two distinct
rises were observed in the high-temperature and low-temperature regions,
implying that two relaxation phenomena exist: in the high-temperature region, a
peak was observed near the LGT critical ridge line, which was linked with
changes in the density fluctuation and isochoric and isobaric specific heat
capacities; in the low-temperature region, Sf increased toward the
low-temperature region, which was linked with the change in the isochoric heat
capacity. We concluded that these two relaxation phenomena are originated from
critical fluctuations of liquid-gas phase transition (LGT) and liquid-liquid
phase transition, respectively. The linkage between Sf and isochoric heat

poles in desired convex regions in the complex plane. We considered the system
state and input matrices to be unknown and can only use the measurements of the
system trajectories. The closed-loop pole placement problem in the linear
matrix inequality (LMI) regions is considered a classic robust control problem;
however, that requires knowledge about the state and input matrices of the
linear system. We bring in ideas from the behavioral system theory and
persistency of excitation condition-based fundamental lemma to develop a
data-driven counterpart that satisfies multiple closed-loop robustness
specifications, such as $\mathcal{D}$-stability and mixed $H_2/H_{\infty}$
performance specifications. Our formulations lead to data-driven semi-definite
programs (SDPs) that are coupled with sufficient theoretical guarantees. We
validate the theoretical results with numerical simulations on a third-order

maintain a healthy balance between the efficient modeling long-range
dependencies across nodes while avoiding unintended consequences such
oversmoothed node representations or sensitivity to spurious edges. To address
this issue (among other things), two separate strategies have recently been
proposed, namely implicit and unfolded GNNs. The former treats node
representations as the fixed points of a deep equilibrium model that can
efficiently facilitate arbitrary implicit propagation across the graph with a
fixed memory footprint. In contrast, the latter involves treating graph
propagation as unfolded descent iterations as applied to some graph-regularized
energy function. While motivated differently, in this paper we carefully
quantify explicit situations where the solutions they produce are equivalent
and others where their properties sharply diverge. This includes the analysis
of convergence, representational capacity, and interpretability. In support of
this analysis, we also provide empirical head-to-head comparisons across
multiple synthetic and public real-world node classification benchmarks. These
results indicate that while IGNN is substantially more memory-efficient, UGNN
models support unique, integrated graph attention mechanisms and propagation
rules that can achieve SOTA node classification accuracy across disparate
regimes such as adversarially-perturbed graphs, graphs with heterophily, and
graphs involving long-range dependencies.

hundred MeV/nucleon in which the emissions of heavy fragments with the charge
numbers larger than 3 become crucial. To make the CNN applicable in the task of
the impact parameter determination at the present energy range, specific
improvements are made in the input selection, the CNN construction and the CNN
training. It is demonstrated from the comparisons of the deep CNN method and
the conventional methods with the impact parameter-sensitive observables, that
the deep CNN method shows better performance for determining the impact
parameters, especially leading to the capability of providing better
recognition of the central collision events. With a proper consideration of the
experimental filter effect in both training and testing processes to keep
consistency with the actual experiments, the good performance of the deep CNN
method holds, and shows significantly better in terms of predicting the impact
parameters and recognizing the central collision events, compared to that of
the conventional methods, demonstrating the superiority of the present deep CNN
method. The deep CNN method with the consideration of the filter effect is
applied in the deduction of nuclear stopping power. Higher accuracy for the
stopping power deduction is achieved benefitting from the better impact

The CAPM uses an integro-differential approach in combination with power law
ansatz functions for the velocity profiles and a Hirs' model to calculate the
resulting pressure field. Third, for experimental validation, a setup is
presented using magnetic bearings to inherently measure the position as well as
the force on the rotor induced by the flow field inside the gap. The

information evolves in complex networks. However, a general theory to
characterize information evolution is yet absent. Consequently, numerous
unknowns remain about the mechanisms underlying information evolution. Among
these unknowns, a fundamental problem, being a seeming paradox, lies in the
coexistence of local randomness, manifested as the stochastic distortion of
information content during individual-individual diffusion, and global
regularity, illustrated by specific non-random patterns of information content
on the network scale. Here, we attempt to formalize information evolution and
explain the coexistence of randomness and regularity in complex networks.
Applying network dynamics and information theory, we discover that a certain
amount of information, determined by the selectivity of networks to the input
information, frequently survives from random distortion. Other information will
inevitably experience distortion or dissipation, whose speeds are shaped by the
diversity of information selectivity in networks. The discovered laws exist
irrespective of noise, but the noise accounts for the intensification. We
further demonstrate the ubiquity of our discovered laws by analyzing the
emergence of neural tuning properties in the primary visual and medial temporal

the field. Our goal is to find the acceptable value of $c$ for this scattering
and our method is based on setting the mass of the proton as an eigenvalue of
the baryonic state equations of the DIS to find the acceptable value of the

we calculate wave function equations for the baryonic states where the mass of
the proton target requires a value contribution of $c$ as $c = 0.0120 {\rm

derive the holographic interaction action related to the amplitude of the

of the DD-MZM, while the received signal including the leakage signal and echo
signals is applied to the lower arm of the DD-MZM. When the amplitudes and
delays of the leakage cancellation reference signal and the leakage signal are
precisely matched and the DD-MZM is biased at the minimum transmission point,
the leakage signal is canceled in the optical domain. The de-chirped signals
are obtained after the leakage-free optical signal is detected in a
photodetector. An experiment is performed. The cancellation depth of the
de-chirped leakage signal is around 23 dB when the center frequency and
bandwidth of the linearly frequency-modulated signal are 11.5 and 2 GHz. The
leakage cancellation scheme is used in a radar system. When the leakage
cancellation is not employed, the leakage signal will seriously affect the

transmission between the system and its environment. The framework depicted in
the current research attempts to glance at the critical role of the internal
orders inside the non-isolated system in shaping the information thermodynamics
coupling. We characterize the coupling as a generalized encoding process, where
the system acts as an information thermodynamics encoder to encode the external
information based on thermodynamics. We formalize the encoding process in the
context of the nonequilibrium second law of thermodynamics, revealing an
intrinsic difference in information thermodynamics characteristics between
information thermodynamics encoders with and without internal correlations.
During the information encoding process of an external source $\mathsf{Y}$,
specific sub-systems in an encoder $\mathsf{X}$ with internal correlations can
exceed the information thermodynamics bound on
$\left(\mathsf{X},\mathsf{Y}\right)$ and encode more information than system
$\mathsf{X}$ works as a whole. We computationally verify this theoretical
finding in an Ising model with a random external field and a neural data set of
the human brain during visual perception and recognition. Our analysis
demonstrates that the stronger internal correlation inside these systems
implies a higher possibility for specific sub-systems to encode more
information than the global one. These findings may suggest a new perspective
in studying information thermodynamics in diverse physical and biological
systems.

a static environment is investigated. It is shown that the shape of the wave
varies periodically as a manifestation of its peculiar properties of
nonstaticity like the case of the Fock-state analysis for a nonstatic wave. A
belly occurs in the graphic of wave evolution whenever the wave is maximally
displaced in the quadrature space, whereas a node takes place every time the
wave passes the equilibrium point during its oscillation. In this way, a belly
and a node appear in turn successively. Whereas this change of wave profile is
accompanied by the periodic variation of electric and magnetic energies, the
total energy is conserved. The fluctuations of quadratures also vary in a
regular manner according to the wave transformation in time. While the
resultant time-varying uncertainty product is always larger than (or, at least,
equal to) its quantum-mechanically allowed minimal value ($\hbar/2$), it is
smallest whenever the wave constitutes a belly or a node. The mechanism
underlying the abnormal features of nonstatic light waves demonstrated here can
be interpreted by the rotation of the squeezed-shape contour of the Wigner
distribution function in phase space.

the Virgo cluster carried out with MegaCam at the CFHT, we discovered 8 massive
lenticular galaxies with prominent ionised gas emission features in their inner
(few kpc) regions. These features are either ionised gas filaments similar to
those observed in cooling flows (2 gal), or thin discs with sizes 0.7<R(Ha)<2.0
kpc (6 gal), thus significantly smaller than those of the stellar disc. These
discs have morphological properties similar to those of the dust seen in
absorption in high-resolution HST images. Using a unique set of multifrequency
data we show that while the gas located within these inner discs is
photoionised by young stars, signaling ongoing star formation, the gas in the
filamentary structures is shock-ionised. These discs have a star formation
surface brightness similar to those observed in late-type galaxies. Because of
their reduced size, however, these lenticular galaxies are located below the
main sequence of unperturbed or cluster star-forming systems. By comparing the
dust masses measured from absorption maps in optical images, from the Balmer
decrement, or estimated by fitting the UV-to-far-IR spectral energy
distribution of the target galaxies, we confirm that those derived from optical
attenuation maps are heavily underestimated because of geometrical effects due
to the relative distribution of the absorbing dust and the emitting stars. We
have also shown that these galaxies have gas-to-dust ratios of G/D~80, and that
the star formation within these discs follows the Schmidt relation, albeit with
an efficiency reduced by a factor of ~ 2.5. Using our unique set of
multifrequency data, we discuss the possible origin of the ionised gas in these
objects, which suggests multiple and complex formation scenarios for massive
lenticular galaxies in clusters.

generative model for real-world datasets. In particular, we propose to learn a
closed-loop transcription between a multi-class multi-dimensional data
distribution and a linear discriminative representation (LDR) in the feature
space that consists of multiple independent multi-dimensional linear subspaces.
In particular, we argue that the optimal encoding and decoding mappings sought
can be formulated as the equilibrium point of a two-player minimax game between
the encoder and decoder. A natural utility function for this game is the
so-called rate reduction, a simple information-theoretic measure for distances
between mixtures of subspace-like Gaussians in the feature space. Our
formulation draws inspiration from closed-loop error feedback from control
systems and avoids expensive evaluating and minimizing approximated distances
between arbitrary distributions in either the data space or the feature space.
To a large extent, this new formulation unifies the concepts and benefits of
Auto-Encoding and GAN and naturally extends them to the settings of learning a
both discriminative and generative representation for multi-class and
multi-dimensional real-world data. Our extensive experiments on many benchmark
imagery datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop
formulation: under fair comparison, visual quality of the learned decoder and
classification performance of the encoder is competitive and often better than
existing methods based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. Unlike existing
generative models, the so learned features of the multiple classes are
structured: different classes are explicitly mapped onto corresponding
independent principal subspaces in the feature space. Source code can be found

adequate way to supervise PA detectors learning sufficient and intrinsic
spoofing cues. Instead of using the handcrafted labels, we propose a novel
Meta-Teacher FAS (MT-FAS) method to train a meta-teacher for supervising PA
detectors more effectively. The meta-teacher is trained in a bi-level
optimization manner to learn the ability to supervise the PA detectors learning
rich spoofing cues. The bi-level optimization contains two key components: 1) a
lower-level training in which the meta-teacher supervises the detector's
learning process on the training set; and 2) a higher-level training in which
the meta-teacher's teaching performance is optimized by minimizing the
detector's validation loss. Our meta-teacher differs significantly from
existing teacher-student models because the meta-teacher is explicitly trained
for better teaching the detector (student), whereas existing teachers are
trained for outstanding accuracy neglecting teaching ability. Extensive
experiments on five FAS benchmarks show that with the proposed MT-FAS, the
trained meta-teacher 1) provides better-suited supervision than both
handcrafted labels and existing teacher-student models; and 2) significantly
improves the performances of PA detectors.

we have yet to establish a picture of the precise status of anomaly information

gaps, focusing on the domain of syntactic anomalies. First, we explore
fine-grained differences in anomaly encoding by designing probing tasks that
vary the hierarchical level at which anomalies occur in a sentence. Second, we
test not only models' ability to detect a given anomaly, but also the
generality of the detected anomaly signal, by examining transfer between
distinct anomaly types. Results suggest that all models encode some information
supporting anomaly detection, but detection performance varies between
anomalies, and only representations from more recent transformer models show
signs of generalized knowledge of anomalies. Follow-up analyses support the
notion that these models pick up on a legitimate, general notion of sentence
oddity, while coarser-grained word position information is likely also a
contributor to the observed anomaly detection.

over time, each with a message to send. In each synchronous slot, each node can
send or remain idle. If in a slot one node sends alone, it succeeds; otherwise,
if multiple nodes send simultaneously, messages collide and none succeeds.
Nodes can differentiate collision and silence only if collision detection is
available. Ideally, a contention resolution algorithm should satisfy three
criteria: low time complexity (or high throughput); low energy complexity,
meaning each node does not make too many broadcast attempts; strong robustness,
meaning the algorithm can maintain good performance even if slots can be
jammed. Previous work has shown, with collision detection, there are ""perfect""
contention resolution algorithms satisfying all three criteria. On the other
hand, without collision detection, it was not until 2020 that an algorithm was
discovered which can achieve optimal time complexity and low energy cost,
assuming there is no jamming. More recently, the trade-off between throughput
and robustness was studied. However, an intriguing and important question
remains unknown: without collision detection, are there robust algorithms
achieving both low total time complexity and low per-node energy cost? In this
paper, we answer the above question affirmatively. Specifically, we develop a
new randomized algorithm for robust contention resolution without collision
detection. Lower bounds show that it has both optimal time and energy
complexity. If all nodes start execution simultaneously, we design another
algorithm that is even faster, with similar energy complexity as the first
algorithm. The separation on time complexity suggests for robust contention
resolution without collision detection, ``batch'' instances (nodes start
simultaneously) are inherently easier than ``scattered'' ones (nodes arrive
over time).

tribological loading. This in turn results in changing tribological properties,
so understanding deformation under tribological load is mandatory when
designing tribological systems. Single-trace experiments were conducted to
understand the initiation of deformation mechanisms acting in various
tribological systems. The main scope of this work was to investigate the
influence of normal and friction forces as well as crystal orientations on the
dominating deformation mechanism in a face-centred cubic concentrated solid
solution. While varying the normal force is easily realised, varying friction
forces were achieved by using several counter body materials paired against
CoCrFeMnNi. The subsurface deformation layer was either mediated through
dislocation slip or twinning, depending on the grain orientation and on the
tribological system. A layer dominated by dislocation-based deformation is
characterised by lattice rotation, the formation of a dislocation trace line or
subgrain formation. Such behaviour is observed for tribological systems with a
low friction coefficient. For systems dominated by deformation twinning, three
types of twin appearance were observed: small twins interacting with the
surface, large twins and grains with two active twin systems. Two different
twinning mechanisms are discussed as responsible for these characteristics.

and stationary dynamics of a minority game that is played by agents performing
market arbitrage. On the level of linear response the method allows to include
the reaction of the market to individual actions of the agents as well as the
reaction of the agents to individual information items of the market. This way
we derive a self-consistent solution to the minority game. In particular we
analyze the impact of general nonlinear price functions on the amount of
arbitrage if noise from external fluctuations is present. We identify the
conditions under which arbitrage gets reduced due to the presence of noise.
When the cavity method is extended to time dependent response of the market
price to previous actions of the agents, the individual contributions of noise
can be pursued over different time scales in the transient dynamics until a
stationary state is reached and when the stationary state is reached. The
contributions are from external fluctuations in price and information and from
noise due to the choice of strategies. The dynamics explains the time evolution
of scores of the agents' strategies: it changes from initially a random walk to
non-Markovian dynamics and bounded excursions on an intermediate time scale to
effectively random switching in the choice between strategies on long time
scales. In contrast to the Curie-Weiss level of a mean-field approach, the
market response included by the cavity method captures the realistic feature
that the agents can have a preference for a certain choice of strategies
without getting stuck to a single choice. The breakdown of the method in the
phase transition region indicates possible market mechanisms leading to
critical volatility and a possible regime shift.

of stars observed within the core program of the PLATO space mission. The
pipeline is based on the Bayesian inference and provides effective temperature,
surface gravity, metallicity, chemical abundances, and luminosity. The code in
its more general version can have a much wider range of applications. It can
also provide masses, ages, and radii of stars and can be used for stars of
stellar types not targeted by the PLATO core program, such as red giants. We
validate the code on a set of 27 benchmark stars that includes 19 FGK-type
dwarfs, 6 GK-type sub-giants, and 2 red giants. Our results suggest that
combining various observables is the optimal approach, as it allows to break
degeneracies between different parameters and yields more accurate values of
stellar parameters and more realistic uncertainties. For the PLATO core sample,
we obtain a typical uncertainty of 27 ($\rm{syst.}$) $\pm$ 37 ($\rm{stat.}$) K

x-ray breast imaging modalities: mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis,
contrast enhanced digital mammography and breast-CT. Moreover, to implement and
validate a phase space file generation routine. Methods: The MC-GPU code (v.
1.5 DBT) was modified in order to generate phase space files and to be
compatible with PENELOPE v. 2018 derived cross section database. Simulations
were performed with homogeneous and anthropomorphic breast phantoms for
different breast imaging techniques. The glandular dose was computed for each
case and compared with results from the PENELOPE (v. 2014) + penEasy (v. 2015)
and egs brachy (EGSnrc) Monte Carlo codes. Afterwards, several phase space
files were generated with MC-GPU and the scored photon spectra were compared
between the codes. Results: MC-GPU showed good agreement with the other codes
when calculating the glandular dose distribution for mammography, mean
glandular dose for digital breast tomosynthesis, and normalized glandular dose
for breast-CT. The latter case showed average/maximum relative differences of
2.3%/27%, respectively, compared to other literature works, with the larger
differences observed at low energies (around 10 keV). The recorded photon
spectra entering a voxel were similar (within statistical uncertainties)
between the three Monte Carlo codes. Conclusions: The results indicate that
MC-GPU code is suitable for breast dosimetric studies for different x-ray
breast imaging modalities, with the advantage of a high performance. The phase
space file implementation was validated and is compatible with the IAEA
standard, allowing multiscale Monte Carlo simulations with a combination of CPU

that the small planetary bodies that accreted within the initial 2-3 million

left unconsolidated, e.g., as a rubble pile. The former set of bodies could
have formed by direct aggregation of nebula dust. Whereas, the majority of the
rubble pile type small planetary bodies accreted latter by the assemblage of
the fragmented debris of the initially existing planetesimals. These bodies
cooled over tens of million years. Generations of small planetesimals formed
over time in the early solar system evolved from an ensemble of compact

interstellar matter in galaxies. 3D reconstructions of dust extinction and
density in the Milky Way have suffered from artefacts such as the
fingers-of-god effect and negative densities, and have been limited by large
computational costs. Here we aim to overcome these issues with a novel
algorithm that derives the 3D extinction density of dust in the Milky Way using
a latent variable Gaussian Process and variational inference. Our model
maintains non-negative density and hence monotonically non-decreasing
extinction along all lines-of-sight, and performs inference within a reasonable
computational time. Using extinctions for hundreds of thousands of stars
computed from optical and near-IR photometry, together with distances based on
Gaia parallaxes, we use our algorithm to infer the structure of the Orion,
Taurus, Perseus, and Cygnus X star-forming regions. A number of features
superimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly deblended in 3D dust extinction
density maps. We find a large filament on the edge of Orion, identify filament
that in the Taurus and Perseus regions, and show that Cygnus X is located at
1300-1500pc. We compute dust masses of the regions and find these to be
slightly higher than previous estimates, likely a consequence of our input data
recovering the highest column densities more effectively. Comparing our
predicted extinctions to Planck data, we find that known relationships between
density and dust processing, where high extinction lines of sight have the most
processed grains, hold up in resolved observations when density is included,
and that they exist at smaller scales than previously suggested. This can be
used to study the changes in size or composition of dust as they are processed
in molecular clouds. (Abridged)

to their significant applications in quasi-synchronous code division multiple
access (QS-CDMA) systems and other wireless communication domains. However, the
lengths of most existing ZCZ sequences are limited, and their parameters are
not flexible, which are leading to practical limitations in their use in
QS-CDMA and other communication systems. The current study proposes a direct
construction of ZCZ sequences of prime-power length with flexible parameters by
using multivariable functions. In the proposed construction, we first present a
multivariable function to generate a vector with specific properties; this is
further used to generate another class of multivariable functions to generate
the desired $(p^t,(p-1)p^n,p^{n+t+1})$-ZCZ sequence set, where $p$ is a prime
number, $t,n$ are positive integers, and $t\leq n$. The constructed ZCZ
sequence set is optimal for the binary case and asymptotically optimal for the
non-binary case by the \emph{Tang-Fan-Matsufuji} bound. Moreover, a relation
between the second-order cosets of first-order generalized Reed-Muller code and
the proposed ZCZ sequences is also established. The proposed construction of
ZCZ sequences is compared with existing constructions, and it is observed that
the parameters of this ZCZ sequence set are a generalization of that of in some
existing works. Finally, the performance of the proposed ZCZ-based QS-CDMA
system is compared with the Walsh-Hadamard and Gold code-based QS-CDMA system.

photometric measurements to TESS images and produces transit timings by fitting
the light curves. We refine and update the previous ephemeris, based on these

10$ years). Our refined ephemeris gives the transit timing at a median
precision of 0.82 minutes until 2025 and 1.21 minutes until 2030. We regard the
timing offsets mainly originating from the underestimated ephemeris
uncertainty. All the targets with timing offset larger than 10$\sigma$ present
earlier timings than the prediction, which cannot be due to underestimated

sensor attacks on feedback systems. The defender periodically and randomly
switches between thresholds from a discrete set to increase the uncertainty for
the attacker and make stealthy attacks detectable. However, the defender does
not know the exact goal of the attacker but only the prior of the possible
attacker goals. Here, we model one period with a constant threshold as a
Bayesian game and use the Bayesian Nash equilibrium concept to find the
distribution for the choice of the threshold in that period, which takes the
defender's uncertainty about the attacker into account. To obtain the
equilibrium distribution, the defender minimizes its cost consisting of the
cost for false alarms and the cost induced by the attack. We present a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a moving target defense

Furthermore, we present a closed-form solution for the special case when the
defender knows the attacker's goals. The results are numerically evaluated on a

opportunities for our understanding of the co-evolution between super-massive
black holes and their host galaxies. Here we present a detailed study of
ionized gas in the central kiloparsec region of M81, which hosts the closest
prototype low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, based on optical
integral-field spectroscopic observations taken with the CAHA 3.5m telescope.
It is found that much of the circumnuclear ionized gas is concentraed within a
bright core of $\sim$200 pc in extent and a surrounding spiral-like structure
known as the nuclear spiral. The total mass of the ionized gas is estimated to
be $\sim2\times10^5\rm~M_\odot$, which corresponds to a few percent of the cold
gas mass in this region, as traced by co-spatial dust extinction features.
Plausible signature of a bi-conical outflow along the disk plane is suggested
by a pair of blueshifted/redshifted low-velocity features, symmetrically
located at $\sim$ 120 -- 250 pc from the nucleus. The spatially-resolved line
ratios of [N\,{\sc ii}]/H$\alpha$ and [O\,{\sc iii}]/H$\beta$ demonstrate that
much of the circumnuclear region can be classified as LINER (low-ionization
nuclear emission-line region). However, substantial spatial variations in the
line intensities and line ratios strongly suggest that different
ionization/excitation mechanisms, rather than just a central dominant source of
photoionization, are simultaneously at work to produce the observed line
signatures.

obtained from the two-loop effective potential of order parameter W_L(A_0^cl)

this potential is applicable at high temperatures beginning from the

also efficiently train on Bing short text datasets containing up to 62 million

successfully applied to edge applications, such as smart phones and automated
driving. Nowadays, more applications require ML on tiny devices with extremely
limited resources, like implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which is
known as TinyML. Unlike ML on the edge, TinyML with a limited energy supply has
higher demands on low-power execution. Stochastic computing (SC) using
bitstreams for data representation is promising for TinyML since it can perform
the fundamental ML operations using simple logical gates, instead of the
complicated binary adder and multiplier. However, SC commonly suffers from low
accuracy for ML tasks due to low data precision and inaccuracy of arithmetic
units. Increasing the length of the bitstream in the existing works can
mitigate the precision issue but incur higher latency. In this work, we propose
a novel SC architecture, namely Block-based Stochastic Computing (BSC). BSC
divides inputs into blocks, such that the latency can be reduced by exploiting
high data parallelism. Moreover, optimized arithmetic units and output revision
(OUR) scheme are proposed to improve accuracy. On top of it, a global
optimization approach is devised to determine the number of blocks, which can
make a better latency-power trade-off. Experimental results show that BSC can
outperform the existing designs in achieving over 10% higher accuracy on ML
tasks and over 6 times power reduction.

model that explicitly accounts for both demographic and mobility differences

prioritized for the most disadvantaged communities, which holds even when such
communities manifest considerable vaccine reluctance. Nevertheless, equity
among distinct demographic features are in tension due to their complex
correlation in society. We design two behavior-and-demography-aware indices,
community risk and societal harm, which capture the risks communities face and
those they impose on society from not being vaccinated, to inform the design of
comprehensive vaccine distribution strategies. Our study provides a framework
for uniting utility and equity-based considerations in vaccine distribution,
and sheds light on how to balance multiple ethical values in complex settings
for epidemic control.

multiple simultaneously studied close encounters with multiple test asteroids.
In order to validate our algorithm and data treatment, we apply the MCMC
algorithm to pure orbit determination for the main-belt asteroid (367) Amicitia

to estimate a mass for (445) Edna with Gaia astrometry alone based on its close

  In the case of the orbit of (367) Amicitia, we find a solution that improves
on the previously published solution. The study of (445) Edna reveals that mass
estimation with DR2 astrometry alone is unfeasible and that it must be combined

a combination of DR2 and Earth-based astrometry results in dramatically reduced

Siepmann and Sprik and reformulated later by Reed (SR-CPM) has been widely
employed to investigate the metallic electrolyte/electrode interfaces,
especially for conducting nanochannels with complex connectivity, *e.g.*,
carbide-derived carbon or graphene-assembled membrane. This work makes
substantial extensions of this seminal SR-CPM approach. First, we introduce two
numerical techniques to determine electrode atom charges with an order of
magnitude improvement in computational efficiency compared with those widely
employed methods. The first numerical technique dramatically accelerates the to
calculation of the Ewald interaction matrix $\mathbf{E}$, which takes advantage
of the existing highly optimised electrostatic codes. The second technique
introduces a new preconditioning technique in the conjugate gradient method to
considerably increase the computational efficiency of a linear equation system
that determines electrode atomic charges. Our improved SR-CPM implemented in
the LAMMPS package can handle extra-large systems, *e.g.*, over 8.1 million
electrode atoms. Second, after demonstrating the importance of the
electroneutrality constraint, we propose a two-step method to enforce
electroneutrality in the following post-treatment step, applicable for matrix
and iterative techniques. Third, we propose a solid theoretical analysis for
the adjustable parameter $\alpha_i$ (namely the atomic Hubbard-U $U_i^0$),
which is arbitrarily selected in many SR-CPM simulation practices. We proposed
that the optimised $\alpha_i$ or $U_i^0$ should compensate for the electrical
potential/energy discrepancy between the discrete atomistic model and the
continuum limit. The analytical and optimal ${\alpha}_i^0$ values are derived
for a series of 2D materials.

Models (GCMs) can be validated using water isotopes as tracers. Many GCMs now
simulate the movement of the stable isotopes of water, but here we present the
first GCM simulations modelling the content of natural tritium in water. These
simulations were obtained using a version of the LMDZ General Circulation Model
enhanced by water isotopes diagnostics, LMDZ-iso. To avoid tritium generated by
nuclear bomb testing, the simulations have been evaluated against a compilation
of published tritium datasets dating from before 1950, or measured recently.
LMDZ-iso correctly captures the observed tritium enrichment in precipitation as
oceanic air moves inland (the so-called continental effect) and the observed
north-south variations due to the latitudinal dependency of the cosmogenic
tritium production rate. The seasonal variability, linked to the stratospheric
intrusions of air masses with higher tritium content into the troposphere, is
correctly reproduced for Antarctica with a maximum in winter. LMDZ-iso
reproduces the spring maximum of tritium over Europe, but underestimates it and
produces a peak in winter that is not apparent in the data. This implementation
of tritium in a GCM promises to provide a better constraint on: (1) the
intrusions and transport of air masses from the stratosphere and (2) the
dynamics of the modelled water cycle. The method complements the existing
approach of using stable water isotopes.

remain trustworthy by testing for unwanted responsibility voids in advance. We
follow recent proposals to use probabilities as the basis for responsibility
ascription in uncertain environments rather than the deterministic causal views

cluster may be stable independent of the stability of the other clusters, which
results in possibly different ranges in which each cluster synchronizes

different cases: Matryoshka Cluster Synchronization (when the range of the

extremely large pre-trained language models (PLMs), which can achieve
comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning by only tuning a few soft
prompts. However, PT requires much more training time than fine-tuning.
Intuitively, knowledge transfer can help to improve the efficiency. To explore
whether we can improve PT via prompt transfer, we empirically investigate the
transferability of soft prompts across different downstream tasks and PLMs in
this work. We find that (1) in zero-shot setting, trained soft prompts can
effectively transfer to similar tasks on the same PLM and also to other PLMs
with a cross-model projector trained on similar tasks; (2) when used as
initialization, trained soft prompts of similar tasks and projected prompts of
other PLMs can significantly accelerate training and also improve the
performance of PT. Moreover, to explore what decides prompt transferability, we
investigate various transferability indicators and find that the overlapping
rate of activated neurons strongly reflects the transferability, which suggests
how the prompts stimulate PLMs is essential. Our findings show that prompt
transfer is promising for improving PT, and further research shall focus more
on prompts' stimulation to PLMs. The source code can be obtained from

these biases are partly consequences of a too diffusive advection. Exploiting
the LMDZ-iso model, we show that a less diffusive representation of the
advection, especially on the horizontal, is very important to reduce the bias
in the isotopic contents of precipitation above this area. The choice of an
appropriate representation of the advection is thus essential when using GCMs
for paleoclimate applications based on polar water isotopes. Too much diffusive
mixing along the poleward transport leads to overestimated isotopic contents in
water vapor because dehydration by mixing follows a more enriched path than
dehydration by Rayleigh distillation. The near-air surface temperature is also
influenced, to a lesser extent, by the diffusive properties of the advection
scheme directly via the advection of the air and indirectly via the radiative
effects of changes in high cloud fraction and water vapor. A too diffusive
horizontal advection increases the temperature and so also contributes to
enrich the isotopic contents of water vapor over Antarctica through a reduction
of the distillation. The temporal relationship, from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
to present-day conditions, between the mean annual near-air surface temperature
and the water isotopic contents of precipitation for a specific location can
also be impacted, with significant consequences on the paleo-temperature
reconstruction from observed changes in water isotopes.

represents the singular flow due to a point force. Its classical value in an
unbounded fluid has been extended near surfaces of various shapes, including
flat walls and spheres, and in most cases the presence of a surface leads to an
advection flow induced at the location of the point force. In this paper,
motivated by the biological transport of cargo along polymeric filaments inside
eukaryotic cells, we investigate the reaction flow at the location of the point
force due to a rigid slender filament located at a separation distance
intermediate between the filament radius and its length (i.e. we compute the
advection of the point force induced by the presence of the filament). An
asymptotic analysis of the problem reveals that the leading-order approximation
for the force distribution along the axis of the filament takes a form
analogous to resistive-force theory but with drag coefficients that depend
logarithmically on the distance between the point force and the filament. A
comparison of our theoretical prediction with boundary element computations
show good agreement. We finally briefly extend the model to the case of curved
filaments.

method to solve both 2D and 3D packing problems. We first embed states by a
recurrent encoder, and then adopt attention with conditional queries from
previous actions. The conditional query mechanism fills the information gap
between learning steps, which shapes the problem as a Markov decision process.
Benefiting from the recurrence, a single RCQL model is capable of handling
different sizes of packing problems. Experiment results show that RCQL can
effectively learn strong heuristics for offline and online strip packing
problems (SPPs), outperforming a wide range of baselines in space utilization
ratio. RCQL reduces the average bin gap ratio by 1.83% in offline 2D 40-box

our method also achieves 5.64% higher space utilization ratio for SPPs with

equivalent to probabilistic cellular automata, namely cellular automata with a

models on a square lattice and therefore as classical statistical systems. As
quantum field theories they are quantum systems. Thus quantum mechanics emerges
from classical statistics. As an explicit example for an interacting fermionic
quantum field theory we describe a type of discretized Thirring model as a

evolution operator that can be expressed in terms of fermionic annihilation and
creation operators. The complex structure of quantum mechanics is associated to
particle -- hole transformations. The naive continuum limit exhibits Lorentz

goal in integrated photonics. We show that by coupling molecular vibrations

statistics of the cavity field can be reversibly manipulated over
sub-picosecond timescales. The mechanism involves changing the cavity resonance
frequency through a modulation of the dielectric response of the cavity
materials using femtosecond UV pulses. For a single anharmonic molecular
vibration in an infrared cavity under ultrastrong coupling conditions, the
pulsed modulation of the cavity frequency can adiabatically produce
mid-infrared light that is simultaneously sub-Poissonian and quadrature
squeezed, depending on the dipolar behavior of the vibrational mode. For a
vibration-cavity system in strong coupling, non-adiabatic polariton excitations
can be produced after the frequency modulation pulse is over, when the system
is initially prepared in the lower polariton state. We propose design
principles for the generation of mid-infrared quantum light by analyzing the
dependence of the cavity field statistics on the shape of the electric dipole
function of the molecule, the cavity detuning at the modulation peak and the
anharmonicity of the Morse potential. Feasible experimental implementations of
the modulation scheme are suggested. This work paves the way for the

architecture design, resulting in better performance on various prediction
tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine node feature aggregation
and feature transformation using learnable weight matrix in the same layer.
This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of node features aggregated
from various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As
different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in
features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which
features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information.
In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph
neural network, and empirically analyze how different aggregated features play
a role in prediction performance. We show that not all features generated via
aggregation steps are useful, and often using these less informative features
can be detrimental to the performance of the GNN model. Through our
experiments, we show that learning certain subsets of these features can lead
to better performance on wide variety of datasets. We propose to use softmax as

different hop distances; and L2-Normalization over GNN layers. Combining these
techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph

just the difference between the saddle point free energy and that at its

methods for optimal control of complementarity Lagrangian systems (CLS) with
state jumps. We cover the difficult case when after the state jump the system
evolves on the boundary of the dynamic's feasible set. In nonsmooth mechanics,
this corresponds to inelastic impacts. The main idea of the time-freezing
reformulation is to introduce a clock state and an auxiliary dynamical system
whose trajectory endpoints satisfy the state jump law. When the auxiliary
system is active, the clock state is not evolving, hence by taking only the
parts of the trajectory when the clock state was active, we can recover the
original solution. The resulting time-freezing system is a Filippov system that
has jump discontinuities only in the first time derivative instead of the
trajectory itself. This enables one to use the recently proposed Finite
Elements with Switch Detection [Nurkanovic et al., 2022], which makes high
accuracy numerical optimal control of CLS with impacts and friction possible.
We detail how to recover the solution of the original system and show how to
select appropriate auxiliary dynamics. The theoretical findings are illustrated
on the nontrivial numerical optimal control example of a hopping one-legged
robot.

proposes an approach for enabling high-precision radial velocity measurements

of the radial velocity measurements is determined by combining the
spectrophotometric accuracy and the quality of the absorption lines in the
recorded spectrum. Therefore, a highly dispersive densified pupil spectrograph
proposed to perform stable spectroscopy can be utilized for high-precision
radial velocity measures. A concept involving the telescope line-of-sight
monitor is developed to minimize the change of the telescope line-of-sight over

drift without any significant impact on the Airy disk when the densified pupil
spectra are recorded. We analytically derive the uncertainty of the radial
velocity measurements, which is caused by the residual offset of the
line-of-sights at two epochs. We find that the error could be reduced down to
approximately 1 $cm/s$, and the precision will be limited by another factor
(e.g., wavelength calibration uncertainty). A combination of the high precision
spectrophotometry and the high spectral resolving power could open a new path

are sought which not only minimize a given function, but also possess a certain
degree of regularity. Popular applications are image denoising, sparse
regression and machine learning. Since the choice of the regularization
parameter is crucial but often difficult, path-following methods are used to
approximate the entire regularization path, i.e., the set of all possible
solutions for all regularization parameters. Due to their nature, the
development of these methods requires structural results about the
regularization path. The goal of this article is to derive these results for
the case of a smooth objective function which is penalized by a piecewise
differentiable regularization term. We do this by treating regularization as a
multiobjective optimization problem. Our results suggest that even in this
general case, the regularization path is piecewise smooth. Moreover, our theory
allows for a classification of the nonsmooth features that occur in between
smooth parts. This is demonstrated in two applications, namely support-vector

made in the literature towards the applicability of such algorithms for

regularity conditions (in particular, involving only weak continuity of the

quantization of states and actions converge to a limit, and furthermore this
limit satisfies an optimality equation which leads to near optimality with
either explicit performance bounds or which are guaranteed to be asymptotically
optimal. Our approach builds on (i) viewing quantization as a measurement
kernel and thus a quantized MDP as a POMDP, (ii) utilizing near optimality and
convergence results of Q-learning for POMDPs, and (iii) finally,
near-optimality of finite state model approximations for MDPs with weakly

complicated tasks, from image recognition and object detection to speech

the Lyapunov time. This study shows that, remarkably, ESNs can successfully
predict dynamical behavior that is qualitatively different from any behavior
contained in the training set. Evidence is provided for a fluid dynamics
problem where the flow can transition between laminar (ordered) and turbulent
(disordered) regimes. Despite being trained on the turbulent regime only, ESNs
are found to predict laminar behavior. Moreover, the statistics of
turbulent-to-laminar and laminar-to-turbulent transitions are also predicted
successfully, and the utility of ESNs in acting as an early-warning system for
transition is discussed. These results are expected to be widely applicable to
data-driven modelling of temporal behaviour in a range of physical, climate,
biological, ecological and finance models characterized by the presence of
tipping points and sudden transitions between several competing states.

duration gamma-ray bursts. However, the observational test of this model is
problematic. Spectral lines of Wolf-Rayet stars originate in expanding stellar
wind, therefore a reliable spectroscopical determination of their rotational
velocities is difficult. Intrinsic polarization of Wolf-Rayet stars due to the
rotational modulation of the stellar wind may provide an indirect way to
determine the rotational velocities of these stars. However, detailed wind
models are required for this purpose. We determine the intrinsic polarization
of Wolf-Rayet stars from hydrodynamical wind models as a function of rotational
velocity. We used 2.5D hydrodynamical simulations to calculate the structure of
rotating winds of Wolf-Rayet stars. The simulations account for the deformation
of the stellar surface due to rotation, gravity darkening, and nonradial
forces. From the derived models, we calculated the intrinsic stellar
polarization. The mass loss rate was scaled to take realistic wind densities of
Wolf-Rayet stars into account. The hydrodynamical wind models predict a prolate
wind structure, which leads to a relatively low level of polarization. Even
relatively large rotational velocities are allowed by observational constrains.
The obtained wind structure is similiar to that obtained previously for
rotating optically thin winds. Derived upper limits of rotational velocities of
studied Wolf-Rayet stars are not in conflict with the model of long duration
gamma-ray bursts

screening. Although the benefits of using digital mammography for cancer
screening outweigh the risks associated with the x-ray exposure, the radiation
dose must be kept as low as possible while maintaining the diagnostic utility
of the generated images, thus minimizing patient risks. Many studies
investigated the feasibility of dose reduction by restoring low-dose images
using deep neural networks. In these cases, choosing the appropriate training
database and loss function is crucial and impacts the quality of the results.
In this work, a modification of the ResNet architecture, with hierarchical skip
connections, is proposed to restore low-dose digital mammography. We compared
the restored images to the standard full-dose images. Moreover, we evaluated
the performance of several loss functions for this task. For training purposes,
we extracted 256,000 image patches from a dataset of 400 images of
retrospective clinical mammography exams, where different dose levels were
simulated to generate low and standard-dose pairs. To validate the network in a
real scenario, a physical anthropomorphic breast phantom was used to acquire
real low-dose and standard full-dose images in a commercially avaliable
mammography system, which were then processed through our trained model. An
analytical restoration model for low-dose digital mammography, previously
presented, was used as a benchmark in this work. Objective assessment was
performed through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean normalized squared
error (MNSE), decomposed into residual noise and bias. Results showed that the
perceptual loss function (PL4) is able to achieve virtually the same noise
levels of a full-dose acquisition, while resulting in smaller signal bias

through coherent communications. Driven by the rapid pace of growth in
interconnectivity over the last decade, long-haul data transmission has reached
capacities on the order of tens to hundreds of terabits per second, over fiber
reaches which may span thousands of kilometers. Data center communications
however operate in a different regime, featuring shorter reaches and
characterized as being more cost and power sensitive. While integrated
microresonator frequency combs are poised to revolutionize light sources used
for high-speed data transmission over fiber, their use has been limited to
coherent detection schemes. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of
microresonator frequency combs pumped with a single laser for the transmission
of high-speed data, importantly using direct detection schemes. We achieve 120
Gb/s and 240 Gb/s aggregate data transmission for 30 Gb/s non-return-to-zero

respectively over 2 km of optical fiber, exceeding the reach, single lane data
rate, and aggregate data rates specified in Parallel Single Mode 4 (PSM4) and
Course Wavelength Division Multiplex 4 (CWDM4) multi-source agreements.
Remarkably, we achieve an extremely low power penalty of 0.1 dB compared to
back-to-back characterization. The results firmly cement CMOS-compatible
micro-resonator frequency combs based high-speed data transmission as a viable
technology for the cost and power sensitive data center transceiver industry.

it can provide valuable information about the mass and the nature of the
neutrino. The double beta decay (DBD) itself is also of interest in nuclear
physics. While DBD has been observed in about a dozen nuclei, the positron
double beta decay ($\beta^{+}\beta^{+}$/EC-$\beta^{+}$) continues to be an
elusive. An important signature for $\beta^{+}\beta^{+}$ decay is the
simultaneous emission of four 511 keV gamma rays and the coincident detection
of these gamma rays can improve the measurement sensitivity. This paper
presents an estimation of sensitivity for EC-$\beta^{+}$ and
$\beta^{+}\beta^{+}$ employing coincidence measurement with two high purity Ge
(HPGe) detectors. Simulations for coincident detection efficiency
(${\epsilon}_c$) of 511 keV gamma rays with two HPGe detectors have been
carried out using GEANT4 for different source geometries to optimize the mass
efficiency product (M${\epsilon}_c$). The source of size $55\,mm \times 55\,mm
\times 5\,mm$ (thickness) sandwiched between the front faces of the detectors
were found to be optimal for 2 pairs of 511 keV gamma rays in the present
detector setup. The coincident background is estimated at the sea level with
moderate Pb shielding. With this setup, the sensitivity for T$_{1/2}$
measurement of EC-$\beta^{+}$ in $^{112}$Sn and $\beta^{+}\beta^{+}$ in
$^{106}$Cd is estimated to be $\sim$10$^{19}$ - 10$^{20}$ y for 1y of

is an interesting topic. The primordial black hole is a type of black hole
formed in the early universe, especially during the thermal radiation period of
the early universe. Driven by gravity, thermal radiation will collapse to form
a black hole. Because of the complexity of the actual situation, we use the
simplest model for simulation under the premise of only considering the
thermodynamic properties of the system: in the classic case, an isolated box
full of thermal radiation, by adjusting the initial temperature within a
reasonable range, the results show that the collapse of part of the thermal
radiation to form a black hole and finally achieve thermal equilibrium is an
inevitable result of the second law of thermodynamics. We then introduced the
quantization of black holes and the number of microscopic states of thermal
radiation into the thermal equilibrium system and came to a surprising
conclusion: if both the quantization of black holes and the number of
microscopic states of thermal radiation are considered at the same time, the
fluctuation of thermodynamics is inevitable. When only one of them is
considered, the law of conservation of energy and the second law of
thermodynamics can be satisfied at the same time, and the fluctuation of
thermodynamics can be avoided. This provides a new way of thinking for us to
understand the microscopic origin of thermodynamic fluctuations.

Identifiable Information (PII) on social media. Such exposed PII can cause
severe losses to the users, and informing users of their PII exposure is
crucial to raise their privacy awareness and encourage them to take protective
measures. To this end, advanced automatic techniques are needed. While
Information Extraction (IE) techniques can be used to extract the PII
automatically, Deep Learning (DL)-based IE models alleviate the need for
feature engineering and further improve the efficiency. However, DL-based IE
models often require large-scale labeled data for training, but PII-labeled
social media posts are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. Also, these
models rely heavily on pre-trained word embeddings, while PII in social media
often varies in forms and thus has no fixed representations in pre-trained word
embeddings. In this study, we propose the Deep Transfer Learning for PII
Extraction (DTL-PIIE) framework to address these two limitations. DTL-PIIE
transfers knowledge learned from publicly available PII data to social media to
address the problem of rare PII-labeled data. Moreover, our framework leverages
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to incorporate syntactic patterns to guide
PIIE without relying on pre-trained word embeddings. Evaluation against
benchmark IE models indicates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
DL-based IE models. Our framework can facilitate various applications, such as
PII misuse prediction and privacy risk assessment, protecting the privacy of

understand how the model makes the decision and verify that the model is

(interpretable) classification model to predict the seismic failure mode of
conventional reinforced concrete shear (structural) walls. Reported
experimental damage information of 176 conventional shear walls tested under
reverse cyclic loading were designated as class-types, whereas key design
properties (e.g. compressive strength of concrete, axial load ratio, and web
reinforcement ratio) of shear walls were used as the basic classification
features. The trade-off between model complexity and model interpretability was
discussed using eight Machine Learning (ML) methods. The results showed that
the Decision Tree method was a more convenient classifier with higher
interpretability with a high classification accuracy than its counterparts.
Also, to enhance the practicality of the model, a feature reduction was
conducted to reduce the complexity of the proposed classifier with higher
classification performance, and the most relevant features were identified,
namely: compressive strength of concrete, wall aspect ratio, transverse
boundary, and web reinforcement ratio. The ability of the final DT model to
predict the failure modes was validated with a classification rate of around
90%. The proposed model aims to provide engineers interpretable, robust, and

distinct and even inverse influences of some factors in different water areas

locations are negative, which are ignored by MLR. The outcomes provide insights
