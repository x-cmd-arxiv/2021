training signals for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While filtering such
pairs out is known to improve final model quality, we argue that it is
suboptimal in low-resource conditions where even mined data can be limited. In
our work, we propose instead, to refine the mined bitexts via automatic
editing: given a sentence in a language xf, and a possibly imperfect
translation of it xe, our model generates a revised version xf' or xe' that
yields a more equivalent translation pair (i.e., <xf, xe'> or <xf', xe>). We
use a simple editing strategy by (1) mining potentially imperfect translations
for each sentence in a given bitext, (2) learning a model to reconstruct the
original translations and translate, in a multi-task fashion. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach successfully improves the quality of CCMatrix
mined bitext for 5 low-resource language-pairs and 10 translation directions by
up to ~ 8 BLEU points, in most cases improving upon a competitive
back-translation baseline.

throughout all processing steps of GeSn devices is essential to avoid possible
material degradation. This constraint is exacerbated by the need for higher Sn
contents along with an enhanced strain relaxation to achieve efficient
mid-infrared devices. Herein, as a low thermal budget solution for post-epitaxy
processing, we elucidate the effects of laser thermal annealing (LTA) on
strain-relaxed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn0$_{.11}$ layers and Ni-Ge$_{0.89}$Sn0$_{.11}$
contacts. Key diffusion and recrystallization processes are proposed and
discussed in the light of systematic microstructural studies. LTA treatment at
a fluence of 0.40 J/cm2 results in a 200-300 nm-thick layer where Sn atoms
segregate toward the surface and in the formation of Sn-rich columnar
structures in the LTA-affected region. These structures are reminiscent to
those observed in the dislocation-assisted pipe-diffusion mechanism, while the
buried GeSn layers remain intact. Moreover, by tailoring the LTA fluence, the
contact resistance can be reduced without triggering phase separation across
the whole GeSn multi-layer stacking. Indeed, a one order of magnitude decrease
in the Ni-based specific contact resistance was obtained at the highest LTA
fluence, thus confirming the potential of this method for the functionalization
of direct bandgap GeSn materials.

convergent while they suffer from slow local convergence, especially when
moderate or high accuracy is needed. To alleviate this problem, we propose an
optimization algorithm -- which we refer to as a hybrid acceleration scheme --
for a class of proximal variance reduced stochastic optimization algorithms.
The proposed optimization scheme combines a fast locally convergent algorithm,
such as a quasi--Newton method, with a globally convergent variance reduced
stochastic algorithm, for instance SAGA or L--SVRG. Our global convergence
result of the hybrid acceleration method is based on specific safeguard
conditions that need to be satisfied for a step of the locally fast convergent
method to be accepted.
  We prove that the sequence of the iterates generated by the hybrid
acceleration scheme converges almost surely to a solution of the underlying
optimization problem. We also provide numerical experiments that show
significantly improved convergence of the hybrid acceleration scheme compared

method for the solution of 2D scattering problems with complex backgrounds,
providing an alternative to Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) or other artificial
boundary conditions. Based on half-plane representations for the solution, the
scattering problem is rewritten as a system coupling (1) a standard finite
element discretisation localised around the scatterer and (2) integral
equations whose unknowns are traces of the solution on the boundaries of a
finite number of overlapping half-planes contained in the domain. While
satisfactory numerical results have been obtained for real wavenumbers,
well-posedness and equivalence of this HSM formulation to the original
scattering problem have been established only for complex wavenumbers. In the
present paper we show, in the case of a homogeneous background, that the HSM
formulation is equivalent to the original scattering problem also for real
wavenumbers, and so is well-posed, provided the traces satisfy radiation
conditions at infinity analogous to the standard Sommerfeld radiation
condition. As a key component of our argument we show that, if the trace on the
boundary of a half-plane satisfies our new radiation condition, then the
corresponding solution to the half-plane Dirichlet problem satisfies the
Sommerfeld radiation condition in a slightly smaller half-plane. We expect that
this last result will be of independent interest, in particular in studies of
rough surface scattering.

a distributional view is facilitating a modern, measured, approach to risk when
outcomes are not completely certain. By contrast, psychological and
neuroscientific investigations into decision making under risk have utilized a
variety of more venerable theoretical models such as prospect theory that lack
axiomatically desirable properties such as coherence. Here, we consider a
particularly relevant risk measure for modeling human and animal planning,
called conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which quantifies worst-case outcomes
(e.g., vehicle accidents or predation). We first adopt a conventional
distributional approach to CVaR in a sequential setting and reanalyze the
choices of human decision-makers in the well-known two-step task, revealing
substantial risk aversion that had been lurking under stickiness and
perseveration. We then consider a further critical property of risk
sensitivity, namely time consistency, showing alternatives to this form of CVaR
that enjoy this desirable characteristic. We use simulations to examine
settings in which the various forms differ in ways that have implications for

two-dimensional temporal ontology and query languages by combining logics from

queries (OMQs) that consist of a 2D ontology and a positive temporal instance
query. Our target languages for FO-rewritings are two-sorted FO(<) -
first-order logic with sorts for time instants ordered by the built-in
precedence relation < and for the domain of individuals - its extension FOE
with the standard congruence predicates t \equiv 0 mod n, for any fixed n > 1,
and FO(RPR) that admits relational primitive recursion. In terms of circuit
complexity, FOE- and FO(RPR)-rewritability guarantee answering OMQs in uniform
AC0 and NC1, respectively.
  We proceed in three steps. First, we define a hierarchy of 2D DL-Lite/LTL
ontology languages and investigate the FO-rewritability of OMQs with atomic
queries by constructing projections onto 1D LTL OMQs and employing recent
results on the FO-rewritability of propositional LTL OMQs. As the projections
involve deciding consistency of ontologies and data, we also consider the
consistency problem for our languages. While the undecidability of consistency
for 2D ontology languages with expressive Boolean role inclusions might be
expected, we also show that, rather surprisingly, the restriction to Krom and
Horn role inclusions leads to decidability (and ExpSpace-completeness), even if
one admits full Booleans on concepts. As a final step, we lift some of the
rewritability results for atomic OMQs to OMQs with expressive positive temporal
instance queries. The lifting results are based on an in-depth study of the

for the sub-component sharply increases as we consider a smaller relative
abundance fraction among the dark-matter species. Therefore, contrary to a
naive expectation, it can be easier to detect the sub-component with smaller
abundance fractions in direct/indirect-detection experiments and cosmological
observations. Combining with the current results of accelerator-based
experiments, the abundance fractions smaller than $10\,\%$ are strongly
disfavored; we demonstrate this by taking a dark photon portal scenario as an

to the parameter space probed by accelerator-based experiments.

flat torus $\mathbf{T}_\Gamma:=\mathbf{R}^d/\Gamma$ are flexible enough to
approximate, over the natural length scale of order $1/\sqrt\lambda$, where
$\lambda\gg1$ is the eigenvalue, an arbitary solution of the Helmholtz equation
$\Delta h + h=0$ on $\mathbf{R}^d$. This problem is motivated by the fact that,
by the asymptotics for the local Weyl law, ""approximate Laplace eigenfunctions""
do have this approximation property on any compact Riemannian manifold. What we
find is that the answer depends solely on the arithmetic properties of the
spectrum. Specifically, recall that the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{T}_\Gamma$ are
of the form $\lambda_k=Q_\Gamma(k)$, where $Q_\Gamma$ is a quadratic form and
$k \in \mathbf{Z}^d$. Our main result is that the eigenfunctions of
$\mathbf{T}_\Gamma$ have the desired approximation property if and only
$Q_\Gamma$ is a multiple of a quadratic form with integer coefficients. In
particular, the set of lattices $\Gamma$ for which this approximation property
holds has measure zero but includes all rational lattices. A consequence of
this fact is that when $Q_\Gamma$ is a multiple of a quadratic form with
integer coefficients, Laplace eigenfunctions exhibit an extremely flexible
behavior over scales of order $1/\sqrt\lambda$. In particular, there are
eigenfunctions of arbitrarily high energy that exhibit nodal components
diffeomorphic to any compact hypersurface of diameter $O(1/\sqrt\lambda)$.

computing a near maximum cut or a near minimum bisection in polynomial time.
For graphs of girth $2L$, we develop a local message passing algorithm whose
complexity is $O(nkL)$, and that achieves near optimal cut values among all
$L$-local algorithms. Focusing on max-cut, the algorithm constructs a cut of
value $nk/4+ n\mathsf{P}_\star\sqrt{k/4}+\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)$, where
$\mathsf{P}_\star\approx 0.763166$ is the value of the Parisi formula from spin
glass theory, and $\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)=o_n(n)+no_k(\sqrt{k})+n \sqrt{k} o_L(1)$
(subscripts indicate the asymptotic variables). Our result generalizes to
locally treelike graphs, i.e., graphs whose girth becomes $2L$ after removing a
small fraction of vertices.
  Earlier work established that, for random $k$-regular graphs, the typical
max-cut value is $nk/4+ n\mathsf{P}_\star\sqrt{k/4}+o_n(n)+no_k(\sqrt{k})$.
Therefore our algorithm is nearly optimal on such graphs. An immediate
corollary of this result is that random regular graphs have nearly minimum
max-cut, and nearly maximum min-bisection among all regular locally treelike
graphs. This can be viewed as a combinatorial version of the near-Ramanujan

different acculturation settings on the evolution of cooperation in spatial
public goods games with the immigration of defectors and efficient cooperators.
Here, immigrants may be socially influenced, or not, by the native culture
according to four acculturation settings: integration, where immigrants imitate
both immigrants and natives; marginalization, where immigrants do not imitate
either natives or other immigrants; assimilation, where immigrants only imitate
natives; and separation, where immigrants only imitate other immigrants. We
found that cooperation is greatly facilitated and reaches a peak for moderate
values of the migration rate under any acculturation setting. Most
interestingly, we found that the main acculturation factor driving the highest
levels of cooperation is that immigrants do not avoid social influence from
their fellow immigrants. We also show that integration may not promote the
highest level of native cooperation if the benefit of cooperation is low.

paper, finite congestion games with non-separable costs are shown to have an

Minkowski sum $\mathcal{X}= \sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}} X_C$ of non-empty closed
convex sets $X_C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{R}}_{\geq 0}$, where
$\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are finite sets. We assume that an oracle for
approximate linear minimization over $X_C$ is given. In this setting, the
currently fastest known FPTAS is due to M\""uller, Radke, and Vygen. For $\delta

using $\mathcal{O}((|\mathcal{C}|+|\mathcal{R}|)\log |\mathcal{R}| (\delta^{-2}

ratio of the oracle. We describe an extension of their algorithm and improve on
previous results in various ways. Our FPTAS, which, as previous approaches, is
based on the multiplicative weight update method, computes close to optimal
primal and dual solutions using $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{|\mathcal{C}|+
|\mathcal{R}|}{\delta^2} \log |\mathcal{R}|\right)$ oracle calls. We prove that
our running time is optimal under certain assumptions, implying that no
warm-start analysis of the algorithm is possible. A major novelty of our
analysis is the concept of local weak duality, which illustrates that the
algorithm optimizes (close to) independent parts of the instance separately.
Interestingly, this implies that the computed solution is not only
approximately $\ell_{\infty}$-minimal, but among such solutions, also its
second-highest entry is approximately minimal. We prove that this statement
cannot be extended to the third-highest entry.

are among the most popular summary statistics. Researchers use histograms to
judge the shape of quantitative data distribution by visual inspection. The
coefficient of variation is taken as an estimator of relative variability of
these data. We explore properties of histograms and coefficient of variation by
examples in R, thus offering better alternatives: density plots and
Eisenhauer's relative dispersion coefficient. Methods: Hypothetical examples
developed in R are applied to create histograms and density plots, and to
compute coefficient of variation and relative dispersion coefficient. Results:
These hypothetical examples clearly show that these two traditional approaches
are flawed. Histograms do not necessarily reflect the distribution of
probabilities and the Pearson's coefficient of variation is not invariant with
linear transformations and is not a measure of relative variability, for it is
a ratio between a measure of absolute variability (standard deviation) and a
measure of central position (mean). Potential alternatives are explained and
applied for contrast. Conclusions: With the use of modern computers and R
language it is easy to apply density plots, which are able to approximate the
theoretical probability distribution. In addition, Eisenhauer's relative
dispersion coefficient is suggested as a suitable estimator of relative
variability, including sample size correction for lower and upper bounds.

observed by transit, as they allow us to put constraints on the masses and
eccentricities of the observed planets, or even to constrain the existence of
non-transiting companions. However, TTVs can also act as a detection bias that
can prevent the detection of small planets in transit surveys that would
otherwise be detected by standard algorithms such as the Boxed Least Square
algorithm (BLS) if their orbit was not perturbed. This bias is especially
present for surveys with a long baseline, such as Kepler, some of the TESS
sectors, and the upcoming PLATO mission. Here we introduce a detection method
that is robust to large TTVs, and illustrate its use by recovering and
confirming a pair of resonant super-Earths with ten-hour TTVs around
Kepler-1705. The method is based on a neural network trained to recover the
tracks of low-signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N) perturbed planets in river diagrams.
We recover the transit parameters of these candidates by fitting the light
curve. The individual transit S/N of Kepler-1705b and c are about three times
lower than all the previously known planets with TTVs of 3 hours or more,
pushing the boundaries in the recovery of these small, dynamically active
planets. Recovering this type of object is essential for obtaining a complete
picture of the observed planetary systems, and solving for a bias not often
taken into account in statistical studies of exoplanet populations. In
addition, TTVs are a means of obtaining mass estimates which can be essential
for studying the internal structure of planets discovered by transit surveys.
Finally, we show that due to the strong orbital perturbations, it is possible
that the spin of the outer resonant planet of Kepler-1705 is trapped in a sub-

Gas, electricity,

picture as reading proof to confirm the reading by checking offline with
another operator and/or using it as evidence in case of conflicts or

errors. Automation can optimize and facilitate such labor-intensive and human
error-prone processes. With the recent advances in the fields of artificial

more viable than ever. Motivated by the recent advances in the field of
artificial intelligence and inspired by open-source open-access initiatives in
the research community, we introduce a novel large benchmark dataset of
real-life gas meter images, named the NRC-GAMMA dataset. The data were
collected from an Itron 400A diaphragm gas meter on January 20, 2020, between
00:05 am and 11:59 pm. We employed a systematic approach to label the images,
validate the labellings, and assure the quality of the annotations. The dataset
contains 28,883 images of the entire gas meter along with 57,766 cropped images

quantum phase transitions due to the interplay of disparate fluctuations,
leading to novel universality classes. While quantum critical points have been
well characterized, our understanding of QMCPs is much more limited, even
though they might be less elusive to study experimentally than quantum critical
points. Here, we characterize the QMCP of an interacting heterogeneous quantum
system in two and three dimensions, the ferromagnetic random transverse-field
Ising model (RTIM). The QMCP of the RTIM emerges due to both geometric and
quantum fluctuations, studied here numerically by the strong disorder
renormalization group method. The QMCP of the RTIM is found to exhibit
ultraslow, activated dynamic scaling, governed by an infinite disorder fixed
point. This ensures that the obtained multicritical exponents tend to the exact
values at large scales, while also being universal -- i.e. independent of the
form of disorder -- , providing a solid theoretical basis for future

computer vision detectors successfully with high confidence. In this paper, we
address the problem for the first time by combining deep object detectors with
super-resolution techniques and altitude data. In particular, we show that the
integration of a holistic attention network based super-resolution approach and
a custom-built altitude data exploitation network into standard recognition

between animal resolution and detection performance. We conclude that
super-resolution and altitude knowledge exploitation techniques can
significantly increase benchmarks across settings and, thus, should be used
routinely when detecting minutely resolved animals in aerial imagery.

the detection of glitches and the robust measurements of their parameters. The
Jodrell Bank pulsar timing programme regularly monitors more than 800 radio
pulsars and has accrued, in some cases, over 50 years of timing history on
individual objects. In this paper we present 106 new glitches in 70 radio
pulsars as observed up to the end of 2018. For 70% of these pulsars, the event
we report is its only known glitch. For each new glitch we provide measurements
of its epoch, amplitude and any detected changes to the spin-down rate of the
star. Combining these new glitches with those listed in the Jodrell Bank glitch
catalogue we analyse a total sample of 543 glitches in 178 pulsars. We model
the distribution of glitch amplitudes and spin-down rate changes using a
mixture of two Gaussian components. We corroborate the known dependence of
glitch rate and activity on pulsar spin-down rates and characteristic ages, and
show that younger pulsars tend to exhibit larger glitches. Pulsars whose
spin-down rates between $10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$ and $10^{-10.5}$ Hz s$^{-1}$
show a mean reversal of 1.8% of their spin-down as a consequence of glitches.
Our results are qualitatively consistent with the superfluid vortex unpinning

efficacy of Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) when applied to these
smartphone data in order to check whether they achieve the same accuracy as in
the desktop/laptop area. None of the selected models were able to account for
the smartphone data satisfactorily. Their failure is traced back to: (i) the
hardware and software differences between desktops and smartphones, (ii) the
specific features of mobile applications compared to desktop applications, and
(iii) the different operational conditions and usage profiles. Thus, a
reliability model suited to smartphone applications is still needed. In the
second step, we applied the Weibull and Gamma distributions, and their two
particular cases, Rayleigh and S-Shaped, to model the smartphone failure data
sorted by application version number and grouped into different time periods.
An estimation of the expected number of defects in each application version was

random errors (noise), whose distribution is known. We investigate whether a
Bayesian nonparametric approach for modelling the latent distribution of the
signal can yield inferences with asymptotic frequentist validity under the
$L^1$-Wasserstein metric. When the error density is ordinary smooth, we develop
two inversion inequalities relating either the $L^1$ or the $L^1$-Wasserstein
distance between two mixture densities (of the observations) to the
$L^1$-Wasserstein distance between the corresponding distributions of the
signal. This smoothing inequality improves on those in the literature. We apply
this general result to a Bayesian approach bayes on a Dirichlet process mixture
of normal distributions as a prior on the mixing distribution (or distribution
of the signal), with a Laplace or Linnik noise. In particular we construct an
\textit{adaptive} approximation of the density of the observations by the
convolution of a Laplace (or Linnik) with a well chosen mixture of normal
densities and show that the posterior concentrates at the minimax rate up to a
logarithmic factor. The same prior law is shown to also adapt to the Sobolev
regularity level of the mixing density, thus leading to a new Bayesian
estimation method, relative to the Wasserstein distance, for distributions with
smooth densities.

training in order to synthesize high-fidelity images. Recent studies have shown
that training GANs with limited data remains formidable due to discriminator
overfitting, the underlying cause that impedes the generator's convergence.
This paper introduces a novel strategy called Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation
(APA) to encourage healthy competition between the generator and the
discriminator. As an alternative method to existing approaches that rely on
standard data augmentations or model regularization, APA alleviates overfitting
by employing the generator itself to augment the real data distribution with
generated images, which deceives the discriminator adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of APA in improving synthesis quality
in the low-data regime. We provide a theoretical analysis to examine the
convergence and rationality of our new training strategy. APA is simple and
effective. It can be added seamlessly to powerful contemporary GANs, such as
StyleGAN2, with negligible computational cost.

they are valid. Hence, knowledge base completion (KBC) on temporal knowledge
bases (TKB), where each statement \textit{may} be associated with a temporal
scope, has attracted growing attention. Prior works assume that each statement
in a TKB \textit{must} be associated with a temporal scope. This ignores the
fact that the scoping information is commonly missing in a KB. Thus prior work
is typically incapable of handling generic use cases where a TKB is composed of
temporal statements with/without a known temporal scope. In order to address
this issue, we establish a new knowledge base embedding framework, called
TIME2BOX, that can deal with atemporal and temporal statements of different
types simultaneously. Our main insight is that answers to a temporal query
always belong to a subset of answers to a time-agnostic counterpart. Put
differently, time is a filter that helps pick out answers to be correct during
certain periods. We introduce boxes to represent a set of answer entities to a
time-agnostic query. The filtering functionality of time is modeled by
intersections over these boxes. In addition, we generalize current evaluation
protocols on time interval prediction. We describe experiments on two datasets
and show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
on both link prediction and time prediction.

positive rate of approximate membership checking structures. This has led to
the development of new structures such as cuckoo filters and xor filters.
Adaptive filters that can react to false positives as they occur to avoid them
for future queries to the same elements have also been recently developed. In
this paper, we propose a new type of static filters that completely avoid false
positives for a given set of negative elements and show how they can be
efficiently implemented using xor probing filters. Several constructions of
these filters with a false positive free set are proposed that minimize the
memory and speed overheads introduced by avoiding false positives. The proposed
filters have been extensively evaluated to validate their functionality and
show that in many cases both the memory and speed overheads are negligible. We
also discuss several use cases to illustrate the potential benefits of the
proposed filters in practical applications.

simulation for the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey area. DC2 is the first
large-scale (300 deg$^2$) image simulation of a transient survey that includes
realistic cadence, variable observing conditions, and CCD image artifacts. We
analyze ${\sim}$15 deg$^2$ of DC2 over a 5-year time-span in which artificial
point-sources from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) light curves have been overlaid
onto the images. We measure the detection efficiency as a function of
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and find a $50\%$ efficiency at $\rm{SNR}=5.8$. The
magnitude limits for each filter are: $u=23.66$, $g=24.69$, $r=24.06$,
$i=23.45$, $z=22.54$, $y=21.62$ $\rm{mag}$. The artifact contamination is
$\sim90\%$ of detections, corresponding to $\sim1000$ artifacts/deg$^2$ in $g$
band, and falling to 300 per deg$^2$ in $y$ band. The photometry has biases
$<1\%$ for magnitudes $19.5 < m <23$. Our DIA performance on simulated images
is similar to that of the Dark Energy Survey pipeline applied to real images.
We also characterize DC2 image properties to produce catalog-level simulations
needed for distance bias corrections. We find good agreement between DC2 data
and simulations for distributions of SNR, redshift, and fitted light-curve
properties. Applying a realistic SNIa-cosmology analysis for redshifts $z<1$,
we recover the input cosmology parameters to within statistical uncertainties.

analysis of data. More recently, Dasgupta [2016] defined a precise objective
function. Given a set of $n$ data points with a weight function $w_{i,j}$ for
each two items $i$ and $j$ denoting their similarity/dis-similarity, the goal
is to build a recursive (tree like) partitioning of the data points (items)
into successively smaller clusters. He defined a cost function for a tree $T$
to be $Cost(T) = \sum_{i,j \in [n]} \big(w_{i,j} \times |T_{i,j}| \big)$ where
$T_{i,j}$ is the subtree rooted at the least common ancestor of $i$ and $j$ and
presented the first approximation algorithm for such clustering. Then Moseley
and Wang [2017] considered the dual of Dasgupta's objective function for
similarity-based weights and showed that both random partitioning and average
linkage have approximation ratio $1/3$ which has been improved in a series of
works to $0.585$ [Alon et al. 2020]. Later Cohen-Addad et al. [2019] considered
the same objective function as Dasgupta's but for dissimilarity-based metrics,
called $Rev(T)$. It is shown that both random partitioning and average linkage
have ratio $2/3$ which has been only slightly improved to $0.667078$ [Charikar

within the same cluster as deep as possible. So, for dissimilarity-based

$Cost_H(T) = \sum_{i,j \in [n]} \big(w_{i,j} \times H_{i,j} \big)$. We present

can be generalized to waves propagating in nonlinear media, like matter waves

nonlinear currents sustained by a localized linear complex potential in a
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. A key feature allowing the nonlinear
generalization of a SS is a possibility to reduce a nonlinear current to the
linear limit, where a SS has the unambiguous definition. In the meantime, known
examples of nonlinear modes bifurcating from linear spectral singularities are
few and belong to the specific class of constant-amplitude waves. Here we
propose to extend the class of nonlinear SSs by incorporating solutions whose
amplitudes are inhomogeneous. We show that the continuation from the linear
limit requires a deformation of the complex potential, and this deformation is
not unique. Examples include the deformation preserving the gain-and-loss
distribution and the deformation preserving geometry of the potential. For the
case example of a rectangular potential, we demonstrate that the nonlinear
currents can be divided into two types: solutions of the first type bifurcate
from the linear spectral singularities, and solutions of the second type cannot
be reduced to the linear limit.

utmost importance to test and evaluate early quantum technology and understand

few years, multiple theoretical and numerical advances have continuously pushed
the boundary of what is classically simulable, hence the development of a
plethora of tools which are often limited to a specific purpose or designed for
a particular hardware (e.g. CPUs vs. GPUs). Moreover, such tools are typically
developed using tailored languages and syntax, which makes it hard to compare

  To support unified and optimized use of these techniques across platforms, we
developed HybridQ, a highly extensible platform designed to provide a common

main pillars: ""Easy to Use"", ""Easy to Extend"", and ""Use the Best Available

HybridQ supports large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) simulations,
automatically balancing workload among different processor nodes and enabling
the use of multiple backends to maximize parallel efficiency. Everything is
then glued together by a simple and expressive language that allows seamless
switching from one technique to another as well as from one hardware to the

unnormalized target densities due to high efficiency and favorable scalability
with respect to increasing space dimensions. However, HMC struggles when the
target distribution is multimodal, because the maximum increase in the
potential energy function (i.e., the negative log density function) along the
simulated path is bounded by the initial kinetic energy, which follows a half
of the $\chi_d^2$ distribution, where d is the space dimension. In this paper,
we develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method where the constructed paths can
travel across high potential energy barriers. This method does not require the
modes of the target distribution to be known in advance. Our approach enables
frequent jumps between the isolated modes of the target density by continuously
varying the mass of the simulated particle while the Hamiltonian path is
constructed. Thus, this method can be considered as a combination of HMC and
the tempered transitions method. Compared to other tempering methods, our
method has a distinctive advantage in the Gibbs sampler settings, where the
target distribution changes at each step. We develop a practical tuning
strategy for our method and demonstrate that it can construct globally mixing
Markov chains targeting high-dimensional, multimodal distributions, using
mixtures of normals and a sensor network localization problem.

very basic questions remain open in this model. We resolve a number of them:
  - We show uniqueness of journey times in equilibria.
  - We show continuity of equilibria: small perturbations to the instance or to

equilibrium evolutions.
  - We demonstrate that, assuming constant inflow into the network at the

multi-wavelength light curves (LCs) from thermal disk emission around accreting
equal-mass supermassive black hole (BH) binaries, with a focus on revealing
binary eccentricity. LCs are obtained by modeling the disk thermodynamics with
an adiabatic equation of state, a local blackbody cooling prescription, and
corrections to approximate the effects of radiation pressure. We find that
modulation of multi-band LCs on the orbital time scale are generally in-phase

substructure in the time domain that is not necessarily reflected in BH
accretion rates $\dot M$. We thus predict that binary-hosting AGN will exhibit
highly correlated, in-phase, periodic brightness modulations in their
low-energy disk emission. However, detectability of these modulations in
multi-wavelength observing campaigns could be seriously compromised because
observed stochastic variability in AGNs typically has a higher amplitude than
our proposed signal. It is possible that observations over temporal baselines
of many binary periods may make the signal more prominent, but this would need
to be analyzed carefully. If jet emission is predicted by $\dot{M}$, then we
predict a weaker correlation with low-energy disk emission due to the differing
sub-peak structure. For the binary parameters we explore, we show that LC
variability due to hydrodynamics likely dominates Doppler brightening for all
equal-mass binaries with disk Mach numbers $\lesssim 20$. A promising signature
of eccentricity is weak or absent ""lump"" periodicity. We find hints that a
significant lag exists between $\dot{M}$ and low-energy disk emission for
circular binaries, but they are in-phase for eccentric binaries, which might
explain some ""orphan"" blazar flares with no $\gamma$-ray counterpart.

terraforming the planet. One major requirement for such terraforming is having
the protection of a planetary magnetic field which Mars currently does not
have. In this article we explore comprehensively for the first time, the
practical and engineering challenges that affect the feasibility of creating an
artificial magnetic field capable of encompassing Mars. This includes the
concerns that define the design, where to locate the magnetic field generator
and possible construction strategies. The rationale here is not to justify the
need for a planetary magnetosphere but to put figures on the practicalities so
as to be able to weigh the pros and cons of the different engineering
approaches.
  The optimum solution proposed is completely novel, although inspired by
natural situations and fusion plasma techniques. The solution with the lowest
power, assembly and mass is to create an artificial charged particle ring
(similar in form to a ""radiation belt""), around the planet possibly formed by
ejecting matter from one of the moons of Mars (in fashion similar to that that
forms the Io-Jupiter plasma torus), but using electromagnetic and plasma waves
to drive a net current in the ring(s) that results in an overall magnetic
field.
  With a new era of space exploration underway, this is the time to start
thinking about these new and bold future concepts and to begin filling
strategic knowledge gaps. Furthermore, the principles explored here are also
applicable to smaller scale objects like manned spacecraft, space stations or
moon bases, which would benefit from the creation of protective

erase convective cores and modify a star's main sequence lifetime. The Sun's
proximity to us makes it an ideal laboratory for studying these effects.
However, the two formalisms commonly used to parametrize such heat transport

Knudsen transition, where heat transport is maximized. We construct a Monte
Carlo simulation to exactly solve the Boltzmann collision equation, determining
the steady-state distribution and luminosity carried in stars by ADM with cross
sections that depend on velocity and momentum. We find that, although the
established (Gould and Raffelt) formalism based on local thermal equilibrium
does well for constant cross sections, the isothermal (Spergel and Press)

in the expanding ejecta of a number of core-collapse supernovae. How dust forms
in such quantities remains poorly understood; theories of dust formation
predict lower total masses and much faster formation rates than observations
imply. One suggestion to reconcile observations and theory was made by Dwek et
al. (2019), who proposed that the dust forms very rapidly, and because of its
optical depth, is not initially observationally detectable, only being
gradually revealed as the ejecta expand. Observational dust masses at early
times would then only be lower limits. Using a large grid of radiative transfer
models covering dust masses from 10$^{-4}$ to 1M$_\odot$ to calculate both the
spectral energy distribution and the emission line profiles from clumpy dust
shells, we show that this cannot be the case. Some clump distributions allow
dust masses of $\sim$0.01 M$_\odot$ to be concealed in clumps and still predict
an SED consistent with the observations. However, these geometries predict
emission line profiles which are inconsistent with the observations. Similarly,
clump geometries which reproduce the observed emission line profiles with dust
masses >0.01 M$_\odot$ do not reproduce the SED. However, models with
$\sim$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ of amorphous carbon can reproduce both the SED and
the emission line profiles. We conclude that no large masses of dust can be
hidden from view in the ejecta of SN 1987A at early epochs, and that the
majority of dust must thus have formed at epochs >1000 days.

span of spatial scales and the complexity of the required numerical methods. In
particular, turbulent velocity and magnetic fields are extremely sensitive to
the spatial discretisation of simulated domains. To explore how refinement
schemes affect galactic turbulence and amplification of magnetic fields in
cosmological simulations, we compare two refinement strategies. A traditional
quasi-Lagrangian adaptive mesh refinement approach focusing spatial resolution
on dense regions, and a new refinement method that resolves the entire galaxy
with a high resolution quasi-uniform grid. Our new refinement strategy yields
much faster magnetic energy amplification than the quasi-Lagrangian method,
which is also significantly greater than the adiabatic compressional estimate
indicating that the extra amplification is produced through stretching of
magnetic field lines. Furthermore, with our new refinement the magnetic energy
growth factor scales with resolution following $\propto \Dres^{-1/2}$, in much
better agreement with small-scale turbulent box simulations. Finally, we find
evidence suggesting most magnetic amplification in our simulated galaxies
occurs in the warm phase of their interstellar medium, which has a better
developed turbulent field with our new refinement strategy.

asymptotically flat BPS black holes as a fixed point formula that is formally
equivalent to a recent gluing proposal for asymptotically AdS$_4$ black holes.
This prompts a conjecture that the complete perturbative answer for the most
general gravitational building block of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity at a
single fixed point takes the form of a Nekrasov-like partition function with
equivariant parameters related to the higher-derivative expansion of the
prepotential. In turn this leads to a simple localization-like proposal for a
set of supersymmetric partition functions in (UV completed) 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$
supergravity theories. The conjecture is shown to be in agreement with a number
of available results for different BPS backgrounds with both Minkowski and AdS
asymptotics. In particular, it follows that the OSV formula comes from the
unrefined limit of the general expression including only the so-called
$\mathbb{W}$ tower of higher derivatives, while the on-shell action of pure
(Euclidean) AdS$_4$ with round S$^3$ boundary comes from the NS limit that
includes only the $\mathbb{T}$ tower. Backgrounds preserving less
supersymmetry, such as the under-rotating black holes in flat space, the
holographic squashed S$^3$, and the static/rotating twisted and non-twisted
Kerr-Newman-like black holes in AdS$_4$ lead to a more general refined version

black holes (SMBHs) have been obtained with the orbit superposition technique
under the assumption of axisymmetry. However, few galaxies -- in particular
massive early-type galaxies -- obey exact axisymmetry. Here we present a
revised orbit superposition code and a new approach for dynamically determining
the intrinsic shapes and mass parameters of triaxial galaxies based on
spatially-resolved stellar kinematic data. The triaxial TriOS code described
here corrects an error in the original van den Bosch et al. (2008) code that
gives rise to incorrect projections for most orbits in triaxial models and can
significantly impact parameter search results. The revised code also contains
significant improvements in orbit sampling, mass constraints, and run time.
Furthermore, we introduce two new parameter searching strategies -- a new set
of triaxial shape parameters and a novel grid-free sampling technique -- that
together lead to a remarkable gain in efficiency in locating the best-fit
model. We apply the updated code and search method to NGC 1453, a fast-rotating
massive elliptical galaxy. A full 6D parameter search finds
$p=b/a=0.933^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ and $q=c/a=0.779\pm0.012$ for the intrinsic
axis ratios and $T=0.33\pm0.06$ for the triaxiality parameter. Despite the
deviations from axisymmetry, the best-fit SMBH mass, stellar mass-to-light
ratio, and dark matter enclosed mass for NGC 1453 are consistent with the
axisymmetric results. More comparisons between axisymmetric and triaxial
modeling are needed before drawing general conclusions.

dwarf and a K-type main-sequence star in the Hyades star cluster. We analyzed
publicly available photometry and spectroscopy of V471 Tau to revise the
stellar and orbital parameters of the system. We used archival K2 photometry,
archival Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy, and published radial-velocity
measurements of the K-type star. Employing Gaussian processes to fit for
rotational modulation of the system flux by the main-sequence star, we
recovered the transits of the white dwarf in front of the main-sequence star
for the first time. The transits are shallower than would be expected from
purely geometric occultations owing to gravitational microlensing during
transit, which places an additional constraint on the white-dwarf mass. Our
revised mass and radius for the main-sequence star is consistent with
single-star evolutionary models given the age and metallicity of the Hyades.
However, as noted previously in the literature, the white dwarf is too massive
and too hot to be the result of single-star evolution given the age of the
Hyades, and may be the product of a merger scenario. We independently estimate
the conditions of the system at the time of common envelope that would result
in the measured orbital parameters today.

The mechanisms by which AI generates these insights, however, often remain

psychological traits from digital footprints. We elaborate on two popular XAI
methods (rule extraction and counterfactual explanations) in the context of Big
Five personality predictions (traits and facets) from financial transactions
data (N = 6,408). First, we demonstrate how global rule extraction sheds light
on the spending patterns identified by the model as most predictive for
personality, and discuss how these rules can be used to explain, validate, and
improve the model. Second, we implement local rule extraction to show that
individuals are assigned to personality classes because of their unique
financial behavior, and that there exists a positive link between the model's
prediction confidence and the number of features that contributed to the
prediction. Our experiments highlight the importance of both global and local
XAI methods. By better understanding how predictive models work in general as
well as how they derive an outcome for a particular person, XAI promotes
accountability in a world in which AI impacts the lives of billions of people

that minimizes a weighted sum of material consumption and (linearly) elastic

in general not well-posed since its solution typically requires the use of
infinitesimally fine microstructure. Therefore we examine the effect of
singularly perturbing the problem by adding the structure perimeter to the
cost. For a uniaxial and a shear load in two space dimensions, corresponding
energy scaling laws were already derived in the literature. This work now
derives the scaling law for the case of a uniaxial load in three space

essence, it is expected (and confirmed in this article) that for a uniaxial
load the compliance behaves almost like the dissipation in a scalar flux

directly be applied. The upper bounds though require nontrivial modifications
of the constructions known from superconductors. Those become necessary since
in elasticity one has the additional constraint of torque balance.

In
recent years, the interest in confined fluids has grown, driven by research on
unconventional hydrocarbon resources -- shale gas and shale oil, much of which
are confined in nanopores. When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their
properties differ from those of the same fluid in the bulk. These properties
include density, freezing point, transport coefficients, thermal expansion
coefficient, and elastic properties. The elastic moduli of a fluid confined in
the pores contribute to the overall elasticity of the fluid-saturated porous
medium and determine the speed at which elastic waves traverse through the
medium. Wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media is pivotal for
geophysics, as elastic waves are used for characterization of formations and
rock samples. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of experimental
works on wave propagation in fluid-saturated nanoporous media, as well as
theoretical works focused on calculation of compressibility of fluids in
confinement. We discuss models that bridge the gap between experiments and
theory, revealing a number of open questions that are both fundamental and
applied in nature. While some results were demonstrated both experimentally and
theoretically (e.g. the pressure dependence of compressibility of fluids),
others were theoretically predicted, but not verified in experiments (e.g.
linear scaling of modulus with the pore size). Therefore, there is a demand for
the combined experimental-modeling studies on porous samples with various
characteristic pore sizes. The extension of molecular simulation studies from
simple model fluids to the more complex molecular fluids is another open area
of practical interest.

regular expressions on an edge-labeled, directed multigraph. When evaluating an
RPQ, the evaluation of a Kleene closure (i.e., Kleene plus or Kleene star) is
very expensive. Furthermore, when multiple RPQs include a Kleene closure as a
common sub-query, repeated evaluations of the common sub-query cause serious
performance degradation. In this paper, we present a novel concept of RPQ-based
graph reduction, which significantly simplifies the original graph through
edge-level and vertex-level reductions. Interestingly, RPQ-based graph
reduction can replace the evaluation of the Kleene closure on the large
original graph to that of the transitive closure to the small reduced graph. We
then propose a reduced transitive closure (RTC) as a lightweight structure for
efficiently sharing the result of a Kleene closure. We also present an RPQ
evaluation algorithm, RTCSharing, which treats each clause in the disjunctive
normal form of the given RPQ as a batch unit. If the batch units include a
Kleene closure as a common sub-query, we share the lightweight RTC instead of
the heavyweight result of the Kleene closure. RPQ-based graph reduction further
enables us to formally represent the result of an RPQ including a Kleene
closure as a relational algebra expression including the RTC. Through the
formal expression, we optimize the evaluation of the batch unit by eliminating
useless and redundant operations of the previous method. Experiments show that
RTCSharing improves the performance significantly by up to 73.86 times compared
with existing methods in terms of query response time.

executes proper movements in the face of delayed and noisy stimuli. A prominent
framework for addressing such control problems is Optimal Feedback Control
(OFC). OFC generates control actions that optimize behaviorally relevant
criteria by integrating noisy sensory stimuli and the predictions of an
internal model using the Kalman filter or its extensions. However, a
satisfactory neural model of Kalman filtering and control is lacking because
existing proposals have the following limitations: not considering the delay of
sensory feedback, training in alternating phases, and requiring knowledge of
the noise covariance matrices, as well as that of systems dynamics. Moreover,
the majority of these studies considered Kalman filtering in isolation, and not
jointly with control. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel
online algorithm which combines adaptive Kalman filtering with a model free
control approach (i.e., policy gradient algorithm). We implement this algorithm
in a biologically plausible neural network with local synaptic plasticity
rules. This network performs system identification and Kalman filtering,
without the need for multiple phases with distinct update rules or the
knowledge of the noise covariances. It can perform state estimation with
delayed sensory feedback, with the help of an internal model. It learns the
control policy without requiring any knowledge of the dynamics, thus avoiding
the need for weight transport. In this way, our implementation of OFC solves
the credit assignment problem needed to produce the appropriate sensory-motor
control in the presence of stimulus delay.

prediction tasks of practical interest, especially using tabular datasets.
Hyperparameter tuning can further improve the predictive performance, but
unlike neural networks, full-batch training of many models on large datasets
can be time consuming. Owing to the discovery that (i) there is a strong linear
relation between dataset size & training time, (ii) XGBoost models satisfy the
ranking hypothesis, and (iii) lower-fidelity models can discover promising
hyperparameter configurations, we show that uniform subsampling makes for a
simple yet fast baseline to speed up the tuning of large XGBoost models using
multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization with data subsets as the fidelity

of diverse and natural human motions from prescribed action categories. The key
issue lies in the ability to synthesize multiple distinct motion sequences that
are realistic in their visual appearances. It is achieved in this paper by a
two-step process that maintains internal 3D pose and shape representations,
action2motion and motion2video. Action2motion stochastically generates
plausible 3D pose sequences of a prescribed action category, which are
processed and rendered by motion2video to form 2D videos. Specifically, the Lie
algebraic theory is engaged in representing natural human motions following the
physical law of human kinematics; a temporal variational auto-encoder (VAE) is
developed that encourages diversity of output motions. Moreover, given an
additional input image of a clothed human character, an entire pipeline is
proposed to extract his/her 3D detailed shape, and to render in videos the
plausible motions from different views. This is realized by improving existing
methods to extract 3D human shapes and textures from single 2D images, rigging,
animating, and rendering to form 2D videos of human motions. It also
necessitates the curation and reannotation of 3D human motion datasets for
training purpose. Thorough empirical experiments including ablation study,
qualitative and quantitative evaluations manifest the applicability of our
approach, and demonstrate its competitiveness in addressing related tasks,
where components of our approach are compared favorably to the
state-of-the-arts.

trust for over three decades in relative isolation from one another.
Human-robot interaction has focused on the underlying dimensions, layers,
correlates, and antecedents of trust models, while game theory has concentrated
on the psychology and strategies behind singular trust decisions. Both fields
have grappled to understand over-trust and trust calibration, as well as how to
measure trust expectations, risk, and vulnerability. This paper presents
initial steps in closing the gap between these fields. Using insights and
experimental findings from interdependence theory and social psychology, this
work starts by analyzing a large game theory competition data set to
demonstrate that the strongest predictors for a wide variety of human-human
trust interactions are the interdependence-derived variables for commitment and
trust that we have developed. It then presents a second study with human
subject results for more realistic trust scenarios, involving both human-human
and human-machine trust. In both the competition data and our experimental
data, we demonstrate that the interdependence metrics better capture social
`overtrust' than either rational or normative psychological reasoning, as
proposed by game theory. This work further explores how interdependence
theory--with its focus on commitment, coercion, and cooperation--addresses many
of the proposed underlying constructs and antecedents within human-robot trust,
shedding new light on key similarities and differences that arise when robots
replace humans in trust interactions.

complex properties of these dynamically active regions of clusters and in
general the micro physics of the ICM. Abell 3667 is a spectacular examples of a

(z=0.0553) and large mass, the system enables the study of these sources to a
uniquely high level of detail. We observed Abell 3667 with MeerKAT as part of
the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. We used these data to study the large

properties. We present the most detailed view of the radio relic system in

with a network of filaments with different spectral and polarisation properties
that are likely associated with multiple regions of particle acceleration and
local enhancements of the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field in the
space between filaments has strengths close to that expected in unperturbed
regions at the same cluster-centric distance. Comparisons with MHD simulations
supports the idea of filaments as multiple acceleration sites. Our observations
also confirm the presence of an elongated radio halo, developed in the wake of
the bullet-like sub-cluster that merged from the South-East. Finally, we
associate the process of magnetic draping to a thin polarised radio source
surrounding the remnant of the bullet's cool core.

elements, another has none, and the remainder include any one or two. We found
that both the mean and variance of bias decline as design elements are added,
with the lowest mean and smallest variance in a design with all three elements.
The probability of bias falling within 0.10 standard deviations of the
experimental estimate varied from 59 to 83 percent in Bayesian analyses and
from 86 to 100 percent in non-Bayesian ones -- the ranges depending on the
level of data aggregation. But confounding remains possible due to each of the
eight observational study design cells including a different set of WSC
studies.

computational models of inference and learning with local update rules and the
global gradient-based optimization of neural network models employed in machine
learning. One particularly exciting connection is the correspondence between
the locally informed optimization in predictive coding networks and the error
backpropagation algorithm that is used to train state-of-the-art deep
artificial neural networks. Here we focus on the related, but still largely
under-explored connection between precision weighting in predictive coding
networks and the Natural Gradient Descent algorithm for deep neural networks.
Precision-weighted predictive coding is an interesting candidate for scaling up
uncertainty-aware optimization -- particularly for models with large parameter
spaces -- due to its distributed nature of the optimization process and the
underlying local approximation of the Fisher information metric, the adaptive
learning rate that is central to Natural Gradient Descent. Here, we show that
hierarchical predictive coding networks with learnable precision indeed are
able to solve various supervised and unsupervised learning tasks with
performance comparable to global backpropagation with natural gradients and
outperform their classical gradient descent counterpart on tasks where high
amounts of noise are embedded in data or label inputs. When applied to
unsupervised auto-encoding of image inputs, the deterministic network produces
hierarchically organized and disentangled embeddings, hinting at the close
connections between predictive coding and hierarchical variational inference.

whether protons (through hadronic interactions and subsequent pion decay) or

understanding of the spatial and energy distribution of the underlying particle

numerical approach is not only super-algebraically convergent, but it also
satisfies an important property of the convolution -- namely, the preservation
of bandwidth. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed method depends only on
how well the source field is approximated; it is independent of wavelength,
propagation distance, and observation plane discretization. In contrast,
methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), such as the angular spectrum
method (ASM) and its variants, approximate the optical fields in the source and
observation planes using Fourier series. We will show that the ASM introduces
artificial periodic boundary conditions and violates the preservation of
bandwidth property, resulting in limited accuracy which decreases for longer
propagation distances. The sinc-based approach avoids both of these problems.
Numerical results are presented for Gaussian beam propagation and circular
aperture diffraction to demonstrate the high-order accuracy of the sinc method

a morpho-functional design. By engineering a 3D-printed exoskeleton we encode a
re-orientation response to an external body force (such as gravity) or a
surface force (such as a collision). We show that the force-orientation
response is generic, and can augment existing swarm-robotic platforms (e.g
Kilobots) as well as custom robots even 10 times larger. At the individual
level, the exoskeleton improves the motility and stability, and also allows to
encode two contrasting dynamical behaviors in response to an external force or
a collision (including collision with a wall or a movable obstacle, and on a
dynamically tilting plane). This force-orientation response adds a mechanical
layer to the robot's sense-act cycle at the swarm level, leveraging steric
interactions for collective phototaxis when crowded. Enabling collisions also
promotes information flow, facilitating online distributed learning. Each robot
runs an embedded algorithm that ultimately optimizes collective performance. We
identify an effective parameter that controls the force-orientation response

functions by observing human behavior. But people exhibit a wide array of
irrationalities, and our goal with this work is to better understand the effect

that there are many types of irrationality, with varying degrees of
mathematical formalization. We thus operationalize irrationality in the
language of MDPs, by altering the Bellman optimality equation, and use this
framework to study how these alterations would affect inference.
  We find that wrongly modeling a systematically irrational human as
noisy-rational performs a lot worse than correctly capturing these biases -- so
much so that it can be better to skip inference altogether and stick to the
prior! More importantly, we show that an irrational human, when correctly
modelled, can communicate more information about the reward than a perfectly
rational human can. That is, if a robot has the correct model of a human's
irrationality, it can make an even stronger inference than it ever could if the
human were rational. Irrationality fundamentally helps rather than hinder
reward inference, but it needs to be correctly accounted for.

potentially k simultaneous equipment outages. Inspired by methods in
adversarially robust training, we frame N-k SCOPF as a minimax optimization
problem - viewing power generation settings as adjustable parameters and
equipment outages as (adversarial) attacks - and solve this problem via
gradient-based techniques. The loss function of this minimax problem involves
resolving implicit equations representing grid physics and operational
decisions, which we differentiate through via the implicit function theorem. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in solving N-3 SCOPF, which has
traditionally been considered as prohibitively expensive to solve given that
the problem size depends combinatorially on the number of potential outages.

(COPD) and many complex diseases suggest subgroup disparities (e.g., by sex).
We consider this problem from the standpoint of integrative analysis where we
combine information from different views (e.g., genomics, proteomics, clinical
data). Existing integrative analysis methods ignore the heterogeneity in
subgroups, and stacking the views and accounting for subgroup heterogeneity
does not model the association among the views. To address analytical
challenges in the problem of our interest, we propose a statistical approach
for joint association and prediction that leverages the strengths in each view
to identify molecular signatures that are shared by and specific to males and
females and that contribute to the variation in COPD, measured by airway wall
thickness. HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) accounts for
subgroup heterogeneity, allows for sparsity in variable selection, is
applicable to multi-class and to univariate or multivariate continuous
outcomes, and incorporates covariate adjustment. We develop efficient
algorithms in PyTorch. Our COPD findings have identified several proteins,
genes, and pathways that are common and specific to males and females, some of
which have been implicated in COPD, while others could lead to new insights
into sex differences in COPD mechanisms.

undergoing evaporation on rigid surfaces. Using a lubrication-like
approximation, the governing equations of three-dimensional nonlinear
poroelasticity are reduced to a single thin-film equation for the drop
thickness. We find that thin drops experience compressive elastic stresses but
the total in-plane stresses are tensile. The mechanical response of the drop is
dictated by the initial profile of the solid skeleton, which controls the
in-plane deformation, the dominant components of elastic stress, and sets a
limit on the depth of delamination that can potentially occur. Our theory
suggests that the alignment of desiccation fractures in colloidal drops is
selected by the shape of the drop at the point of gelation. We propose that the
emergence of three distinct fracture patterns in dried blood drops is a
consequence of a non-monotonic drop profile at gelation. We also show that
depletion fronts, which separate wet and dry solid, can invade the drop from
the contact line and localise the generation of mechanical stress during
drying. Finally, the finite element method is used to explore the stress
profiles in drops with large contact angles.

central, among other tools, to the development of the polynomial method in
combinatorics. Owing to its concrete connections with Gr\""obner basis theory,
as well as its applicability in several areas like computational complexity,
combinatorial geometry, and coding theory, an important line of enquiry is to
understand the affine Hilbert function of structured sets of points in the
affine space.
  In this work, we determine the affine Hilbert function (over the reals) of
arbitrary unions of layers of points in a uniform grid (a finite grid with the
component sets having equispaced points), where each layer of points is
determined by a fixed sum of components for all the points. This extends a
result of Bernasconi and Egidi (Inf. Comput. 1999) from the Boolean cube
setting to the uniform grid setting.
  Our proofs follow a similar outline as that of Bernasconi and Egidi. However,
there are two bottlenecks that arise in the uniform grid setting. We resolve
these by using (i) a classical fact that a symmetric Jordan basis exists for
the function space on a uniform grid, and (ii) an extension to multisets of an
algebraic interpretation by Friedl and R\'onyai (Discrete Math. 2003) of the
notion of order shattering.
  The affine Hilbert function is, in fact, a stronger notion than the
finite-degree Zariski closure, which is yet another important tool in the
polynomial method toolkit. We conclude by giving an alternative proof of a
combinatorial characterization of a variant of finite-degree Zariski closures,
for unions of layers in uniform grids, obtained in an earlier work of the
author (arXiv, 2021).

However, it imposes a great challenge to perform online learning for such a

photosynthetic light harvesting systems including non-Markovian coupling to
phonon degrees of freedom, under excitation by N-photon Fock state pulses. This
method combines the input-output formalism and the hierarchical equations of
motion (HEOM) formalism into a double hierarchy of coupled linear equations in
density matrices. We show analytically that, under weak field excitation
relevant to natural photosynthesis conditions, an N-photon Fock state input and
a corresponding coherent state input give rise to equal density matrices in the
excited manifold. However, an important difference is that an N-photon Fock
state input has no off-diagonal coherence between the ground and excited
subspaces, in contrast with the coherences created by a coherent state input.
We derive expressions for the probability to absorb a single Fock state photon,
with or without the influence of phonons. For short pulses (or equivalently,
wide bandwidth pulses), we show that the absorption probability has a universal
behavior that depends only upon a system-dependent effective energy spread
parameter {\Delta} and an exciton-light coupling constant {\Gamma}. This holds
for a broad range of chromophore systems and for a variety of pulse shapes. We
also analyse the absorption probability in the opposite long pulses (narrow
bandwidth) regime. We also derive an expression for the long time emission rate
in the presence of phonons and use it to study the difference between
collective versus independent emission. Finally, we present a numerical
simulation for the LHCII monomer (14-mer) system under single photon excitation

the identification of perfect symmetries in the connectivity structure. We test
the algorithm against other strategies to repair missing links in incomplete

polyelectrolytes tethered onto a spherical, oppositely charged core in
equilibrium with an ionic reservoir of fixed concentration. Particular focus is
placed on the situation of stretched chains, where the monomer concentration is
known to display an inverse square-law decay far away from the spherical
surface, which is then further extrapolated all the way down to the grafting
core. While the equilibrium distributions of mobile ions are computed in the
framework of a classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT) that incorporates
both their size and electrostatic correlations within the grafted
polyelectrolyte, the equilibrium configuration of the latter is described by
its averaged radius of gyration, which is taken as a variational parameter that
guarantees mechanical equilibrium across the polymer-solvent interface. The
averaged particle size is then analyzed over a wide range of polymerization
degrees, ionic concentrations and functionality of the polymer backbones. Two
distinct regimes can be identified: at high ionic strengths, swelling of the
grafted polymers is dominated by ionic entropic contribution as well as polymer
size effects, whereas at low ionic concentrations a balance between
electrostatic and entropic effects is the main driven mechanism for particle
stretching. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we then proceed to investigate the
effects of charge regulation when the brush core is further decorated with
active functional sites randomly distributed over its surface, which act as

time series have shown superior results in many forecasting competitions and
real-world applications compared with univariate forecasting approaches. One
aspect of the popularity of statistical forecasting models such as ETS and
ARIMA is their relative simplicity and interpretability (in terms of relevant
lags, trend, seasonality, and others), while GFMs typically lack
interpretability, especially towards particular time series. This reduces the
trust and confidence of the stakeholders when making decisions based on the
forecasts without being able to understand the predictions. To mitigate this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel local model-agnostic interpretability
approach to explain the forecasts from GFMs. We train simpler univariate
surrogate models that are considered interpretable (e.g., ETS) on the
predictions of the GFM on samples within a neighbourhood that we obtain through
bootstrapping or straightforwardly as the one-step-ahead global black-box model
forecasts of the time series which needs to be explained. After, we evaluate
the explanations for the forecasts of the global models in both qualitative and

several studies propose refactoring strategies to optimize software design
through applying design patterns and removing design defects, little is known
about how developers actually refactor their code to improve its reuse.
Therefore, we extract, from 1,828 open-source projects, a set of refactorings
that were intended to improve the software reusability. We analyze the impact
of reusability refactorings on the state-of-the-art reusability metrics, and we
compare the distribution of reusability refactoring types, with the
distribution of the remaining mainstream refactorings. Overall, we found that
the distribution of refactoring types, applied in the context of reusability,
is different from the distribution of refactoring types in mainstream
development. In the refactorings performed to improve reusability, source files
are subject to more design-level types of refactorings. Reusability
refactorings significantly impact, high-level code elements, such as packages,
classes, and methods, while typical refactorings, impact all code elements,
including identifiers, and parameters. These findings provide practical
insights into the current practice of refactoring in the context of code reuse

  a novel hybrid-dimensional model of single-phase Darcy flow in a fractured
porous media. In this model, the fracture is treated as an $(d-1)$-dimensional
interface within the $d$-dimensional fractured porous domain, for $d=2, 3$. Two
classes of fracture are distinguished based on the permeability magnitude ratio
between the fracture and its surrounding medium: when the permeability in the
fracture is (significantly) larger than in its surrounding medium, it is
considered as a {\it conductive} fracture; when the permeability in the
fracture is (significantly) smaller than in its surrounding medium, it is
considered as a {\it blocking} fracture. The conductive fractures are treated
using the classical hybrid-dimensional approach of the interface model where
pressure is assumed to be continuous across the fracture interfaces, while the
blocking fractures are treated using the recent Dirac-$\delta$ function
approach where normal component of Darcy velocity is assumed to be continuous
across the interface. Due to the use of Dirac-$\delta$ function approach for
the blocking fractures, our numerical scheme allows for nonconforming meshes
with respect to the blocking fractures. This is the major novelty of our model
and numerical discretization. Moreover, our numerical scheme produces locally
conservative velocity approximations and leads to a symmetric positive definite
linear system involving pressure degrees of freedom on the mesh skeleton only.
The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by various benchmark
test cases in both two- and three-dimensions. Numerical results indicate that
the proposed scheme is highly competitive with existing methods in the
literature.

KCT identification approach explores the dependency degrees among tasks and

correlated with the discoveries on the operational network and the asset

conventional routing jointly solves the problem of selecting nodes for
computation and paths for data transfer between nodes. We show that using our

provides an essential framework for the characterization of anatomy/morphology.
Such analysis is often driven by the identification of a relatively small
number of geometrically consistent features found across the samples of a
population. These features can subsequently provide information about the
population shape variation. Dense correspondence models can provide ease of
computation and yield an interpretable low-dimensional shape descriptor when
followed by dimensionality reduction. However, automatic methods for obtaining
such correspondences usually require image segmentation followed by significant
preprocessing, which is taxing in terms of both computation as well as human
resources. In many cases, the segmentation and subsequent processing require
manual guidance and anatomy specific domain expertise. This paper proposes a
self-supervised deep learning approach for discovering landmarks from images
that can directly be used as a shape descriptor for subsequent analysis. We use
landmark-driven image registration as the primary task to force the neural
network to discover landmarks that register the images well. We also propose a
regularization term that allows for robust optimization of the neural network
and ensures that the landmarks uniformly span the image domain. The proposed
method circumvents segmentation and preprocessing and directly produces a
usable shape descriptor using just 2D or 3D images. In addition, we also
propose two variants on the training loss function that allows for prior shape
information to be integrated into the model. We apply this framework on several
2D and 3D datasets to obtain their shape descriptors, and analyze their utility

For example, this nonlinearity forms the basis for a new type of gain medium,
which when integrated into a laser or maser, produces large Fock states (rather

orders of magnitude larger than any realized previously, and would be protected
from dissipation by a new type of equilibrium between nonlinear gain and linear
loss. We discuss paths to experimental realization of the effects described

non-equilibrium vacancy and self-interstitial populations migrate under
sufficiently asymmetric interaction biases. In conventional metals, the
propensity is determined to first approximation by comparing point-defect
relaxation strains. We thus present DFT-based calculations of structures and
formation energies and volumes of point defects in the $\alpha$ and the
$\delta$-phases of plutonium. Our results show that lattice defects in
$\delta$-Pu, in contrast to most fcc metals, have surprisingly small formation
volumes. Equally unexpected are the large defect formation volumes found in the
low-symmetry $\alpha$-Pu phase. Both these unusual properties can be
satisfactorily explained from defect-induced spin/orbital moment formation and
destruction in the Pu phases. When we use the calculated defect properties to
estimate the classic void swelling bias in each of the phases, we find it to be
unusually small in $\delta$-Pu, but likely much larger in $\alpha$-Pu. Hence,
swelling rates and mechanisms can diverge dramatically between the different
phases of Pu. Especially in the transient regime before formation of large
defect clusters, the swelling rate of $\alpha$-Pu can reliably be expected to
be much larger than $\delta$-Pu. However, accurate forecasts over longer times
will require the conventional void-swelling theory to be modified to handle the
complexities presented by the different Pu phases. As a case in point, we show
possible anomalous temperature dependence of vacancy properties in $\delta$-Pu,
caused by entropic contributions from defect-induced spin-lattice fluctuations.
Such complications may affect defect-defect interactions and thus alter the
void swelling bias.

intelligent autonomous systems. This task becomes a significant challenge when
the underlying dynamics are changing with time. Motivated by this challenge,
this paper considers the problem of controlling an unknown Markov jump linear
system (MJS) to optimize a quadratic objective. By taking a model-based
perspective, we consider identification-based adaptive control for MJSs. We
first provide a system identification algorithm for MJS to learn the dynamics
in each mode as well as the Markov transition matrix, underlying the evolution
of the mode switches, from a single trajectory of the system states, inputs,
and modes. Through mixing-time arguments, sample complexity of this algorithm
is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then propose an adaptive control
scheme that performs system identification together with certainty equivalent
control to adapt the controllers in an episodic fashion. Combining our sample
complexity results with recent perturbation results for certainty equivalent
control, we prove that when the episode lengths are appropriately chosen, the
proposed adaptive control scheme achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which
can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(polylog(T))$ with partial knowledge of the
system. Our proof strategy introduces innovations to handle Markovian jumps and
a weaker notion of stability common in MJSs. Our analysis provides insights
into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and control
performance. Numerical simulations are presented to further reinforce these

remote sensing capability of detecting oceanic microplastics, which is based on
the measurable surface roughness reduction induced by the presence of
microplastics on the ocean surface. In particular, we are interested in whether
this roughness reduction is caused by the microplastics as floating particles,
or by the surfactants which follow similar transport paths as microplastics.
For this purpose, we experimentally test the effects of floating particles and
surfactants on surface roughness, quantified by the mean square slope (MSS),
with waves generated by a mechanical wave maker or by wind. For microplastics,
we find that their effect on wave energy and MSS critically depends on the
surface area fraction of coverage, irrespective of the particle sizes in the
test range. The damping by particles is observed only for fractions above
$O(5-10\%)$, which is much higher than the realistic ocean condition. For
surfactants, their damping effect on mechanically generated irregular waves
generally increases with the concentration of surfactants, but no optimal
concentration corresponding to maximum damping is observed, in contrast to
previous studies based on monochromatic waves. In wind-wave experiments, the
presence of surfactants suppresses the wave generation, due to the combined
effects of reduced wind shear stress and increased wave damping. For the same
wind speed, the wind stress is identified to depend on the concentration of
surfactants with a power-law relation. The implications of these findings to
remote sensing are discussed.

extended to report the $k$ segments which intersect an axis aligned query

similarity-based methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction
problem, many technical challenges still exist due to the unique structural

feature representations are obtained by optimizing a graph-based objective

perform link prediction solely leveraging the node features of the network. We
define a flexible similarity function with one tunable parameter, which serves
as a penalty of the original similarity measure. The optimal value is learned
through supervised learning thus is adaptive to data distribution. To evaluate
the performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on

researchers have considered the individual code qubits being encoded with the

outer discrete-variable code such as the surface code on these GKP qubits.
Under such a concatenation scheme, the analog information from the inner GKP
error correction improves the noise threshold of the outer code. However, the
surface code has vanishing rate and demands a lot of resources with growing
distance. In this work, we concatenate the GKP code with generic quantum
low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes and demonstrate a natural way to exploit
the GKP analog information in iterative decoding algorithms. We first show the
noise thresholds for two lifted product QLDPC code families, and then show the
improvements of noise thresholds when the iterative decoder - a
hardware-friendly min-sum algorithm (MSA) - utilizes the GKP analog
information. We also show that, when the GKP analog information is combined
with a sequential update schedule for MSA, the scheme surpasses the well-known
CSS Hamming bound for these code families. Furthermore, we observe that the GKP
analog information helps the iterative decoder in escaping harmful trapping
sets in the Tanner graph of the QLDPC code, thereby eliminating or
significantly lowering the error floor of the logical error rate curves.
Finally, we discuss new fundamental and practical questions that arise from
this work on channel capacity under GKP analog information, and on improving

image has been considered in man hyperspectral image denoising methods.
However, these methods usually unfold the 3D tensor to 2D matrix or 1D vector
to exploit the prior information, such as nonlocal spatial self-similarity
(NSS) and global spectral correlation (GSC), which break the intrinsic
structure correlation of hyperspectral image (HSI) and thus lead to poor
restoration quality. In addition, most of them suffer from heavy computational
burden issues due to the involvement of singular value decomposition operation
on matrix and tensor in the original high-dimensionality space of HSI. We
employ subspace representation and the weighted low-rank tensor regularization
(SWLRTR) into the model to remove the mixed noise in the hyperspectral image.
Specifically, to employ the GSC among spectral bands, the noisy HSI is
projected into a low-dimensional subspace which simplified calculation. After
that, a weighted low-rank tensor regularization term is introduced to
characterize the priors in the reduced image subspace. Moreover, we design an
algorithm based on alternating minimization to solve the nonconvex problem.
Experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the SWLRTR method
performs better than other hyperspectral denoising methods quantitatively and
visually.

memory footprint and better energy efficiency are desired. Many prior works
address this need by removing redundant parameters. Parameter quantization
replaces floating-point arithmetic with lower precision fixed-point arithmetic,
further reducing complexity.
  Typical training of quantized weight neural networks starts from fully
quantized weights. Quantization creates random noise. As a way to compensate
for this noise, during training, we propose to quantize some weights while
keeping others in floating-point precision. A deep neural network has many
layers. To arrive at a fully quantized weight network, we start from one
quantized layer and then quantize more and more layers. We show that the order
of layer quantization affects accuracies. Order count is large for deep neural
networks. A sensitivity pre-training is proposed to guide the layer
quantization order.
  Recent work in weight binarization replaces weight-input matrix
multiplication with additions. We apply the proposed iterative training to
weight binarization. Our experiments cover fully connected and convolutional
networks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We show empirically that,
starting from partial binary weights instead of from fully binary ones,
training reaches fully binary weight networks with better accuracies for larger
and deeper networks. Layer binarization in the forward order results in better
accuracies. Guided layer binarization can further improve that. The
improvements come at a cost of longer training time.

loss function to train a lightweight Student network (e.g., MobileNetV2) for
facial landmark detection. We use two Teacher networks, a Tolerant-Teacher and
a Tough-Teacher in conjunction with the Student network. The Tolerant-Teacher
is trained using Soft-landmarks created by active shape models, while the
Tough-Teacher is trained using the ground truth (aka Hard-landmarks) landmark
points. To utilize the facial landmark points predicted by the Teacher
networks, we define an Assistive Loss (ALoss) for each Teacher network.
Moreover, we define a loss function called KD-Loss that utilizes the facial
landmark points predicted by the two pre-trained Teacher networks
(EfficientNet-b3) to guide the lightweight Student network towards predicting
the Hard-landmarks. Our experimental results on three challenging facial
datasets show that the proposed architecture will result in a better-trained

discrepancy problem (also known as the signed series problem): given a sequence
of $T$ unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, find $\pm$ signs for each of them such
that the signed sum vector along any prefix has a small $\ell_\infty$-norm?
This problem is central to proving upper bounds for the Steinitz problem, and
the popular Koml\'os problem is a special case where one is only concerned with
the final signed sum vector instead of all prefixes. Banaszczyk gave an
$O(\sqrt{\log d+ \log T})$ bound for the prefix discrepancy problem. We
investigate the tightness of Banaszczyk's bound and consider natural
generalizations of prefix discrepancy:
  We first consider a smoothed analysis setting, where a small amount of
additive noise perturbs the input vectors. We show an exponential improvement
in $T$ compared to Banaszczyk's bound. Using a primal-dual approach and a
careful chaining argument, we show that one can achieve a bound of
$O(\sqrt{\log d+ \log\!\log T})$ with high probability in the smoothed setting.
Moreover, this smoothed analysis bound is the best possible without further
improvement on Banaszczyk's bound in the worst case.
  We also introduce a generalization of the prefix discrepancy problem where
the discrepancy constraints correspond to paths on a DAG on $T$ vertices. We
show that an analog of Banaszczyk's $O(\sqrt{\log d+ \log T})$ bound continues
to hold in this setting for adversarially given unit vectors and that the
$\sqrt{\log T}$ factor is unavoidable for DAGs. We also show that the
dependence on $T$ cannot be improved significantly in the smoothed case for
DAGs.
  We conclude by exploring a more general notion of vector balancing, which we
call combinatorial vector balancing. We obtain near-optimal bounds in this
setting, up to poly-logarithmic factors.

Therefore, this study adopted multi-year and large-scale air quality data to

concept called dynamic similar hu lines to replace the single fixed division in
the previous research. Furthermore, this study discussed the causes of
distribution patterns quantitatively with geographical detector and random
forest. The causes included natural factors and anthropogenic factors. And
these factors could be divided into three parts according to the
characteristics of spatial distribution: broadly changing with longitude,
changing with latitude, and having local characteristics. Overall, regions with
relatively more densely population, higher GDP, lower altitude, higher
humidity, higher atmospheric pressure, higher surface temperature, less
sunshine hours and more accumulated precipitation often corresponds to positive
correlation coefficient between PM2.5 and O3, no matter in which season. The
parts with opposite conditions that mentioned above are essentially negative
correlation coefficient. And what's more, humidity, global surface temperature,
air temperature and accumulated precipitation are four decisive factors to form
the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3. In general, collaborative
governance of atmospheric pollutants should consider particular time and space

Observations were made simultaneously using the Band 3 (300-500 MHz) and Band 4
(550-750 MHz) receivers of the uGMRT. The pulsar is known to exhibit subpulse
drifting, mode changing, and nulling. Our observations reveal four distinct
sub-pulse drifting modes of emission (A, B, C, and D) for this pulsar, with the
drift periodicities of 17.9 $P_1$, 5.8 $P_1$, 8 $P_1$, 14.1 $P_1$, respectively
(where $P_1$ is the pulsar rotation period), two of which exhibit some new
features that were not reported in the previous studies. We also investigate
the possible spark configuration, characterised by the number of sparks ($n$)

two representative solutions for the number of sparks for a carousel rotation
period, $P_4$, which lies in the range of $13$ to $16$. The large frequency

lower bound that this distance needs to satisfy in order to guarantee
homogeneous traffic density across sections and reduce bottleneck congestion.
The bound is verified analytically and demonstrated using microscopic

five sub-samples according to the relative brightness of an EVQ during SDSS
spectroscopic observation compared to the mean brightness from photometric
observations. Corresponding control samples of normal quasars are built with
matched redshift, bolometric luminosity and supermassive black hole mass. We
obtain the composite SDSS spectra of EVQs in various states and their
corresponding control samples. We find EVQs exhibit clearly bluer (redder) SDSS
spectra during bright (dim) states, consistent with the ""bluer-when-brighter""
trend widely seen in normal quasars. We further find the line EWs of broad
MgII, CIV and OIII (but not broad Hb which is yet puzzling) gradually decrease
from dim state to bright state, similar to the so-called intrinsic Baldwin
effect commonly seen in normal AGNs. Meanwhile, EVQs have systematically larger
line EWs compared with the control samples. We also see that EVQs exhibit
subtle excess in the very broad line component compared with control samples.

tracking in double integrator systems of which mechanical systems evolving on
Euclidean space constitute a large class. But since mechanical systems are
typically constrained interconnections of rigid bodies whose configuration
space is $SE(3)$, which is not even topologically Euclidean, a geometric PID
controller has been developed for mechanical systems evolving on Lie groups. In
this work, we extend the framework to such systems which have nonholonomic
constraints. It encompasses many practically applicable mechanical systems
encountered in robotics as robots are constrained interconnections of rigid
bodies where the constraints could either be holonomic or nonholonomic.

  Networks-based Link Prediction","Published in 2021 International Conference On Computer-Aided Design
  (ICCAD)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logic locking aims to prevent intellectual property (IP) piracy and
unauthorized overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs). However, initial
logic locking techniques were vulnerable to the Boolean satisfiability
(SAT)-based attacks. In response, researchers proposed various SAT-resistant
locking techniques such as point function-based locking and symmetric
interconnection (SAT-hard) obfuscation. We focus on the latter since point
function-based locking suffers from various structural vulnerabilities. The
SAT-hard logic locking technique, InterLock [1], achieves a unified logic and
routing obfuscation that thwarts state-of-the-art attacks on logic locking. In
this work, we propose a novel link prediction-based attack, UNTANGLE, that
successfully breaks InterLock in an oracle-less setting without having access
to an activated IC (oracle). Since InterLock hides selected timing paths in
key-controlled routing blocks, UNTANGLE reveals the gates and interconnections
hidden in the routing blocks upon formulating this task as a link prediction
problem. The intuition behind our approach is that ICs contain a large amount
of repetition and reuse cores. Hence, UNTANGLE can infer the hidden timing
paths by learning the composition of gates in the observed locked netlist or a
circuit library leveraging graph neural networks. We show that circuits
withstanding SAT-based and other attacks can be unlocked in seconds with 100%
precision using UNTANGLE in an oracle-less setting. UNTANGLE is a generic
attack platform (which we also open source [2]) that applies to multiplexer
(MUX)-based obfuscation, as demonstrated through our experiments on ISCAS-85
and ITC-99 benchmarks locked using InterLock and random MUX-based locking.

ZTF17aaaeefu and discovered very deep eclipses. The observations were obtained
over 8 nights covering 7 months. The eclipse profile is similar to the eclipse
profiles observed in other cataclysmic variables. During the observations,
ZTF17aaaeefu showed brightness changes resembling dwarf nova outbursts and
quiescent states. When ZTF17aaaeefu was bright (16.0-16.2 mag), the average
eclipse depth was 2.50+/-0.18 mag. When ZTF17aaaeefu was faint (17.2-17.4 mag),
the average eclipse depth was 1.45+/-0.06 mag. However, these differences in
the eclipse depth may be mainly caused by the contaminating effect of three
faint stars around ZTF17aaaeefu. In both cases, the average width of the
prominent parts of the eclipses was the same and was about 30 min. Due to the
large coverage of observations, I measured the orbital period with high
precision, Porb=0.18821155+/-0.00000014 d. I derived the eclipse ephemeris, the
validity time of which is 700 years in accordance with the precision of the
orbital period. This ephemeris can be used for future studies of the orbital
period changes. Because ZTF17aaaeefu has a long orbital period, this
cataclysmic variable is of interest for determining the masses of its stellar
components. In future radial velocity measurements, my precise eclipse
ephemeris may be useful for determining the orbital phases.

  models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial dependent data frequently occur in many fields such as spatial
econometrics and epidemiology. To deal with the dependence of variables and
estimate quantile-specific effects by covariates, spatial quantile
autoregressive models (SQAR models) are introduced. Conventional quantile
regression only focuses on the fitting models but ignores the examination of
multiple conditional quantile functions, which provides a comprehensive view of
the relationship between the response and covariates. Thus, it is necessary to
study the different regression slopes at different quantiles, especially in
situations where the quantile coefficients share some common feature. However,
traditional Wald multiple tests not only increase the burden of computation but
also bring greater FDR. In this paper, we transform the estimation and
examination problem into a penalization problem, which estimates the parameters
at different quantiles and identifies the interquantile commonality at the same
time. To avoid the endogeneity caused by the spatial lag variables in SQAR
models, we also introduce instrumental variables before estimation and propose
two-stage estimation methods based on fused adaptive LASSO and fused adaptive
sup-norm penalty approaches. The oracle properties of the proposed estimation
methods are established. Through numerical investigations, it is demonstrated
that the proposed methods lead to higher estimation efficiency than the
traditional quantile regression.

From the supervised algorithms, KEA and WINGNUS are employed for keyword
extraction. To assess the similarity of the extracted keywords with

similarity indexes are employed in this study. The experiment shows that the
MultipartiteRank keyword extraction technique measured with cosine with word

teaching strategy would involve assessing a student's knowledge progress for
tailoring the teaching materials in a way that enhances the learning progress.
A human teacher would achieve this by tracing a student's knowledge over
important learning concepts in a task. Albeit, such teaching strategy is not
well exploited yet in machine learning as current machine teaching methods tend
to directly assess the progress on individual training samples without paying
attention to the underlying learning concepts in a learning task. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, called Knowledge Augmented Data Teaching
(KADT), which can optimize a data teaching strategy for a student model by
tracing its knowledge progress over multiple learning concepts in a learning
task. Specifically, the KADT method incorporates a knowledge tracing model to
dynamically capture the knowledge progress of a student model in terms of
latent learning concepts. Then we develop an attention pooling mechanism to
distill knowledge representations of a student model with respect to class
labels, which enables to develop a data teaching strategy on critical training
samples. We have evaluated the performance of the KADT method on four different
machine learning tasks including knowledge tracing, sentiment analysis, movie
recommendation, and image classification. The results comparing to the

  for Quantum Circuits",,,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum computing is one of the most promising technology advances of the
latest years. Once only a conceptual idea to solve physics simulations, quantum
computation is today a reality, with numerous machines able to execute quantum
algorithms. One of the hardest challenges in quantum computing is reliability.
Qubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless.
Moreover, lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely
susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When
adopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a
serious challenge for qubits reliability. In this paper, we propose an
evaluation of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum
circuits. Inspired by the Architectural and Program Vulnerability Factors,
widely adopted to characterize the reliability of classical computing
architectures and algorithms, we propose the Quantum Vulnerability Factor (QVF)
as a metric to measure the impact that the corruption of a qubit has on the
circuit output probability distribution. First, we model faults based on the
latest studies on real machines and recently performed radiation experiments.
Then, we design a quantum fault injector, built over Qiskit, and characterize
the propagation of faults in quantum circuits. We report the finding of more
than 15,000,000 fault injections, evaluating the reliability of three quantum
circuits and identifying the faults and qubits that are more likely than others
to impact the output. With our results, we give guidelines on how to map the
qubits in the real quantum computer to reduce the output error and to reduce
the probability of having a radiation-induced corruption to modify the output.
Finally, we compare the simulation results with experiments on physical quantum
computers.

double state and the operator purity of the analytically continued
time-evolution operator. At infinite-temperature, it reduces to one minus the
operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator. In the zero-temperature
limit and for nondegenerate Hamiltonians, the BROTOC probes the groundstate
entanglement. By computing long-time averages, we show that the equilibration

the information of the system is carried directly by the functional form and
adjustable parameters of the LFWFs. In this work, we model the LFWFs for four
charmonium states, $\eta_c$, $J/\psi$, $\psi'$, and $\psi(3770)$ as
superpositions of orthonormal basis functions. We choose the basis functions as
eigenfunctions of an effective Hamiltonian, which has a longitudinal confining
potential in addition to the transverse confining potential from light-front
holographic QCD. We determine the basis function parameters and superposition
coefficients by employing both guidance from the nonrelativistic description of
the meson states and the experimental measurements of the meson decay widths.
With the obtained wavefunctions, we study the features of those meson states,
including charge radii and parton distribution functions. We use the $J/\psi$
LFWF to calculate the meson production in diffractive deep inelastic scattering

increasingly challenging. To combat these attacks, security practitioners
actively summarize and exchange their knowledge about attacks across
organizations in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. However,
as CTI reports written in natural language texts are not structured for
automatic analysis, the report usage requires tedious manual efforts of cyber
threat intelligence recovery. Additionally, individual reports typically cover
only a limited aspect of attack patterns (techniques) and thus are insufficient
to provide a comprehensive view of attacks with multiple variants. To take
advantage of threat intelligence delivered by CTI reports, we propose AttacKG
to automatically extract structured attack behavior graphs from CTI reports and
identify the adopted attack techniques. We then aggregate cyber threat
intelligence across reports to collect different aspects of techniques and
enhance attack behavior graphs into technique knowledge graphs (TKGs). In our
evaluation against 1,515 real-world CTI reports from diverse intelligence
sources, AttacKG effectively identifies 28,262 attack techniques with 8,393
unique Indicators of Compromises (IoCs). To further verify the accuracy of
AttacKG in extracting threat intelligence, we run AttacKG on 16 manually
labeled CTI reports. Empirical results show that AttacKG accurately identifies
attack-relevant entities, dependencies, and techniques with F1-scores of 0.887,
0.896, and 0.789, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches Extractor

benefit downstream security tasks that rely on technique specifications, e.g.,

machine. In this paper, a system for speech emotion recognition (SER) based on
speech signal is proposed, which uses new techniques in different stages of
processing. The system consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature
selection, and finally feature classification. In the first stage, a complex
set of long-term statistics features is extracted from both the speech signal
and the glottal-waveform signal using a combination of new and diverse features
such as prosodic, spectral, and spectro-temporal features. One of the
challenges of the SER systems is to distinguish correlated emotions. These
features are good discriminators for speech emotions and increase the SER's
ability to recognize similar and different emotions. This feature vector with a
large number of dimensions naturally has redundancy. In the second stage, using
classical feature selection techniques as well as a new quantum-inspired
technique to reduce the feature vector dimensionality, the number of feature
vector dimensions is reduced. In the third stage, the optimized feature vector
is classified by a weighted deep sparse extreme learning machine (ELM)
classifier. The classifier performs classification in three steps: sparse
random feature learning, orthogonal random projection using the singular value
decomposition (SVD) technique, and discriminative classification in the last
step using the generalized Tikhonov regularization technique. Also, many
existing emotional datasets suffer from the problem of data imbalanced
distribution, which in turn increases the classification error and decreases
system performance. In this paper, a new weighting method has also been
proposed to deal with class imbalance, which is more efficient than existing
weighting methods. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard emotional
databases.

for the notion of single-port chargers (SPCs), where a charger can interface
one EV maximum, and multi-port chargers (MPCs), where the same charger can
interface multiple EVs. The advantage of MPCs is twofold. First, multiple ports
allow arbitraging the charging among multiple vehicles without requiring the
drivers to plug and unplug EVs. Second, the charger's power electronics is not
sized for the total number of charging ports, enabling cost savings when the
grid constraints are bottleneck of the problem. The proposed method can account

Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) and the $K = 0$ component of the
Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance (ISGQR), which results in a double peak
structure of the isoscalar monopole (IS0) strength (a narrow low-energy
deformation-induced peak and a main broad ISGMR part). The energy of the narrow
low-lying IS0 peak is sensitive to both the incompressibility modulus
$K_\infty$ and the coupling between IS0 and isoscalar quadrupole (IS2)
strength.
  Objective: This study aims to investigate the two-peaked structure of the
ISGMR in the prolate $^{24}$Mg and oblate $^{28}$Si nuclei and identify among a
variety of energy density functionals based on Skyrme parameterisations the one
which best describes the experimental data. This will allow for conclusions
regarding the nuclear incompressibility. Because of the strong IS0/IS2
coupling, the deformation splitting of the ISGQR will also be analysed.
  Methods: The ISGMR was excited in $^{24}$Mg and $^{28}$Si using
$\alpha$-particle inelastic scattering measurements acquired with an $E_\alpha
= 196$ MeV beam at scattering angles $\theta_{\text{Lab}} = 0^\circ$ and
$4^\circ$. The K$600$ magnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS was used to detect
and momentum analyse the inelastically scattered $\alpha$ particles. An
experimental energy resolution of $\approx 70$ keV (FWHM) was attained,
revealing fine structure in the excitation-energy region of the ISGMR. The IS0
strength distributions in the nuclei studied were obtained with the
Difference-of-Spectrum (DoS) technique. The theoretical comparison is based on
the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with a representative set
of Skyrme forces.

structures in some materials with special structure and localized orbital
distribution. In this work, taking Janus monolayer FeClF as a concrete example,
the correlation effects on its electronic structures are investigated by using
generalized gradient approximation plus $U$ (GGA+$U$) approach. For
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the increasing electron correlation
effect can induce the ferrovalley (FV) to half-valley-metal (HVM) to quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) to HVM to FV transitions. For QAH state, there are a unit
Chern number and a chiral edge state connecting the conduction and valence
bands. The HVM state is at the boundary of the QAH phase, whose carriers are
intrinsically 100\% valley polarized. With the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, no
special QAH states and prominent valley polarization are observed. However, for
both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, sign-reversible Berry
curvature can be observed with increasing $U$. It is found that these
phenomenons are related with the change of $d_{xy}$/$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$
orbital distributions and different magnetocrystalline directions. It is also
found that the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and Curie temperature strongly
depend on the $U$. With PMA, taking typical $U=$2.5 eV, the electron valley
polarization can be observed with valley splitting of 109 meV, which can be
switched by reversing the magnetization direction. The analysis and results can
be readily extended to other nine members of monolayer FeXY (X/Y=F, Cl, Br and
I) due to sharing the same Fe-dominated low-energy states and electronic
correlations with FeClF monolayer.

challenges in designing neural networks based on synaptic devices. This paper
presents a novel weight update method named conditional reverse update scheme
(CRUS) for hardware neural network (HNN) consisting of synaptic devices with
highly nonlinear or abrupt conductance update characteristics. We formulate a
linear optimization method of conductance in synaptic devices to reduce the
average deviation of weight changes from those calculated by the Stochastic
Gradient Rule (SGD) algorithm. We introduce a metric called update noise (UN)
to analyze the training dynamics during training. We then design a weight
update rule that reduces the UN averaged over the training process. The
optimized network achieves >90% accuracy on the MNIST dataset under highly
nonlinear long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)
conditions while using inaccurate and infrequent conductance sensing.
Furthermore, the proposed method shows better accuracy than previously reported
nonlinear weight update mitigation techniques under the same hardware
specifications and device conditions. It also exhibits robustness to temporal
variations in conductance updates. We expect our scheme to relieve design
requirements in device and circuit engineering and serve as a practical
technique that can be applied to future HNNs.

streamlines) in a simply connected domain, Prandtl (1905) and Batchelor (1956)
found that in the limit of vanishing viscosity, the vorticity is constant in an
inner region separated from the boundary layer. In this paper, we consider the
generalized Prandtl-Batchelor theory on an annulus that is
non-simply-connected. First, we observe that in the vanishing viscosity if
steady Navier-Stokes solutions with nested closed streamlines on an annulus
converge to steady Euler flows which are rotating shear flows, then the
vorticity of Euler flows must be $a\ln r+b$ and the associated velocity must be
$(ar+\frac{b}{r}+cr\ln r,0)$ in polar coordinates. We call solutions of steady
Navier-Stokes equations with the above property Prandtl-Batchelor flows. Then,
by constructing higher order approximate solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations and establishing the validity of Prandtl boundary layer expansion, we
give a rigorous proof of the existence of Prandtl-Batchelor flows on an annulus
with the wall velocity slightly different from the rigid-rotation. In
particular, for the above boundary conditions, we prove that there is a
continuous curve (i.e. infinitely many) of solutions to the steady
Navier-Stokes equations when the viscosity is sufficiently small.

from multiple observations of a scene. As a result, these ""single-view"" methods
form their representations of a 3D scene based only on a single 2D observation
(view). Naturally, this leads to several inaccuracies, with these methods
falling victim to single-view spatial ambiguities. To address this, we propose
The Multi-View and Multi-Object Network (MulMON) -- a method for learning
accurate, object-centric representations of multi-object scenes by leveraging
multiple views. In order to sidestep the main technical difficulty of the
multi-object-multi-view scenario -- maintaining object correspondences across
views -- MulMON iteratively updates the latent object representations for a
scene over multiple views. To ensure that these iterative updates do indeed
aggregate spatial information to form a complete 3D scene understanding, MulMON
is asked to predict the appearance of the scene from novel viewpoints during
training. Through experiments, we show that MulMON better-resolves spatial
ambiguities than single-view methods -- learning more accurate and disentangled
object representations -- and also achieves new functionality in predicting
object segmentations for novel viewpoints.

carefully designed FeCo/TbCo2/FeCo anisotropic heterostructure, we
experimentally demonstrate Stoner-Wohlfarth-like coherent rotation of the THz

strength of the hard axis field, and with only a negligible decrease in the
emission efficiency as compared to standard Pt/CoFeB/W inverse spin Hall

been focused on mass action, and not that much on power law kinetic (PLK)
systems, even for PL-RDK systems (PLK systems where two reactions with
identical reactant complexes have the same kinetic order vectors). For mass
action, reactions with different reactants have different kinetic order rows. A
PL-RDK system satisfying this property is called factor span surjective
(PL-FSK). In this work, we show that a cycle terminal PL-FSK system with
$E_+\ne \varnothing$ and has independent linkage classes (ILC) is a poly-PLP
system, i.e., $E_+$ is the disjoint union of log-parametrized sets. The key
insight for the extension is that factor span surjectivity induces an
isomorphic digraph structure on the kinetic complexes. The result also
completes, for ILC networks, the structural analysis of the original complex
balanced generalized mass action systems (GMAS) by M\""uller and Regensburger.
We also identify a large set of PL-RDK systems where non-emptiness of $E_+$ is
a necessary and sufficient condition for non-emptiness of each set of positive
equilibria for each linkage class. These results extend those of Boros on mass
action systems with ILC. We conclude this paper with two applications of our
results. Firstly, we consider absolute complex balancing (ACB), i.e., the
property that each positive equilibrium is complex balanced, in poly-PLP
systems. Finally, we use the new results to study absolute concentration

system with unconventional superconducting properties. A conventional
superconductor is a perfect diamagnet expelling magnetic fields out of its
volume, a phenomenon known as Meissner effect. Here, we show that the simple
adsorption of a monolayer of chiral molecules, which are non-magnetic in
solution, onto the surface of a conventional superconductor can markedly change
its diamagnetic Meissner response. By measuring the internal magnetic field
profile in superconducting Nb thin films under an applied transverse field by
low-energy muon spin rotation spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the local field
profile inside Nb is considerably modified upon molecular adsorption in a way
that also depends on the applied field direction. The modification is not
limited to the chiral molecules/Nb interface, but it is long ranged and occurs
over a length scale comparable to the superconducting coherence length.
Zero-field muon spin spectroscopy measurements in combination with our
theoretical analysis show that odd-frequency spin-triplet states induced by the
chiral molecules are responsible for the modification of the Meissner response
observed inside Nb. These results indicate that a chiral
molecules/superconductor system supports odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs due
to the molecules acting as a spin active layer and therefore they imply that
such system can be used as a simpler alternative to superconductor/ferromagnet
or superconductor/topological insulator hybrids for the generation and
manipulation of unconventional spin-triplet superconducting states.

power, Bayesian edge intelligence. Deep neural networks (DNN) with
deterministic weights cannot express their prediction uncertainties, thereby
pose critical risks for applications where the consequences of mispredictions
are fatal such as surgical robotics. To address this limitation, Bayesian
inference of a DNN has gained attention. Using Bayesian inference, not only the
prediction itself, but the prediction confidence can also be extracted for
planning risk-aware actions. However, Bayesian inference of a DNN is
computationally expensive, ill-suited for real-time and/or edge deployment. An
approximation to Bayesian DNN using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) has shown
high robustness along with low computational complexity. Enhancing the
computational efficiency of the method, we discuss a novel CIM module that can
perform in-memory probabilistic dropout in addition to in-memory weight-input
scalar product to support the method. We also propose a compute-reuse
reformulation of MC-Dropout where each successive instance can utilize the
product-sum computations from the previous iteration. Even more, we discuss how
the random instances can be optimally ordered to minimize the overall
MC-Dropout workload by exploiting combinatorial optimization methods.
Application of the proposed CIM-based MC-Dropout execution is discussed for
MNIST character recognition and visual odometry (VO) of autonomous drones. The
framework reliably gives prediction confidence amidst non-idealities imposed by
MC-CIM to a good extent. Proposed MC-CIM with 16x31 SRAM array, 0.85 V supply,

Accurate detection of table cells (including empty cells) simplifies structure

captive jump process while the process may jump within the restricted domain.
In a further development, we also show how - within a confined domain - inner
time-dependent corridors can be introduced, which a captive jump process may
leave only if the jumps reach far enough, while nonetheless being unable to
ever penetrate the outer confining shell. Captive jump processes generalize the
recently developed captive diffusion processes. In the case where a captive
jump-diffusion is a continuous martingale or a pure-jump process, the uppermost
confining boundary is non-decreasing, and the lowermost confining boundary is
non-increasing. Captive jump processes could be considered to model phenomena

Moreover, we also observe that -- depending on the level of damping -- these
structures can produce driven linear, rotational, or vibrational motion. These
effects are a result of the non-conservative and non-pairwise nature of the
acoustic binding force, and represent novel contactless manipulation and
transport methods with potential application to metamaterial synthesis and drug
delivery.

To detect and treat heart-related diseases, continuous Blood Pressure (BP)
monitoring along with many other parameters are required. Several invasive and
non-invasive methods have been developed for this purpose. Most existing
methods used in the hospitals for continuous monitoring of BP are invasive. On
the contrary, cuff-based BP monitoring methods, which can predict Systolic
Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), cannot be used for
continuous monitoring. Several studies attempted to predict BP from
non-invasively collectible signals such as Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and
Electrocardiogram (ECG), which can be used for continuous monitoring. In this
study, we explored the applicability of autoencoders in predicting BP from PPG
and ECG signals. The investigation was carried out on 12,000 instances of 942
patients of the MIMIC-II dataset and it was found that a very shallow,
one-dimensional autoencoder can extract the relevant features to predict the
SBP and DBP with the state-of-the-art performance on a very large dataset.
Independent test set from a portion of the MIMIC-II dataset provides an MAE of
2.333 and 0.713 for SBP and DBP, respectively. On an external dataset of forty
subjects, the model trained on the MIMIC-II dataset, provides an MAE of 2.728
and 1.166 for SBP and DBP, respectively. For both the cases, the results met
British Hypertension Society (BHS) Grade A and surpassed the studies from the
current literature.

several advanced features that enable the discovery of more general
differential equations from noisy and limited data. The library of candidate
terms is extended for the identification of actuated systems, partial

formulations, including the integral form of SINDy and ensembling techniques,
are also implemented to improve performance for real-world data. Finally, we
provide a range of new optimization algorithms, including several sparse
regression techniques and algorithms to enforce and promote inequality
constraints and stability. Together, these updates enable entirely new SINDy
model discovery capabilities that have not been reported in the literature,
such as constrained PDE identification and ensembling with different sparse

allow repetition of elements, with the number of times each element appears
being understood as the respective multiplicity. Recent generalizations of
multisets to real-valued functions, accounting for possibly negative values,
have paved the way to a number of interesting implications and applications,
including respective implementations as electronic systems. The basic multiset
operations include the set complementation (sign change), intersection (minimum
between two values), union (maximum between two values), difference and sum
(identical to the algebraic counterparts). When applied to functions or
signals, the sign and conjoint sign functions are also required. Given that
signals are functions, it becomes possible to effectively translate the
multiset and multifunction operations to analog electronics, which is the
objective of the present work. It is proposed that effective multiset
operations capable of high performance self and cross-correlation can be
obtained with relative simplicity in either discrete or integrated circuits.
The problem of switching noise is also briefly discussed. The present results

healthcare professionals - only one in four people who suffer from dementia are

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code in a patient's
charts. Information relevant to cognitive impairment (CI) is often found within
electronic health records (EHR), but manual review of clinician notes by
experts is both time consuming and often prone to errors. Automated mining of
these notes presents an opportunity to label patients with cognitive impairment

fundamental sloshing profile, for the IFP is in the interior of the free
surface for large Bond numbers, but for sufficiently small Bond number the high
spot is on the boundary of the free surface. While several papers have proven
high spot results in the absence of surface tension as it depends on the shape
of the container, as far as we are aware, this is the first study investigating
the effects of surface tension on the location of the high spot.
