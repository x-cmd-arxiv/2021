contamination signal in plastic scintillating dosimeters. In this study, we
propose a novel approach designed to take advantage of this angular dependency
to perform a direct measurement of an external beam radiation angle of
incidence. A Cerenkov probe composed of a 10-mm long filtered sensitive volume
of clear PMMA optical fibre was built. Both filtered and raw Cerenkov signals
from the transport fibre were collected through a single 1-mm diameter
transport fibre. An independent PSD composed of 10-mm BCF12 scintillating fibre
was also used for simultaneous dose measurements. A first series of
measurements aimed at validating the ability to account for the Cerenkov
electron energy spectrum dependency by simultaneously measuring the deposited
dose. A cylindrical phantom was then used to obtain an angular calibration
curve for fixed dose irradiations and perform incident angle measurements using
electron and photon beams. The beam nominal energy was found to have a
significant impact on the shapes of the angular calibration curves obtained for
irradiation angle measurements. This can be linked to the electron energy
spectrum dependency of the Cerenkov emission cone. Irradiation angle
measurements exhibit an absolute mean error of 1.86{\deg} and 1.02{\deg} at 6
and 18 MV, respectively. Similar results were obtained with electron beams and
the absolute mean error reaches 1.97, 1.66, 1.45 and 0.95 degrees at 9, 12, 16
and 20 MeV, respectively. Reducing the numerical aperture of the Cerenkov probe
leads to an increased angular dependency for the lowest energy while no major
changes were observed at higher energy. This allowed irradiation angle
measurements at 6 MeV with a mean absolute error of 4.82{\deg}. The detector
offers promising perspectives for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy
applications.

recently proposed to encode non-negative scalar functions. We provide a
representer theorem for this class of PSD functions, show that it constitutes a
universal approximator of PSD functions, and derive eigenvalue bounds in the
case of subsampled equality constraints. We then apply our results to modeling
convex functions, by enforcing a kernel sum-of-squares representation of their
Hessian, and show that any smooth and strongly convex function may be thus
represented. Finally, we illustrate our methods on a PSD matrix-valued
regression task, and on scalar-valued convex regression.

mechanical procedures. To estimate entropic uncertainty relations, entropies
are used: the greater the entropy bound, the less effective the quantum
operations and entanglement are. In this regard, we analyze the entropic
uncertainty, entropic uncertainty lower bound, and concurrence dynamics in two
non-interacting qubits. The exposure of two qubits is studied in two different
qubit-noise configurations, namely, common qubit-noise and independent
qubit-noise interactions. To include the noisy effects of the local external
fields, a Gaussian Ornstein Uhlenbeck process is considered. We show that the
rise in entropic uncertainty gives rise to the disentanglement in the two-qubit
Werner type state and both are directly proportional. Depending on the
parameters adjustment and the number of environments coupled, different
classical environments have varying capacities to induce entropic uncertainty
and disentanglement in quantum systems. The entanglement is shown to be
vulnerable to current external fields; however, by employing the ideal
parameter ranges we provided, prolonged entanglement retention while preventing
entropic uncertainty growth can be achieved. Besides, we have also analyzed the
intrinsic behavior of the classical fields towards two-qubit entanglement
without any imperfection with respect to different parameters

examining the linear-algebraic and representation-theoretic structure of

linear transformations between such homomorphism tensor subspaces can be
interpreted both as homomorphism indistinguishability over a graph class and as

deriving the E-step. What we propose in this paper, is that this derivation is
commonly unnecessary: many existing click models can in fact, under certain
assumptions, be optimized as they were Input-Output Hidden Markov Models
(IO-HMMs), for which the forward-backward equations immediately provide this
E-step. To arrive at that conclusion, we will present the Generalized Cascade

of our $n$ vertices with an independently and uniformly sampled vector from the
$d$-dimensional unit sphere, and we connect pairs of vertices whose vectors are
``sufficiently close'', such that the marginal probability of an edge is $p$.
  We investigate the problem of testing for this latent geometry, or in other
words, distinguishing an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $\mathsf{G}(n, p)$ from a
random geometric graph $\mathsf{Geo}_d(n, p)$. It is not too difficult to show
that if $d\to \infty$ while $n$ is held fixed, the two distributions become
indistinguishable; we wish to understand how fast $d$ must grow as a function
of $n$ for indistinguishability to occur.
  When $p = \frac{\alpha}{n}$ for constant $\alpha$, we prove that if $d \ge
\mathrm{polylog} n$, the total variation distance between the two distributions
is close to $0$; this improves upon the best previous bound of Brennan,
Bresler, and Nagaraj (2020), which required $d \gg n^{3/2}$, and further our
result is nearly tight, resolving a conjecture of Bubeck, Ding, Eldan, \&
R\'{a}cz (2016) up to logarithmic factors. We also obtain improved upper bounds
on the statistical indistinguishability thresholds in $d$ for the full range of
$p$ satisfying $\frac{1}{n}\le p\le \frac{1}{2}$, improving upon the previous
bounds by polynomial factors.
  Our analysis uses the Belief Propagation algorithm to characterize the
distributions of (subsets of) the random vectors {\em conditioned on producing
a particular graph}. In this sense, our analysis is connected to the ``cavity
method'' from statistical physics. To analyze this process, we rely on novel
sharp estimates for the area of the intersection of a random sphere cap with an
arbitrary subset of the sphere, which we prove using optimal transport maps and
entropy-transport inequalities on the unit sphere.

start by examining the existing vulnerabilities in the EV ecosystem that can be
exploited to control the EV charging and launch attacks against the power grid.
We then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate
multiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs.
EV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the
grid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids
and demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing
traditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely
destabilize the system. Finally, we suggest several patches for the existing

this observation, cryogenic bulk thermal conductivity measurements, and
analysis using an anisotropic Debye model, we conclude that longitudinal atomic

carriers and that the high thermal conductivity for draw ratio $\gtrsim 150$
arises from the enlargement of extended crystals with drawing. The mean free
paths appear to remain limited by the extended crystal dimensions, suggesting

resolutions, at $z=0$ we find that even for halos resolved by 100 particles,
the lower resolution simulation predicts a cumulative halo abundance that is 5
per cent lower than in the higher resolution simulation. We propose a simple
weighting scheme to utilise the halos that are usually regarded as being
`sub-resolution'. With the scheme, we are able to use halos which contain only
11 particles to reproduce the clustering measured in the higher resolution
simulation to within 5 per cent on scales down to $2 h^{-1}$ Mpc, thereby
extending the useful halo resolution by a factor of ten below the mass at which
the mass functions in the two simulations first start to deviate. The
performance of the method is slightly worse at higher redshift. Our method
allows a simulation to be used to probe a wider parameter space in clustering
studies, for example, in a halo occupation distribution analysis. This reduces
the cost of generating many simulations to estimate the covariance matrix on
measurements or using a larger volume simulation to make large-scale clustering
predictions.

voltages between 1V and 1000V, frequencies between 100Hz and 2MHz and
temperatures of -20{\deg}C and -30{\deg}C. The position dependence of the
electric field is parameterised by a linear dependence at the two sides of the
diode, and a constant in the centre. The parameters as a function of voltage,
temperature and irradiation fluence are determined by fits of the model to the
data. For voltages below about 300V all data are well described by the model,
and the results for the electric field agrees with expectations: Depleted
high-field regions towards the two faces and a constant low electric field in
the centre, with values which agrees with the field in an ohmic resistor with
approximately the intrinsic resistivity of silicon. For conditions at which the
low field region disappears and the diode is fully depleted, the method fails.
This happens around 300V for the lowest irradiation fluence at -30{\deg}C, and
at higher voltages for higher fluences and lower temperatures. In the
conclusions the successes and problems of the method are discussed.

been observed by several telescopes over the years, in different orbital
phases. Back in 1999, observations performed with Beppo-SAX lead to the
detection of a cyclotron-resonant-scattering feature, which has not been found
again with any other instrument. A recent NuSTAR X-ray observation, performed
during the brightest phase of the source, allows us to perform sensitive
searches for cyclotron-resonant-scattering features in the hard X-ray spectrum
of the source. We aim to characterise the source by means of temporal and
spectral X-ray analysis, and to confidently search for the presence of
cyclotron-resonant-scattering features. The observation was divided into four
time intervals in order to characterise each one. Several timing analysis tools
were used to obtain the pulse of the neutron star, and the light curves folded
into the time intervals. The NuSTAR spectrum in the energy range 3-79 keV was
used, which was modelled with a power-law continuum emission model with a
high-energy cutoff. We find the pulsations associated with the source in the
full observation, which are shifted due to the orbital Doppler effect. We show
evidence that a cyclotron line at $35.6 \pm 2.5$ keV is present in the
spectrum. We use this energy to estimate the dipolar magnetic field at the
pulsar surface to be $4.0\pm 0.2\,\times\,10^{12}$ G. We further estimate a
lower limit in the distance to OAO 1657-415 of $\simeq 1$ kpc. And we also find
a possible positive correlation between the luminosity and the energy
associated with the cyclotron line. We conclude that the cyclotron line at
$35.6\pm2.5$ keV is the same as that detected by Beppo-SAX. Our detection has a
significance of $\sim$ 3.4$\sigma$.

forgetting the previous tasks. A recent trend indicates that dynamic
architectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic

often require a task identifier at test-time, need complex tuning to balance
the growing number of parameters, and barely share any information across
tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks without
significant overhead. In this paper, we propose a transformer architecture
based on a dedicated encoder/decoder framework. Critically, the encoder and
decoder are shared among all tasks. Through a dynamic expansion of special
tokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task
distribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having
negligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters
expansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy doesn't need any hyperparameter
tuning to control the network's expansion. Our model reaches excellent results
on CIFAR100 and state-of-the-art performances on the large-scale ImageNet100

frameworks.

Boltzmann formulation, as a first step towards formulating a quantum lattice
Boltzmann algorithm. Specifically, we deal with the case of a single,
incompressible fluid with the Bhatnagar Gross and Krook equilibrium function.
Under this assumption, the error in the velocities is proportional to the
square of the Mach number. Then, we showcase the Carlemann linearization
technique for the system under study. We compute an upper bound to the number
of variables as a function of the order of the Carlemann linearization. We
study both collision and streaming steps of the lattice Boltzmann formulation
under Carlemann linearization. We analytically show why linearizing the
collision step sacrifices the exactness of streaming in lattice Boltzmann,
while also contributing to the blow up in the number of Carlemann variables in
the classical algorithm. The error arising from Carlemann linearization has
been shown analytically and numerically to improve exponentially with the
Carlemann linearization order. This bodes well for the development of a
corresponding quantum computing algorithm based on the Lattice Boltzmann

statistical inference and machine learning. In many applications, distributions
of interest are supported on different spaces, and yet a meaningful
correspondence between data points is desired. Motivated to explicitly encode
consistent bidirectional maps into the discrepancy measure, this work proposes
a novel unbalanced Monge optimal transport formulation for matching, up to
isometries, distributions on different spaces. Our formulation arises as a
principled relaxation of the Gromov-Haussdroff distance between metric spaces,
and employs two cycle-consistent maps that push forward each distribution onto
the other. We study structural properties of the proposed discrepancy and, in
particular, show that it captures the popular cycle-consistent generative
adversarial network (GAN) framework as a special case, thereby providing the
theory to explain it. Motivated by computational efficiency, we then kernelize
the discrepancy and restrict the mappings to parametric function classes. The
resulting kernelized version is coined the generalized maximum mean discrepancy
(GMMD). Convergence rates for empirical estimation of GMMD are studied and
experiments to support our theory are provided.

(SD) or nucleation-growth (NG)) remains a largely unexplored area of research
in spite of its importance. The present work examines this critically in Fe-Cr
system using atom probe tomography (APT) and small angle neutron scattering
(SANS), and establishes the framework to distinguish the two different modes of
alpha-prime phase separation in thermally aged Fe-35 at.% Cr and Fe-20 at.% Cr
alloys. Independent APT analysis determines the mode of phase separation on the
basis of: (i) presence / absence of periodic chemical fluctuation through
radial distribution function analysis; and (ii) inter-phase interface
characteristics (diffuse / sharp). SANS analysis, in contrast, yields virtually
indistinguishable correlation peaks for both the modes, which necessitates
further investigation of the several different aspects of SANS profiles in the
light of APT results. For the first time, key features of SANS profiles have
been identified that can unambiguously distinguish SD from NG in Fe-Cr system:
(i) nature of temporal evolution of FWHM of the correlation peak; and (ii)
appropriate value of 'gamma' for fitting with the dynamic scaling model
('gamma'= 6 for SD, Fe-35 at.% Cr alloy; 'gamma'= 4 for NG, Fe-20 at.% Cr
alloy).

twisted bi-layer graphene (MATBG) has provided a unique platform to study
strongly correlated phe-nomena including superconductivity, correlated
insulators, Chern insulators and magnetism. A fundamental feature of the MATBG,
so far unexplored, is its high magnetic field Hof-stadter spectrum. Here we
report on a detailed magneto-transport study of a MATBG de-vice in external
magnetic fields of up to B = 31 T, corresponding to one magnetic flux quan-tum
per moir\'e unit cell {\Phi}0. At {\Phi}0, we observe a re-entrant correlated
insulator at a flat band filling factor of {\nu} = +2, and interaction-driven
Fermi surface reconstructions at other fillings, which are identified by new
sets of Landau levels originating from these. These ex-perimental observations
are supplemented by theoretical work that predicts a new set of 8 well-isolated
flat bands at {\Phi}0 , of comparable band width but with different topology
than in zero field. Overall, our magneto-transport data reveals a qualitatively
new Hofstadter spec-trum in MATBG, which arises due to the strong electronic
correlations in the re-entrant flat bands.

the emergence of effective massive gravitons, induced by the net quadrupole

have restrictive rules around data sharing. Federated learning is a distributed
learning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on
decentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data
privacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for
decentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated
learning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model,
and a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's
privacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants
without the need of a centralized server. The proposed method eliminates a
significant limitation of canonical federated learning by allowing model
heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with any architecture.
Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to stronger privacy
guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on popular image
datasets, and a cancer diagnostic problem using high-quality gigapixel
histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can outperform existing
alternatives with much less communication overhead and stronger privacy.

data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between
observations. However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation
times are irregular and can carry important information. To address this
challenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural
architecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between
observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a
linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an
encoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived
using the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The
resulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states
and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We
derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast
implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging
datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than
methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.

introducing randomness through a suitable waiting time distribution, the
Weibull distribution, allows to significantly extend the parameter range for
which an advantage over the thermal Fisher information is attained. These
results are explicitly demonstrated for dephasing interactions and also hold
for partial swap interactions. Furthermore, we show that the optimal
measurements can be performed locally, thus implying that genuine quantum
correlations do not play a role in achieving this advantage. We explicitly
confirm this by examining the correlation properties for the deterministic
collisional model.

role in a rich array of unusual optical phenomena and non-Hermitian band
theory. In this paper, we provide a topological classification of isolated EPs
based on homotopy theory. In particular, the classification indicates that an
$n$-th order EP in two dimensions is fully characterized by the braid group
B$_n$, with its eigenenergies tied up into a geometric knot along a closed path
enclosing the EP. The quantized discriminant invariant of the EP is the writhe
of the knot. The knot crossing number gives the number of bulk Fermi arcs
emanating from each EP. Furthermore, we put forward a non-Hermitian no-go
theorem, which governs the possible configurations of EPs and their splitting
rules on a two-dimensional lattice and goes beyond the previous fermion
doubling theorem. We present a simple algorithm generating the non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian with a prescribed knot. Our framework constitutes a systematic
topological classification of the EPs and paves the way towards exploring the

forthcoming SKA Observatory (SKAO). This paper explores detection capability
for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) with a suite of \(100\) simulations
introducing the main limitations from foreground contamination and poor angular
resolution caused by the radio telescope beam. Such broad single-dish beam
representing a serious challenge for BAO detection with \hi\ intensity mapping,
we investigate a multipole expansion approach as a means for mitigating such
limitations. We also showcase the gains made from cross-correlating the \hi\
intensity mapping data with an overlapping spectroscopic galaxy survey, aiming
to test potential synergies between the SKA Project and other future
cosmological experiments at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. For our
${\sim}\,4\,000\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ data set at $z\,{=}\,0.9$, replicating the
essential features of an SKAO \hi\ intensity mapping survey, we were able to
achieve a ${\sim}\,4.5\sigma$ detection of BAO features in auto-correlation
despite the dominant beam effect. Cross-correlation with an overlapping galaxy
survey can increase this to a ${\sim}\,6\sigma$ detection. Furthermore,
including the power spectrum quadrupole besides the monopole in a joint fit can
approximately double the BAO detection significance. Despite not implementing a
radial-only $P(k_\parallel)$ analysis in favour of the three-dimensional
$P(\bm{k})$ and its multipoles, we were still able to obtain robust constraints
on the radial Alcock-Paczynski parameter, whereas the perpendicular parameter
remains unconstrained and prior dominated due to beam effects.

on the initial starting point and follows a Poisson process. The field gradient
elongates the DNA on its way towards the nanopore and favors a successful
translocation even after multiple failed threading attempts. Even in the limit
of an extremely narrow pore, a fully flexible chain has a finite probability of
hairpin-loop capture while this probability decreases for a stiffer chain and

contact (e.g., infectious disease, threatening ideas, etc.). We show how
diversity along just these two influences are sufficient to cause the emergence

which extrinsic social factors influence the desire to maintain particular
social ties, and show the robustness of emergent homophilic patterns to these
additional influences. These results demonstrate how observable
population-level homophily may arise out of individual behaviors that balance
the value of social contacts against the potential risks associated with those
contacts. We present and discuss these results in the context of outbreaks of
infectious disease in human populations. Complementing the standard narrative

computer vision and several related fields. Despite such progress, current
neural architectures still suffer from catastrophic interference (a.k.a.
forgetting) which obstructs DNNs to learn continually. While several
state-of-the-art methods have been proposed to mitigate forgetting, these
existing solutions are either highly rigid (as regularization) or time/memory
demanding (as replay). An intermediate class of methods, based on dynamic
networks, has been proposed in the literature and provides a reasonable balance
between task memorization and computational footprint. In this paper, we devise
a dynamic network architecture for continual learning based on a novel
forgetting-free neural block (FFNB). Training FFNB features on new tasks is
achieved using a novel procedure that constrains the underlying parameters in
the null-space of the previous tasks, while training classifier parameters
equates to Fisher discriminant analysis. The latter provides an effective
incremental process which is also optimal from a Bayesian perspective. The
trained features and classifiers are further enhanced using an incremental
""end-to-end"" fine-tuning. Extensive experiments, conducted on different
challenging classification problems, show the high effectiveness of the
proposed method.

real-time data is available to electric utilities and consumers. Such high

pricing (RTP), in which the wholesale market-clearing price is passed directly
to the consumer on an hour-by-hour basis. While rare, RTP exists in parts of
the United States and has been observed to reduce electric bills. Although
these reductions are largely incidental, RTP may represent an opportunity for
large-scale peak shaving, demand response, and economic efficiency when paired
with intelligent control systems. Algorithms controlling flexible loads and
energy storage have been deployed for demand response elsewhere in the
literature, but few studies have investigated these algorithms in an RTP
environment. If properly optimized, the dynamic between RTP and intelligent

driven by growing penetration of distributed renewable generation and electric

application for optimal battery control subject to an RTP signal.

examples with small and quasi-imperceptible perturbations. Furthermore, the
adversarial examples created on one classification model can also fool another
different model. The transferability of the adversarial examples has recently
attracted a growing interest since it makes black-box attacks on classification
models feasible. As an extension of classification, semantic segmentation has
also received much attention towards its adversarial robustness. However, the
transferability of adversarial examples on segmentation models has not been
systematically studied. In this work, we intensively study this topic. First,
we explore the overfitting phenomenon of adversarial examples on classification
and segmentation models. In contrast to the observation made on classification
models that the transferability is limited by overfitting to the source model,
we find that the adversarial examples on segmentations do not always overfit
the source models. Even when no overfitting is presented, the transferability
of adversarial examples is limited. We attribute the limitation to the
architectural traits of segmentation models, i.e., multi-scale object
recognition. Then, we propose a simple and effective method, dubbed dynamic
scaling, to overcome the limitation. The high transferability achieved by our
method shows that, in contrast to the observations in previous work,
adversarial examples on a segmentation model can be easy to transfer to other
segmentation models. Our analysis and proposals are supported by extensive
experiments.

transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets for the metastable helium

HAT-P-11 b, and take into account the variation of the in-transit absorption
caused by transit geometry. For this planet, our best fit yields a total
atmospheric escape rate of approximately $2.5 \times 10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$ and
wind temperature of $7200$ K. The range of retrieved mass loss rates increases
significantly when we let the H atom fraction be a free parameter, but the
posterior distribution of the latter remains unconstrained by He observations
alone. The stellar host limb darkening does not have a significant impact in
the retrieved escape rate or outflow temperature for HAT-P-11 b. Based on the
non-detection of escaping He for GJ 436 b, we are able to rule out total escape
rates higher than $3.4 \times 10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$ at 99.7% (3$\sigma$)

two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations
from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of
signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions,
we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that
allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We
show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to
increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal
from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes
less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts
are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that
DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner
inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it
otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves
inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data
set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that
non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference
performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an
important role of phylogeny.

utilizing parameter estimations from prior studies. SA indicates that 1%
increase in within-host pathogen growth rate can lead up to 8% increase in R0;
up to 1% increase in steady-state infected host abundance, and up to 4%
increase in infectiousness of hosts when the reproduction number R0 is larger
than one. These significant increases in population-scale disease quantities
suggest that control strategies that reduce the within-host pathogen growth can
be important in reducing disease prevalence.

building block for every country to utilize solar power efficiently. Solar
rooftop potential assessment relies on several features such as building

approximations that do not take these factors into deep consideration are often
inaccurate. This paper introduces Lebanon's first comprehensive footprint and
solar rooftop potential maps using deep learning-based instance segmentation to
extract buildings' footprints from satellite images. A photovoltaic panels
placement algorithm that considers the morphology of each roof is proposed. We
show that the average rooftop's solar potential can fulfill the yearly electric
needs of a single-family residence while using only 5% of the roof surface. The
usage of 50% of a residential apartment rooftop area would achieve energy
security for up to 8 households. We also compute the average and total solar
rooftop potential per district to localize regions corresponding to the highest
and lowest solar rooftop potential yield. Factors such as size, ground coverage
ratio and PV_out are carefully investigated for each district. Baalbeck
district yielded the highest total solar rooftop potential despite its low
built-up area. While, Beirut capital city has the highest average solar rooftop
potential due to its extremely populated urban nature. Reported results and
analysis reveal solar rooftop potential urban patterns and provides
policymakers and key stakeholders with tangible insights. Lebanon's total solar
rooftop potential is about 28.1 TWh/year, two times larger than the national
energy consumption in 2019.

release events such as solar flares, geomagnetic substorms, and some
astrophysical jets. A characteristic feature of magnetic reconnection is the
production of fast reconnection outflow jets near the plasma Alfv\'{e}n speeds.
In eruptive solar flares, dark, finger-shaped plasma downflows moving toward
the flare arcade have been commonly regarded as the principal observational
evidence for such reconnection-driven outflows. However, they often show a
speed much slower than that expected in reconnection theories, challenging the
reconnection-driven energy release scenario in standard flare models. Here, we
present a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model of solar flares. By
comparing the model-predictions with the observed plasma downflow features, we
conclude that these dark downflows are self-organized structures formed in a
turbulent interface region below the flare termination shock where the outflows

from significant performance losses with increasing connections beyond linear

the diminishing energy gap during annealing. Furthermore, we investigate the

offers a rule-of-mixture type predictions of the lattice constants and

a preferential flow direction. A certain class of models is investigated where
the fluid is driven by peristaltic pumping and the nonlinear elements are ideal
valves that completely suppress backflow. This highly nonlinear system produces
discontinuous solutions that are difficult to study. As the density of valves
increases, the pressure and flow are well-approximated by a continuum of valves
which can be analytically treated. Interestingly, two different pumping
mechanisms emerge from this model. At low frequencies, diffusive transport
pushes open all but one valve, and the radius takes the shape of the imposed
force. At high frequencies, half of the valves open, and the flow is determined
by the advective transport induced by peristalsis. In either case, the induced
flow is linear in the amplitude of the peristaltic forces and is independent of
pumping direction. Despite the continuum approximation used, the physical valve
density is accounted for by modifying the resistance of the fluid
appropriately. The suppression of backflow causes a net benefit in adding
valves when the valve density is low, but once the density is high enough, the
dominant valve effect is to suppress the forward flow, suggesting there is an
optimum number of valves per wavelength.

belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their
competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in
Transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still
perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general
architecture of the Transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,
is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately
replace the attention module in Transformers with an embarrassingly simple
spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we
observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive
performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K,
PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned Vision
Transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with
35%/52% fewer parameters and 50%/62% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of
PoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of
""MetaFormer"", a general architecture abstracted from Transformers without
specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that
MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent
Transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more
future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the
token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a
starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available

efforts this year, the internet has become a dominant source of information
about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety and efficacy, and their availability. We
sought to evaluate whether trends in internet searches related to COVID-19
vaccination - as reflected by Google's Vaccine Search Insights (VSI) index -
could be used as a marker of population-level interest in receiving a
vaccination. We found that between January and August of 2021: 1) Google's
weekly VSI index was associated with the number of new vaccinations

earlier months was strongly correlated (up to r = 0.89) with vaccination rates
many months later. Given these results, we illustrate an approach by which data
on search interest may be combined with other available data to inform local
public health outreach and vaccination efforts. These results suggest that the
VSI index may be useful as a leading indicator of population-level interest in

arrive. These difficulties (e.g., architectural incompatibility, slow training,
high memory consumption, unknown training formulae, etc.) have prevented recent
studies from benchmarking detection transfer learning with standard ViT models.
In this paper, we present training techniques that overcome these challenges,
enabling the use of standard ViT models as the backbone of Mask R-CNN. These
tools facilitate the primary goal of our study: we compare five ViT
initializations, including recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning
methods, supervised initialization, and a strong random initialization
baseline. Our results show that recent masking-based unsupervised learning
methods may, for the first time, provide convincing transfer learning
improvements on COCO, increasing box AP up to 4% (absolute) over supervised and
prior self-supervised pre-training methods. Moreover, these masking-based
initializations scale better, with the improvement growing as model size
increases.

deconfinement can exist on the domain walls at the transition point. To verify
it, we study the spin excitation spectra by combining stochastic analytic
continuation and quantum Monte Carlo simulation. In both PVBS and SF phases, a
flat band with bow-tie structure is observed and can be explained by group
theoretic analysis. At the transition point, the spectra turn to be continuous
and gapless, which indicates the topological excitations. From the snapshot of
the spin configuration in real space, we found the existence of the domain wall
in which the symmetries satisfy the anomaly. Meanwhile, a Luttinger liquid like
continuum implies additional domain walls (point-defect) can emerge in the

of the ideal laboratories to test Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP):
the hypothetical time lag between photons with different energies under a
gravitational potential. If WEP is violated, such evidence should be exposed
within the observational uncertainties of dispersion measures, unless the WEP
violation also depends on the inverse-square of the observed frequency. In this
work, we constrain the difference of gamma parameters ($\Delta\gamma$) between

work, we measure the effectiveness of changes in star formation rates by
analysing a new parameter, the Star Formation Acceleration (SFA), as a function
of galaxy morphology. This methodology is capable of identifying both bursting
and quenching episodes that occurred in the preceding 300 Myrs. We use
morphological classification catalogs based on Deep learning techniques. Our
final sample has $\sim$14,200 spirals and $\sim$2,500 ellipticals. We find that
elliptical galaxies in the transition region have median shorter quenching
timescales ( $\tau$ < 1 Gyr) than spirals ($\tau \geq 1$ Gyr). This result
conforms to the scenario in which major mergers and other violent processes
play a fundamental role in galaxy evolution for most ellipticals, not only
quenching star formation more rapidly but also playing a role in morphological
transformation. We also find that $\sim$two thirds of galaxies bursting in the
green valley in our sample are massive spirals ($M_\star \geq
10^{11.0}M_\odot$) with signs of disturbance. This is in accordance with the

superconductivity, while staggered rotations destroy interorbital
superconductivity, leaving a paramagnetic metal. The magnetic field then shifts
van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, allowing intraorbital SDW order to
form in the bilayer. Our theory predicts that bilayer Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ without
staggered rotations exhibits interorbital superconductivity with a possibly
higher transition temperature.

spectroscopic observations of such mission could also allow us to estimate the

measurement approach (AMA) often lead to a counter-intuitive capital estimate
of value at risk at 99.9% due to extreme loss events. To address this issue, a
flexible semi-nonparametric (SNP) model is introduced using the change of
variables technique to enrich the family of distributions to handle extreme
loss events. The SNP models are proved to have the same maximum domain of
attraction (MDA) as the parametric kernels, and it follows that the SNP models
are consistent with the extreme value theory peaks over threshold method but
with different shape and scale parameters from the kernels. By using the
simulation dataset generated from a mixture of distributions with both light
and heavy tails, the SNP models in the Frechet and Gumbel MDAs are shown to fit
the tail dataset satisfactorily through increasing the number of model
parameters. The SNP model quantile estimates at 99.9 percent are not overly
sensitive towards the body-tail threshold change, which is in sharp contrast to
the parametric models. When applied to a bank operational risk dataset with
three Basel event types, the SNP model provides a significant improvement in
the goodness of fit to the two event types with heavy tails, yielding an
intuitive capital estimate that is in the same magnitude as the event type
total loss. Since the third event type does not have a heavy tail, the
parametric model yields an intuitive capital estimate, and the SNP model cannot
provide additional improvement. This research suggests that the SNP model may
enable banks to continue with the AMA or its partial use to obtain an intuitive
operational risk capital estimate when the simple non-model based Basic
Indicator Approach or Standardized Approach are not suitable per Basel

is measured as the total number of bits transmitted globally in the network. In
this paper, we study a variation called local communication complexity in which
performance instead measures the maximum number of bits sent or received at any
one player. We focus on a simple model where $n$ players, each with one input
bit, execute a protocol by exchanging messages to compute a function on the $n$
input bits. We ask what can and cannot be solved with a small local
communication complexity in this setting. We begin by establishing a
non-trivial lower bound on the local complexity for a specific function by
proving that counting the number of $1$'s among the first $17$ input bits
distributed among the participants requires a local complexity strictly greater
than $1$. We further investigate whether harder counting problems of this type
can yield stronger lower bounds, providing a largely negative answer by showing
that constant local complexity is sufficient to count the number $1$ bits over
the entire input, and therefore compute any symmetric function. In addition to
counting, we show that both sorting and searching can be computed in constant
local complexity. We then use the counting solution as a subroutine to
demonstrate that constant local complexity is also sufficient to compute many
standard modular arithmetic operations on two operands, including: comparisons,
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Finally we
establish that function $GCD(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[1,n]$
has local complexity of $O(1)$. Our work highlights both new techniques for
proving lower bounds on this metric and the power of even a small amount of
local communication.

of the cosmic web. As galaxies are accreted they are affected by their local
environment before they enter (pre-processing), and traverse the cluster
potential. Observations that aim to constrain pre-processing are challenging to
interpret because filaments comprise a heterogeneous range of environments
including groups of galaxies embedded within them and backsplash galaxies that
contain a record of their previous passage through the cluster. This motivates
using modern cosmological simulations to dissect the population of galaxies
found in filaments that are feeding clusters, to better understand their
history, and aid the interpretation of observations. We use zoom-in simulations
from The ThreeHundred project to track halos through time and identify their
environment. We establish a benchmark for galaxies in cluster infall regions
that supports the reconstruction of the different modes of pre-processing. We
find that up to 45% of all galaxies fall into clusters via filaments (closer
than 1Mpc/h from the filament spine). 12% of these filament galaxies are
long-established members of groups and between 30 and 60% of filament galaxies
at R200 are backsplash galaxies. This number depends on the cluster's dynamical
state and sharply drops with distance. Backsplash galaxies return to clusters
after deflecting widely from their entry trajectory, especially in relaxed
clusters. They do not have a preferential location with respect to filaments
and cannot collapse to form filaments. The remaining pristine galaxies (30 -
60%) are environmentally effected by cosmic filaments alone.

higher resolution observations, in particular for the analysis of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Three cosmological results of the Planck mission are
presented next: the implications of the map of Comptonization fluctuations, the
dipole analysis from cross-correlating cosmic microwave background anisotropy
and Comptonization fluctuation maps, and the constraints on the primordial
tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio. Finally, we discuss some future
perspectives and alternative scenarios in cosmology, such as the study of the
Lorentz invariance violation with the cosmic microwave background polarization,
the introduction of new gravitational degrees of freedom to solve the dark
matter problem, and the exploitation of the magnification bias with
high-redshift sub-millimeter galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters.

doubles based on low-rank tensor hypercontraction (THC) factorizations of both
the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) and the doubles amplitudes. This
extends our rank-reduced coupled-cluster method to incorporate higher-order

for most of the gain in computational efficiency as it is sufficient, in
conjunction with a Cholesky decomposition of the ERIs, to reduce the
computational complexity of most contributions to the CCSD amplitude equations.
Further THC factorization of the ERIs reduces the complexity of certain terms
arising from nested commutators between the doubles excitation operator and the
two-electron operator. We implement this new algorithm using graphical

molecules with 250 atoms and 2500 basis functions using a single computer node.

exactly solvable example with a quantum spin liquid ground state. In a properly
oriented external magnetic field, chiral Majorana edge modes associated with a
quantized thermal Hall conductance emerge, and a distinct spin-disordered phase
appears at intermediate field strengths, below the polarized phase. However,
since material realizations of Kitaev magnetism invariably display competing
exchange interactions, the stability of these exotic phases with respect to
additional couplings is a key issue. Here, we report a 24-site exact
diagonalization study of the Heisenberg-Kitaev model in a magnetic field
applied in the [001] and [111] directions. By mapping the full phase diagram of
the model and contrasting the results to recent nonlinear spin-wave

quantum corrections substantially modify the classical phase diagram.

spin-disordered phase is remarkably stable to Heisenberg interactions and may
potentially end in a novel quantum tricritical point.

deployed on ""bare metal"" servers installed with operating systems. Recently,
the use of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server was
adopted due to cost reduction and flexibility. Nowadays, containers have become
popular for application deployment due to smaller footprints than the VMs,
their ability to start and stop more quickly, and their capability to pack the
application binaries and their dependencies in standalone units for seamless
portability. A typical container ecosystem includes a code repository (e.g.,
GitHub) where the container images are built from the codes and libraries and
then pushed to the image registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment
as application containers. However, the pervasive use of containers also leads
to a wide-range of security breaches, such as stealing credentials and
sensitive data from image registry and code repository, carrying out DoS
attacks, and gaining root access to the underlying host. In this paper, we
first perform threat modeling on the containers ecosystem using the popular
threat modeling framework, called STRIDE. Using STRIDE, we identify the
vulnerabilities in each system component, and investigate potential security
threats and their consequences. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the
existing countermeasures designed against the identified threats and
vulnerabilities. In particular, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
existing mitigation strategies designed against such threats. We believe that
this work will help researchers and practitioners to gain a deeper
understanding of the threat landscape in containers and the state-of-the-art
countermeasures. We also discuss open research problems and future research
directions in containers security, which may ignite further research to be done
in this area.

variational quantum simulations (VQS) is subject to two competing factors. On
one hand, the set of states that can be generated by the PQC has to be large
enough to contain the solution state. Otherwise, one may at best find the best
approximation of the solution restricted to the states generated by the chosen
PQC. On the other hand, the PQC should contain as few parametric quantum gates
as possible to minimize noise from the quantum device. Thus, when designing a
PQC one needs to ensure that there are no redundant parameters. The dimensional
expressivity analysis discussed in these proceedings is a means of addressing
these counteracting effects. Its main objective is to identify independent and
redundant parameters in the PQC. Using this information, superfluous parameters
can be removed and the dimension of the space of states that are generated by
the PQC can be computed. Knowing the dimension of the physical state space then
allows us to deduce whether or not the PQC can reach all physical states.
Furthermore, the dimensional expressivity analysis can be implemented
efficiently using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. This implementation has
relatively small overhead costs both for the classical and quantum part of the
algorithm and could therefore be used in the future for on-the-fly circuit
construction. This would allow for optimized circuits to be used in every loop
of a VQS rather than the same PQC for the entire VQS. These proceedings review

reconstructing liquids from image data. The challenges in reconstructing
liquids, which is not faced in previous reconstruction works on rigid and
deforming surfaces, lies in the inability to use depth sensing and color
features due the variable index of refraction, opacity, and environmental
reflections. Therefore, we limit ourselves to only surface detections (i.e.
binary mask) of liquids as observations and do not assume any prior knowledge
on the liquids properties. A novel optimization problem is posed which
reconstructs the liquid as particles by minimizing the error between a rendered
surface from the particles and the surface detections while satisfying liquid
constraints. Our solvers to this optimization problem are presented and no
training data is required to apply them. We also propose a dynamic prediction
to seed the reconstruction optimization from the previous time-step. We test
our proposed methods in simulation and on two new liquid datasets which we open
source so the broader research community can continue developing in this under
explored area.

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors. To collect the required data for the
model, Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) tool is used, which enables
us to measure participants' stress levels in a controlled environment. The
results suggested that the density of vehicles has a positive effect, meaning
as the density of vehicles increases, so does the stress level for pedestrians.
It was noted that younger pedestrians have a lower amount of stress when
crossing as compared to older pedestrians which have higher amounts of stress.
Geometric variables have an impact on the stress level of pedestrians. The
greater the number of lanes the greater the observed stress, which is due to
the crossing distance increasing, while the walking speed remains the same.

abstract model for nanorobots that can compute a very simple basis function
called B-function. It is mathematically shown here that a swarm of BAs has the
universal function approximation property and can accurately approximate
functions. It is then analytically demonstrated that a swarm of BAs can be
easily reprogrammed to compute desired functions simply by adjusting the
concentrations of BAs in the environment. We further propose a specific
structure for BAs which enable them to perform distributed computing such as in
the aqueous environment of living tissues and nanomedicine. The hardware

play in our understanding of both high-redshift galaxies and low metallicity

nebular gas emission, the massive stars that power it remain challenging to
constrain. Here we present exceptionally deep Hubble Space Telescope
ultraviolet spectra targeting six galaxies that power strong nebular C IV
emission approaching that encountered at $z>6$. We find that the strength and
spectral profile of the nebular C IV in these new spectra follow a sequence
evocative of resonant scattering models, indicating that the hot circumgalactic
medium likely plays a key role in regulating C IV escape locally. We constrain
the metallicity of the massive stars in each galaxy by fitting the forest of
photospheric absorption lines, reporting measurements driven by iron that lie
uniformly below 10% solar. Comparison with the gas-phase oxygen abundances
reveals evidence for enhancement in O/Fe above solar across the sample, robust
to assumptions about the absolute gas-phase metallicity scale. This supports
the idea that these local systems are more chemically-similar to their
primordial high-redshift counterparts than to the bulk of nearby galaxies.
Finally, we find significant tension between the strong stellar wind profiles
observed and our population synthesis models constrained by the photospheric
forest in our highest-quality spectra. This reinforces the need for caution in
interpreting wind lines in isolation at high-redshift, but also suggests a
unique path towards validating fundamental massive star physics at extremely
low metallicity with integrated ultraviolet spectra.

lines toward a Class I protostar, L1551 IRS 5, and its outflows. The SOFIA
observations detect [OI] emission toward only the protostar and [CII] emission
toward the protostar and the red-shifted outflow. The [OI] emission has a width
of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ only in the blue-shifted velocity, suggesting an
origin in shocked gas. The [CII] lines are narrow, consistent with an origin in
a photodissociation region. Differential dust extinction from the envelope due
to the inclination of the outflows is the most likely cause of the missing
red-shifted [OI] emission. Fitting the [OI] line profile with two Gaussian
components, we find one component at the source velocity with a width of
$\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$ and another extremely broad component at -30 km s$^{-1}$
with a width of 87.5 km s$^{-1}$, the latter of which has not been seen in
L1551 IRS 5. The kinematics of these two components resemble cavity shocks in
molecular outflows and spot shocks in jets. Radiative transfer calculations of
the [OI], high-J CO, and H$_2$O lines in the cavity shocks indicate that [OI]
dominates the oxygen budget, making up more than 70% of the total gaseous
oxygen abundance and suggesting [O]/[H] of $\sim$1.5$\times$10$^{-4}$.
Attributing the extremely broad [OI] component to atomic winds, we estimate the
intrinsic mass loss rate of (1.3$\pm$0.8)$\times$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. The intrinsic mass loss rates derived from low-J CO, [OI], and HI
are similar, supporting the model of momentum-conserving outflows, where the
atomic wind carries most momentum and drives the molecular outflows.

important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual
construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies
mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of
the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new
transport map, based on the F\""ollmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener
measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of
the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this
Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous
questions for optimal transport maps are open.
  The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove
functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or
improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction
results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which
lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the
Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits conjecture.
  We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on
the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal

networks (GNNs) also become a dominant approach to graph classification. By the
help of a global readout operation that simply aggregates all node (or
node-cluster) representations, existing GNN classifiers obtain a graph-level
representation of an input graph and predict its class label using the
representation. However, such global aggregation does not consider the
structural information of each node, which results in information loss on the
global structure. Particularly, it limits the discrimination power by enforcing
the same weight parameters of the classifier for all the node representations;
in practice, each of them contributes to target classes differently depending
on its structural semantic. In this work, we propose structural semantic
readout (SSRead) to summarize the node representations at the position-level,
which allows to model the position-specific weight parameters for
classification as well as to effectively capture the graph semantic relevant to
the global structure. Given an input graph, SSRead aims to identify
structurally-meaningful positions by using the semantic alignment between its
nodes and structural prototypes, which encode the prototypical features of each
position. The structural prototypes are optimized to minimize the alignment
cost for all training graphs, while the other GNN parameters are trained to
predict the class labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that SSRead
significantly improves the classification performance and interpretability of
GNN classifiers while being compatible with a variety of aggregation functions,

Transfer is then obtained by freezing the learned internal dynamics and value

retraining the encoder for transfer, we make several observations: (i) in some
cases, there are local minima that have small losses but a mismatching
embedding space, resulting in poor task performance and (ii) in the absence of
local minima, the output of the encoder converges in our experiments to the
same embedding space, which leads to a fast and efficient transfer as compared
to learning from scratch. The local minima are caused by the reduced degree of

posed by various foregrounds and systematics in the CMB and galaxy surveys, as
well as biases in the quadratic estimators. To do so, we further develop the
quadratic estimator formalism and implement a numerical code for computing
properly correlated spectra for all the components of the CMB
(primary/secondary blackbody components and foregrounds) and a photometric
redshift survey, with associated redshift errors, to allow for accurate
forecasting. We create a simulation framework for generating realizations of
properly correlated CMB maps and redshift binned galaxy number counts, assuming
the underlying fields are Gaussian, and use this to validate a velocity
reconstruction pipeline and assess map-based systematics such as masking. We
highlight the most significant challenges for velocity reconstruction, which
include biases associated with: modelling errors, characterization of redshift

due to stellar spots. We collected and detrended all the complete transit light
curves we had access to from these anomalies, which we modeled with EXOFAST and
measured the mid-transit times forming a homogeneous data set for a TTV
analysis. We found an increase in the orbital period of HAT-P-36 b at a rate of
0.014 s per year from the best fitting quadratic function, which is only found
in the TTV constructed by making use of the mid-transit times measured from
detrended light curves, against an expectation of an orbital decay based on its

Spectral Energy Distribution of the host star, its archival radial velocity
observations from multiple instruments, and most precise transit light curves
from the space and the ground covering a wide range of wavelengths with
EXOFASTV2. We also analyzed the out-of-transit variability from TESS

analysis. We report a statistically significant periodicity in the TESS light

perform privacy-preserving, federated data analytics. Various LDP protocols
have been developed for different types of data such as categorical data,
numerical data, and key-value data. Due to their distributed settings, LDP
protocols are fundamentally vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which fake
users manipulate the server's analytics results via sending carefully crafted
data to the server. However, existing poisoning attacks focused on LDP
protocols for simple data types such as categorical and numerical data, leaving
the security of LDP protocols for more advanced data types such as key-value
data unexplored.
  In this work, we aim to bridge the gap by introducing novel poisoning attacks
to LDP protocols for key-value data. In such a LDP protocol, a server aims to
simultaneously estimate the frequency and mean value of each key among some
users, each of whom possesses a set of key-value pairs. Our poisoning attacks
aim to simultaneously maximize the frequencies and mean values of some
attacker-chosen target keys via sending carefully crafted data from some fake

formulate them as a two-objective optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a
method to approximately solve the two-objective optimization problem, from
which we obtain the optimal crafted data the fake users should send to the
server. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks to three LDP protocols
for key-value data both theoretically and empirically. We also explore two
defenses against our attacks, which are effective in some scenarios but have
limited effectiveness in other scenarios. Our results highlight the needs for
new defenses against our poisoning attacks.

of greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, motivating global activities to
replace the coke-based blast furnace reduction by hydrogen-based direct
reduction (HyDR). Iron oxide reduction with hydrogen has been widely
investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The process includes
multiple types of chemical reactions, solid state and defect-mediated diffusion
(by oxygen and hydrogen species), several phase transformations, as well as
massive volume shrinkage and mechanical stress buildup. In this work, a
chemo-mechanically coupled phase-field (PF) model has been developed to explore
the interplay between phase transformation, chemical reaction, species
diffusion, large elasto-plastic deformation and microstructure evolution.
Energetic constitutive relations of the model are based on the system free
energy which is calibrated with the help of a thermodynamic database. The model
has been first applied to the classical core-shell (w\""ustite-iron) structure.
Simulations show that the phase transformation from w\""ustite to alpha-iron can
result in high stress and rapidly decelerating reaction kinetics. Mechanical
stresses can contribute elastic energy to the system, making phase
transformation difficult. Thus slow reaction kinetics and low metallization are
observed. However, if the stress becomes comparatively high, it can shift the
shape of the free energy from a double-well to a single-well case and speed up
the transformation. The model has been further applied to simulate an actual
iron oxide specimen with its complex microstructure, characterized by electron
microscopy. The simulation results show that isolated pores in the
microstructure are filled with water vapor during reduction, an effect which
influences the local reaction atmosphere and dynamics.

theory that incorporates a contribution from fluctuating active stresses. Apart

recent studies on Active Model B/B+. We point to the many unusual aspects of
the dynamics of active phase segregation, such as (i) anomalous growth
dynamics, (ii) coarsening accompanied by propulsion and coalescence of domains
that exhibit nonreciprocal effects, (iii) segregation into mesoscale domains,
(iv) emergence of a nonequilibrium phase segregated steady state characterised
by strong macroscopic fluctuations (fluctuation dominated phase ordering

advocated. But a fundamental problem for both RCTs and observational studies is
that exposure status is often unavailable or difficult to measure, which has
made it impossible to apply existing methodology to study vaccine effects that
account for exposure status. In this work, we present new results on this type
of vaccine effects. Under plausible conditions, we show that point
identification of certain relative effects is possible even when the exposure
status is unknown. Furthermore, we derive sharp bounds on the corresponding
absolute effects. We apply these results to estimate the effects of the ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) conditional on post-vaccine
exposure to the virus, using data from a large RCT.

a learner seeks to control its dynamic regret against an arbitrary sequence of

demonstrate that Strongly Adaptive (SA) algorithms can be viewed as a
principled way of controlling dynamic regret in terms of path variation $V_T$

$\tilde O(\sqrt{TV_T} \vee \log T)$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{dTV_T} \vee d\log T)$

further demonstrated by the novel results in the setting of learning against

  Under a related setting, the second component of the paper addresses an open
question posed by Zhdanov and Kalnishkan (2010) that concerns online kernel
regression with squared error losses. We derive a new lower bound on a certain
penalized regret which establishes the near minimax optimality of online Kernel

  Ride-Hailing Systems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In ride-hailing systems, en-route time refers to the time that elapses from
the moment a car is dispatched to pick up a rider until the rider is picked up.
A fundamental phenomenon in ride-hailing systems is that there is a trade-off
between en-route time and the time that a car waits for a dispatch. In short,
if cars spend little time idle waiting for a dispatch, then few cars are
available when a rider makes a request, and thus the mean distance between a
rider and the closest available car is long, which means that en-route time is
long. This phenomenon is of great importance in ride-hailing, because en-route
time increases rapidly as the number of idle cars decreases, and every minute
that a car spends en-route is one minute less that the car can transport
riders. In spite of this, the existing literature on price optimization for
ride-hailing, and on repositioning optimization for ride-hailing, ignores
en-route time. Initial attempts to take this trade-off for the mean en-route
time into account when considering price optimization or repositioning
optimization all resulted in intractable optimization problems. Then we found a
way to reformulate a simultaneous price and repositioning optimization problem,
that takes this trade-off for the distribution of en-route time into account,
as a tractable convex optimization problem. We show how the optimal solution
can be used to construct policies that perform much better in simulations than
the policies proposed in previous papers.

(FVS) forces the network into one of its attractors (long-term dynamic
behaviors). The FVS is often composed of more nodes than can be realistically
manipulated in a system; for example, only up to three nodes can be controlled
in intracellular networks, while their FVS may contain more than 10 nodes.
Thus, we developed an approach to rank subsets of the FVS on Boolean models of
intracellular networks using topological, dynamics-independent measures. We
investigated the use of seven topological prediction measures sorted into three
categories -- centrality measures, propagation measures, and cycle-based
measures. Using each measure every subset was ranked and then evaluated against
two dynamics-based metrics that measure the ability of interventions to drive
the system towards or away from its attractors: To Control and Away Control.
After examining an array of biological networks, we found that the FVS subsets
that ranked in the top according to the propagation metrics can most
effectively control the network. This result was independently corroborated on
a second array of different Boolean models of biological networks.
Consequently, overriding the entire FVS is not required to drive a biological
network to one of its attractors, and this method provides a way to reliably
identify effective FVS subsets without knowledge of the network's dynamics.

motion to swim forward. The archetypal demonstration of this unique
motion-constraint was introduced by Purcell with the so-called ""scallop
theorem"". Scallop here is a minimal mathematical model of a swimmer composed by
two arms connected via a hinge whose periodic motion (of opening and closing
its arms) is not sufficient to achieve net displacement. Any source of
incongruence on the motion or in the forces/torques experienced by such
time-reversible scallop will break the symmetry imposed by the Stokes linearity
and lead to subsequent propulsion of the scallop. However, little is known
about the controllability of time-reversible scalloping systems. Here, we
consider two individually non-controllable scallops swimming together. Under a
suitable geometric assumption on the configuration of the system, it is proved
that non-zero net displacement can be achieved as a consequence of their
hydrodynamic interaction. A detailed analysis of the control system of
equations is carried out analytically by means of geometric control theory. We
obtain an analytic expression for the the displacement after a prescribed
sequence of controls in function of the phase difference of the two scallops.
Numerical validation of the theoretical results is presented with model

reconciling differences in priors for the same common quantity between two
adjacent submodels. Estimating the posterior of the resulting overall joint
model is also challenging, so we describe a sampler that uses the chain
structure to incorporate information contained in the submodels in multiple
stages, possibly in parallel. We demonstrate our methodology using two
examples. The first example considers an ecological integrated population
model, where multiple data sets are required to accurately estimate population
immigration and reproduction rates. We also consider a joint longitudinal and

classes of objects, including 17 classes of man-made objects, 18 classes of
natural objects and 21 general classes. We analyze ATLANTIS in detail and
evaluate several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on our
benchmark. In addition, a novel deep neural network, AQUANet, is developed for
waterbody semantic segmentation by processing the aquatic and non-aquatic
regions in two different paths. AQUANet also incorporates low-level feature
modulation and cross-path modulation for enhancing feature representation.
Experimental results show that the proposed AQUANet outperforms other
state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on ATLANTIS. We claim that
ATLANTIS is the largest waterbody image dataset for semantic segmentation
providing a wide range of water and water-related classes and it will benefit
researchers of both computer vision and water resources engineering.

is completely opposite. Some few comments about possible phenomenological
implications of our results are given. One of them is a plausible resolution of
the initial singularity. On the other hand for the case in which the scalar

algebraic objects. This consists in starting with a convergent presentation,
and expliciting a family of generating confluences to obtain a coherent
presentation -- one with generators, generating relations, and generating
relations between relations (syzygies). In this article we develop these ideas
for a class of monoids which encode the representation theory of complex
symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, called plactic monoids. The main tools for
this are the crystal realization of plactic monoids due to Kashiwara, and a
class of presentations compatible with a crystal structure, called crystal
presentations. We show that the compatibility of the crystal structure with the
presentation reduces certain aspects of the study of plactic monoids by
rewriting theory to components of highest weight in the crystal. We thus obtain
reduced versions of Newman's Lemma and Critical Pair Lemma, which are results
for verifying convergence of a presentation. Further we show that the family of
generating confluences of a convergent crystal presentation is entirely
determined by the components of highest weight. Finally we apply these
constructions to the finite convergent presentations of plactic monoids of type
$A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and $G_2$, due to Cain-Gray-Malheiro.

symmetry corresponding to these hairs, thus they are not conserved and one
cannot understand them as Noether charges. They arise as coupling constants.
Although there are many hairs, the black hole has only one horizon. The scalar
potential becomes negative for sufficient large $\phi$ (or in the vicinity of

constructing the phase boundaries (known as the $R$-crossing method) and the
Widom line, which is considered by many to be the continuation of the
coexistence curve beyond the critical point. In this paper, we revisit these
geometry-based constructions with the aim of understanding their limitations
and generality. We introduce a new equation-of-state expansion for fluids near
a critical point, assuming analyticity with respect to the number density, and
use this to prove a number of key results, including the equivalence between
the $R$-crossing method and the standard construction of phase boundaries near
the critical point. The same conclusion is not seen to hold for the Widom line
of fluids in general. However, for the ideal van der Waals fluid a slight tweak
in the usual formulation of the Ruppeiner metric, which we call the
Ruppeiner-$N$ metric, makes the Ruppeiner geometry prediction of the Widom line
exact. This is in contrast to the results of May and Mausbach where the
prediction is good only up to the slope of the Widom line at the critical
point. We also apply the Ruppeiner-$N$ metric to improve the proposed
classification scheme of Di\'osi et al. that partitions the van der Waals state
space into its different phases using Ruppeiner geodesics. Whereas the original
Di\'osi boundaries do not correspond to any established thermodynamic lines
above (or even below) the critical point, our construction remarkably detects
the Widom line. These results suggest that the Ruppeiner-$N$ metric may play a
more important role in thermodynamic geometry than is presently appreciated.

recognition benchmarks, which however suffer from high computational cost. In
this paper, we present STTS, a token selection framework that dynamically
selects a few informative tokens in both temporal and spatial dimensions
conditioned on input video samples. Specifically, we formulate token selection
as a ranking problem, which estimates the importance of each token through a
lightweight scorer network and only those with top scores will be used for
downstream evaluation. In the temporal dimension, we keep the frames that are
most relevant to the action categories, while in the spatial dimension, we
identify the most discriminative region in feature maps without affecting the
spatial context used in a hierarchical way in most video transformers. Since
the decision of token selection is non-differentiable, we employ a
perturbed-maximum based differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training.
We mainly conduct extensive experiments on Kinetics-400 with a recently
introduced video transformer backbone, MViT. Our framework achieves similar
results while requiring 20% less computation. We also demonstrate our approach

Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) compared to home charging? 2) is there any
profitable market opportunity for charging stations while the retail
electricity market is regulated? To this end, the strategic bidding problem for
EVCSs which purchase electricity from the Day-Ahead Electricity Market (DAM)

constrained by the market-clearing problem within the DAM as well as EVs'
charging cost minimization problem. A bi-level optimization problem formulation

the form of collisionless and pressureless dark matter. Unstable decaying dark
matter has been proposed in the literature as an extension to the standard cold
dark matter model. In this paper we investigate a scenario when dark matter
decays and the resultant particle moves with respect to the dark matter. A
covariant hydrodynamical model is developed in which the decay is modeled by
the transfer of energy-momentum between two dark dust fluid components. We
parameterise the model in terms of the decay rate $\Gamma$ and injection
velocity $v_i$ of the resultant dark matter particles. We apply the framework
to study the evolution of cosmic voids which are environments with low content
of baryonic matter. Thus, unlike baryon-rich environments, voids provide an
opportunity to measure dark matter signals that are less contaminated by
complex baryonic processes. We find that the growth of S-type voids is modified
by the dark matter decay, leading to imprints at the present day. This paper
serves as a proof-of-concept that cosmic voids can be used to study dark mater
physics. We argue that future cosmological observations of voids should focus
on signs of reported features to either confirm or rule out the decaying dark
matter scenario. Lack of presence of reported features could put constraints of
the decay of dark matter in terms of $\Gamma > H_0^{-1}$ and $v_i<10$ km/s.

low-energy constants (LECs) of nuclear effective field theories (EFTs) from
first-principles calculations that incorporate the dynamics of quarks and
gluons. Given the Euclidean and finite-volume nature of LQCD outputs, complex
mappings are developed in recent years to obtain the Minkowski and
infinite-volume counterparts of LQCD observables. In particular, as LQCD is
moving toward computing a set of important few-nucleon matrix elements at the
physical values of the quark masses, it is important to investigate whether the
anticipated precision of LQCD spectra and matrix elements will be sufficient to
guarantee tighter constraints on the relevant LECs than those already obtained
from phenomenology, considering the non-trivial mappings involved. With a focus
on the leading-order LECs of the pionless EFT, $L_{1,A}$ and $g_{\nu}^{NN}$,
which parametrize, respectively, the strength of the isovector axial two-body
current in a single-$\beta$ decay (and other related processes such $pp$
fusion), and of the isotensor contact two-body operator in the neutrinoless
double-$\beta$ decay within the light neutrino exchange scenario, the expected
uncertainty on future extractions of $L_{1,A}$ and $g_{\nu}^{NN}$ are examined
using synthetic data at the physical values of the quark masses. It is observed
that achieving small uncertainties in $L_{1,A}$ will be challenging, and
(sub)percent-level precision in the two-nucleon spectra and matrix elements is
essential in reducing the uncertainty on this LEC compared to the existing
constraints. On the other hand, the short-distance coupling of the neutrinoless
double-$\beta$ decay, $g_{\nu}^{NN}$, is shown to be less sensitive to
uncertainties on both LQCD energies and the matrix element, and can likely be
constrained with percent-level precision in the upcoming LQCD calculations.

superiority of employing active IRS in WPCNs and the benefits of dynamic IRS
beamforming. Specifically, it is found that compared to the passive IRS, the
active IRS not only improves the WST greatly, but also is more energy-efficient
and can significantly extend the transmission coverage. Moreover, different
from the symmetric deployment strategy of passive IRS, it is more preferable to
deploy the active IRS near the devices.

The workflow includes lung volume segmentation, ""synthetic"" healthy lung

developed to generate synthetic ""healthy"" lung CT images from infected lung
images. After that, the pneumonia lesions are extracted by subtracting the
synthetic ""healthy"" lung CT images from the ""infected"" lung CT images. A median
filter and K-means clustering were then applied to contour the lesions. The
auto segmentation approach was validated on two public datasets (Coronacases
and Radiopedia). The Dice coefficients reached 0.748 and 0.730, respectively,
for the Coronacases and Radiopedia datasets. Meanwhile, the precision and
sensitivity for lesion segmentationdetection are 0.813 and 0.735 for the

performance is comparable to existing supervised segmentation networks and
outperforms previous unsupervised ones. The proposed unsupervised segmentation
method achieved high accuracy and efficiency in automatic COVID-19 lesion

the best of our knowledge, there is no work that jointly takes into account
these aspects. By content recommendation, a requested content that is not in
the cache can be alternatively satisfied by a related cached content
recommended by the system. Information freshness can be quantified by age of
information (AoI). We address, optimal scheduling of cache updates for a
time-slotted system accounting for content recommendation and AoI. For each
content, there are requests that need to be satisfied, and there is a cost
function capturing the freshness of information. We present the following
contributions. First, we prove that the problem is NP-hard. Second, we derive
an integer linear formulation, by which the optimal solution can be obtained
for small-scale scenarios. Third, we develop an algorithm based on Lagrangian
decomposition. Fourth, we develop efficient algorithms for solving the
resulting subproblems. Our algorithm computes a bound that can be used to
evaluate the performance of any suboptimal solution. Finally, we conduct
simulations to show the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison to a
greedy schedule.

0. The variation shows a fluctuating behaviour on either side of 0.
Furthermore, the deviations tend to be larger in the first year than the rest

for unconstrained optimization, but it satisfies weak complexity bounds at best
when applied to smooth convex functions. In contrast, Nesterov's accelerated
gradient (AG) method is optimal up to constant factors for this class. However,
when specialized to quadratic function, conjugate gradient is optimal in a
strong sense among function-gradient methods. Therefore, there is seemingly a
gap in the menu of available algorithms: NCG, the optimal algorithm for
quadratic functions that also exhibits good practical performance for general
functions, has poor complexity bounds compared to AG. We propose an NCG method
called C+AG (""conjugate plus accelerated gradient"") to close this gap, that is,
it is optimal for quadratic functions and still satisfies the best possible
complexity bound for more general smooth convex functions. It takes conjugate
gradient steps until insufficient progress is made, at which time it switches
to accelerated gradient steps, and later retries conjugate gradient. The
proposed method has the following theoretical properties: (i) It is identical
to linear conjugate gradient (and hence terminates finitely) if the objective
function is quadratic; (ii) Its running-time bound is $O(\eps^{-1/2})$ gradient
evaluations for an $L$-smooth convex function, where $\eps$ is the desired
residual reduction, (iii) Its running-time bound is
$O(\sqrt{L/\ell}\ln(1/\eps))$ if the function is both $L$-smooth and
$\ell$-strongly convex. In computational tests, the function-gradient

address this challenge, this paper presents PointCrack3D, a new
3D-point-cloud-based crack detection algorithm for unstructured surfaces. The
method comprises three key components: an adaptive down-sampling method that
maintains sufficient crack point density, a DNN that classifies each point as
crack or non-crack, and a post-processing clustering method that groups crack
points into crack instances. The method was validated experimentally on a new
large natural rock dataset, comprising coloured LIDAR point clouds spanning
more than 900 m^2 and 412 individual cracks. Results demonstrate a crack
detection rate of 97% overall and 100% for cracks with a maximum width of more

cross-validation, PointCrack3D was applied to an entirely new dataset acquired
in different locations and not used at all in training and shown to detect 100%

performance, crack width and number of points per crack, providing a foundation

Differential Equation (PDE) of the temperature distribution defined on a
spatial interval with a moving boundary, where the boundary represents the
liquid-solid interface and its dynamics are governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). The PDE-ODE coupling at the boundary is nonlinear
and creates a significant challenge for state estimation with provable
convergence and robustness. This tutorial article presents a state estimation
method based on PDE backstepping for the Stefan system, using measurements only
at the moving boundary. PDE backstepping observer design generates an observer
gain by employing a Volterra transformation of the observer error state into a
desirable target system, solving a Goursat-form PDE for the transformation's
kernel, and performing a Lyapunov analysis of the target observer error system.
The observer is applied to models of problems motivated by climate change and
the need for renewable energy storage: a model of polar ice dynamics and a
model of charging and discharging in lithium-ion batteries. The numerical
results for polar ice demonstrate a robust performance of the designed
estimator with respect to the unmodeled salinity effect in sea ice. The results
for an electrochemical PDE model of a lithium-ion battery with a phase

contributions include a generalized model of Markov entropic centrality with
the flexibility to tune the importance of node degrees, edge weights and

about the suitability of our approach to cluster a given graph, and determine

an agglomerative clustering mechanism. The entropic centrality computations are
amortized by our clustering algorithm, making it computationally efficient:
compared to prior approaches using Markov entropic centrality for clustering,
our experiments demonstrate multiple orders of magnitude of speed-up. Our
clustering algorithm naturally inherits the flexibility to accommodate edge

with promising performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. However, the
correlation operation between query feature and the given template only
exploits accurate target localization, leading to state estimation error
especially when the target suffers from severe deformable variations. To
address this issue, segmentation-based trackers have been proposed that employ
per-pixel matching to improve the tracking performance of deformable objects
effectively. However, most of existing trackers only refer to the target
features in the initial frame, thereby lacking the discriminative capacity to
handle challenging factors, e.g., similar distractors, background clutter,
appearance change, etc. To this end, we propose a dynamic compact memory
embedding to enhance the discrimination of the segmentation-based deformable
visual tracking method. Specifically, we initialize a memory embedding with the
target features in the first frame. During the tracking process, the current
target features that have high correlation with existing memory are updated to
the memory embedding online. To further improve the segmentation accuracy for
deformable objects, we employ a point-to-global matching strategy to measure
the correlation between the pixel-wise query features and the whole template,
so as to capture more detailed deformation information. Extensive evaluations

source with a size $\sim 44~\mu$as. Starting with the annulus and disk models
leads to images with the lowest noise, smallest off-source artifacts, and
better closure residuals. The source appears as a ring, or edge-brightened
disk, with higher surface brightness in the southern half, consistent with
previous results. Starting with the other models leads to a surface brightness
distribution with a similar size, and an internal depression, but not as
clearly ring-like. A consideration of visibility amplitudes vs. UV-distance
argues for a roughly circularly symmetric structure of $\sim 50~\mu$as scale,
with a sharp-edge, based on a prominent minimum in the UV-distribution, and the
amplitude of the secondary peak in the UV-plot is more consistent with an
annular model than a flat disk model. With further processing, we find a
possible modest extension from the ring toward the southwest, in a direction
consistent with the southern limb of the jet seen on 3mm VLBI images on a
factor of few larger scales. However, this extension appears along the
direction of one of the principle sidelobes of the synthesized beam, and hence

the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) metallicities are strongly
correlated, with scatter $\sim$3 times smaller than that found in previous

including stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and a gravitational
potential proxy. However, we show that these trends are primarily a consequence
of: (a) the different star formation and metal enrichment histories of the
galaxies, and (b) the fact that while stellar metallicities trace primarily
iron enrichment, gas-phase metallicity indicators are calibrated to the
enrichment of oxygen in the ISM. Indeed, once both metallicities are converted
to the same `element base' all of our trends become significantly weaker.
Interestingly, the ratio of gas to stellar metallicity is always below the
value expected for a simple closed-box model, which requires that outflows and
inflows play an important role in the enrichment history across our entire
stellar mass range. This work highlights the complex interplay between stellar
and gas-phase metallicities and shows how care must be taken in comparing them

method to attain an uncertainty map, which can serve as a weight for losses to
force the models to focus on the valuable region according to the

Simultaneously, in the backward process, we joint unsupervised and supervised

quantification, and it lies behind many seemingly different results in economic
theory: spanning social choice, belief formation, and individual decision
making. Three examples of rational aggregation rules are as follows. (1) Give
each individual model (expert) a weight (a score) and use weighted averaging to
aggregate individual or finite ensembles of models (experts). (2) Order/rank
individual model (expert) and let the aggregation of a finite ensemble of

regulate the intermediate representation consecutively to produce
representation that (a) emphasizes the novel information in the frame of the
current time-stamp in contrast to previously observed content, and (b) reflects
its correlation with previously observed frames. The former is achieved by
minimizing a contrastive loss, and the latter can be achieved by a dynamic
reweighing mechanism to attend to informative frames in the observed content
with a similarity comparison between feature of the current frame and observed

multi-task learning which performs joint feature learning on the target

overhead can only be partially eliminated with elaborate schemes such as
bits-back coding, often resulting in poor single-sample compression rates. To
overcome such problems, we establish a new class of tractable lossless
compression models that permit efficient encoding and decoding: Probabilistic
Circuits (PCs). These are a class of neural networks involving $|p|$
computational units that support efficient marginalization over arbitrary

derive efficient encoding and decoding schemes that both have time complexity
$\mathcal{O} (\log(D) \cdot |p|)$, where a naive scheme would have linear costs
in $D$ and $|p|$, making the approach highly scalable. Empirically, our

mass in a steady wind during the main-sequence and blue supergiant phases. This
in turn sets the stage for their further evolution and eventual supernova, with
consequences for ISM energization and chemical enrichment. Understanding these
processes requires accurate observational constraints on the mass-loss rates of
the most luminous stars, which can also be used to test theories of stellar
wind generation. In the past, mass-loss rates have been characterized via
collisional emission processes such as H$\alpha$ and free-free radio emission,
but these so-called ""density squared"" diagnostics require correction in the
presence of widespread clumping. Recent observational and theoretical evidence
points to the likelihood of a ubiquitously high level of such clumping in
hot-star winds, but quantifying its effects requires a deeper understanding of
the complex dynamics of radiatively driven winds. Furthermore, large-scale
structures arising from surface anisotropies and propagating throughout the
wind can further complicate the picture by introducing further density
enhancements, affecting mass-loss diagnostics. Time series spectroscopy of UV
resonance lines with high resolution and high signal-to-noise are required to
better understand this complex dynamics, and help correct ""density squared""

report a promising method for the fabrication of high-density SiV- centers in a
low-cost polycrystalline diamond film grown on an inches-scale Si wafer. Our
method utilizes the nucleation surface of the diamond film which initially
interfaces with the Si wafer. Benefited from the diamond seeding substrate of
silicon, the nucleation surface has originally been incorporated with
high-density Si atoms. Upon helium-ion implantation and subsequent thermal
annealing, we demonstrate by performing PL mapping that these Si atoms can be
efficiently converted to SiV- centers. The SiV- centers exhibit bright emission
and a relatively long fluorescence lifetime (~1.08 ns) that is comparable to
the SiV- lifetime reported in single-crystal diamonds. Furthermore, by using a
focused helium beam and varying the helium fluence, we demonstrate the feasible
density control and patterning of the SiV- centers. These results show that our
method can produce high-density SiV- centers in low-cost wafer-scale
polycrystalline diamonds, which could facilitate the commercialization of SiV-

In this regard, various strategies have been proposed in the past to improve
the expressiveness of GNNs. For example, one straightforward option is to
simply increase the parameter size by either expanding the hid-den dimension or
increasing the number of GNN layers. However, wider hidden layers can easily
lead to overfitting, and incrementally adding more GNN layers can potentially
result in over-smoothing.In this paper, we present a model-agnostic
methodology, namely Network In Graph Neural Network (NGNN ), that allows
arbitrary GNN models to increase their model capacity by making the model
deeper. However, instead of adding or widening GNN layers, NGNN deepens a GNN
model by inserting non-linear feedforward neural network layer(s) within each
GNN layer. An analysis of NGNN as applied to a GraphSage base GNN on
ogbn-products data demonstrate that it can keep the model stable against either
node feature or graph structure perturbations. Furthermore, wide-ranging

1-d interface motion with inertia in an elastic solid with a non-monotone
stress-strain response. In classical nonlinear elasticity, it is known that
subsonic interfaces require a kinetic law, in addition to momentum balance, to
obtain unique solutions; in contrast, for supersonic interfaces, momentum
balance alone is sufficient to provide unique solutions. This work finds that
peridynamics agrees with this classical result, in that different choices of
regularization parameters provide different kinetics for subsonic motion but
the same kinetics for supersonic motion. In contrast, conventional phase-field
models coupled to elastodynamics are unable to model, even qualitatively, the
supersonic motion of interfaces. This work identifies the shortcomings in the
physics of standard phase-field models to be: (1) the absence of higher-order
stress to balance unphysical stress singularities, and (2) the ability of the
model to access unphysical regions of the energy landscape.
  Based on these observations, this work proposes an augmented phase-field
model to introduce the missing physics. The augmented model adds: (1) a viscous
stress to the momentum balance, in addition to the dissipative phase-field
evolution, to regularize singularities; and (2) an augmented driving force that
models the physical mechanism that keeps the system out of unphysical regions
of the energy landscape. When coupled to elastodynamics, the augmented model
correctly describes both subsonic and supersonic interface motion. The
augmented model has essentially the same computational expense as conventional
phase-field models and requires only minor modifications of numerical methods,
and is therefore proposed as a replacement to the conventional phase-field
models.

extra UAV is utilized as a cooperative jammer generating artificial noise (AN)

covertness requirement, which is determined analytically. Since the

the application of cutting-edge techniques such as CNN. As a well studied
property for CNN-based models, the receptive field is a measurement for
measuring the spatial range covered by a single feature response, which is
crucial in improving the image categorization accuracy. In video domain, video
event semantics are actually described by complex interaction among different
concepts, while their behaviors vary drastically from one video to another,
leading to the difficulty in concept-based analytics for accurate event
categorization. To model the concept behavior, we study temporal concept
receptive field of concept-based event representation, which encodes the
temporal occurrence pattern of different mid-level concepts. Accordingly, we
introduce temporal dynamic convolution (TDC) to give stronger flexibility to
concept-based event analytics. TDC can adjust the temporal concept receptive
field size dynamically according to different inputs. Notably, a set of
coefficients are learned to fuse the results of multiple convolutions with
different kernel widths that provide various temporal concept receptive field
sizes. Different coefficients can generate appropriate and accurate temporal
concept receptive field size according to input videos and highlight crucial
concepts. Based on TDC, we propose the temporal dynamic concept modeling
network (TDCMN) to learn an accurate and complete concept representation for
efficient untrimmed video analysis. Experiment results on FCVID and ActivityNet
show that TDCMN demonstrates adaptive event recognition ability conditioned on
different inputs, and improve the event recognition performance of
Concept-based methods by a large margin. Code is available at

priors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated
uncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual
weights, we show that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranking allows pruning of the
fully-connected layers to the level of 30% without significant loss of
performance, and that this pruning increases the predictive uncertainty in the
model. Finally we show that, like other work in this field, we experience a
cold posterior effect. We examine whether adapting the cost function in our
model to accommodate model misspecification can compensate for this effect, but
find that it does not make a significant difference. We also examine the effect
of principled data augmentation and find that it improves upon the baseline but
does not compensate for the observed effect fully. We interpret this as the
cold posterior effect being due to the overly effective curation of our

However, detecting novel classes with only few samples remains challenging,
since deep learning under low data regime usually leads to a degraded feature
space. Existing works employ a holistic fine-tuning paradigm to tackle this
problem, where the model is first pre-trained on all base classes with abundant
samples, and then it is used to carve the novel class feature space.
Nonetheless, this paradigm is still imperfect. Durning fine-tuning, a novel
class may implicitly leverage the knowledge of multiple base classes to
construct its feature space, which induces a scattered feature space, hence
violating the inter-class separability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
a two-step fine-tuning framework, Few-shot object detection via Association and
DIscrimination (FADI), which builds up a discriminative feature space for each
novel class with two integral steps. 1) In the association step, in contrast to
implicitly leveraging multiple base classes, we construct a compact novel class
feature space via explicitly imitating a specific base class feature space.
Specifically, we associate each novel class with a base class according to
their semantic similarity. After that, the feature space of a novel class can
readily imitate the well-trained feature space of the associated base class. 2)
In the discrimination step, to ensure the separability between the novel
classes and associated base classes, we disentangle the classification branches
for base and novel classes. To further enlarge the inter-class separability
between all classes, a set-specialized margin loss is imposed. Extensive
experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate FADI achieves new
SOTA performance, significantly improving the baseline in any shot/split by
+18.7. Notably, the advantage is most announced on extremely few-shot
scenarios.

The accuracy of the response and its utility to the intended use are frequently

of this paper is to introduce a tractable framework to design the optimum noise

radiologists to contextualize clinical history and inform image interpretation,
the majority of deep learning architectures for medical imaging are unimodal,
i.e., they only learn features from pixel-level information. Recent research
revealing how race can be recovered from pixel data alone highlights the
potential for serious biases in models which fail to account for demographics
and other key patient attributes. Yet the lack of imaging datasets which
capture clinical context, inclusive of demographics and longitudinal medical
history, has left multimodal medical imaging underexplored. To better assess
these challenges, we present RadFusion, a multimodal, benchmark dataset of 1794
patients with corresponding EHR data and high-resolution computed tomography
(CT) scans labeled for pulmonary embolism. We evaluate several representative
multimodal fusion models and benchmark their fairness properties across
protected subgroups, e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age. Our results suggest
that integrating imaging and EHR data can improve classification performance
and robustness without introducing large disparities in the true positive rate
between population groups.

solar wind formation, are intimately tied by magnetic field dynamics. Thus, a
detailed comparative study of these regions is needed to understand the
underlying physical processes. CHs are known to have subdued intensity and
larger blueshifts in the corona. This work investigates the similarities and
differences between CHs and QS in the chromosphere using the Mg II h & k, C II
lines, and transition region using Si IV line, for regions with identical
absolute magnetic flux density (|B|). We find CHs to have subdued intensity in
all the ines, with the difference increasing with line formation height and
|B|. The chromospheric lines show excess upflows and downflows in CH, while Si
IV shows excess upflows (downflows) in CHs (QS), where the flows increase with
|B|. We further demonstrate that the upflows (downflows) in Si IV are
correlated with both upflows and downflows (only downflows) in the
chromospheric lines. CHs (QS) show larger Si IV upflows (downflows) for similar
flows in the chromosphere, suggesting a common origin to these flows. These
observations may be explained due to impulsive heating via interchange
(closed-loop) reconnection in CHs (QS), resulting in bidirectional flows at
different heights, due to differences in magnetic field topologies. Finally,
the kinked field lines from interchange reconnection may be carried away as
magnetic field rotations and observed as switchbacks. Thus, our results suggest
a unified picture of solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and near-Sun
switchback formation.

and imitation learning. This research develops a new learning methodology and
systematic approach in both a simulated and a smaller real world environment by
integrating supervised imitation learning into reinforcement learning to make
the RL training data collection process more effective and efficient. By
combining the two methods, the proposed research successfully leverages the
advantages of both RL and IL methods. First, a real mini-scale robot car was
assembled and trained on a 6 feet by 9 feet real world track using imitation
learning. During the process, a handle controller was used to control the
mini-scale robot car to drive on the track by imitating a human expert driver
and manually recorded the actions using Microsoft AirSim's API. 331 accurate
human-like reward training samples were able to be generated and collected.
Then, an agent was trained in the Microsoft AirSim simulator using
reinforcement learning for 6 hours with the initial 331 reward data inputted
from imitation learning training. After a 6-hour training period, the
mini-scale robot car was able to successfully drive full laps around the 6 feet
by 9 feet track autonomously while the mini-scale robot car was unable to
complete one full lap round the track even after 30 hour training pure RL
training. With 80% less training time, the new methodology produced
significantly more average rewards per hour. Thus, the new methodology was able
to save a significant amount of training time and can be used to accelerate the
adoption of RL in autonomous driving, which would help produce more efficient
and better results in the long run when applied to real life scenarios.

novel methods to implement non-trivial quantum computations on near-term
hardware. An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary
entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a
sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that
circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are
error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this
end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods
to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing
QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements
mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary
unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of
QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it
produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the
number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times
less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the
efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a
naive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can
be adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different
hardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google. We hope this
package will facilitate further algorithmic exploration for quantum processor
designers, as well as quantum physicists.

parameters in understating formation and and evolution of stars and galaxies.
This article presents the complete set of fundamental parameters of two nearby
(CVBSs), these are HIP 19206 and HIP 84425. We used a combination of two
methods; the first one is Tokovinin's dynamical method to solve the orbit of
the system and to estimate orbital elements and the dynamical mass sum, and the
second one is Al-Wardat's method for analyzing CVBMSs to estimate the physical
parameters of the individual components. The latest method employs grids of
Kurucz line-blanketed plane parallel model atmospheres to build synthetic
Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) of the individual components. Trigonometric
parallax measurements given by Gaia DR2 and Hipparcos catalogues are used to
analyse the two systems. The difference in these measurements yielded slight
discrepancies in the fundamental parameters of the individual components
especially masses. So, a new dynamical parallax is suggested in this work based
on the most convenient mass sum as given by each of the two methods. The new
dynamical parallax for the system Hip 19205 as $22.97\pm 0.95$ mas coincides
well with the trigonometric one given recently (in December 2020) by Gaia DR3
as $22.3689\pm 0.4056$ mas.
  The positions of the components of the two systems on the evolutionary tracks
and isochrones are plotted, which suggest that all components are solar-type
main sequence stars. Their most probable formation and evolution scenarios are
also discussed.

two-parameter quantum pumping in graphene with a line defect. It is found that
different from the conventional sinusoidal relation, the pumped current in this
device is cosinusoid dependence on the phase difference between the two pumping
potentials, which adopts its positive/nagative maximum value at while tends to
zero at . This phenomenon is related to the peculiar valley tunneling
characteristics across the line defects and the exchange of valley indices on
both sides of the line defect. Moreover, the pumped currents from the two
valleys will flow in opposite directions along the line defect, indicating that
the controllable valley current can be pumped out in the line defect without
the application of strain field in graphene.

GATE. The water-phantom results show excellent agreement, suggesting that the
radiation physics module in the new NM code is adequate. To demonstrate the
clinical utility and advantage of ARCHER-NM, one set of PET/CT data for an
adult male NM patient is calculated using the new code. Radiosensitive organs
in the CT dataset are segmented using a CNN-based tool called DeepViewer. The
PET image intensity maps are converted to radioactivity distributions to allow
for MC radiation transport dose calculations at the voxel level. The dose rate
maps and corresponding statistical uncertainties were calculated for the
duration of PET image acquisition. The dose rate results of the 18F-FDG PET
imaging patient show that ARCHER-NM's results agree very well with those of the
GATE within 0.58% to 4.11%. Most impressively, ARCHER-NM obtains such results
in less than 0.5 minutes while it takes GATE as much as 376 minutes. This is
the first study presenting GPU-accelerated patient-specific MC internal
radiation dose rate calculations for clinically realistic 18F-FDG PET/CT

accurate and fast enough for routine internal dosimetry in NM clinics.

shown to depend on the degree of magnetisation. Specifically, in the region
near the thruster outlet, the plume is weakly-magnetised due to the cross-field
diffusion of electron-heavy particle collisions. Downstream, a
strongly-magnetised region of near-isothermal expansion occurs. Finally, in the

(PCGA) we estimate the probability density function of the bathymetry from flow
velocity measurements, and then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to obtain
a fast solver for the SWEs. The fast solver uses realizations from the
posterior bathymetry distribution and takes as input the prescribed range of
BCs. The first stage allows us to predict flow velocities without direct
measurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore, we augment the bathymetry posterior
distribution to a more general class of distributions before providing them as
inputs to ML algorithm in the second stage. This allows the solver to
incorporate future direct bathymetry measurements into the flow velocity
prediction for improved accuracy, even if the bathymetry changes over time
compared to its original indirect estimation. We propose and benchmark three
different solvers, referred to as PCA-DNN (principal component analysis-deep

constants. We argue that the bulk picture of these local collective fields

translation (NMT) tasks. Early NMT works supposed that syntax details can be
automatically learned from numerous texts via attention networks. However,
succeeding researches pointed out that limited by the uncontrolled nature of

deep syntactic awareness. Although existing syntax-aware NMT methods have born
great fruits in combining syntax, the additional workloads they introduced
render the model heavy and slow. Particularly, these efforts scarcely involve
the Transformer-based NMT and modify its core self-attention network (SAN). To
this end, we propose a parameter-free, Dependency-scaled Self-Attention Network
(Deps-SAN) for syntax-aware Transformer-based NMT. A quantified matrix of
dependency closeness between tokens is constructed to impose explicit syntactic

particles are subjected to a bistable potential the double-well shape of which
is tunable via a shape deformability parameter. Our objective is to examine the
impact of shape deformability on the order of transition in quantum tunneling
in the bistable system, and on the possible existence of exact solutions to the
transfer-integral operator associated with the partition function of the
system. The bistable potential is represented by a class composed of three
families of parametrized double-well potentials, whose minima and barrier
height can be tuned distinctly. It is found that the extra degree of freedom,
introduced by the shape deformability parameter, favors a first-order
transition in quantum tunneling, in addition to the second-order transition
predicted with the $\phi^4$ model. This first-order transition in quantum
tunneling, which is consistent with Chudnovsky's conjecture of the influence of
the shape of the potential barrier on the order of thermally-assisted
transitions in bistable systems, is shown to occur at a critical value of the
shape-deformability parameter which is the same for the three families of
parametrized double-well potentials. Concerning the statistical mechanics of
the system, the associate partition function is mapped onto a spectral problem
by means of the transfer-integral formalism. The condition that the partition
function can be exactly integrable, is determined by a criterion enabling exact
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the transfer-integral operator. Analytical
expressions of some of these exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given,
and the corresponding ground-state wavefunctions are used to compute the

written as linear regressions with bounded disturbances. The task is to
estimate such parameters under the condition that the regressor is finitely
exciting (FE). Considering such a problem statement, a new robust method is
proposed to identify the time-varying parameters with bounded error, which
could be reduced to the limit by the adjustment of such method parameters. For
this purpose, the function of the system unknown parameters, which depends on
time, is expanded into a Taylor series in order to turn the considered problem
into the identification of the regression with piecewise-constant parameters.
This results in the increase of the dimensionality of the problem to be solved.
Then, the I-DREM procedure with exponential forgetting, resetting, and
normalization of the regressor, which has been proposed earlier by the authors,
is applied to the obtained regression. This allows one, in contrast to the
known solutions, to get the dimensionality of the problem back to the initial
one and provide the required exponential convergence of the parameter error to
a bounded set with adjustable bound under the condition that the regressor is
FE. In addition, this method guarantees that the parameter error is bounded
beyond the regressor excitation interval. The above properties are proved
analytically and shown via numerical simulations.

complex logistics of direct bathymetry surveys, i.e., depth imaging, have
encouraged the use of indirect measurements such as surface flow velocities.
However, estimating high-resolution bathymetry from indirect measurements is an
inverse problem that can be computationally challenging. Here, we propose a
reduced-order model (ROM) based approach that utilizes a variational
autoencoder (VAE), a type of deep neural network with a narrow layer in the
middle, to compress bathymetry and flow velocity information and accelerate
bathymetry inverse problems from flow velocity measurements. In our
application, the shallow-water equations (SWE) with appropriate boundary
conditions (BCs), e.g., the discharge and/or the free surface elevation,
constitute the forward problem, to predict flow velocity. Then, ROMs of the
SWEs are constructed on a nonlinear manifold of low dimensionality through a
variational encoder. Estimation with uncertainty quantification (UQ) is
performed on the low-dimensional latent space in a Bayesian setting. We have
tested our inversion approach on a one-mile reach of the Savannah River, GA,
USA. Once the neural network is trained (offline stage), the proposed technique
can perform the inversion operation orders of magnitude faster than traditional
inversion methods that are commonly based on linear projections, such as
principal component analysis (PCA), or the principal component geostatistical
approach (PCGA). Furthermore, tests show that the algorithm can estimate the
bathymetry with good accuracy even with sparse flow velocity measurements.

representing configurations of RMP coil currents are examined and their effects
on the NBI heating efficiency are compared, in order to find a parameter window
where deleterious effects of RMPs on NBI heating efficiency are minimized. It
is found that the internal redistribution of fast ions by RMPs induces local
accumulation of fast ions, resulting in higher local fast ion pressure than the
case without RMPs. It is also found that the toroidal phasing of the RMP with
respect to the fast ion source has slight effects on the steady-state radial
profile of fast ions. The dependence of fast ion loss fraction on the RMP
up-down phase difference shows similar behavior as the dependence of the radial

simulations, based on a finite difference discretisation and the immersed
boundary method, are performed to mutually couple the dynamics of fibres and
fluid turbulence, allowing to account for the backreaction of the dispersed
phase to the carrier flow. An extensive parametric study is carried out over
the characteristic properties of the suspension, i.e., fibre's linear density
(from neutrally-buoyant to heavy fibres), length (from short fibres comparable
with the dissipative scale to long fibres comparable with the integral scale)
and bending stiffness (from highly flexible to almost rigid fibres), as well as
the concentration (from dilute to non-dilute suspensions). Results reveal the
existence of a robust turbulence modulation mechanism that is primarily
controlled by the mass fraction of the suspension (with only a minor influence
of the fibre's bending stiffness), which is characterised in detail by means of
a scale-by-scale analysis in Fourier space. Despite such alteration with
respect to the single-phase case due to the non-negligible backreaction, fibres
experience only two possible flapping states (previously identified in the very
dilute condition) while being transported and deformed by the flow.
Additionally, we show that the maximum curvature obeys to different scaling
laws that can be derived from the fibre dynamical equation. Finally, we explore
the preferential concentration and alignment of fibres within the flow,
highlighting the peculiar role of inertia and elasticity.

Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O. The title compound crystallizes in an $\eta$-carbide type
structure of the space group $Fd\overline{3}m$ (No. 227), with lattice
parameters $a=b=c=11.6194(1)$ \AA. The superconducting $T_c$ is found to be 5.1
$\sim$ 5.7 K. Most surprisingly, Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O hosts an upper critical field of
16.45 T, which is far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. Strong coupled
superconductivity with evidences for multigap is revealed by the measurements
of heat capacity and upper critical field. First-principles calculations
suggest that the density of states near the Fermi level originates from the
hybridization of Ti-3$d$ and Ir-5$d$ orbitals, and the effect of spin-orbit
coupling on the Fermi surfaces is prominent. Large values of the Wilson ratio
($R_W$ $\sim$ 3.9), the Kadowaki-Woods ratio ($A/\gamma^2$ $\sim$ 9.0 $\times$
10$^{-6}$ $\mu\Omega$ cm/(mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$)$^2$), and the Sommerfeld
coefficient ($\gamma$ = 33.74 mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) all suggest strong
electron correlations (similar to heavy fermion systems) in Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O. The
violation of Pauli limit is possibly due to a combination of strong-coupled
superconductivity, large spin-orbit scattering, and electron correlation. With
these intriguing behaviors, Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O serves as a candidate for
unconventional superconductor.

Interestingly, while the periodicity of inhomogeneous phases at large densities

renewable energy generation leads to increased uncertainty and variability in

grid security, we investigate a joint chance-constrained (CC) direct current
(DC) optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The problem aims to find economically
optimal power generation while guaranteeing that all power generation, line
flows, and voltages simultaneously remain within their bounds with a
pre-defined probability. Unfortunately, the problem is computationally
intractable even if the distribution of renewables fluctuations is specified.
Moreover, existing approximate solutions to the joint CC OPF problem are overly
conservative, and therefore have less value for the operational practice. This
paper proposes an importance sampling approach to the CC DC OPF problem, which
yields better complexity and accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods.
The algorithm efficiently reduces the number of scenarios by generating and
using only the most important of them, thus enabling real-time solutions for
test cases with up to several hundred buses.

applications such as navigation, target tracking, security and surveillance. A
higher steering rate (rotation angle per second) of gimbal is preferable for
real-time applications since a given field-of-view (FOV) can be revisited
within a short period of time. However, due to relative motion between the
gimbal and scene during the exposure time, the captured video frames can suffer
from motion blur. Since most of the post-capture applications require blurfree
images, motion deblurring in real-time is an important need. Even though there
exist blind deblurring methods which aim to retrieve latent images from blurry
inputs, they are constrained by very high-dimensional optimization thus
incurring large execution times. On the other hand, deep learning methods for
motion deblurring, though fast, do not generalize satisfactorily to different
domains (e.g., air, water, etc). In this work, we address the problem of
real-time motion deblurring in infrared (IR) images captured by a gimbal-based
system. We reveal how a priori knowledge of the blur-kernel can be used in
conjunction with non-blind deblurring methods to achieve real-time performance.
Importantly, our mathematical model can be leveraged to create large-scale
datasets with realistic gimbal motion blur. Such datasets which are a rarity
can be a valuable asset for contemporary deep learning methods. We show that,
in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques in deblurring, our method is
better suited for practical gimbal-based imaging systems.

based on our previous development of a self-consistent shock-in-jet model with

Monte-Carlo simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and time-dependent
radiative transport. This model has been very successful in modeling spectral
variability patterns of several blazars, but has difficulties describing orphan

investigates the possibility of a synchrotron mirror component within the

this scenario. The model's applicability to a recently observed orphan

many artificial intelligence applications. Many of the forefront applications
of RL involve multiple agents, e.g., playing chess and Go games, autonomous
driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, the framework upon which classical RL
builds is inappropriate for multi-agent learning, as it assumes an agent's
environment is stationary and does not take into account the adaptivity of
other agents. In this review paper, we present the model of stochastic games
for multi-agent learning in dynamic environments. We focus on the development
of simple and independent learning dynamics for stochastic games: each agent is
myopic and chooses best-response type actions to other agents' strategy without
any coordination with her opponent. There has been limited progress on
developing convergent best-response type independent learning dynamics for
stochastic games. We present our recently proposed simple and independent
learning dynamics that guarantee convergence in zero-sum stochastic games,
together with a review of other contemporaneous algorithms for dynamic
multi-agent learning in this setting. Along the way, we also reexamine some
classical results from both the game theory and RL literature, to situate both
the conceptual contributions of our independent learning dynamics, and the
mathematical novelties of our analysis. We hope this review paper serves as an
impetus for the resurgence of studying independent and natural learning
dynamics in game theory, for the more challenging settings with a dynamic
environment.

sharp image and the blur kernel given a blurry image. Recent progress on image
deblurring always designs end-to-end architectures and aims at learning the
difference between blurry and sharp image pairs from pixel-level, which
inevitably overlooks the importance of blur kernels. This paper reveals an
intriguing phenomenon that simply applying ReLU operation on the frequency
domain of a blur image followed by inverse Fourier transform, i.e., frequency
selection, provides faithful information about the blur pattern (e.g., the blur
direction and blur level, implicitly shows the kernel pattern). Based on this
observation, we attempt to leverage kernel-level information for image
deblurring networks by inserting Fourier transform, ReLU operation, and inverse
Fourier transform to the standard ResBlock. 1x1 convolution is further added to
let the network modulate flexible thresholds for frequency selection. We term
our newly built block as Res FFT-ReLU Block, which takes advantages of both
kernel-level and pixel-level features via learning frequency-spatial
dual-domain representations. Extensive experiments are conducted to acquire a
thorough analysis on the insights of the method. Moreover, after plugging the
proposed block into NAFNet, we can achieve 33.85 dB in PSNR on GoPro dataset.
Our method noticeably improves backbone architectures without introducing many

compression via knowledge transfer. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) is
to transfer knowledge from a large and well pre-trained teacher network to a

learning (DML) has been proposed to help student networks learn collaboratively

never been jointly explored in a unified framework to solve the knowledge

supports more trustworthy supervision signals in KD, while the student captures
more similar behaviors from the teacher in DML. Based on these observations, we
first propose to combine KD with DML in a unified framework. Furthermore, we
propose a Semi-Online Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) method that effectively
improves the performance of the student and the teacher. In this method, we
introduce the peer-teaching training fashion in DML in order to alleviate the

$\sin^2\theta_{23}$ - $\Delta m^2_{31}$ degeneracy in establishing non-maximal

channels, impact of systematic uncertainties and marginalization over
oscillation parameters, importance of spectral analysis and data from both
$\nu$ and $\bar\nu$ runs, while analyzing DUNE's sensitivity to establish
non-maximal $\theta_{23}$. DUNE can resolve the octant of $\theta_{23}$ at

Nevertheless, the intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling in
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ partly hinders the realization of ""high-temperature"" QAH
effect. Here, by using first-principles electronic structure calculations, we
design a new class of materials Mn\emph{X}$_{2}$\emph{B}$_{2}$\emph{T}$_{6}$

Mn\emph{B}$_{2}$\emph{T}$_{4}$ is sandwiched by two [\emph{X}\emph{T}] layers,
which may turn the AFM interlayer coupling into a ferromagnetic (FM) coupling.
The calculations specifically demonstrate that

\emph{MnGe}$_{2}$\emph{Bi}$_{2}$\emph{Te}$_{6}$, and

different phenotypes that allow them to carry out specific functions and react
to changes in their surrounding environment. This division of labour is
achieved by cellular division and cellular differentiation, events which lead
to a population of cells with unique characteristics. In this paper, we model
the dynamics of cells over time across a sequence of compartments. Cells within
a compartment may represent being at the same spatial location or sharing the
same phenotype. In this sequence of compartments, cells can either die, divide
or enter an adjacent compartment. We analyse a set of ordinary differential
equations to describe the evolution of the average number of cells in each
compartment over time. We also focus on the progeny of a founder cell in terms
of a stochastic process and analyse several summary statistics to bring
insights into the lifespan of a single cell, the number of divisions during its
lifespan, and the probability to die in each compartment. Numerical results
inspired by cellular immune processes allow us to illustrate the applicability
of our techniques.

fashion: each of $e_1',e_2'$ contains one vertex of $e_1$ and one vertex of

the rate of switching in a way that any fixed edge is involved in a switching
with a rate that approaches a limiting value $\mathsf{v}$, so that locally the
switching is seen in the same time scale as that of the contact process. We
prove that if the infection rate of the contact process is above a threshold
value $\bar{\lambda}$ (depending on $d$ and $\mathsf{v}$), then the infection
survives for a time that grows exponentially with the size of the graph. By
proving that $\bar{\lambda}$ is strictly smaller than the lower critical

that there are values of $\lambda$ for which the infection dies out in

  Robustness and Misspecification in Probabilistic Modeling""",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although neural networks are powerful function approximators, the underlying
modelling assumptions ultimately define the likelihood and thus the hypothesis
class they are parameterizing. In classification, these assumptions are minimal
as the commonly employed softmax is capable of representing any categorical
distribution. In regression, however, restrictive assumptions on the type of
continuous distribution to be realized are typically placed, like the dominant
choice of training via mean-squared error and its underlying Gaussianity
assumption. Recently, modelling advances allow to be agnostic to the type of
continuous distribution to be modelled, granting regression the flexibility of
classification models. While past studies stress the benefit of such flexible
regression models in terms of performance, here we study the effect of the
model choice on uncertainty estimation. We highlight that under model
misspecification, aleatoric uncertainty is not properly captured, and that a
Bayesian treatment of a misspecified model leads to unreliable epistemic
uncertainty estimates. Overall, our study provides an overview on how modelling
choices in regression may influence uncertainty estimation and thus any

least 1% of local authority budgets will be subject to PB. This ongoing
research paper explores the challenges that emerge from this 'scaling up' or
'mainstreaming' across the 32 local authorities that make up Scotland. The main
objective is to evaluate local authority use of the digital platform Consul,
which applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address these challenges.
This project adopts a qualitative longitudinal design with interviews,
observations of PB processes, and analysis of the digital platform data.
Thematic analysis is employed to capture the major issues and themes which
emerge. Longitudinal analysis then explores how these evolve over time. The
potential for 32 live study sites provides a unique opportunity to explore
discrete political and social contexts which materialize and allow for a deeper
dive into the challenges and issues that may exist, something a wider
cross-sectional study would miss. Initial results show that issues and
challenges which come from scaling up may be tackled using NLP technology

Time-gating the photoluminescence enhances the ODMR contrast by discriminating

is an important parameter in quantifying nucleation kinetics and its underlying
mechanisms. Due to the stochastic nature of nucleation, efficient methods for
measuring large number of independent induction times are needed to ensure
statistical reproducibility. In this work, we present a novel approach for
measuring and analyzing induction times in sessile arrays of microdroplets via
deliquescence/recrystallization cycling. With the help of a recently developed
image analysis protocol, we show that the interfering diffusion-mediated
interactions between microdroplets can be eliminated by controlling the
relative humidity, thereby ensuring independent nucleation events. Moreover,
possible influence of heterogeneities, impurities, and memory effect appear
negligible as suggested by our 2-cycle experiment. Further statistical analysis
(k-sample Anderson-Darling test) reveals that upon identifying possible
outliers, the dimensionless induction times obtained from different datasets
(microdroplet lines) obey the same distribution and thus can be pooled together
to form a much larger dataset. The pooled dataset showed an excellent fit with
the Weibull function, giving a mean supersaturation at nucleation of 1.61 and
1.85 for the 60pL and 4pL microdroplet respectively. This confirms the effect
of confinement where smaller systems require higher supersaturations to
nucleate. Both the experimental method and the data-treatment procedure
presented herein offer promising routes in the study of fundamental aspects of
nucleation kinetics, particularly confinement effects, and are adaptable to
other salts, pharmaceuticals, or biological crystals of interest.

noise and a large number of points impact the correspondence search. This
challenge is still a remaining research problem since most of the existing
methods rely on correspondence search. To solve this challenge, we propose a
new data-driven registration algorithm by investigating deep generative neural
networks to point cloud registration. Given two point clouds, the motivation is
to generate the aligned point clouds directly, which is very useful in many
applications like 3D matching and search. We design an end-to-end generative
neural network for aligned point clouds generation to achieve this motivation,
containing three novel components. Firstly, a point multi-perception layer
(MLP) mixer (PointMixer) network is proposed to efficiently maintain both the
global and local structure information at multiple levels from the self point
clouds. Secondly, a feature interaction module is proposed to fuse information
from cross point clouds. Thirdly, a parallel and differential sample consensus
method is proposed to calculate the transformation matrix of the input point
clouds based on the generated registration results. The proposed generative
neural network is trained in a GAN framework by maintaining the data
distribution and structure similarity. The experiments on both ModelNet40 and
7Scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method reduces $2\times$

not well understood. In this work, we present evaporation models applicable for
arrays of sessile microdroplets with dissolved solute submerged in a thin layer

presence of the oil film separating the droplet and air, the diffusive
interaction of neighboring droplets, as well as the variation of the solution
density and water activity due to the evolving solute concentration. Our model
shows excellent agreement with experimental data for both pure water and NaCl

rate and neglecting the diffusive interactions can lead to severe inaccuracies
in the measurement of droplet concentration particularly during nucleation

inefficiencies and even problems for the electricity network. Flexible

Power to X) allow the flexibility of energy systems to be increased. These
technologies make a connection between different energy sectors (e.g.,
electricity and gas) possible, and thus create new synergies within an overall
multi energy system. This paper analyzes how the P2G technology can be used at
the distribution network level (both gas and electricity) to optimize the use
of RES. In fact, in order to coordinate P2X resources, it is necessary to take
into account the whole multi energy scenario, and not just the electrical side:
it therefore becomes fundamental to recognize the pros and cons that Balancing

field theory must decrease between ultraviolet and infrared fixed points of the
renormalization group flow, and it has been proven for unitary conformal field
theories (CFTs). We consider here the long-range bosonic $O(N)^3$ model on a
spherical background, at next-to-next-to-leading order of the $1/N$ expansion.
The model displays four large-$N$ fixed points and we test and confirm the
$F$-theorem holds in this case. This is non-trivial as one of the couplings is
imaginary, and therefore the model is non-unitary at finite $N$. Despite this,
several tests indicating that the large-$N$ CFTs are in fact unitary have been
performed: for instance all the OPE coefficients computed so far in the
large-$N$ limit are real, and the spectrum of bilinear operators is real and
above unitarity bounds. Our result, namely that the F theorem holds at large
$N$, can be viewed as further indication that such theories are unitary. As an
added bonus, we show how conformal partial waves expansions in conformal field
theory can be used to resum infinite classes of vacuum diagrams.
Non-perturbatively, the jump in the value of the free energy has the
interpretation of the inclusion at the ultraviolet fixed point of an extra
non-normalizable contribution in the conformal partial wave expansion. This can
be seen in perturbation theory as the reversal of the sign of an infinite class
of diagrams due to the flow of a coupling constant.

it is necessary to take into account that the role of natural fluxes of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the terrestrial ecosystems can

ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any) using the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT)
around one day after the burst to deeper limits due to the longitudinal
advantage of the place. This paper presents our analysis of the two objects
using data from other collaborative facilities, i.e., 2.2m Calar Alto
Astronomical Observatory (CAHA) and other archival data. Our analysis suggests
that GRB 210205A is a potential dark burst once compared with the X-ray
afterglow data. Also, comparing results with other known and well-studied dark
GRBs samples indicate that the reason for the optical darkness of GRB 210205A
could either be intrinsic faintness or a high redshift event. Based on our
analysis, we also found that ZTF21aaeyldq is the third known orphan afterglow
with a measured redshift except for ZTF20aajnksq (AT2020blt) and ZTF19abvizsw
(AT2019pim). The multiwavelength afterglow modelling of ZTF21aaeyldq using the
afterglowpy package demands a forward shock model for an ISM-like ambient
medium with a rather wider jet opening angle. We determine circumburst density
of $n_{0}$ = 0.87 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy $E_{k}$ = 3.80 $\times 10^{52}$ erg
and the afterglow modelling also indicates that ZTF21aaeyldq is observed
on-axis ($\theta_{obs} < \theta_{core}$) and a gamma-ray counterpart was missed
by GRBs satellites. Our results emphasize that the 3.6m DOT has a unique
capability for deep follow-up observations of similar and other new transients
for deeper observations as a part of time-domain astronomy in the future.

Sh2-236. It contains about five `O'-type stars and several early `B'-type
stars. It is located at a distance of $\sim$3.25 kpc and has a reddening,
E(B-V)$\sim$0.4 mag. To characterize the young low-mass stellar population in
the central portion of the cluster, we carried out deep VI band observations of
the region using the 4K$\times$4K CCD IMAGER mounted on the 3.6-m DOT. Our
analysis shows that the present data are deep enough to detect stars below
$\sim$24 mag. We found optical counterparts of $\sim$220 candidate members,
including young stars and unclassified cluster members from Caramazza et al.
(2008). We estimated the membership probabilities of the Gaia sources (mostly
bright stars with G$<$19 mag) located within the cluster radius using the Gaia
EDR3. Toward the fainter end, we used the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
to select the cluster members from a sample of young stars. The unclassified
member candidates and X-ray sources from Caramazza et al. (2012) are also found
to be young low-mass stars. In total, we identified $\sim$425 young stars with
age$<$10 Myr, and 110 of these are new. Most of these stars appear kinematic
members of the cluster. By examining the CMD for the stars in the cluster
region, we suggest that the cluster has insignificant contamination due to
field stars in the pre-main sequence zone of the CMD. The slope of the mass
function in the mass range 0.2$\le$M/M$\odot$$\le$2.5 is found to be $\Gamma$ =
-1.43 $\pm$ 0.15, consistent with those of other star-forming complexes. The
spatial distribution of the young stars as a function of mass suggests that

elusive, in particular due to large damping. Here, we study Pt/FeCoB/AlO$_x$
multilayers hosting dense and robust skyrmion lattices at room temperature with
Gilbert damping of $\sim 0.02$. We use magnetic force microscopy to
characterise their static magnetic phases and broadband ferromagnetic resonance
to probe their high frequency response. Micromagnetic simulations reproduce the
experiments with accuracy and allow us to identify distinct resonant modes
detected in the skyrmion lattice phase. Low ($<$ 2 GHz) and intermediate
frequency ($2-8$ GHz) modes involve excitations localised to skyrmion edges in
conjunction with precession of the uniform background magnetisation, while a
high frequency ($>$ 12 GHz) mode corresponds to in-phase skyrmion core
precession emitting spin waves into uniform background with wavelengths in the
50--80 nm range commensurate with the lattice structure. These findings could
be instrumental in the investigation of room temperature wave scattering and
the implementation of novel microwave processing schemes in reconfigurable

the torus of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with low luminosity of $L_{\rm
bol}\lesssim 10^{42} erg s^{-1}$, constituting a new class of exoplanets
orbiting the supermassive black hole called \textit{blanets}. However, large
dust grains in the AGN torus may be rotationally disrupted by the Radiative
Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism due to AGN radiation feedback, which would
prevent the blanet formation. To test this scenario, we adopt the simple smooth
and clumpy dust/gas distribution inside the torus region to study the effect of
RATD on the evolution of composite dust grains in the midplane of the torus. We
found that grain growth and then blanet formation are possible in the smooth
torus model. However, in the clumpy torus model, grain growth will be strongly
constrained by RATD, assuming the gas density distribution as adopted in Wada
et al. We also found that icy grain mantles inside clumps are quickly detached
from the grain core by rotational desorption, reducing the sticking coefficient
between icy grains and coagulation efficiency. The grain rotational disruption
and ice desorption occur on timescales much shorter than the growth time up to
a factor of $\sim 10^{4}$, which are the new barriers that grain growth must
overcome to form blanets. Further studies with more realistic AGN models are
required to better constrain the effect of RATD on grain growth and blanet
formation hypothesis around low luminosity AGN.

minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD)
have attracted much attentions in high-dimensional data analysis, and have been
widely used in signal processing, image restoration, matrix estimation, etc.
However, in view of their non-convex and non-smooth characteristics, they are
computationally challenging. Almost all existing algorithms converge locally,
and the proper selection of initial values is crucial. Therefore, in actual
operation, they often combine a warm-starting technique to meet the rigid
requirement that the initial value must be sufficiently close to the optimal
solution of the corresponding problem. In this paper, based on the DC
(difference of convex functions) property of MCP and SCAD penalties, we aim to
design a global two-stage algorithm for the high-dimensional least squares
linear regression problems. A key idea for making the proposed algorithm to be
efficient is to use the primal dual active set with continuation (PDASC)
method, which is equivalent to the semi-smooth Newton (SSN) method, to solve
the corresponding sub-problems. Theoretically, we not only prove the global
convergence of the proposed algorithm, but also verify that the generated
iterative sequence converges to a d-stationary point. In terms of computational
performance, the abundant research of simulation and real data show that the
algorithm in this paper is superior to the latest SSN method and the classic

computer vision tasks. However, modelling global correlations with multi-head
self-attention (MSA) layers leads to two widely recognized issues: the massive
computational resource consumption and the lack of intrinsic inductive bias for
modelling local visual patterns. To solve both issues, we devise a simple yet
effective method named Single-Path Vision Transformer pruning (SPViT), to
efficiently and automatically compress the pre-trained ViTs into compact models
with proper locality added. Specifically, we first propose a novel
weight-sharing scheme between MSA and convolutional operations, delivering a
single-path space to encode all candidate operations. In this way, we cast the
operation search problem as finding which subset of parameters to use in each
MSA layer, which significantly reduces the computational cost and optimization
difficulty, and the convolution kernels can be well initialized using
pre-trained MSA parameters. Relying on the single-path space, we further
introduce learnable binary gates to encode the operation choices, which are
jointly optimized with network parameters to automatically determine the
configuration of each layer. We conduct extensive experiments on two
representative ViTs showing that our SPViT achieves a new SOTA for pruning on
ImageNet-1k. For example, our SPViT can trim 52.0% FLOPs for DeiT-B and get an
impressive 0.6% top-1 accuracy gain simultaneously. The source code is

significant strengthening, or false signatures, of stellar concentrations are

represented as a diffuse scalar field and an interface seeding method is
employed to mediate the interface boundary conditions. The method is based on
an existing multi-material diffuse interface method that is capable of handling
an arbitrary mixture of fluids and elastoplastic solids. The underlying method
is general and can be extended to a range of different applications including
high-strain rate deformation in elastoplastic solids and reactive fluid
mixtures. As such, the new method presented here is thoroughly tested through a
variety of problems, including fluid-rigid body interaction,
elastoplastic-rigid body interaction, and detonation-structure interaction.
Comparison is drawn between both experimental work and previous numerical
results, with excellent agreement in both cases. The new method is
straightforward to implement, highly local, and parallelisable. This allows the
method to be employed in three dimensions with multiple levels of adaptive mesh
refinement using complex immersed geometries. The rigid body field can be
static or dynamic, with the THINC interface reconstruction method being used to
keep the interface sharp in the dynamic case.

easily synthesizable and stable at ambient conditions, our findings open new

light on the dipolar fluctuations of a thermal ensemble of nuclear spins in a
diamond crystal structure, hyperfine-coupled to a central spin. The raw time
series of the nuclear spin bath coherent dynamics is acquired through the
two-point correlation function computed using the cluster correlation expansion
method. The dynamics can be conveniently analyzed according to zero-, single-,
and double-quantum transitions derived from the dipolar pairwise spin flips. We
show that in the early-time behavior when the coherence is preserved in the
spin ensemble, the Overhauser field fluctuations are modulated by
dipole-dipole-induced small inhomogeneous detunings of nearly resonant
transitions within the bath. The resulting beating extending over relatively
longer time intervals is featured on the scalograms where both temporal and
spectral behaviors of nuclear spin noise are unveiled simultaneously. Moreover,
a second kind of beating that affects faster dynamics is readily discernible,
originating from the inhomogeneous spread of the hyperfine coupling of each
nucleus with the central spin. Additionally, any quadrupolar nuclei within the
bath imprint as beating residing in the zero-quantum channel. The nuclear spin
environment can be directionally probed by orienting the hyperfine axis.
Thereby, crucial spatial information about the closely separated spin clusters
surrounding the central spin are accessible. Thus, a wavelet-based post
processing can facilitate the identification of proximal nuclear spins as
revealed by their unique beating patterns on the scalograms. Finally, when
these features are overwhelmed by either weakly or strongly coupled classical
noise sources, we demonstrate the efficacy of thresholding techniques in the

for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, as the RIS technology provides a
new solution to control the propagation channel in order to improve the
efficiency of a wireless link through enhancing the received signal power. In
this paper, we propose RIS-assisted receive quadrature space-shift keying
(RIS-RQSSK), which enhances the spectral efficiency of an RIS-based index
modulation (IM) system by using the real and imaginary dimensions independently
for the purpose of IM. Therefore, the error rate performance of the system is
improved as all RIS elements reflect the incident transmit signal toward both
selected receive antennas. At the receiver, a low-complexity but effective
greedy detector (GD) can be employed which determines the maximum energy per
dimension at the receive antennas. A max-min optimization problem is defined to
maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) components at both selected
receive antennas; an analytical solution is provided based on Lagrange duality.
In particular, the multi-variable optimization problem is shown to reduce to
the solution of a single-variable equation, which results in a very simple
design procedure. In addition, we investigate the average bit error probability
(ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSSK system and derive a closed-form approximate
upper bound on the ABEP. We also provide extensive numerical simulations to
validate our derivations. Numerical results show that the proposed RIS-RQSSK
scheme substantially outperforms recent prominent benchmark schemes. This
enhancement considerably increases with an increasing number of receive
antennas.

parallel corpora of English and Indian languages and an English NER dataset.
The proposed framework includes an annotation projection method that combines
word alignment score and NER tag prediction confidence score on source language
(English) data to generate weakly labeled data in a target Indian language. We
employ a variant of the Teacher-Student model and optimize it jointly on the
pseudo labels of the Teacher model and predictions on the generated weakly
labeled data. We also present manually annotated test sets for three Indian
languages: Hindi, Bengali, and Gujarati. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed framework on the test sets of the three Indian languages. Empirical
results show a minimum 10% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot
transfer learning model on all languages. This indicates that weakly labeled
data generated using the proposed annotation projection method in target Indian
languages can complement well-annotated source language data to enhance
performance. Our code is publicly available at

procedure is suitably robust. This is a well-known issue and has been addressed
in Robust Statistics, however, the relation of contamination and distorted
variable selection has been rarely considered in literature. As for variable
selection, many methods for sparse model selection have been proposed,
including the Stability Selection which is a meta-algorithm based on some
variable selection algorithm in order to immunize against particular data
configurations. We introduce the variable selection breakdown point that
quantifies the number of cases resp. cells that have to be contaminated in
order to let no relevant variable be detected. We show that particular outlier
configurations can completely mislead model selection and argue why even
cell-wise robust methods cannot fix this problem. We combine the variable
selection breakdown point with resampling, resulting in the Stability Selection
breakdown point that quantifies the robustness of Stability Selection. We
propose a trimmed Stability Selection which only aggregates the models with the
lowest in-sample losses so that, heuristically, models computed on heavily
contaminated resamples should be trimmed away. An extensive simulation study
with non-robust regression and classification algorithms as well as with Sparse
Least Trimmed Squares reveals both the potential of our approach to boost the
model selection robustness as well as the fragility of variable selection using
non-robust algorithms, even for an extremely small cell-wise contamination
rate.

explicit use of proof rules based on induction over the ADTs. The main
extension over previous techniques for ADT removal is a new transformation
rule, called differential replacement, which allows us to introduce auxiliary
predicates, whose definitions correspond to lemmas that are used when making
inductive proofs. We present an algorithm that performs the automatic removal
of ADTs by applying the new rule, together with the traditional

non-contrastive representation learning for downstream clustering task.
Contrastive-based methods thanks to negative pairs learn uniform
representations for clustering, in which negative pairs, however, may
inevitably lead to the class collision issue and consequently compromise the
clustering performance. Non-contrastive-based methods, on the other hand, avoid
class collision issue, but the resulting non-uniform representations may cause
the collapse of clustering. To enjoy the strengths of both worlds, this paper
presents a novel end-to-end deep clustering method with prototype scattering
and positive sampling, termed ProPos. Specifically, we first maximize the
distance between prototypical representations, named prototype scattering loss,
which improves the uniformity of representations. Second, we align one
augmented view of instance with the sampled neighbors of another view --
assumed to be truly positive pair in the embedding space -- to improve the
within-cluster compactness, termed positive sampling alignment. The strengths
of ProPos are avoidable class collision issue, uniform representations,
well-separated clusters, and within-cluster compactness. By optimizing ProPos
in an end-to-end expectation-maximization framework, extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ProPos achieves competing performance on
moderate-scale clustering benchmark datasets and establishes new

superconducting qubits and, recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). We
propose that the quantum capacitance arising in electronic two-level systems
(the dual of Josephson inductance) can provide an alternative dissipation-less
non-linear element for parametric amplification. We experimentally demonstrate
phase-sensitive parametric amplification using a QD-reservoir electron
transition in a CMOS nanowire split-gate transistor embedded in a 1.8~GHz
superconducting lumped-element microwave cavity, achieving parametric gains of
-3 to +3 dB, limited by Sisyphus dissipation. Using a semi-classical model, we
find an optimised design within current technological capabilities could
achieve gains and bandwidths comparable to JPAs, while providing complementary
specifications with respect to integration in semiconductor platforms or
operation at higher magnetic fields.

However, such techniques have not yet met the same success in the realm of

This challenge has recently motivated the design of novel variance reduction

for time-resolved transmission spectroscopy observations that probe independent

However, object detection is much more sophisticated and most knowledge

Focal distillation separates the foreground and background, forcing the student
to focus on the teacher's critical pixels and channels. Global distillation
rebuilds the relation between different pixels and transfers it from teachers
to students, compensating for missing global information in focal distillation.
As our method only needs to calculate the loss on the feature map, FGD can be
applied to various detectors. We experiment on various detectors with different
backbones and the results show that the student detector achieves excellent mAP

synapse capacity (big cores have higher capacity than the little ones), and
they are interconnected using a parallel segmented bus interconnect, which
leads to lower latency and energy compared to a traditional mesh-based
Network-on-Chip (NoC). We propose a system software framework called SentryOS

of a compiler and a run-time manager. The compiler compiles an SDCNN

With the CSI from the available BSs, UE localization can be performed in
different ways. One the one hand, a single neural network (NN) can be trained
for the UE localization by considering the CSI from all the available BSs as
one overall fingerprint of the user's location. On the other hand, the CSI at

associated with global permutation equivariance by operating more locally on
sub-graphs. In addition, through operating on sub-graphs the expressive power

then investigated with ab initio calculations to determine kink-pair formation,
nucleation and migration energies. These energies are used in kinetic
Monte-Carlo simulations and in an analytical model to obtain the velocity of
screw dislocations as a function of the temperature, the applied stress and the

Nevertheless, we have just visited tens of asteroids while we have discovered

understand the remains of planetary building materials. One of the mission
design solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple
Earth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a
subclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys,
involving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a
combinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the
number of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem
expands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby
cycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural
networks approximating trajectory optimization results. Since one of the
bottlenecks of machine learning approaches is the computation time to generate
massive trajectory databases, we propose an efficient database generation
strategy by introducing pseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions. The numerical result applied to JAXA's DESTINY+ mission shows that
the proposed method is practically applicable to space mission design and can
significantly reduce the computational time for searching asteroid flyby

nanoscale information carriers in non-volatile memory and logic devices. While
room-temperature magnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation were
recently demonstrated, the stray field resulting from their finite
magnetization as well as their topological charge limit their minimum size and
reliable motion in tracks. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions allow these
limitations to be lifted owing to their vanishing magnetization and net zero
topological charge, promising room-temperature, ultrasmall skyrmions, fast
dynamics, and insensitivity to external magnetic fields. While room-temperature
AF spin textures have been recently demonstrated, the observation and
controlled nucleation of AF skyrmions operable at room temperature in
industry-compatible synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) material systems is still

techniques, we are able to observe the skyrmions in the different SAF layers

micromagnetic simulations and analytical models using experimental parameters,

also demonstrate the local nucleation of SAF skyrmions via local current
injection as well as ultrafast laser excitations at zero field. These results
will enable the utilization of SAF skyrmions in skyrmion-based devices.

greatly advanced the state-of-the-art in the detection of clouds in satellite

of training images with expensive pixel-level cloud labels. To alleviate this
cost, we propose Fixed-Point GAN for Cloud Detection (FCD), a weakly-supervised
approach. Training with only image-level labels, we learn fixed-point
translation between clear and cloudy images, so only clouds are affected during
translation. Doing so enables our approach to predict pixel-level cloud labels
by translating satellite images to clear ones and setting a threshold to the
difference between the two images. Moreover, we propose FCD+, where we exploit
the label-noise robustness of CNNs to refine the prediction of FCD, leading to
further improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
Landsat-8 Biome cloud detection dataset, where we obtain performance close to
existing fully-supervised methods that train with expensive pixel-level labels.
By fine-tuning our FCD+ with just 1% of the available pixel-level labels, we
match the performance of fully-supervised methods.

road condition data are constantly being generated and sent to the cloud for
processing. However, this introduces a significant load on the network
bandwidth causing delay in the network and for a time-critical application like
VANET such delay may have severe impact on real-time traffic management. This
delay maybe reduced by offloading some computational tasks to devices as close
as possible to the vehicles. Further, security and privacy of vehicles is
another important concern in such applications. Thus, this paper proposes a
secure road condition monitoring scheme for fog-based vehicular networks. It
considers Road-Side Units (RSUs) with computational capabilities, which act as
intermediate fog nodes in between vehicles and cloud to reduce delay in
decision making and thereby increases scalability. Apart from fulfilling basic
security features, our scheme also supports advanced features like
unlinkability and untraceability. A detailed security analysis proves that the
proposed scheme can handle both internal and external adversaries. We also
justify the efficiency of our scheme through theoretical overhead analysis.
Finally, the scheme is simulated using an integrated SUMO and NS-3 platform to
show its feasibility for practical implementations while not compromising on
the network performance. The results show an average 80.96\% and 37.5\%
improvement in execution time and end-to-end delay respectively while
maintaining at par results for packet delivery ratio over a state-of-the-art

fusion. In the first stage, two parameterized samplers are designed to learn
the preference structure adaptively with network reconstruction tasks. In the
second stage, an additional attention layer is designed to fuse two sampled

In order
to compare them on equal footing, one uses the so-called distance-based
approach where different types of correlations are captured by the distance to
different sets of states. However, these quantifiers are usually hard to
compute as their definition involves optimization aiming to find the closest
states within the set. On the other hand, negativity is one of the few
computable entanglement monotones, but its comparison with other correlations
required further justification. Here we place negativity as part of a family of
correlation measures that has a distance-based construction. We introduce a
suitable distance, discuss the emerging measures and their applications, and
compare them to relative entropy-based correlation quantifiers. This work is a
step towards correlation measures that are simultaneously comparable and
computable.

arises as a secondary effect, induced by a structural instability in the

polar axis. However, previous X-ray diffraction studies on gadolinium molybdate
have been restricted by the limited ability to include the entire 2{\theta}
range in the analysis, and thus, at atomic scale, much remains to be explored.
By applying temperature dependent X-ray diffraction, we observe the transition
from the paraelectric tetragonal phase to the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase.
The ferroelastic strain is calculated based on the thermal evolution of the
lattice parameters and Rietveld refinement of the temperature dependent data
reveals that the displacement of different cations follows different critical

estimator for low-rank channel covariance matrices is presented in this paper,
using a generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) of two covariance matrices
that can be estimated from the available uplink data. The requirements for the
systems are minimal and, except for synchronization, there is no need for
communication between the different cells and no prior knowledge on the

individual changes to a common code base. When the merge algorithm fails, this
is called a merge conflict. The conflict either manifests in textual merge
conflicts where the merge fails to produce code, or semantic merge conflicts
where the merged code results in compiler or test breaks. Resolving these

radio core power, core dominance factor, total radio power, jet kinetic power

radio galaxies (GRGs), GRQs have higher black hole mass and Eddington ratio.
The high core dominance factor of SRQs is an indicator of them lying closer to
the line of sight than GRQs. We also find a correlation of the accretion disc
luminosity with the radio core and jet power of GRQs, which provides evidence
for disc-jet coupling. Lastly, we find the distributions of Eddington ratios of
GRGs and GRQs to be bi-modal, similar to that found in small radio galaxies

scenario jets uplift and entrain cold and dense clumps, impart the clumps
velocity perpendicular to the original jets' direction, and `drop' them closer
to the jets' axis. The angular momentum of these clumps is at a very high angle
to the original jets' axis. When these clumps feed the SMBH in the next
outburst (jet-launching episode) the new jets' axis might be at a high angle to
the axis of the first pair of jets. I apply this scenario to recent
observations that show the two perpendicular pairs of bubbles in RBS 797 to
have a small age difference of <10Myr, and conclude that the jets-clumps
interaction takes place in a distance of about 10-100 pc from the SMBH.
Interestingly, in this zone the escape velocity from the SMBH is about equal to

finite groups. Specifically, we use the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension (WL) to
characterize, compare and quantify the effectiveness and complexity of
invariants for group isomorphism.
  It turns out that a surprising number of invariants and characteristic
subgroups that are classic to group theory can be detected and identified by a
low dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. These include the center, the inner
automorphism group, the commutator subgroup and the derived series, the abelian
radical, the solvable radical, the Fitting group and $\pi$-radicals. A low
dimensional WL algorithm additionally determines the isomorphism type of the
socle as well as the factors in the derived series and the upper and lower
central series.
  We also analyze the behavior of the WL algorithm for group extensions and
prove that a low dimensional WL algorithm determines the isomorphism types of
the composition factors of a group.
  Finally we develop a new tool to define a canonical maximal central
decomposition for groups. This allows us to show that the Weisfeiler-Leman
dimension of a group is at most one larger than the dimensions of its direct
indecomposable factors. In other words the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension increases
by at most 1 when taking direct products.

the radiative influence of ionization sources. They are associated with peak
patches of reionization redshift (zreion) field, for which we measure their
general properties (e.g. number, size, shape, orientation). We aim at gaining

construct exact black holes for two families of self-interactions that admit

a commercially available option for measuring MRI k-space trajectories and

algorithm to automatically perform this synchronization using only the MRI and

the MRI data, trajectory data, and receiver sensitivity profiles by iteratively
alternating between convex optimizations for (a) the image and (b) the
synchronization delay. A healthy human subject was scanned at 7T using a
transmit-receive coil with integrated field probes using both single shot
spiral and echo-planar imaging (EPI), and reconstructions with various
synchronization delays were compared to the result of the proposed algorithm.
The accuracy of the algorithm was also investigated using simulations, where
the acquisition delays for simulated acquisitions were determined using the
proposed algorithm and compared to the known ground truth. Results: In the in

synchronization delay for both spiral and EPI acquisitions, and the computation
time required was less than 30 seconds. The simulations demonstrated accuracy
to within tens of nanoseconds. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm can

means of a genetic algorithm previously developed to parameterize the

set that simultaneously fits the DFT energies obtained for several crystalline

most precise framework for the estimation of scale parameters that is allowed
by the laws of quantum mechanics. This addresses an important gap in quantum
metrology, since current practice focuses almost exclusively on the estimation
of phase and location parameters. For given prior probability and quantum
state, and using Bayesian principles, a rule to construct the optimal
probability-operator measurement is provided. Furthermore, the corresponding
minimum mean logarithmic error is identified. This is then generalised as to
accommodate the simultaneous estimation of multiple scale parameters, and a
procedure to classify practical measurements into optimal, almost-optimal or
sub-optimal is highlighted. As a means of illustration, the new framework is
exploited to generalise scale-invariant global thermometry, as well as to
address the estimation of the lifetime of an atomic state. On a more conceptual
note, the optimal strategy is employed to construct an observable for scale
parameters, an approach which may serve as a template for a more systematic
search of quantum observables. Quantum scale estimation thus opens a new line

techniques mainly focus on face frontalization or face augmentation in image
space. However, transforming face images in image space is not guaranteed to
preserve the lossless identity features of the original image. Moreover, these
methods suffer from more computational costs and memory requirements due to the
additional models. We argue that it is more desirable to perform feature
transformation in hierarchical feature space rather than image space, which can
take advantage of different feature levels and benefit from joint learning with
representation learning. To this end, we propose a lightweight and
easy-to-implement attention block, named Pose Attention Module (PAM), for
pose-invariant face recognition. Specifically, PAM performs frontal-profile
feature transformation in hierarchical feature space by learning residuals
between pose variations with a soft gate mechanism. We validated the
effectiveness of PAM block design through extensive ablation studies and
verified the performance on several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,
AgeDB-30, CPLFW, and CALFW. Experimental results show that our method not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also effectively reduces memory
requirements by more than 75 times. It is noteworthy that our method is not
limited to face recognition with large pose variations. By adjusting the soft
gate mechanism of PAM to a specific coefficient, such semantic attention block
can easily extend to address other intra-class imbalance problems in face
recognition, including large variations in age, illumination, expression, etc.

significant for macroscopic single crystals where bulk diffusion is in fact
present. We observe that the internal magnetic field fluctuations caused by the

TeV at midrapidity ($|y| <0.5$) with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The
measurements are performed as a function of the charm-hadron transverse
momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in intervals of charged-particle multiplicity, measured
with two multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions.
While the strange to non-strange $D^{+}_{\rm s}$/$D^{0}$ ratio indicates no
significant multiplicity dependence, the baryon-to-meson $p_{\rm
T}$-differential $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$/$D^{0}$ ratio shows a
multiplicity-dependent enhancement, with a significance of 5.3$\sigma$ for $1<
p_{\rm T} < 12$ GeV/$c$, comparing the highest multiplicity interval with
respect to the lowest one. The measurements are compared with a theoretical
model that explains the multiplicity dependence by a canonical treatment of
quantum charges in the statistical hadronisation approach, and with predictions
from event generators that implement colour reconnection mechanisms beyond the
leading colour approximation to model the hadronisation process. The
$\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$/$D^{0}$ ratios as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ present a
similar shape and magnitude as the $\Lambda/K^{0}_{s}$ ratios in comparable
multiplicity intervals, suggesting a potential common mechanism for light- and
charm-hadron formation, with analogous multiplicity dependence. The $p_{\rm
T}$-integrated ratios, extrapolated down to $p_{\rm T}$=0, do not show a
significant dependence on multiplicity within the uncertainties.

operators $(O,R^a_{\mu})$ corresponding, respectively, to the gauge invariant

analyzed to all orders in perturbation theory by means of the algebraic
renormalization in the $SU(2)$ Higgs model, with a single scalar in the
fundamental representation, when quantized in the Landau gauge in Euclidean
space-time. The present analysis generalizes earlier results presented in the
case of the $U(1)$ Higgs model. A powerful global Ward identity, related to an
exact custodial symmetry, is derived for the first time, with deep consequences
at the quantum level. In particular, the gauge invariant vector operators
$R^a_{\mu}$ turn out to be the conserved Noether currents of the
above-mentioned custodial symmetry. As such, these composite operators do not
renormalize, as expressed by the fact that the renormalization $Z$-factors of
the corresponding external sources, needed to define the operators $R^a_{\mu}$
at the quantum level, do not receive any quantum corrections. Another
consistency feature of our analysis is that the longitudinal component of the
two-point correlation function $\langle R^a_\mu(p) R^b_\nu(-p) \rangle$
exhibits only a tree level non-vanishing contribution which, moreover, is
momentum independent, being thus not associated to any physical propagating
mode. Finally, we point out that the renowned non-renormalization theorem for
the ghost-antighost-vector boson vertex in Landau gauge remains true to all

biological cognition mechanisms and consider the system as an agent equipped
with an information processor (or a group of such agents), which makes a move
in the environment, consumes information supplied by the environment, and gives
out the next move (hence, the process is considered as a game). The system
moves in an unknown environment and should recognize new objects located in it.
In this case, the system should build comprehensive images of visible things
and memorize them if necessary (and it should also choose the current goal
set). The main problems here are object recognition, and the informational
reward rating in the game. Thus, the main novelty of the paper is a new method
of evaluating the amount of visual information about the object as the reward.
In such a system, we suggest using a minimally pre-trained neural network to be
responsible for the recognition: at first, we train the network only for
Biederman geons (geometrical primitives). The geons are generated
programmatically and we demonstrate that such a trained network recognizes
geons in real objects quite well. We also offer to generate, procedurally, new
objects from geon schemes (geon combinations in images) obtained from the
environment and to store them in a database. In this case, we do not obtain new
information about an object (i.e., our reward is maximal, thus the game and the
object cognition process stop) when we stop getting new schemes of this kind.
These schemes are generated from geons connected with the object. In the case
of a possibly known item, the informational reward is maximal when we have no
more detection uncertainty for any of the objects.

an open challenge in theoretical physics. In this study, the main algebraic
approaches used to generalize the Dirac and Kemmer Duffin equations for
particles of arbitrary spin are investigated. It is proved that an irreducible
relativistic equation formulated using spin matrices satisfying the commutation
relations of the anti-de Sitter group leads to inconsistent results, mainly as
a consequence of violation of unitarity and the appearance of a mass spectrum
that does not reflect the physical reality of elementary particles. However,
the introduction of subsidiary conditions resolves the problem of unitarity and
restores the physical meaning of the mass spectrum. The equations obtained by
these approaches are solved and the physical nature of the solutions is
discussed.

  Synchronization","PLDI 2023",,,,"cs.PL cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Writing concurrent code that is both correct and efficient is notoriously
difficult. Thus, programmers often prefer to use synchronization abstractions,
which render code simpler and easier to reason about. Despite a wealth of work
on this topic, there is still a gap between the rich semantics provided by
synchronization abstractions in modern programming languages -- specifically,
\emph{fair} FIFO ordering of synchronization requests and support for
\emph{abortable} operations -- and frameworks for implementing it correctly and
efficiently. Supporting such semantics is critical given the rising popularity
of constructs for asynchronous programming, such as coroutines, which abort
frequently and are cheaper to suspend and resume compared to native threads.
  This paper introduces a new framework called
\texttt{CancellableQueueSynchronizer} (CQS), which enables simple yet efficient
implementations of a wide range of fair and abortable synchronization
primitives: mutexes, semaphores, barriers, count-down latches, and blocking
pools. Our main contribution is algorithmic, as implementing both fairness and
abortability efficiently at this level of generality is non-trivial.
Importantly, all our algorithms, including the CQS framework and the primitives
built on top of it, come with \emph{formal proofs} in the Iris framework for
Coq for many of their properties. These proofs are modular, so it is easy to
show correctness for new primitives implemented on top of CQS. From a practical
perspective, implementation of CQS for native threads on the JVM significantly
improves Java's \texttt{AbstractQueuedSynchronizer}, the only practical
abstraction offering similar semantics. In sum,
\texttt{CancellableQueueSynchronizer} is the first framework to combine
expressiveness with formal guarantees and solid practical performance.

model. The workflow is successfully demonstrated in the 3D channelized

training and validating data. Moreover, the application is extended for a
stress test by adding signal noise to the seismic data, and the workflow
results show a robust estimation even with 5\% of noise. Another two ResUNet++
are trained to take either the lowest or highest resolution seismic data only
to estimate the porosity model, but they show under- and over-fitting results,
supporting the importance of using decomposed seismic data in porosity
estimation.

difficulty in interpreting sophisticated machine learning models, whose
ever-increasing complexity makes it hard for such models to be understood,

of interpretability for these so-called black-box models can lead to serious
economic and ethical consequences, thereby hindering the development and
deployment of AI in wider fields, particularly in those involving critical and
regulatory applications. Yet, the building services industry is a
highly-regulated domain requiring transparency and decision-making processes
that can be understood and trusted by humans. To this end, the design and
implementation of autonomous Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems
for the automatic but concurrently interpretable optimisation of energy
efficiency and room thermal comfort is of topical interest. This work therefore
presents an interpretable machine learning model aimed at predicting room
temperature in non-domestic buildings, for the purpose of optimising the use of
the installed HVAC system. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed
model can accurately forecast room temperatures eight hours ahead in real-time
by taking into account historical RT information, as well as additional
environmental and time-series features. In this paper, an enhanced feature
engineering process is conducted based on the Exploratory Data Analysis
results. Furthermore, beyond the commonly used Interpretable Machine Learning
techniques, we propose a Permutation Feature-based Frequency Response Analysis
(PF-FRA) method for quantifying the contributions of the different predictors
in the frequency domain. Based on the generated reason codes, we find that the
historical RT feature is the dominant factor that has most impact on the model

approximation purposes, as they achieved good accuracy results while being
extremely flexible and versatile. In this work, we put our focus on the context
of periodic signals sampled with spatial measurements. The optimization
problems are penalized thanks to the total variation norm, using a specific
class of (pseudo-)differential operators to use well-chosen reconstruction
functions. We introduce three algorithms and their adaptation to this specific
use case. The first one is a discrete grid-based $\ell_1$ method, the second is
called CPGD, which relies on the estimation of discrete innovations within the
FRI framework, and the last one is the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We put the
emphasis on that later algorithm as we underline its greedy behavior. We
consider a refined version of this algorithm, that leads to very encouraging
outputs. We pursue the algorithmic treatment with a theoretical analysis of the
optimization problem, based on convexity and duality theory. We draw away two
conditions that, if verified by the differential operator, would inform on the
shape of the solutions and even ensure uniqueness, in some cases. Moreover, we
demonstrate the general expression of periodic one-dimensional exponential
splines, as a first step to verify the latter conditions for exponential
operators.

strategies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases while maintaining some
level of in person learning. In response, the proposed approach recursively
applied a quantum annealing algorithm for Max-Cut optimization on D-Wave
Systems, which grouped students into cohorts such that the number of possible
infection events via shared classrooms was minimized. To test this approach,
available coursework data was used to generate highly clustered course
enrollment networks representing students and the classes they share. The
algorithm was then recursively called on these networks to group students, and
a disease model was applied to forecast disease spread. Simulation results
showed that under some assumptions on disease statistics and methods of spread,
the quantum grouping method reduced both the total and peak percentage of
infected students when compared against random groupings of students. Scaling
to larger networks, it is possible that this quantum annealer-assisted grouping
approach may provide practical advantage over classical approaches. This paper,
however, is strictly a proof-of-concept demonstration of the approach and is
not intended to argue for a quantum speedup.

independent columns. The fact has become the most fundamental theorem in linear
algebra such that we may favor it in an unconscious way. The sole aim of this
paper is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical
tools for the rank of a matrix in order to seamlessly introduce how it works in
applied linear algebra. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all
the useful and interesting results concerning this topic and given the paucity
of scope to present this discussion, e.g., a proof via the injective linear
map. We refer the reader to literature in the field of linear algebra for a
more detailed introduction to the related fields.

costly task in which the employees account for a large part of the warehouse
performance. Hence, many approaches exist, that optimize the order picking
process based on diverse economic criteria. However, most of these approaches
focus on a single economic objective at once and disregard ergonomic criteria
in their optimization. Further, the influence of the placement of the items to
be picked is underestimated and accordingly, too little attention is paid to
the interdependence of these two problems. In this work, we aim at optimizing
the storage assignment and the order picking problem within mezzanine warehouse
with regards to their reciprocal influence. We propose a customized version of
the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for optimizing the
storage assignment problem as well as an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
algorithm for optimizing the order picking problem. Both algorithms incorporate
multiple economic and ergonomic constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, the
algorithms incorporate knowledge about the interdependence between both
problems, aiming to improve the overall warehouse performance. Our evaluation
results show that our proposed algorithms return better storage assignments and
order pick routes compared to commonly used techniques for the following
quality indicators for comparing Pareto fronts: Coverage, Generational
Distance, Euclidian Distance, Pareto Front Size, and Inverted Generational
Distance. Additionally, the evaluation regarding the interaction of both
algorithms shows a better performance when combining both proposed algorithms.
