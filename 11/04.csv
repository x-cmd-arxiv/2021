collision-induced absorption (CIA) due to CH$_4-$N$_2$ pairs at temperatures
between 70 and 400 K. Our analysis utilizes recently calculated high-level
potential energy (PES) and induced dipole surfaces (IDS) [Finenko, A. A.,
Chistikov, D. N., Kalugina, Y. N., Conway E. K., Gordon, I. E., Phys. Chem.
Chem. Phys., 2021, doi: 10.1039/d1cp02161c]. Treating collision partners as
rigid rotors, the time evolution of interaction-induced dipole is accumulated
over a vast ensemble of classical trajectories and subsequently transformed
into CIA spectrum via Fourier transform. In our calculations, both bound and
unbound states are properly accounted for, and the rigorous theory of
lower-order spectral moments is addressed to check the accuracy of simulated
profiles. Classically derived trajectory-based profiles are subject to two
approximate desymmetrization procedures so that resulting profiles conform to
the quantum principle of detailed balance. The simulated profiles are compared
to laboratory measurements and employed for modeling Titan's spectra in the
50-500 cm$^{-1}$ range. Based on the desymmetrized simulated profiles, a new
semi-empirical model for CH$_4-$N$_2$ CIA is proposed for modeling Titan's
infrared spectra. Synthetic spectra derived using this model yield an excellent
agreement with the data recorded by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS)
aboard the Cassini spacecraft at low and high emission angles.

applications due to the fascinating spin-momentum locking (SML) of the surface
states. One particular interest lies in using TIs as spin-polarized sources for
spintronics structures. Here, we propose the band tilt induced nonlinear Nernst
effect (NLNE) in TIs as a clean and efficient route to generate
high-performance spin polarization (SP). We show that in the presence of SML
and hexagonal warping effect a finite band tilt can induce an imbalance of two
spin carriers and effectively give rise to spin-polarized NLNE current in TIs.
In our scheme, both the spin current and charge current regime can be achieved
under the thermal drive. The obtainable SP can be efficiently tuned in either a
smooth or rapid way, exhibiting highly flexible tunability. In addition,
near-unity SP can be generated within a wide range of tunable parameters, which
is also found to be robust against temperature. Therefore, our work provides a
mechanism to realize controllable room-temperature high-degree SP based on TIs,
which is of essential importance for future spintronics applications.

learn an underlying distribution to generate synthetic data. Many existing
studies of GANs focus on improving the realness of the generated image data for
visual applications, and few of them concern about improving the quality of the
generated data for training other classifiers -- a task known as the model
compatibility problem. As a consequence, existing GANs often prefer generating
`easier' synthetic data that are far from the boundaries of the classifiers,
and refrain from generating near-boundary data, which are known to play an
important roles in training the classifiers. To improve GAN in terms of model
compatibility, we propose Boundary-Calibration GANs (BCGANs), which leverage
the boundary information from a set of pre-trained classifiers using the
original data. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary Boundary-Calibration
loss (BC-loss) into the generator of GAN to match the statistics between the
posterior distributions of original data and generated data with respect to the
boundaries of the pre-trained classifiers. The BC-loss is provably unbiased and
can be easily coupled with different GAN variants to improve their model
compatibility. Experimental results demonstrate that BCGANs not only generate
realistic images like original GANs but also achieves superior model
compatibility than the original GANs.

were heavily studied to measure their prevalence and impacts on test
maintainability. However, these studies focused mainly on the unit level and to
this day, the work on system tests that interact with the System Under Test
through a Graphical User Interface remains limited. To fill the gap, we conduct
an exploratory analysis of test smells occurring in System User Interactive
Tests (SUIT). First, based on a multi-vocal literature review, we propose a
catalog of 35 SUIT-specific smells. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis to
assess the prevalence and refactoring of these smells in 48 industrial test
suites and 12 open-source projects. We show that the same type of smells tends
to appear in industrial and open-source projects, but the symptoms are not
addressed in the same way. Smells such as Obscure Test, Sneaky Checking, and
Over Checking show symptoms in more than 70% of the tests. Yet refactoring
actions are much less frequent with less than 50% of the affected tests ever
undergoing refactoring. Interestingly, while refactoring actions are rare, some
smells, such as Narcissistic, disappear through the removal of old symptomatic
tests and the introduction of new tests not presenting such symptoms.

(RMQ) problem requires us to construct a data structure from $A$, supporting
the RMQ query: given an interval $[a,b]\subseteq[1,n]$, return the index of the
minimum element in subarray $A[a\ldots b]$, i.e. return
$\text{argmin}_{i\in[a,b]}A[i]$. The fundamental problem has a long history.
The textbook solution which uses $O(n)$ words of space and $O(1)$ time by
Gabow, Bentley, Tarjan (STOC 1984) and Harel, Tarjan (SICOMP 1984) dates back
to 1980s. The state-of-the-art solution is presented by Fischer, Heun (SICOMP
2011) and Navarro, Sadakane (TALG 2014). The solution uses $2n-1.5\log
n+n/\left(\frac{\log n}{t}\right)^t+\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ bits of space and
$O(t)$ query time, where the additive $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ is a pre-computed
lookup table used in the RAM model, assuming the word-size is $\Theta(\log n)$
bits. On the other hand, the only known lower bound is proved by Liu and Yu
(STOC 2020). They show that any data structure which solves RMQ in $t$ query
time must use $2n-1.5\log n+n/(\log n)^{O(t^2\log^2t)}$ bits of space, assuming
the word-size is $\Theta(\log n)$ bits.
  In this paper, we prove nearly tight lower bound for this problem. We show
that, for any data structure which solves RMQ in $t$ query time, $2n-1.5\log
n+n/(\log n)^{O(t\log^2t)}$ bits of space is necessary in the cell-probe model

is becoming a limiting factor to the available memory capacity in consumer

non-volatile memories (NVMs) into the market, which can be used to increase the
memory capacity of consumer devices by augmenting or replacing DRAM. Since
entirely replacing DRAM with NVM in consumer devices imposes large system
integration and design challenges, recent works propose extending the total
main memory space available to applications by using NVM as swap space for
DRAM. However, no prior work analyzes the implications of enabling a real
NVM-based swap space in real consumer devices.
  In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of extending the
main memory space of consumer devices using off-the-shelf NVMs. We extensively
examine system performance and energy consumption when the NVM device is used
as swap space for DRAM main memory to effectively extend the main memory

Optane SSD capacity is used as swap space to extend main memory capacity,
against two state-of-the-art systems: (i) a baseline system with double the

subcritical regime, of any sparse (possibly directed) graph with conditionally

widely used network families like stochastic block models, dot-product graphs,

asymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of

neural network models against adversarial attacks. However, there still a
notable gap between the nature accuracy and the robust accuracy. We found one
of the reasons is the commonly used labels, one-hot vectors, hinder the
learning process for image recognition. In this paper, we proposed a method,
called Low Temperature Distillation (LTD), which is based on the knowledge
distillation framework to generate the desired soft labels. Unlike the previous
work, LTD uses relatively low temperature in the teacher model, and employs
different, but fixed, temperatures for the teacher model and the student model.
Moreover, we have investigated the methods to synergize the use of nature data
and adversarial ones in LTD. Experimental results show that without extra
unlabeled data, the proposed method combined with the previous work can achieve
57.72\% and 30.36\% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset
respectively, which is about 1.21\% improvement of the state-of-the-art methods

enforce a consistent performance vs. complexity trade-off throughout the

HS3-Fuse, to aggregate the hierarchical features generated by these layers,
which can provide rich semantic contexts and further enhance the final
segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed HS3 scheme
considerably outperforms vanilla deep supervision with no added inference cost.
Our proposed HS3-Fuse framework further improves segmentation predictions and

setting as among other reasons it circumvents the problems of reward
mis-specification and exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). In IL from
demonstrations, an important challenge is to obtain agent policies that are
smooth with respect to the inputs. Learning through imitation a policy that is
smooth as a function of a large state-action ($s$-$a$) space (typical of high
dimensional continuous control environments) can be challenging. We take a
first step towards tackling this issue by using smoothness inducing
regularizers on \textit{both} the policy and the cost models of adversarial
imitation learning. Our regularizers work by ensuring that the cost function
changes in a controlled manner as a function of $s$-$a$ space; and the agent
policy is well behaved with respect to the state space. We call our new smooth
IL algorithm \textit{Smooth Policy and Cost Imitation Learning} (SPaCIL,
pronounced 'Special'). We introduce a novel metric to quantify the smoothness
of the learned policies. We demonstrate SPaCIL's superior performance on
continuous control tasks from MuJoCo. The algorithm not just outperforms the
state-of-the-art IL algorithm on our proposed smoothness metric, but, enjoys
added benefits of faster learning and substantially higher average return.

with each other and with road infrastructure on a common network, has promising
socio-economic benefits but also poses new cyber-physical threats. Data on
vehicular attackers can be realistically gathered through cyber threat
intelligence using systems like honeypots. Admittedly, configuring honeypots
introduces a trade-off between the level of honeypot-attacker interactions and
any incurred overheads and costs for implementing and monitoring these
honeypots. We argue that effective deception can be achieved through
strategically configuring the honeypots to represent components of the IoV and
engage attackers to collect cyber threat intelligence. In this paper, we
present HoneyCar, a novel decision support framework for honeypot deception in
IoV. HoneyCar builds upon a repository of known vulnerabilities of the
autonomous and connected vehicles found in the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposure (CVE) data within the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to compute
optimal honeypot configuration strategies. By taking a game-theoretic approach,
we model the adversarial interaction as a repeated imperfect-information
zero-sum game in which the IoV network administrator chooses a set of
vulnerabilities to offer in a honeypot and a strategic attacker chooses a
vulnerability of the IoV to exploit under uncertainty. Our investigation is
substantiated by examining two different versions of the game, with and without
the re-configuration cost to empower the network administrator to determine
optimal honeypot configurations. We evaluate HoneyCar in a realistic use case
to support decision makers with determining optimal honeypot configuration
strategies for strategic deployment in IoV.

contrastive features for video salient object detection without the high
computational temporal modeling techniques. We develop a non-local
self-attention scheme to capture the global information in the video frame. A
co-attention formulation is utilized to combine the low-level and high-level
features. We further apply the contrastive learning to improve the feature
representations, where foreground region pairs from the same video are pulled
together, and foreground-background region pairs are pushed away in the latent
space. The intra-frame contrastive loss helps separate the foreground and
background features, and the inter-frame contrastive loss improves the temporal
consistency. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets for
video salient object detection and unsupervised video object segmentation, and
show that the proposed method requires less computation, and performs favorably

coronal thermal equilibrium, leading to the phenomenon of a wave-induced
thermal misbalance. Representing an additional natural mechanism for the
exchange of energy between the plasma and the wave, thermal misbalance makes
the corona an active medium for magnetoacoustic waves, so that the wave can not
only lose but also gain energy from the coronal heating source (similarly to
burning gases, lasers and masers). We review recent achievements in this newly
emerging research field, focussing on the effects that slow-mode
magnetoacoustic waves experience as a back-reaction of this perturbed coronal
thermal equilibrium. The new effects include enhanced frequency-dependent
damping or amplification of slow waves, and effective, not associated with the
coronal plasma non-uniformity, dispersion. We also discuss the possibility to
probe the unknown coronal heating function by observations of slow waves and
linear theory of thermal instabilities. The manifold of the new properties that
slow waves acquire from a thermodynamically active nature of the solar corona
indicate a clear need for accounting for the effects of combined coronal

particular computational challenges. Networks with edge values on the
non-negative integers (count-valued networks) are an important such case, with
applications ranging from migration and trade flow data to data on frequency of
interactions and encounters. Here, we propose an efficient maximum
pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) scheme for count-valued ERGMs, and compare
its performance with existing Contrastive Divergence (CD) and Monte Carlo
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MCMLE) approaches via a simulation study based
on migration flow networks in two U.S states. Our results suggest that edge
value variance is a key factor in method performance, with high-variance edges
posing a particular challenge for CD. MCMLE can work well but requires careful
seeding in the high-variance case, and the MPLE itself performs well when edge
variance is high.

theory with all real excitations removed -- is not empty at all, but filled
with quantum-vacuum fluctuations. Their presence can manifest itself through a
series of phenomena such as the Casimir force, spontaneous emission, or
dispersion forces. These fluctuating fields possess correlations between
space-time points outside the light cone, i.e. between points which are
causally disconnected according to special relativity. A counterintuitive
consequence is that two initially uncorrelated quantum objects in empty space
(the quantum vacuum) which are located in causally disconnected space-time

Using electro-optic sampling, we have experimentally demonstrated the existence
of correlations of the vacuum fields for non-causally connected space-time

quantum systems often admit a simplified description, which involves a small
set of physical observables and requires only a few parameters such as sound
velocity or viscosity. Unveiling the relationship between these hydrodynamic
equations and the underlying microscopic theory usually requires a great effort
by condensed matter theorists. In the present paper, we develop a new

experimental quantum simulator platforms. Using integrable models, where direct

desirable properties; in particular, DQ(x=x)<\omega for any finite variable x
and any Q, if q\supseteq p is a Kim-forking extension of types, then
DQ(q)<DQ(p) for some Q, and if q\supseteq p is a Kim-non-forking extension,
then DQ(q)=DQ(p) for every Q that involves only invariant types whose Morley
powers are \ind^K-stationary. We give natural examples of families of invariant
types satisfying this property in some NSOP1 theories.
  We also answer a question of Granger about equivalence of dividing and
dividing finitely in the theory T_\infty of vector spaces with a generic
bilinear form. We conclude that forking equals dividing in T_\infty,
strengthening an earlier observation that T_\infty satisfies the existence
axiom for forking independence.
  Finally, we slightly modify our definitions and go beyond NSOP1 to find out
that our local ranks are bounded by the well-known ranks: the inp-rank

are finite provided that the dp-rank is finite, for example if T is dp-minimal.
Hence, our notion of ranks identifies a non-trivial class of theories

allows accelerated development for investigational treatments while also having
flexibility in population selection within the course of the trial. The
adaptive decision at the interim analysis is commonly made based on the
conditional probability of trial success. However, one of the critical
challenges for such adaptive designs is immature data for interim decisions,
particularly in the targeted subgroup with a limited sample size at the first
stage of the trial. In this paper, we improve the interim decision making by
incorporating information from surrogate endpoints when estimating conditional
power at the interim analysis, by predicting the primary treatment effect based
on the observed surrogate endpoint and prior knowledge or historical data about
the relationship between endpoints. Modified conditional power is developed for
both selecting the patient population to be enrolled after the interim analysis
and sample size re-estimation. In the simulation study, our proposed design
shows a higher chance to make desirable interim decisions and achieves higher
overall power, while controlling the overall type I error. This performance is
robust over drift of prior knowledge from the true relationship between two
endpoints. We also demonstrate the application of our proposed design in two
case studies in oncology and vaccine trials.

deepen our physics understanding and lead to numerous applications. One of the
most elementary classical operations is the addition of bit strings. As its
quantum version we can take the task of creating a superposition $\alpha
e^{i\phi(\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>)} \left|u\right>+\beta\left|v\right>$
from two unknown states $\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>\in\mathcal{H}$, where
$\phi$ is some real function and $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$.
Oszmaniec, Grudka, Horodecki and W{\'o}jcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116(11):110403,
2016] showed that a quantum circuit cannot create a superposition from a single
copy of each state. But how many input copies suffice? Due to quantum
tomography, the sample complexity seems at most exponential. Surprisingly, we
prove that quantum circuits of any sample complexity cannot output a
superposition for all input state-pairs
$\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>\in\mathcal{H}$ - not even when postselection and
approximations are allowed. We show explicitly the limitation on state
tomography that precludes its use for superposition.
  Our result is an application of the topological ""lower bound"" method
[arXiv:2011.10031], which matches any quantum circuit to a continuous function.
We find topological arguments showing that no continuous function can output a
superposition. This new use of the method offers further understanding of its
applicability.
  Considering state tomography we suggest circumventing our impossibility by
relaxing to random superposition or entangled superposition. Random
superposition reveals a separation between two types of measurement. Entangled
superposition could still be useful as a subroutine. However, both relaxations
are inspired by the inefficient state tomography. Whether efficient
implementations exist remains open.

phase transition at electroweak scale is of paramount importance for the
correct prediction of the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the spectrum of
gravitational waves. By means of the semi-classical formalism we calculate the
velocity and thickness of the wall using as theoretical framework the scalar
singlet extension of the SM with a parity symmetry and the SM effective field
theory supplemented by a dimension six operator. We use these solutions to
carefully predict the baryon asymmetry and the gravitational wave signals. The
singlet scenario can easily accommodate the observed asymmetry but these
solutions do not lead to observable effects at future gravity wave experiments.
In contrast the effective field theory fails at explaining the baryon abundance
due to the strict constraints from electric dipole moment experiments, however,
the strongest solutions we found fall within the sensitivity of the LISA
experiment. We provide a simple analytical approximation for the wall velocity
which only requires calculation of the strength and temperature of the
transition and works reasonably well in all models tested. We find that
generically the weak transitions where the fluid approximation can be used to
calculate the wall velocity and verify baryogenesis produce signals too weak to
be observed in future gravitational wave experiments. Thus, we infer that GW
signals produced by simple SM extensions visible in future experiments are
likely to only be produced in strong transitions described by detonations with
highly relativistic wall velocities.

FAST (i.e., faster arbitrarily-shaped text detector). Different from recent
advanced text detectors that used complicated post-processing and hand-crafted
network architectures, resulting in low inference speed, FAST has two new
designs. (1) We design a minimalist kernel representation (only has 1-channel
output) to model text with arbitrary shape, as well as a GPU-parallel
post-processing to efficiently assemble text lines with a negligible time
overhead. (2) We search the network architecture tailored for text detection,
leading to more powerful features than most networks that are searched for
image classification. Benefiting from these two designs, FAST achieves an
excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency on several challenging
datasets, including Total Text, CTW1500, ICDAR 2015, and MSRA-TD500. For
example, FAST-T yields 81.6% F-measure at 152 FPS on Total-Text, outperforming
the previous fastest method by 1.7 points and 70 FPS in terms of accuracy and

Leveraging on recent results characterizing the set of aggregate demand

by adopting a simplified formulation with a number of constraints for the fleet
that scales linearly in the number of time-slots considered and is independent
of the size of the fleet. This is remarkable, as it shows that, under suitable

An advantageous strategy could thus be to expand the training data to cover

allow to train deep neural networks with partially segmented images, i.e.
segmentations in which some classes may be grouped into super-classes. We
propose to use label-set loss functions to improve the segmentation performance

using the large volume, high resolution THESAN reionization simulations. A
combination of sub-resolution photo-ionization modelling for HII regions and
Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations is employed to estimate the
dust-attenuated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of high-redshift galaxies
($z\gtrsim5.5$). We show that the derived photometric properties such as the
ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function and the UV continuum slopes match
observationally inferred values, demonstrating the accuracy of the SED
modelling. We provide fits to the luminosity--star formation rate relation
(L-SFR) for the brightest emission lines and find that important differences
exist between the derived scaling relations and the widely used low-$z$ ones
because the interstellar medium of reionization era galaxies is generally less
metal-enriched than in their low redshift counterparts. We use these relations
to construct line intensity maps of nebular emission lines and cross correlate
with the 21 cm emission. Interestingly, the wavenumber at which the correlation
switches sign ($k_\mathrm{transition}$) depends heavily on the reionization
model and to a lesser extent on the targeted emission line, which is consistent
with the picture that $k_\mathrm{transition}$ probes the typical sizes of
ionized regions. The derived scaling relations and intensity maps represent a

Decoherence mechanisms typically observed in heavy low frequency elastically

that was formulated at the leading-logarithmic order about two decades ago. In
this article we present a solution to the long-standing problem of their
resummation beyond this order, and carry out the first complete next-to-leading
logarithmic calculation for non-global observables. This is achieved by solving
numerically the recently derived set of non-linear differential equations which
describe the evolution of soft radiation in the planar, large-$N_c$ limit. As a
case study we address the calculation of the transverse energy distribution in
the interjet rapidity region in $e^+e^-\to$ dijet production. The calculation
is performed by means of an algorithm that we formulate in the language of
jet-calculus generating functionals, which also makes the resummation technique
applicable to more general non-global problems, such as those that arise in
hadronic collisions. We find that NLL corrections are substantial and their
inclusion leads to a significant reduction of the perturbative scale
uncertainties for these observables. The computer code used in the calculations

of roughly primordial element abundances, and therefore metal-free. They are
thought to have formed at the cores of dense dark matter clouds. Interactions
between baryons and dark matter can therefore have had an important impact on
their evolution. In this paper we consider the capture of non- or
weakly-annihilating dark matter by these early massive stars. In a wide region
of parameter space, interactions of dark matter with baryons lead to premature
death of the star as a black hole. We sketch how this modification of the
standard evolutionary history of Population III stars might impact the epoch of
reionisation, by modifying the amount of UV emission, the transition to
Population II star formation, and the X-ray and radio emission from accretion
onto the black hole remnants. Signals of massive black holes originating from
Population III stars could be observed through gravitational waves from their
mergers. Finally, the observation of pair-instability supernovae could
effectively preclude premature black hole death across a wide range of

enabling a better handle of photo-$z$ errors by comparing the $\Delta\!\Sigma$

type Ia supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Indeed,
extending the cosmological analyses with high-redshift data is key to
distinguishing between different cosmological models that are degenerate at low
redshifts, and allowing better constraints on a possible dark energy (DE)
evolution. Also, we discuss combinations of BAO, SNe, and QSO data to
understand their compatibility and implications for extensions of the standard
cosmological model. Specifically, we consider a flat and non-flat $\Lambda
\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology, a flat and non-flat DE model with a constant DE
equation of state parameter ($w$), and four flat DE models with variable $w$,
namely the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan models, and
an ""exponential"" and Barboza-Alcaniz parameterisations. We find that a joint
analysis of QSO+SNe with BAO is only possible in the context of a flat
Universe. Indeed BAO confirms the flatness condition assuming a curved
geometry, whilst SNe+QSO show evidence of a closed space. We also find
$\Omega_{M,0}=0.3$ in all data sets assuming a flat $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$
model. Yet, all the other models show a statistically significant deviation at
2-3$\sigma$ with the combined SNe+QSO+BAO data set. In the models where DE
density evolves with time, SNe+QSO+BAO data always prefer $\Omega_{M,0}>0.3$,
$w_{0}<-1$ and $w_{a}>0$. This DE phantom behaviour is mainly driven by
SNe+QSO, while BAO are closer to the flat $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.

we need to model the connection between galaxies and halos accurately and in a
flexible manner. Standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models make the
assumption that the galaxy occupation in a halo is a function of only its mass,
however, in reality, the occupation can depend on various other parameters
including halo concentration, assembly history, environment, spin, etc. Using
the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation as our target, we show that machine
learning tools can be used to capture this high-dimensional dependence and
provide more accurate galaxy occupation models. Specifically, we use a random
forest regressor to identify which secondary halo parameters best model the
galaxy-halo connection and symbolic regression to augment the standard HOD
model with simple equations capturing the dependence on those parameters,
namely the local environmental overdensity and shear, at the location of a
halo. This not only provides insights into the galaxy-formation relationship
but, more importantly, improves the clustering statistics of the modeled
galaxies significantly. Our approach demonstrates that machine learning tools
can help us better understand and model the galaxy-halo connection, and are
therefore useful for galaxy formation and cosmology studies from upcoming
galaxy surveys.

the hyperbolic system exponentially reaches a steady state that solves the

$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Through a concrete example

density and the largest linear size of the radio emission and between the radio
power and the luminosity of the central X-ray point-source. The central radio
spectral indices of the galaxies span a wide range of values, with the majority
of the systems having steep spectra and the rest flat spectra. These results
are consistent with AGN activity, where the central radio sources are mostly

superconductor, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations (or creep) on the
penetration of an ac magnetic field as quantified by the so-called Campbell
length $\lambda_\textrm{C}$. Within strong pinning theory, vortices get pinned
by individual defects, with the jumps in the pinning energy ($\Delta
e_\mathrm{pin}$) and force ($\Delta f_\mathrm{pin}$) between bistable pinned
and free states quantifying the pinning process. We find that the evolution of
the Campbell length $\lambda_{\rm C}(t)$ as a function of time $t$ is the
result of two competing effects, the change in the force jumps $\Delta
f_\mathrm{pin}(t)$ and a change in the trapping area $S_\mathrm{trap}(t)$ of
vortices; the latter describes the area around the defect where a nearby vortex
gets and remains trapped. Contrary to naive expectation, we find that during
the decay of the critical state in a zero-field cooled (ZFC) experiment, the
Campbell length $\lambda_{\rm C}(t)$ is usually nonmonotonic, first decreasing
with time $t$ and then increasing for long waiting times. Field cooled (FC)
experiments exhibit hysteretic effects in $\lambda_\textrm{C}$; relaxation then
turns out to be predominantly monotonic, but its magnitude and direction
depends on the specific phase of the cooling--heating cycle. Furthermore, when
approaching equilibrium, the Campbell length relaxes to a finite value,
different from the persistent current which vanishes at long waiting times $t$,
e.g., above the irreversibility line. Finally, measuring the Campbell length
$\lambda_\textrm{C}(t)$ for different states, zero-field cooled, field cooled,
and relaxed, as a function of different waiting times $t$ and temperatures $T,$

rapid growth leading to a peak responsible for PBH formation. We investigate
the squeezed and the collapsed limits of three and four point functions of
curvature perturbation around the dip, showing that they satisfy consistency
relations connecting their values to the total amplification of the curvature
spectrum, and to the duration of the non-attractor era. Moreover, the
corresponding non-Gaussian parameters are scale-dependent in proximity of the
dip, with features that again depend on the amplification of the spectrum. For
typical PBH scenarios requiring an order ${\cal O}(10^7)$ enhancement of the

concept to obtain the orbital-selected OAIs (OOAIs), where the WCC of the
system is located at a Wyckoff position occupied by an atom but forms a
symmetric representation that does not belong to the outer-shell electrons of
the given atom. In such a way, we obtain a further 121 OOAIs. Furthermore, we
analyze the catalytic properties of one of the OAIs in a ""proof of principle""
experiment. By using the single crystal of 2H-MoS2 as a hydrogen evolution
catalyst, we directly prove that the catalytic activities arise from the
surfaces with OSSs. Additional potential applications of the 3D RSIs and OAIs
in, for example, electrochemistry, asymmetric catalysis, superconductivity, and
Josephson diode will be discussed.

problem in machine learning with applications including Bayesian modeling,

slow convergence. Auxiliary neural models can learn to speed up MCMC, but the
overhead for training the extra model can be prohibitive. We propose a
fundamentally different approach to this problem via a new Hamiltonian dynamics
with a non-Newtonian momentum. In contrast to MCMC approaches like Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo, no stochastic step is required. Instead, the proposed
deterministic dynamics in an extended state space exactly sample the target
distribution, specified by an energy function, under an assumption of
ergodicity. Alternatively, the dynamics can be interpreted as a normalizing
flow that samples a specified energy model without training. The proposed
Energy Sampling Hamiltonian (ESH) dynamics have a simple form that can be
solved with existing ODE solvers, but we derive a specialized solver that
exhibits much better performance. ESH dynamics converge faster than their MCMC
competitors enabling faster, more stable training of neural network energy

is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This
requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins for the

method to identify new catalysts based on searching for crystalline
symmetry-protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic
surface states on otherwise semiconducting or insulating compounds. The Wannier
charge centers in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions
so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic
obstructed surface states (OSSs). Beyond the well-studied 2H-MoS2, we further
verified our theory on the catalysts, 2H-MoTe2, and 1T'-MoTe2, whose catalytic
active sites are consistent with our calculations of obstructed Wannier charge
centers (OWCCs) and OSSs. In addition, we have predicted the location of
catalytic active sites and confirmed these predictions by exploring the
hydrogen evolution reaction on NiPS3 bulk single crystals, which we find to be
one of the most promising new catalysts with high activity and, moreover, of
low cost. Most importantly, we successfully identified several high-efficient
catalysts just by considering the number of OWCCs and the crystal symmetry of
the OAIs. Using the real space invariant theory and high-throughput
computational methods applied to a database of 34013 topologically trivial
insulators, we have identified 1788 unique OAIs (3383 ICSDs), of which 465 are
potential high-quality catalysts for heterogeneous reactions. The Miller
indices of the active surfaces are also obtained. Our new methodology will
facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of
heterogeneous redox reactions, where sustainability, toxicity, and cost must be

radio flux density variations in the blazar PKS~2131$-$021, which strongly
suggest an SMBHB with an orbital separation of $\sim 0.001-0.01$ pc. Our
45.1-year radio light curve shows two epochs of strong sinusoidal variation
with the same period and phase to within $<2\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively,
straddling a 20-year period when this variation was absent. Our simulated light
curves accurately reproduce the ``red noise'' of this object, and Lomb-Scargle,
weighted wavelet Z-transform, and least-squares sine wave analyses demonstrate
conclusively, at the $4.6\sigma$ significance level, that the periodicity in
this object is not due to random fluctuations in flux density. The observed
period translates to $2.082\pm 0.003$ years in the rest frame at the $z=1.285$
redshift of PKS~2131$-$021. The periodic variation in PKS~2131$-$021 is
remarkably sinusoidal. We present a model in which orbital motion, combined

a sine-wave modulation in the flux density which easily fits the observations.
Given the rapidly-developing field of gravitational wave experiments with

previous promising evidence, here we show that this is impossible, and no
direct counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established. This
is accomplished by demonstrating the irreversibility of entanglement theory
from first principles -- assuming only the most general microscopic physical
constraints of entanglement manipulation, we show that entanglement theory is
irreversible under all non-entangling transformations. We furthermore rule out
reversibility without significant entanglement expenditure, showing that
reversible entanglement transformations require the generation of
macroscopically large amounts of entanglement according to certain measures.
Our results not only reveal fundamental differences between quantum

unique property of entanglement which distinguishes it from other known quantum

potential to stimulate the production of powerful jets and account for recent
ultra-high-resolution observations of BH environments. Their main properties
are usually attributed to the accumulation of dynamically significant net
magnetic (vertical) flux throughout the arrested region, which is then
regulated by interchange instabilities. Here we propose instead that it is
mainly a dynamically important {\it toroidal} field -- the result of dynamo
action triggered by the significant but still relatively weak vertical field --
that defines and regulates the properties of MADs. We suggest that rapid
convection-like instabilities, involving interchange of toroidal flux tubes and
operating concurrently with the magnetorotatonal instability (MRI), can
regulate the structure of the disc and the escape of net flux. We generalize
the convective stability criteria and disc structure equations to include the
effects of a strong toroidal field and show that convective flows could be
driven towards two distinct marginally stable states, one of which we associate
with MADs. We confirm the plausibility of our theoretical model by comparing
its quantitative predictions to simulations of both MAD and SANE (strongly
magnetized but not ""arrested"") discs, and suggest a set of criteria that could
help to distinguish MADs from other accretion states. Contrary to previous
claims in the literature, we argue that MRI is not suppressed in MADs and is
probably responsible for the existence of the strong toroidal field.

construction of these mirrors, which turn out to be familiar manifolds. These
are elliptically fibred in multiple ways. By studying the singular fibres, we
are able to identify the rational curves of low degree on the mirror manifolds.
This verifies the mirror symmetry prediction obtained by studying the mirror
map near large complex structure points. We undertake also an extensive study
of the periods of the Hulek-Verrill manifolds and their monodromies. On the
mirror, we compute the genus-zero and -one instanton numbers, which are
labelled by 5 indices, as $h^{1,1}=5$. There is an obvious permutation symmetry
on these indices, but in addition there is a surprising repetition of values.
We trace this back to an $S_{6}$ symmetry made manifest by certain
constructions of the complex structure moduli space of the Hulek-Verrill
manifold. Among other consequences, we see in this way that the moduli space
has six large complex structure limits. It is the freedom to expand the
prepotential about any one of these points that leads to this symmetry in the
instanton numbers. An intriguing fact is that the group that acts on the
instanton numbers is larger than $S_6$ and is in fact an infinite hyperbolic
Coxeter group, that we study. The group orbits have a 'web' structure, and with
certain qualifications the instanton numbers are only nonzero if they belong to
what we term 'positive webs'. This structure has consequences for instanton
numbers at all genera.

new data with the same statistics as the provided training data. However,
multiple recent works show that state-of-the-art architectures yet struggle to
achieve this goal. In particular, they report an elevated amount of high
frequencies in the spectral statistics which makes it straightforward to
distinguish real and generated images. Explanations for this phenomenon are
controversial: While most works attribute the artifacts to the generator, other
works point to the discriminator. We take a sober look at those explanations
and provide insights on what makes proposed measures against high-frequency
artifacts effective. To achieve this, we first independently assess the
architectures of both the generator and discriminator and investigate if they
exhibit a frequency bias that makes learning the distribution of high-frequency
content particularly problematic. Based on these experiments, we make the
following four observations: 1) Different upsampling operations bias the
generator towards different spectral properties. 2) Checkerboard artifacts
introduced by upsampling cannot explain the spectral discrepancies alone as the
generator is able to compensate for these artifacts. 3) The discriminator does
not struggle with detecting high frequencies per se but rather struggles with
frequencies of low magnitude. 4) The downsampling operations in the
discriminator can impair the quality of the training signal it provides. In
light of these findings, we analyze proposed measures against high-frequency
artifacts in state-of-the-art GAN training but find that none of the existing
approaches can fully resolve spectral artifacts yet. Our results suggest that
there is great potential in improving the discriminator and that this could be
key to match the distribution of the training data more closely.

and our ability to respond to infectious disease threats. However, many
networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a
high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most
locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating
large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many
cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of
simulating epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a
representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their
importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive
thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S.
Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate
approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which prioritizes edges that
are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting
sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model,
including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of
stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its
distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network
preserves fewer than $10\%$ of the edges of the original network. In addition
to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a
weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread.

enable multi-task learning due to the absence of both human and animal
annotations for a single object, e.g., a human image does not have animal pose
annotations; thus, we have to devise a new way to exploit heterogeneous
datasets. To make the unstable disjoint multi-task learning jointly trainable,
we propose to exploit the morphological similarity between humans and animals,
motivated by animal exercise where humans imitate animal poses. We realize the
morphological similarity by semantic correspondences, called sub-keypoint,
which enables joint training of human and animal mesh regression branches.
Besides, we propose class-sensitive regularization methods to avoid a
mean-shape bias and to improve the distinctiveness across multi-classes. Our
method performs favorably against recent uni-modal models on various human and

changes seen in the FUV luminosity of GM Aur could lead to variation of up to
~6% in CO line emission and changes in the X-ray luminosity could lead to
larger changes of ~25%. However, the FUV and X-ray luminosity increases must
last at least 100 years in order to induce changes, which seems implausible in
the TTS stage; also, these changes would be too small to be detectable by ALMA.
We report no variability in the 3 cm emission observed by the VLA, showing that
changes of less than a factor of ~3 in the accretion rates of TTSs do not lead
to detectable changes in the mass-loss rate traced by the jet at centimeter

statistical tools in community ecology. They are routinely used for inference
and various prediction tasks, such as to build species distribution maps or
biomass estimation over spatial areas. Existing JSDM's cannot, however, model
mutual exclusion between species, which may happen in some species groups, such
as mosses in the bottom layer of a peatland site. We tackle this deficiency in
the context of modeling plant percentage cover data, where mutual exclusion
arises from limited growing space and competition for light. We propose a
hierarchical JSDM where multivariate latent Gaussian variable model describes
species' niche preferences and Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution models the
observation process and exclusive competition for space between species. We use
both stationary and non-stationary multivariate Gaussian processes to model
residual phenomena. We also propose a decision theoretic model comparison and
validation approach to assess the goodness of JSDMs in four different types of
predictive tasks. We apply our models and methods to a case study on modeling
vegetation cover in a boreal peatland. Our results show that ignoring the
interspecific interactions and competition for space significantly reduces
models' predictive performance and leads to biased estimates for total
percentage cover both for individual species and over all species combined. A
model's relative predictive performance also depends on the model comparison
methods highlighting that model comparison and assessment should resemble the
true predictive task. Our results also demonstrate that the proposed joint
species distribution model can be used to simultaneously infer interspecific
correlations in niche preference as well as mutual exclusive competition for
space and through that provide novel insight into ecological research.

improving revenue for the auctioneer against quasi-linear utility maximizing
bidders. The introduction of reserve prices, however, usually do not help
improve total welfare of the auctioneer and the bidders. In this paper, we
focus on value maximizing bidders with return on spend constraints -- a
paradigm that has drawn considerable attention recently as more advertisers
adopt auto-bidding algorithms in advertising platforms -- and show that the
introduction of reserve prices has a novel impact on the market. Namely, by
choosing reserve prices appropriately the auctioneer can improve not only the
total revenue but also the total welfare. Our results also demonstrate that
reserve prices are robust to bidder types, i.e., reserve prices work well for
different bidder types, such as value maximizers and utility maximizers,
without using bidder type information. We generalize these results for a
variety of auction mechanisms such as VCG, GSP, and first-price auctions.
Moreover, we show how to combine these results with additive boosts to improve
the welfare of the outcomes of the auction further. Finally, we complement our
theoretical observations with an empirical study confirming the effectiveness
of these ideas using data from online advertising auctions.

deteriorates when the training data is polluted with noise, a scenario that
occurs very often in practice. To enable DeepONets training with noisy data, we
propose using the Bayesian framework of replica-exchange Langevin diffusion.
Such a framework uses two particles, one for exploring and another for
exploiting the loss function landscape of DeepONets. We show that the proposed
framework's exploration and exploitation capabilities enable (1) improved

the ensuing feasible region is convex if the Wasserstein ball is centered
around a log-concave distribution (or, more generally, an $\alpha$-concave
distribution with $\alpha \geq -1$). In addition, we propose a block coordinate
ascent algorithm for this class of chance constraints and prove its convergence
to global optimum. Furthermore, we extend the convexity results and conic

Society of Automatic Engineers (SAE) standard, EV chargers can be divided into
three levels based on power rating: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. This paper
investigates the circuit topologies and control principles of EV charging
systems at each level. Three high-fidelity testbeds of EV charging systems for
a 10 kWh battery are designed and implemented in real-time digital simulator
RT-Lab. The testbeds include modeling details such as switching of
semiconductors. Twenty-five minutes real-time simulation is conducted for each
testbed. Detailed dynamic performance of the circuits and the controls at every
stage are presented to demonstrate the charging process. All three level EV
charging systems employ high-frequency transformer embedded dual active bridge
(DAB) dc/dc converter to regulate battery side dc voltage and current. Hence,
average model-based linear system analysis is given to configure the parameters
of the phase shift control adopted by the DAB dc/dc converter. In addition,
power factor control (PFC) that is employed for Level 1 and Level 2
single-phase ac charging systems, three-phase voltage source converter control
that is employed for Level 3 three-phase ac charging systems, are all analyzed.
The three testbeds, with their detailed circuit parameters and control
parameters presented, can be used as reference testbeds for EV grid integration
research.

environments caused by a long-distance propagation and numerous UAVs. In this
paper, a novel multicast scheme is designed for UAV networks serving as an
aerial small BS, where a UAV experiencing a packet loss will request the packet
from other UAVs in the same cluster rather than relying on retransmissions of
BSs. The technical details of the introduced multicast scheme are designed with
the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol
for practicability and without loss of generality. Then, the Poisson cluster
process is employed to model UAV networks to capture their dynamic network
topology, based on which distance distributions are derived using tools of
stochastic geometry for analytical tractability. Additionally, critical

jet formation, and indeed the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations
revealed a ring-like structure in agreement with theoretical models of
accretion onto a rotating Kerr BH. In addition to the spin of the BH being a
potential source of energy for the launching mechanism, magnetic fields are
believed to play a key role in the formation of relativistic jets. A priori,
the spin, $a_\star$, of BH in M87* is unknown, however, when accounting for the

non-thermal emission. In order to bridge the gap between these scales and to
provide a theoretical interpretation of these observations we perform general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion on to black holes and
jet launching.
  M87 has been the target for multiple observations across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum. Among these VLBI observations provide unique details
on the collimation profile of the jet down to several gravitational radii. In
this work we aim to model the observed broad-band spectrum of M87 from the
radio to the NIR regime and at the same time fit the jet structure as observed
with Global mm-VLBI at 86 GHz. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
and simulate the accretion of the magnetised plasma onto Kerr-black holes in

we introduce a large-scale, multimodal dataset, StrokeRehab, as a new
action-recognition benchmark that includes subtle short-duration actions
labeled at a high temporal resolution. These short-duration actions are called
functional primitives, and consist of reaches, transports, repositions,

application domains, there has been a tremendous expansion of interest in
distributed optimization methods to cope with the underlying large-scale
problems. Nonetheless, inevitable system-specific challenges such as limited
computational power, limited communication, latency requirements, measurement
errors, and noises in wireless channels impose restrictions on the exactness of
the underlying algorithms. Such restrictions have appealed to the exploration
of algorithms' convergence behaviors under inexact settings. Despite the
extensive research conducted in the area, it seems that the analysis of
convergences of dual decomposition methods concerning primal optimality
violations, together with dual optimality violations is less investigated.
Here, we provide a systematic exposition of the convergence of feasible points
in dual decomposition methods under inexact settings, for an important class of
global consensus optimization problems. Convergences and the rate of
convergences of the algorithms are mathematically substantiated, not only from
a dual-domain standpoint but also from a primal-domain standpoint. Analytical
results show that the algorithms converge to a neighborhood of optimality, the
size of which depends on the level of underlying distortions. Further
elaboration of a generalized problem formulation is also furnished, together
with the convergence properties of the underlying algorithms. Finally,
theoretical derivations are verified by numerical experiments.

low-cost devices capable of collecting data for a long period of time. For each

interpretation of collected data. In the case of large number of systems with
different properties the standard approach based on detailed and extensive
simulations is not possible, thus a faster method is developed. Knowing the
characteristics of EAS from more general simulations any required probability
is calculated using appropriate parameterization taking into account EAS

to communication and computational systems. Despite the rapid progress in
quantum hardware, it has not yet reached a level of maturity that enables
execution of many quantum protocols in practical settings. To develop quantum
protocols in real world, it is necessary to examine their performance
considering the imperfections in their practical implementation using
simulation platforms. In this paper, we consider several quantum protocols that
enable promising functionalities and services in near-future quantum networks.
The protocols are chosen from both areas of quantum communication and quantum
computation as follows: quantum money, W-state based anonymous transmission,
verifiable blind quantum computation, and quantum digital signature. We use
NetSquid simulation platform to evaluate the effect of various sources of noise
on the performance of these protocols, considering different figures of merit.
We find that to enable quantum money protocol, the decoherence time constant of
the quantum memory must be at least three times the storage time of qubits.
Furthermore, our simulation results for the w-state based anonymous
transmission protocol show that to achieve an average fidelity above 0.8 in
this protocol, the storage time of sender's and receiver's particles in the
quantum memory must be less than half of the decoherence time constant of the
quantum memory. We have also investigated the effect of gate imperfections on
the performance of verifiable blind quantum computation. We find that with our
chosen parameters, if the depolarizing probability of quantum gates is equal to
or greater than 0.05, the security of the protocol cannot be guaranteed.
Lastly, our simulation results for quantum digital signature protocol show that
channel loss has a significant effect on the probability of repudiation.

Using more than 17,000 occupation-specific text descriptors, we transform each
occupation into a high-dimensional vector using natural language processing.
Similar, we assign a vector to the target characteristic and estimate the
occupational degree of this characteristic as the cosine similarity between the
vectors. The main advantages of this approach are its universal applicability
and verifiability contrary to existing ad-hoc approaches. We extensively
validate our approach on several exercises and then use it to estimate the
occupational degree of charisma and emotional intelligence (EQ). We find that
occupations that score high on these tend to have higher educational
requirements. Turning to wages, highly charismatic occupations are either found
in the lower or upper tail in the wage distribution. This is not found for EQ,
where higher levels of EQ are generally correlated with higher wages.

the superiority of a distributed IRSs system over a centralized IRS system as

signatures of ram-pressure stripping also possess an active galactic nucleus

has not been confirmed by a subsequent study. Building upon previous findings,
here we combine MUSE observations conducted within the GASP program and a

Considering a sample of 115 ram pressure stripped galaxies with stellar masses

then investigate whether the AGN incidence is in excess in ram pressure

problem depends on the wavenumber constant parameter k and it is inspired here
by medical applications, where a transducer emits a pulse at a given frequency.
This problem has been successfully solved in the past with the classical Finite
Element Method (FEM) for relative small values of k. But in modern applications
the values of k can be of order of thousands and FEM faces up several numerical
difficulties. To overcome these difficulties we solve the radiation problem
using the Isogeometric Analysis (IgA), a kind of generalization of FEM.
Starting with the variational formulation of the radiation problem, we show
with details how to apply the isogeometric approach in order to compute the
coefficients of the approximated solution of radiation problem in terms of the
B-spline basis functions. Our implementation of IgA using GeoPDEs software
shows that isogeometric approach is superior than FEM, since it is able to
reduce substantially the pollution error, especially for high values of k,
producing additionally smoother solutions which depend on less degrees of
freedom.

recognition systems, presentation attacks on facial recognition systems have
become increasingly sophisticated. The ability to detect presentation attacks
or spoofing attempts is a pressing concern for the integrity, security, and
trust of facial recognition systems. Multi-spectral imaging has been previously
introduced as a way to improve presentation attack detection by utilizing
sensors that are sensitive to different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum

presentation attack detection systems may be discriminative, the need for
additional sensors and computational resources substantially increases

from infrared imagery during training to increase the discriminability of
visible-based presentation attack detection systems. We introduce (1) a new
cross-domain presentation attack detection framework that increases the
separability of bonafide and presentation attacks using only visible spectrum

equations of motion for a doubly-quantised vortex at the centre of a circular
bucket trap. In the late stage of the instability, we reveal a striking novel
behaviour of the system in the non-linear regime. Contrary to expectation, in
the absence of dissipation the system never enters the regime of two
well-separated phase defects described by Hamiltonian vortex dynamics. Instead,
the separation between the two defects undergoes modulations which never exceed
a few healing lengths, in which compressible kinetic energy and incompressible
kinetic energy are exchanged. This suggests that, under the right conditions,
pairs of vortices may be able to form meta-stable bound states.

an algebraic method to find equilibrium points for this kind of system without

continuum limit. To do this, we use a recently introduced algebraic approach to
the Kuramoto dynamics, which results in an explicitly solvable complex-valued
equation that captures the dynamics of the original Kuramoto model. Using this
new approach, we obtain equilibria for both the nonlinear original Kuramoto and
complex-valued systems. We then completely classify all equilibria in the case
of complete graphs originally studied by Kuramoto. Finally, we go on to study
equilibria in networks of coupled oscillators with phase lag, in generalized
circulant networks, multi-layer networks, and also random networks.

was used as a grasp quality evaluation metric to annotate the synthesized

parameter identification by experiments to ensure real world performance. In
addition, previous studies have not considered manipulator reachability such as
when a grasp configuration with high grasp quality is unable to reach the

map from $G_{+}(2,n)$ to a $(2n{-}4)$-dimensional subspace of the 4d kinematic
space where the momentum amplituhedron of SYM lives. We provide strong evidence
that the twistor-string map is a diffeomorphism from $G_+(2,n)$ to the interior

nature and bears certain aspects of both itineracy and localization. On the one
hand, the magnetism is soft, where the local magnetic moments strongly depend
on temperature and the angles formed by these moments at different Co sites of
the kagome lattice, as expected for itinerant magnets. On the other hand, the
picture of localized spins still remains adequate for the description of the
local stability of the ferromagnetic (FM) order with respect to the transversal
spin fluctuations. For the latter purposes, we employ two approaches, which
provide quite different pictures for interatomic exchange interactions: the
regular magnetic force theorem and a formally exact theory based on the
calculation of the inverse response function. The exact theory predicts
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ to be a three-dimensional ferromagnet with the strongest
interaction operating between next-nearest neighbors in the adjacent kagome
planes. The ligand states are found to play a very important role by
additionally stabilizing the FM order. When the local moments decrease, the
interplane interactions sharply decrease, first causing the FM order to become
quasi-two-dimensional, and then making it unstable with respect to the
spin-spiral order propagating perpendicular to the kagome plane. The latter
instability is partly contributed by the states at the Fermi surface and may be
relevant to the magnetic behavior of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ near the Curie
temperature. Peculiarities of the half-metallic ferromagnetism in
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ are also discussed.

by $\gamma$-ray flares with trivial time delays. Intriguingly, we find highly

distributions during plasmoid mergers. This feature may result in fast
$\gamma$-ray flares or orphan $\gamma$-ray flares under the leptonic scenario,
complementary to the frequently considered mini-jet scenario. It may also infer
neutrino emission with low secondary synchrotron flux under the hadronic

proposed PI protocols have achieved significant reductions in PI latency by
moving the computationally heavy homomorphic encryption (HE) parts to an
offline/pre-compute phase. Paired with recent optimizations that tailor
networks for PI, these protocols have achieved performance levels that are
tantalizingly close to being practical. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous
end-to-end characterization of PI protocols and optimization techniques and
find that the current understanding of PI performance is overly optimistic.
Specifically, we find that offline storage costs of garbled circuits (GC), a
key cryptographic protocol used in PI, on user/client devices are prohibitively
high and force much of the expensive offline HE computation to the online
phase, resulting in a 10-1000$\times$ increase to PI latency. We propose a
modified PI protocol that significantly reduces client-side storage costs for a
small increase in online latency. Evaluated end-to-end, the modified protocol
outperforms current protocols by reducing the mean PI latency by $4\times$ for
ResNet18 on TinyImageNet. We conclude with a discussion of several recently

arise for transmitters to be added and removed as the authorized set of
transmitters changes. In such cases, the system could experience long
down-times, as retraining the underlying deep learning model is often a
time-consuming process. In this paper, we draw inspiration from information
retrieval to address this problem: by utilizing feature vectors as RF
fingerprints, we first demonstrate that training could be simplified to
indexing those feature vectors into a database using locality sensitive hashing
(LSH). Then we show that approximate nearest neighbor search could be performed
on the database to perform transmitter authorization that matches the accuracy
of deep learning models, while allowing for more than 100x faster retraining.
Furthermore, dimensionality reduction techniques are used on the feature
vectors to show that the authorization latency of our technique could be
reduced to approach that of traditional deep learning-based systems.

is tackled deterministically by adopting a worst-case perspective tied to an
explicit model assumption made on the functions to be learned. Working in the
framework of Hilbert spaces, this article considers a model assumption based on
approximability. It also incorporates observational inaccuracies modeled via
additive errors bounded in $\ell_2$. Earlier works have demonstrated that
regularization provide algorithms that are optimal in this situation, but did
not fully identify the desired hyperparameter. This article fills the gap in
both a local scenario and a global scenario. In the local scenario, which
amounts to the determination of Chebyshev centers, the semidefinite recipe of
Beck and Eldar (legitimately valid in the complex setting only) is complemented
by a more direct approach, with the proviso that the observational functionals
have orthonormal representers. In the said approach, the desired parameter is
the solution to an equation that can be resolved via standard methods. In the
global scenario, where linear algorithms rule, the parameter elusive in the
works of Micchelli et al. is found as the byproduct of a semidefinite program.
Additionally and quite surprisingly, in case of observational functionals with
orthonormal representers, it is established that any regularization parameter
is optimal.

Data Platforms form a single solution. It is a platform that helps to develop,
deploy and manage the big data environment. Hadoop and Spark are the two
open-source Big Data Platforms provided by Apache. Both these platforms have
many configurational parameters, which can have unforeseen effects on the
execution time, accuracy, etc. Manual tuning of these parameters can be
tiresome, and hence automatic ways should be needed to tune them. After
studying and analyzing various previous works in automating the tuning of these
parameters, this paper proposes two algorithms - Grid Search with Finer Tuning
and Controlled Random Search. The performance indicator studied in this paper
is Execution Time. These algorithms help to tune the parameters automatically.
Experimental results have shown a reduction in execution time of about 70% and
50% for Hadoop and 81.19% and 77.77% for Spark by Grid Search with Finer Tuning

  Safety Assessments: A Case Study of the Pueblo Dam, USA",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Statistical flood frequency analysis coupled with hydrograph scaling is
commonly used to generate design floods to assess dam safety assessment. The
safety assessments can be highly sensitive to the choice of the statistical
flood frequency model. Standard dam safety assessments are typically based on a
single distribution model of flood frequency, often the Log Pearson Type III or
Generalized Extreme Value distributions. Floods, however, may result from
multiple physical processes such as rain on snow, snowmelt or rainstorms. This
can result in a mixed distribution of annual peak flows, according to the cause
of each flood. Engineering design choices based on a single distribution
statistical model are vulnerable to the effects of this potential structural
model error. To explore the practicality and potential value of implementing
mixed distribution statistical models in engineering design, we compare the
goodness of fit of several single- and mixed-distribution peak flow models, as
well as the contingent dam safety assessment at Pueblo, Colorado as a didactic
example. Summer snowmelt and intense summer rainstorms are both key drivers of
annual peak flow at Pueblo. We analyze the potential implications for the
annual probability of overtopping-induced failure of the Pueblo Dam as a
didactic example. We address the temporal and physical cause separation
problems by building on previous work with mixed distributions. We find a Mixed
Generalized Extreme Value distribution model best fits peak flows observed in
the gaged record, historical floods, and paleo floods at Pueblo. Finally, we
show that accounting for mixed distributions in the safety assessment at Pueblo

opportunity to study nuclear conditions and the jet/host galaxy feedback
process at the time of an initial radio jet expansion. PKS 1718-649 is one of a
handful of young radio jets with $\gamma$-ray emission confirmed with the
Fermi/LAT detector. We show that this $\gamma$-ray emission can be successfully
explained by Inverse Compton scattering of the ultraviolet photons, presumably
from an accretion flow, off non-thermal electrons in the expanding radio lobes.
The origin of the X-ray emission in PKS 1718-649 is more elusive. While Inverse
Compton scattering of the infrared photons emitted by a cold gas in the
vicinity of the expanding radio lobes contributes significantly to the X-ray
band, the data require that an additional X-ray emission mechanism is at work,
e.g. a weak X-ray corona or a radiatively inefficient accretion flow, expected
from a LINER type nucleus such as that of PKS 1718-649. We find that the jet in
PKS 1718-649 has low power, $L_j \simeq 2.2 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and

GNSS is vulnerable to various ground interferences, which significantly break
down the continuity of the navigation system. Meanwhile, the GNSS-based
next-generation navigation devices are being developed to be smaller, more

to answer whether the smartphone inertial measurement unit (IMU) is sufficient
to support the GNSS baseband. Thus, a cascaded ultra-tightly coupled
GNSS/inertial navigation system (INS) technique, where consumer-level
smartphone sensors are used, is applied to improve the baseband of GNSS
software-defined radios (SDRs). A Doppler value is predicted based on an
integrated extended Kalman filter (EKF) navigator where the
pseudorange-state-based measurements of GNSS and INS are fused. It is used to
assist numerically controlled oscillators (NCOs) in the GNSS baseband. Then, an
ultra-tight integration platform is built with the upgraded GNSS SDR, of which
baseband processing is integrated with INS mechanization. Finally, tracking and
carrier-based positioning performances are assessed in the proposed platform
for the smartphone-IMU-aided GNSS baseband via kinematic field tests. The
experimental results prove that extra hardware with only a few dollars instead
of more expensive ones can improve the GNSS baseband efficiently.

separator of size $k$ is a minimal separator $S$ that separates two given sets
of vertices $X$ and $Y$ such that we ""cannot move $S$ more towards $X$"" such
that $|S|$ remains smaller than the threshold. One of the incentives is that by
using leftmost separators we can improve the time complexity of treewidth
approximation. Treewidth approximation is a problem which is known to have a
linear time FPT algorithm in terms of input size, and only single exponential
in terms of the parameter, treewidth. It is not known whether this result can
be improved theoretically. However, the coefficient of the parameter $k$ (the
treewidth) in the exponent is large. Hence, our goal is to decrease the
coefficient of $k$ in the exponent, in order to achieve a more practical
algorithm. Hereby, we trade a linear-time algorithm for an $\mathcal{O}(n \log

Nevertheless, whether the chimera states still exist in the opposite situation

are shared by modes regardless of the waveguiding structure; for example, modal
dispersion is inevitable in multimode waveguides, every mode experiences
group-velocity dispersion, and higher-order modes are usually slower than their
lower-order counterparts. We show here that such trends can be fundamentally
altered -- altogether severing the link between modal order and group index
hybrid and eliminating dispersion -- by exploiting hybrid guided space-time
modes in a planar multimode waveguide. Such modes are confined in one-dimension
by the waveguide and in the other by the spatio-temporal spectral structure of
the field itself. Direct measurements of the modal group delays confirm that
the group index for low-loss, dispersion-free, hybrid space-time modes can be
each tuned away from the group index of the conventional mode of same order,
and that the transverse size of these hybrid modes can be varied independently
of the modal order and group index. These findings are verified in a few-mode

  Linguistics (TACL)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much of the existing linguistic data in many languages of the world is locked
away in non-digitized books and documents. Optical character recognition (OCR)
can be used to produce digitized text, and previous work has demonstrated the
utility of neural post-correction methods that improve the results of
general-purpose OCR systems on recognition of less-well-resourced languages.
However, these methods rely on manually curated post-correction data, which are
relatively scarce compared to the non-annotated raw images that need to be
digitized.
  In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning method that makes it
possible to utilize these raw images to improve performance, specifically
through the use of self-training, a technique where a model is iteratively
trained on its own outputs. In addition, to enforce consistency in the
recognized vocabulary, we introduce a lexically-aware decoding method that
augments the neural post-correction model with a count-based language model
constructed from the recognized texts, implemented using weighted finite-state
automata (WFSA) for efficient and effective decoding.
  Results on four endangered languages demonstrate the utility of the proposed
method, with relative error reductions of 15-29%, where we find the combination
of self-training and lexically-aware decoding essential for achieving
consistent improvements. Data and code are available at

nearby galaxies. Here we combine two sets of observational results, 1) cosmic
densities of core-collapse supernova explosion (CCSNe) rates and 2) cosmic far
ultraviolet radiation (and infrared re-radiation) densities, which are
sensitive to massive ($\simeq 8-50 \,{\rm M}_\odot$) and moderately massive

redshift evolution is identified beyond the uncertainties, we find that the
cosmic average IMF slope at $z=0$ is $\alpha=1.8-3.2$ at the 95 % confidence
level that is comparable with the Salpeter IMF, $\alpha=2.35$, which marks the
first constraint on the cosmic average IMF. We show a forecast for the Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope supernova survey that will provide significantly
strong constraints on the IMF slope with $\delta \alpha\simeq 0.5$ over
$z=0-2$. Moreover, as for an independent IMF probe instead of 1), we suggest to
use diffuse supernovae neutrino background (DSNB), relic neutrinos from CCSNe.
We expect that the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino observations over 20 years will
improve the constraints on the IMF slope and the redshift evolution
significantly better than those obtained today, if the systematic uncertainties
of DSNB production physics are reduced in the future numerical simulations.

networks, especially for inferences on lightweight mobile or edge devices.
However, model quantization usually requires access to the original training
data to maintain the accuracy of the full-precision models, which is often
infeasible in real-world scenarios for security and privacy issues. A popular
approach to perform quantization without access to the original data is to use
synthetically generated samples, based on batch-normalization statistics or
adversarial learning. However, the drawback of such approaches is that they
primarily rely on random noise input to the generator to attain diversity of
the synthetic samples. We find that this is often insufficient to capture the
distribution of the original data, especially around the decision boundaries.
To this end, we propose Qimera, a method that uses superposed latent embeddings
to generate synthetic boundary supporting samples. For the superposed
embeddings to better reflect the original distribution, we also propose using
an additional disentanglement mapping layer and extracting information from the
full-precision model. The experimental results show that Qimera achieves
state-of-the-art performances for various settings on data-free quantization.

constraint on matrices. In this paper, we consider a spike and slab prior on
off-diagonal entries, which uses a mixture of point-mass and normal
distribution. The point-mass naturally introduces sparsity to covariance
structures so that the resulting posterior from this prior renders covariance
structure learning. Under this prior, we calculate posterior model

that the error due to Laplace approximation becomes asymptotically marginal at
some rate depending on the posterior convergence rate of covariance matrix

we propose a new framework for estimating a covariance structure. Since the
Laplace approximation is done around the mode of conditional posterior of

conspecific females, which activates the calling behavior of other males and
results in collective choruses. While the calling behavior is quite effective
for mate attraction, it requires high energy consumption. In contrast,
satellite behavior is an alternative mating strategy in which males
deliberately stay silent in the vicinity of a calling male and attempt to
intercept the female attracted to the caller, allowing the satellite males to
drastically reduce their energy consumption while having a chance of mating.
Here we propose a hybrid dynamical model in which male frogs autonomously
switch among three behavioral states (i.e., calling state, resting state, and
satellite state) due to the excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Numerical
simulation of the proposed model demonstrated that (1) both collective choruses
and satellite behavior can be reproduced and (2) the satellite males can
prolong the energy depletion time of the whole aggregation while they split the
maximum chorus activity into two levels over the whole chorusing period. This
study theoretically highlights the trade-off between energy efficiency and

users send confidential signals to the base station by exploiting STAR-RIS to
reconfigure the electromagnetic propagation environment proactively. Depending
on the availability of the eavesdropping channel state information (CSI), both
the full CSI and statistical CSI of the eavesdropper are considered. For the
full eavesdropping CSI scenario, we adopt the adaptive-rate wiretap code scheme
with the aim of maximizing minimum secrecy capacity subject to the successive
interference cancellation decoding order constraints. To proceed, we propose an
alternating hybrid beamforming (AHB) algorithm to jointly optimize the receive
beamforming, transmit power, and reflection/transmission coefficients. While
for the statistical eavesdropping CSI scenario, the constant-rate wiretap code
scheme is employed to minimize the maximum secrecy outage probability (SOP)
subject to the quality-of-service requirements of legitimate users. Then, we
derive the exact SOP expression under the constant-rate coding strategy and
develop an extended AHB algorithm for the joint secrecy beamforming design.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
Moreover, some useful guidance about the quantification of phase

modeling. While PLMs are pre-trained on large-scale text corpora, they are
usually fine-tuned on scarce dialogue data with specific domain knowledge and
dialogue styles. However, tailoring the language models while fully utilizing
prior knowledge in large pre-trained models remains a challenge. In this paper,
we present a novel approach for pre-trained dialogue modeling that casts the
dialogue generation problem as a prompt-learning task. Instead of fine-tuning
on limited dialogue data, our approach, DialogPrompt, learns continuous prompt
embeddings optimized for dialogue contexts, which appropriately elicit
knowledge from the large pre-trained model. To encourage the model to better
utilize the prompt embeddings, the prompt encoders are designed to be
dynamically generated based on the dialogue context. Experiments on popular

fine-tuning baseline and the generic prompt-learning methods. Furthermore,
human evaluations strongly support the superiority of DialogPrompt in regard to

hoppings between atoms or resonating units, which makes the bulk eigenspectrum
sensitive to boundary conditions. When skin effect emerges, eigenstates in the
bulk continuum can become localized on the edges, making the distinction
between edge and bulk states challenging. We establish the bulk-boundary
correspondence for a Chern insulator model with non-Hermitian skin effect by
combining two approaches (""non-Bloch"" approach and ""biorthogonal"" approach).
Both approaches can suppress the skin effect but they are based on different
mathematical tools. A biorthogonal inverse participation ratio is used as a
measure to distinguish between bulk states and edge states, and a non-Bloch
Chern number is used to characterize the topology and predict the number of
topological edge bands. In addition to tangential degeneracies, crossing
degeneracies are found to occur between the bulk and edge bands. Their presence
enriches the (de)localization behavior of the edge states but does not affect
the Chern number. The phase diagram of the system has interesting features that
are not found in Hermitian systems. For example, one topological transition and
two non-Hermitian phase transitions can be induced by tuning a single
parameter. The gapless phase is topologically protected due to the stable
existence of the non-Hermitian band degeneracies guaranteed by nonzero
discriminant numbers.

using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on
variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory
attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor
experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For
each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through
interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory
prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network
served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor
contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the
network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and
amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study
situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in
development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural

using phaseless Wi-Fi measurements is proposed. It is able to image objects
that are large (compared to wavelength) and have high permittivity values, that
existing radio frequency (RF) inverse scattering techniques find very
challenging, making it suitable for indoor RF imaging. The technique utilizes a
Rytov based inverse scattering model with a deep learning framework. The
inverse scattering model is based on an extended Rytov approximation (xRA) that
pre-reconstructs the RF measurements. Under strong scattering conditions, this
pre-reconstruction is related to the actual permittivity profile by a
non-linear function, which is learned by a modified U-Net model to obtain the
permittivity profile of the object. Thus, our proposed approach not only
reconstructs the shape of objects, but also estimates their permittivity values
accurately. We demonstrate its imaging performance using simulations as well as
experimental results in an actual indoor environment using 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
phaseless measurements. For incident wavelength $\lambda_0$, the proposed
framework can reconstruct objects with relative permittivity as high as 77 and
electrical size as large as $40 \lambda$, where $\lambda =\lambda_0/\sqrt{77}$.
This is in contrast to existing phaseless imaging techniques which cannot
reconstruct permittivity values beyond 3 or 4. Thus, our proposed method is the
first inverse scattering-based deep learning framework which can image large
scatterers with high permittivity and achieve accurate indoor RF imaging using
phaseless Wi-Fi measurements.

  Semantic Code Search",,,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Code search aims to retrieve accurate code snippets based on a natural
language query to improve software productivity and quality. With the massive
amount of available programs such as (on GitHub or Stack Overflow), identifying
and localizing the precise code is critical for the software developers. In
addition, Deep learning has recently been widely applied to different
code-related scenarios, e.g., vulnerability detection, source code
summarization. However, automated deep code search is still challenging since
it requires a high-level semantic mapping between code and natural language
queries. Most existing deep learning-based approaches for code search rely on
the sequential text i.e., feeding the program and the query as a flat sequence
of tokens to learn the program semantics while the structural information is
not fully considered. Furthermore, the widely adopted Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have proved their effectiveness in learning program semantics, however,
they also suffer the problem of capturing the global dependencies in the
constructed graph, which limits the model learning capacity. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we design a novel neural network framework, named
GraphSearchNet, to enable an effective and accurate source code search by
jointly learning the rich semantics of both source code and natural language
queries. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs for the source code and
queries with bidirectional GGNN (BiGGNN) to capture the local structural
information of the source code and queries. Furthermore, we enhance BiGGNN by
utilizing the multi-head attention module to supplement the global dependencies
that BiGGNN missed to improve the model learning capacity. The extensive
experiments on Java and Python programming language from the public benchmark
CodeSearchNet confirm that GraphSearchNet outperforms current state-of-the-art
works.

Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithms that target an alternative distribution
$\mu^f_{1,\alpha,c} \propto e^{-\mathcal{H}^{f}_{1,\alpha,c}}$, where
$\mathcal{H}^{f}_{1,\alpha,c}$ is a landscape-modified Hamiltonian which we
introduce explicitly. The advantage of the Metropolis dynamics which targets
$\pi^f_{1,\alpha,c}$ is that it enjoys reduced critical height described by the
threshold parameter $c$, function $f$, and a penalty parameter $\alpha \geq 0$
that controls the state-dependent effect.
  First, we investigate the case of fixed $\alpha$ and propose a
self-normalized estimator that corrects for the bias of sampling and prove
asymptotic convergence results and Chernoff-type bound of the proposed
estimator.
  Next, we consider the case of annealing the penalty parameter $\alpha$. We
prove strong ergodicity and bounds on the total variation mixing time of the
resulting non-homogeneous chain subject to appropriate assumptions on the decay
of $\alpha$.
  We illustrate the proposed algorithms by comparing their mixing times with
the original Metropolis dynamics on statistical physics models including the
ferromagnetic Ising model on the hypercube or the complete graph and the
$q$-state Potts model on the two-dimensional torus. In these cases, the mixing
times of the classical Glauber dynamics are at least exponential in the system
size as the critical height grows at least linearly with the size, while the
proposed annealing algorithm, with appropriate choice of $f$, $c$, and
annealing schedule on $\alpha$, mixes rapidly with at most polynomial
dependence on the size. The crux of the proof harnesses on the important
observation that the reduced critical height can be bounded independently of
the size that gives rise to rapid mixing.

visual representations from unlabeled data. The core idea is training the

further generate more challenging training samples and force the model to keep
predicting discriminative representation on these hard samples. In this paper,
we propose MixSiam, a mixture-based approach upon the traditional siamese
network. On the one hand, we input two augmented images of an instance to the
backbone and obtain the discriminative representation by performing an
element-wise maximum of two features. On the other hand, we take the mixture of
these augmented images as input, and expect the model prediction to be close to
the discriminative representation. In this way, the model could access more
variant data samples of an instance and keep predicting invariant
discriminative representations for them. Thus the learned model is more robust
compared to previous contrastive learning methods. Extensive experiments on
large-scale datasets show that MixSiam steadily improves the baseline and
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be

regions. Although various unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have been
proposed in recent years, no method explicitly learns the temporal shift of
SITS and thus provides only limited benefits for crop classification. To
address this, we propose TimeMatch, which explicitly accounts for the temporal
shift for improved SITS-based domain adaptation. In TimeMatch, we first
estimate the temporal shift from the target to the source region using the
predictions of a source-trained model. Then, we re-train the model for the
target region by an iterative algorithm where the estimated shift is used to
generate accurate target pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an
open-access dataset for cross-region adaptation from SITS in four different
regions in Europe. On our dataset, we demonstrate that TimeMatch outperforms
all competing methods by 11% in average F1-score across five different
adaptation scenarios, setting a new state-of-the-art in cross-region
adaptation.

10-100 kpc from the supermassive black hole have so far been obscured by
instrumental limitations. Here we report low-frequency radio observations that

two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, trapped by a circular box potential
by using the Gross--Pitaevskii equation. We consider a situation in which two
vortices belong to different components and they are initially close. Their
dynamics are significantly different from those of a vortex pair in a
single-component condensate. When two vortices are initially co-located, they
are split by dynamical instability or remain co-located depending on their
intercomponent interaction. If the two split vortices have the same sign of
circulation, they rotate around each other. Then, the angular velocity can be
given as a function of the distance between two vortices, which is understood
through the equations of motion and their interaction. If the circulations of
two close vortices have different signs, however, they move in the same
direction initially, then overlap during the dynamics. This subsequent overlap
can be categorized into two types based on the initial distance between them.
The mechanism of this overlapping can be understood from the interaction
between the vortex and its image vortex, which makes the two vortices close to
each other even if the intrinsic interaction between them is repulsive.

expect that the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation should play a central role in
the long distance mean-field behavior of the 1D Bose gas. We first introduce
novel quantum states of a single dark soliton with a nonzero winding number. We
show them by exactly evaluating not only the density profile but also the
profiles of the square amplitude and phase of the matrix element of the field
operator between the $N$-particle and $(N-1)$-particle states. For elliptic
double dark-solitons, the density and phase profiles of the corresponding
states almost perfectly agree with those of the classical solutions,
respectively, in the weak coupling regime. We then show that the scheme of the
mean-field product state is quite effective for the quantum states of double
dark solitons. Assigning the ideal Gaussian weights to a sum of the excited
states with two particle-hole excitations we obtain double dark-solitons of
distinct narrow notches with different depths. We suggest that the mean-field
product state should be well approximated by the ideal Gaussian weighted sum of
the low excited states with a pair of particle-hole excitations. The results of
double dark-solitons should be fundamental and useful for constructing quantum
multiple dark-solitons.

designated endmarkers on a read-once input tape has proven to be extremely
useful for making a conscious, final decision on the acceptance/rejection of
each input word right after reading the right endmarker. With no endmarkers, by
contrast, a machine must constantly stay in either accepting or rejecting
states at any moment since it never notices the end of the input instance. This
situation, however, helps us analyze the behavior of the machine whose tape
head makes the consecutive moves on all prefixes of a given extremely long
input word. Since those two machine formulations have their own advantages, it
is natural to ask whether the endmarkers are truly necessary to correctly
recognize languages. In the deterministic and nondeterministic models, it is
well-known that the endmarkers are removable without changing the acceptance
criteria of each input instance. This paper proves that, for a more general
model of one-way probabilistic pushdown automata, the endmarkers are also
removable. This is proven by employing probabilistic transformations from an
""endmarker"" machine to an equivalent ""no-endmarker"" machine at the cost of
double exponential state complexity without compromising its error probability.
By setting this error probability appropriately, our proof also provides an
alternative proof to both the deterministic and the nondeterministic models as

state in the mean-field theory when t_1 = t'_1, focusing on collinear states
with two sublattices. It is shown that when the imbalance of the spatial
anisotropies of the two triangles is large, up-up-down-down (uudd) phases are
stable, and the most likely ground states of the lambda-(BETS)_2FeCl_4 system
are the Neel state with the modulation vector (\pi/c,\pi/a) and a uudd state,
where c = a_1 = a'_1 and a = (a_2+a'_2)/2, with a_1, a_1', a_2, and a_2' being
the lattice constants of the bonds with t_1, t'_1, t_2, and t'_2, respectively.
These results are consistent with those from the classical spin system. In
addition, this study reveals behaviors near the quantum critical point, which
cannot be reproduced in the localized spin model. As the imbalance of the
spatial anisotropies increases, the U_c of the Neel state increases, and that
of the uudd state decreases. In the phase diagrams containing areas of the
paramagnetic state, the Neel state with (\pi/c,\pi/a), and a uudd state, their
boundaries terminate at a triple point, near which all the transitions are of
the first order. The phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic phases does
not depend on U, and the transition is of the first order everywhere on the
boundary. By contrast, the transitions from the two antiferromagnetic phases to
the paramagnetic phase are of the second order, unless the system is close to

be eliminated in composite systems by engineering so-called
quantum-mechanics-free subspaces (QMFSs) of commuting variables, leading to a
trajectory of a quantum system without quantum uncertainties. This situation
can be realized in a composite system that includes a negative-mass subsystem,
which can be implemented by, e.g., a polarized spin ensemble or a
two-tone-driven optomechanical system. The realization of a trajectory without
quantum uncertainties implies entanglement between the subsystems, and allows
for measurements of motion, fields and forces with, in principle, unlimited
precision. To date, these principles have been developed theoretically and
demonstrated experimentally for a number of composite systems. However, the
utility of the concept has been limited by the dominating requirement of close
proximity of the resonance frequencies of the system of interest and the
negative-mass reference system, and by the need to embed the subsystems in a
narrowband cavity, which could be problematic while at the same time achieving
good overcoupling. Here we propose a general approach which overcomes these
limitations by employing periodic modulation of the driving fields (e.g.,
two-tone driving) in combination with coherent or measurement-based anti-noise
paths. This approach makes it possible to engineer a QMFS of two systems with
vastly different spectra and with arbitrary signs of their masses, while
dispensing with the need to embed the subsystems in a sideband-resolving
cavity. We discuss the advantages of this novel approach for applications such
as QBA evasion in gravitational wave detection, force sensing, and entanglement
generation between disparate systems.

computational self-testing protocol for Bell states in a single quantum device.
Their protocol relies on the fact that the target states are stabilizer states,
and hence it is highly non-trivial to reveal whether the other class of quantum
states, non-stabilizer states, can be self-tested within their framework. Among
non-stabilizer states, magic states are indispensable resources for universal
quantum computation. In this letter, we show that a magic state for the CCZ
gate can be self-tested while that for the T gate cannot. Our result is
applicable to a proof of quantumness, where we can classically verify whether a
quantum device generates a quantum state having non-zero magic.

on non-Hermitian topological physics. It has long been known that non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians can exhibit real energy spectra under the condition of parity-time
($PT$) symmetry -- commonly implemented with balanced loss and gain -- but only
when non-Hermiticity is relatively weak. Sufficiently strong non-Hermiticity,
on the other hand, will destroy the reality of energy spectra, a situation
known as spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking. Here, based on non-reciprocal
coupling, we show a systematic strategy to construct non-Hermitian topological
systems exhibiting bulk and boundary energy spectra that are always real,
regardless of weak or strong non-Hermiticity. Such nonreciprocal-coupling-based
non-Hermiticity can directly drive a topological phase transition and determine
the band topology, as demonstrated in a few non-Hermitian systems from 1D to
2D. Our work develops so far the only theory that can guarantee the reality of
energy spectra for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and offers a new avenue to
explore non-Hermitian topological physics.

by comparing images of printed layers from a stationary monocular camera with
G-code-based reference images of an ideal process generated with Blender, a
physics rendering engine. Recognition of visual deviations was accomplished by
analyzing the similarity of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) of local
image areas. The developed technique requires preliminary modeling of the
working environment to achieve the best match for orientation, color rendering,
lighting, and other parameters of the printed part. The output of the algorithm
is a level of mismatch between printed and synthetic reference layers. Twelve
similarity and distance measures were implemented and compared for their
effectiveness at detecting 3D printing errors on six different representative
failure types and their control error-free print images. The results show that
although Kendall tau, Jaccard, and Sorensen similarities are the most
sensitive, Pearson r, Spearman rho, cosine, and Dice similarities produce the
more reliable results. This open source method allows the program to notice
critical errors in the early stages of their occurrence and either pause
manufacturing processes for further investigation by an operator or in the
future AI-controlled automatic error correction. The implementation of this
novel method does not require preliminary data for training, and the greatest
efficiency can be achieved with the mass production of parts by either additive

this open source method is a promising means of enabling smart distributed

observational limits on primordial nuclear abundances. Within this constraint,
it is possible that nuclear motion is regulated by Coulomb scattering with
electrons and positrons ($e^\pm$'s), while $e^\pm$'s are affected by a PMF
rather than collisions. For example, at a temperature of $10^9$ K, thermal
nuclei typically experience $\sim 10^{21}$ scatterings per second that are
dominated by very small angle scattering leading to minuscule changes in the
nuclear kinetic energy of order $\mathcal{O}$(1) eV. In this paper the upper
limit on the effects of a possible discretization of the $e^\pm$ momenta by the
PMF on the nuclear momentum distribution is estimated under the extreme
assumptions that the momentum of the $e^\pm$ is relaxed before and after
Coulomb scattering to Landau levels, and that during Coulomb scattering the PMF
is neglected. This assumption explicitly breaks the time reversal invariance of
Coulomb scattering, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not a trivial
steady state solution of the Boltzmann equation under these assumptions. We
numerically evaluate the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation, and show
that the introduction of a special direction in the $e^\pm$ distribution by the
PMF generates no directional dependence of the collisional destruction term of
nuclei. Large anisotropies in the nuclear distribution function are then
constrained from big bang nucleosynthesis. Ultimately, we conclude that a PMF
does not significantly affect the isotropy or BBN.

Thomson effect that appears owing to magnetic phase transitions. The Thomson
coefficient of FeRh-based alloys reaches large values approaching $-$1,000
$\mu$VK$^{-1}$ around room temperature because of the steep temperature
dependence of the Seebeck coefficient associated with the
antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. The Thomson coefficient is
several orders of magnitude larger than the Seebeck coefficient of the alloys.
Using the active thermography technique, we demonstrate that the Thomson
cooling can be much larger than Joule heating in the same material even in a
nearly steady state. The operation temperature of the giant Thomson effect in
the FeRh-based alloys can be tuned over a wide range by applying an external
magnetic field or by slightly changing the composition. Our findings provide a
new direction in the materials science of thermoelectrics and pave the way for

important information embedded in a distributed high-dimensional dataset by
distributed computation of a reduced-dimension data subspace, called principal

we propose a framework of analog MIMO transmission featuring the uncoded analog
transmission of local PCs for estimating the global PCs. To cope with channel
distortion and noise, two maximum-likelihood (global) PC estimators are
presented corresponding to the cases with and without receive channel state
information (CSI). The first design, termed coherent PC estimator, is derived
by solving a Procrustes problem and reveals the form of regularized channel
inversion where the regulation attempts to alleviate the effects of both
receiver noise and data noise. The second one, termed blind PC estimator, is
designed based on the subspace channel-rotation-invariance property and
computes a centroid of received local PCs on a Grassmann manifold. Using the
manifold-perturbation theory, tight bounds on the mean square subspace distance
(MSSD) of both estimators are derived for performance evaluation. The results
reveal simple scaling laws of MSSD concerning device population, data and
channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and array sizes. More importantly, both
estimators are found to have identical scaling laws, suggesting the
dispensability of CSI to accelerate DPCA. Simulation results validate the
derived results and demonstrate the promising latency performance of the

mathematical theory is proposed to take into account a general form of
non-locality in kernels of fractional vector differential and integral
operators. Self-consistency involves proving generalizations of all fundamental
theorems of vector calculus for generalized kernels of operators. In the
generalization of FVC from power-law nonlocality to the general form of
nonlocality in space, we use the general fractional calculus in the Luchko
approach. This paper proposed the following: (1) Self-consistent definitions of
general fractional differential vector operators: the regional and line general
fractional gradients, the regional and surface general fractional curl
operators, the general fractional divergence are proposed. (2) Self-consistent
definitions of general fractional integral vector operators: the general
fractional circulation, general fractional flux and general fractional volume
integral are proposed. (3) The general fractional gradient, Green, Stokes and
Gauss theorems as fundamental theorems of general fractional vector calculus
are proved for simple and complex regions. The fundamental theorems (Gradient,
Green, Stokes, Gauss theorems) of the proposed general FVC are proved for a
wider class of domains, surfaces and curves. Therefore we can state that we
proposed a calculus, which is a general fractional vector calculus. The
difficulties and problems of defining general fractional integral and
differential vector operators are discussed to the nonlocal case, caused by the
violation of standard product (Leibniz) rule, chain rule, and semigroup
property. General FVC for orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, which includes
general fractional vector operators for the spherical and cylindrical
coordinates, is also proposed.

  Decentralized EXchange","27 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SPEEDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets participants securely
trade assets without giving any single party undue control over the market.
SPEEDEX offers several advantages over prior DEXes. It achieves high throughput
-- over 200,000 transactions per second on 48-core servers, even with tens of
millions of open offers. SPEEDEX runs entirely within a Layer-1 blockchain, and
thus achieves its scalability without fragmenting market liquidity between
multiple blockchains or rollups. It eliminates internal arbitrage
opportunities, so that a direct trade from asset $\mathcal{A}$ to asset
$\mathcal{B}$ always receives as good a price as trading through some third
asset such as USD. Finally, it prevents certain front-running attacks that
would otherwise increase the effective bid-ask spread for small traders.
SPEEDEX's key design insight is its use of an Arrow-Debreu exchange market
structure that fixes the valuation of assets for all trades in a given block of
transactions. We construct an algorithm, which is both asymptotically efficient
and empirically practical, that computes these valuations while exactly
preserving a DEX's financial correctness constraints. Not only does this market
structure provide fairness across trades, but it also makes trade operations
commutative and hence efficiently parallelizable. SPEEDEX is prototyped but not
yet merged within the Stellar blockchain, one of the largest Layer-1
blockchains.

of the promising ways to store H$_2$ for its practical applications. Covalent
Organic Frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for H$_2$-storage due to
high porosity, surface area and tunable characteristics. To improve the
hydrogen physisorption in the COFs, the chelation of transition metals (TM) in
the building blocks of the framework has been studied by using first
principle-based density functional theory (DFT) method. Here, we report total
96 H$_2$ complexes made of six different COF linkers and chelated with the Sc,
Ti and V atoms interacting with up to H$_2$ molecules. The molecular
interactions between physisorption H$_2$ and these Sc-, Ti- and V-chelated
linkers have been explored in detail. The binding enthalpy of the most
complexes is higher than ~10 kJ/mol, which is the basic requirement for
practical H$_2$-storage. In the total interaction energy (between physisorption
H$_2$ and chelated linkers), the dispersion and electrostatic interactions are
dominant. This study is essential in finding out the more efficient COF linkers
for practical H$_2$ storage. It can also help to improve the uptake of existing
porous materials for H$_2$ storage. The present study paves a way to design
transition metal chelated COFs for an effective H$_2$-storage and the knowledge
gained from this study is expected to provide some inspiration for developing
the corresponding experiments.

has been extensively studied. The conventional wisdom has been that the
transition from the plaquette valence bond order to the Neel order is direct
and potentially realizes a deconfined quantum critical point beyond the
Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. This scenario however was challenged recently by
improved numerics from density matrix renormalization group which offers
evidence for a narrow gapless spin liquid between the two phases. Prompted by
this controversy and to shed light on this intricate parameter regime from a
fresh perspective, we report high-resolution functional renormalization group
analysis of the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model. The flows of over 50
million running couplings provide a detailed picture for the evolution of spin
correlations as the frequency/energy scale is dialed from the ultraviolet to
the infrared to yield the zero temperature phase diagram. The singlet dimer
phase emerges as a fixed point, the Neel order is characterized by divergence
in the vertex function, while the transition into and out of the plaquette
order is accompanied by pronounced peaks in the plaquette susceptibility. The
plaquette order is suppressed before the onset of the Neel order, lending
evidence for a finite spin liquid region for $J_1/J_2\in (0.77,0.82)$, where
the flow is continuous without any indication of divergence.

Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. One of the major research challenges
is to allocate the physical resources such that the failure of the physical
resources would bring less impact onto the users' service. Additionally, the
major challenge is to handle the embedding process of growing number of
incoming users' VNs from the algorithm design point-of-view. Considering both
of the above-mentioned research issues, a novel Failure aware Semi-Centralized
VNE (FSC-VNE) algorithm is proposed for the Fat-Tree data center network with
the goal to reduce the impact of the resource failure onto the existing users.
The impact of failure of the Physical Machines (PMs), physical links and
network devices are taken into account while allocating the resources to the
users. The beauty of the proposed algorithm is that the VMs are assigned to
different PMs in a semi-centralized manner. In other words, the embedding
algorithm is executed by multiple physical servers in order to concurrently
embed the VMs of a VN and reduces the embedding time. Extensive simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform over other VNE

computing and networking resources of cloud data centers among multiple users.
Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is highly important and is an integral part of
the cloud resource management. The lack of historical knowledge on cloud
functioning and inability to foresee the future resource demand are two
fundamental shortcomings of the traditional VNE approaches. The consequence of
those shortcomings is the inefficient embedding of virtual resources on
Substrate Nodes (SNs). On the contrary, application of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) in VNE is still in the premature stage and needs further investigation.
Considering the underlying complexity of VNE that includes numerous parameters,
intelligent solutions are required to utilize the cloud resources efficiently
via careful selection of appropriate SNs for the VNE. In this paper,
Reinforcement Learning based prediction model is designed for the efficient
Multi-stage Virtual Network Embedding (MUVINE) among the cloud data centers.
The proposed MUVINE scheme is extensively simulated and evaluated against the
recent state-of-the-art schemes. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed
MUVINE scheme consistently outperforms over the existing schemes and provides

However, capturing such sequential behavior is not easy because each user's
short-term or long-term behavior must be taken into account. For this reason,
many research results show that the performance of recommending a specific
movie is not very high in a sequential recommendation. In this paper, we
propose a cluster-based method for classifying users with similar movie

itself considering their short-term and long-term behaviors. The movie genre
prediction does not recommend a specific movie, but it predicts the genre for
the next movie to watch in consideration of each user's preference for the
movie genre based on the genre included in the movie. Through this, it is
possible to provide appropriate guidelines for recommending movies including
the genre to users who tend to prefer a specific genre. In particular, in this
paper, users with similar genre preferences are organized into clusters to
recommend genres, and in clusters that do not have relatively specific
tendencies, genre prediction is performed by appropriately trimming genres that
are not necessary for recommendation in order to improve performance. We
evaluate our method on well-known movie datasets, and qualitatively that it
captures personalized dynamics and is able to make meaningful recommendations.

temporal boundary annotations which are expensive and time-consuming to label.
Hence weakly supervised methods have been put forward recently by only using
coarse video-level label. Despite effectiveness, these methods usually process
moment candidates independently, while ignoring a critical issue that the
natural temporal dependencies between candidates in different temporal scales.
To cope with this issue, we propose a Multi-scale 2D Representation Learning
method for weakly supervised video moment retrieval. Specifically, we first
construct a two-dimensional map for each temporal scale to capture the temporal
dependencies between candidates. Two dimensions in this map indicate the start
and end time points of these candidates. Then, we select top-K candidates from
each scale-varied map with a learnable convolutional neural network. With a
newly designed Moments Evaluation Module, we obtain the alignment scores of the
selected candidates. At last, the similarity between captions and language
query is served as supervision for further training the candidates' selector.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art
results.

should give rise to line driving, producing a powerful wind which may play an
important role in AGN feedback as well as in producing structures like the
broad line region. However, coupled radiation-hydrodynamics codes are complex
and expensive, so we calculate the winds instead using a non-hydrodynamical
approach (the Qwind framework). The original Qwind model assumed the initial
conditions in the wind, and had only simple radiation transport. Here, we
present an improved version which derives the wind initial conditions and has
significantly improved ray-tracing to calculate the wind absorption self
consistently given the extended nature of the UV emission. We also correct the
radiation flux for relativistic effects, and assess the impact of this on the
wind velocity. These changes mean the model is more physical, so its
predictions are more robust. We find that, even when accounting for
relativistic effects, winds can regularly achieve velocities $\simeq$ (0.1-0.5)
$c$, and carry mass loss rates which can be up to 30% of the accreted mass for
black hole masses of $10^{7-9}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and mass accretion rates of
50% of the Eddington rate. Overall, the wind power scales as a power law with
the black hole mass accretion rate, unlike the weaker scaling generally assumed
in current cosmological simulations that include AGN feedback. The updated
code, Qwind3, is publicly available in GitHub

the case of the innovative ASTRI telescope, developed by INAF, exploiting sky
images produced as an ancillary output by its novel Cherenkov camera. In fact,
this instrument implements a statistical technique called ""Variance method""
(VAR) owning the potentiality to image the star field (angular resolution $\sim
11'$). We demonstrate here that VAR images can be exploited to assess the
alignment of the Cherenkov camera with the optical axis of the telescope down
to $\sim 1''$. To this end, we evaluate the position of the stars with
sub-pixel precision thanks to a deep investigation of the convolution between
the point spread function and the pixel distribution of the camera, resulting
in a transformation matrix that we validated with simulations. After that, we
considered the rotation of the field of view during long observing runs,
obtaining light arcs that we exploited to investigate the alignment of the
Cherenkov camera with high precision, in a procedure that we have already
tested on real data. The strategy we have adopted, inherited from optical
astronomy, has never been performed on Variance images from a Cherenkov

$J183221.56-162724.25$ (in short $J1832$) with an orbital period of $8.87hr$.
The system features a box-like deep eclipse with a full width at 50% depth of
$1970\pm2s$ and a large-amplitude coherent pulsation with
$P_\mathrm{obs}\!=\!65.18min$, which represents either the synodic (beat)

$P_\mathrm{spin}\!/P_\mathrm{orb} = 0.1091$ or $0.1225$, respectively. The
eclipsed light originates almost entirely from the two accretion spots and
columns on the WD, with characteristics indicative of pole flipping. There is
no evidence for an accretion disk, and we identify J1832 as the first deeply
eclipsing stream-fed intermediate polar. Our $grizy$ photometry in eclipse
yielded an $i$-band AB magnitude of the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star of
18.98(3), an extinction $E_\mathrm{B-V}\!=\!0.54\!\pm\!0.17$, and a spectral
type $\sim\,K6$. Dynamic models, fitting the photometry, limit the distance to
between 1270 and 2500pc for masses of the secondary star, $M_2$, between $0.16$
and $1.0M_\mathrm{\odot}$, well within the Gaia EDR3 confidence limits.
Employing a luminosity selection inspired by binary population studies yields a

from where the binary can evolve into either a polar or an ultracompact binary

the growing interest in development of scalable quantum technologies. Recently,
hexagonal boron nitride has garnered significant attention in quantum photonic
applications due to its ability to host optically stable quantum emitters.
However, the large band gap of hBN and the lack of efficient doping inhibits
electrical triggering and limits opportunities to study electrical control of
emitters. Here, we show an approach to electrically modulate quantum emitters
in n hBN graphene van der Waals heterostructure. We show that quantum emitters
in hBN can be reversibly activated and modulated by applying a bias across the
device. Notably, a significant number of quantum emitters are intrinsically
dark, and become optically active at non-zero voltages. To explain the results,
we provide a heuristic electrostatic model of this unique behaviour. Finally,
employing these devices we demonstrate a nearly coherent source with linewidths
of 160 MHz. Our results enhance the potential of hBN for tuneable solid state
quantum emitters for the growing field of quantum information science.

modification and based on the interplay between model theory and algorithmic
graph minors. The core of our framework is a new compound logic operating with
two types of sentences, expressing graph modification: the modulator sentence,
defining some property of the modified part of the graph, and the target
sentence, defining some property of the resulting graph. In our framework,
modulator sentences are in counting monadic second-order logic (CMSOL) and have
models of bounded treewidth, while target sentences express first-order logic
(FOL) properties along with minor-exclusion. Our logic captures problems that
are not definable in first-order logic and, moreover, may have instances of
unbounded treewidth. Also, it permits the modeling of wide families of problems
involving vertex/edge removals, alternative modulator measures (such as
elimination distance or $\mathcal{G}$-treewidth), multistage modifications, and
various cut problems. Our main result is that, for this compound logic,
model-checking can be done in quadratic time. All derived algorithms are
constructive and this, as a byproduct, extends the constructibility horizon of
the algorithmic applications of the Graph Minors theorem of Robertson and
Seymour. The proposed logic can be seen as a general framework to capitalize on
the potential of the irrelevant vertex technique. It gives a way to deal with
problem instances of unbounded treewidth, for which Courcelle's theorem does
not apply. The proof of our meta-theorem combines novel combinatorial results
related to the Flat Wall theorem along with elements of the proof of
Courcelle's theorem and Gaifman's theorem. We finally prove extensions where
the target property is expressible in FOL+DP, i.e., the enhancement of FOL with
disjoint-paths predicates.

collecting approximately per-flow statistics in data plane in real-time. Among
them, Count-Min sketch is a versatile tool to measure spectral density of high
volume data using a small amount of memory and low processing overhead. Due to
its simplicity and versatility, Count-Min sketch and its variants have been
adopted in many works as a stand alone or even as a supporting measurement

structure not fully accommodating Zipfian distribution and the indiscriminate
update algorithm without considering a counter value. This in turn degrades the
accuracy of heavy hitter, heavy changer, cardinality, and entropy. To enhance

One of the most notable approaches is to cascade multiple sketches in a
sequential manner so that either mouse or elephant flows should be filtered to
separate elephants from mouse flows such as Elastic sketch (an elephant filter
leveraging TCAM + Count-Min) and FCM sketch (Count-Min-based layered mouse

better estimation. To this end, we are facing two challenges: one is (a) how to

proposed in the last decades which allow decomposing multi-component signals

Decomposition technique and the Iterative Filtering method. When a signal
contains mono-components that have rapid varying instantaneous frequencies, we
can think, for instance, to chirps or whistles, it becomes particularly hard
for most techniques to properly factor out these components. The Adaptive Local
Iterative Filtering technique has recently gained interest in many applied
fields of research for being able to deal with non-stationary signals
presenting amplitude and frequency modulation. In this work, we address the
open question of how to guarantee a priori convergence of this technique, and
propose two new algorithms. The first method, called Stable Adaptive Local
Iterative Filtering, is a stabilized version of the Adaptive Local Iterative
Filtering that we prove to be always convergent. The stability, however, comes
at the cost of higher complexity in the calculations. The second technique,
called Resampled Iterative Filtering, is a new generalization of the Iterative
Filtering method. We prove that Resampled Iterative Filtering is guaranteed to
converge a priori for any kind of signal. Furthermore, in the discrete setting,
by leveraging on the mathematical properties of the matrices involved, we show
that its calculations can be accelerated drastically. Finally, we present some
artificial and real-life examples to show the powerfulness and performance of
the proposed methods.

space with finite density intersecting any convex body of volume one. A recent
approach to this problem is concerned with the construction of dense forests
and is obtained by a suitable weakening of the volume constraint. A dense
forest is a discrete point set of finite density getting uniformly close to
long enough line segments. The distribution of points in a dense forest is then
quantified in terms of a visibility function. Another way to weaken the
assumptions in Danzer's problem is by relaxing the density constraint. In this
respect, a new concept is introduced in this paper, namely that of an optical
forest. An optical forest in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a point set with optimal
visibility but not necessarily with finite density. In the literature, the best
constructions of Danzer sets and dense forests lack effectivity. The goal of
this paper is to provide constructions of dense and optical forests which yield
the best known results in any dimension $d \ge 2$ both in terms of visibility
and density bounds and effectiveness. Namely, there are three main results in
this work: (1) the construction of a dense forest with the best known
visibility bound which, furthermore, enjoys the property of being
deterministic; (2) the deterministic construction of an optical forest with a
density failing to be finite only up to a logarithm and (3) the construction of
a planar Peres-type forest (that is, a dense forest obtained from a
construction due to Peres) with the best known visibility bound. This is
achieved by constructing a deterministic digital sequence satisfying strong

accurate real-time flood warnings to agencies and the public, with a focus on
riverine floods in large, gauged rivers. It became operational in 2018 and has
since expanded geographically. This forecasting system consists of four
subsystems: data validation, stage forecasting, inundation modeling, and alert
distribution. Machine learning is used for two of the subsystems. Stage
forecasting is modeled with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the
Linear models. Flood inundation is computed with the Thresholding and the
Manifold models, where the former computes inundation extent and the latter
computes both inundation extent and depth. The Manifold model, presented here
for the first time, provides a machine-learning alternative to hydraulic
modeling of flood inundation. When evaluated on historical data, all models
achieve sufficiently high-performance metrics for operational use. The LSTM
showed higher skills than the Linear model, while the Thresholding and Manifold
models achieved similar performance metrics for modeling inundation extent.
During the 2021 monsoon season, the flood warning system was operational in
India and Bangladesh, covering flood-prone regions around rivers with a total
area of 287,000 km2, home to more than 350M people. More than 100M flood alerts
were sent to affected populations, to relevant authorities, and to emergency
organizations. Current and future work on the system includes extending
coverage to additional flood-prone locations, as well as improving modeling
capabilities and accuracy.

effective when designed and evaluated in a single organisation. However, it has
been very challenging to design an ML-based detection system by utilising
heterogeneous network data samples originating from several sources. This is
mainly due to privacy concerns and the lack of a universal format of datasets.
In this paper, we propose a collaborative federated learning scheme to address
these issues. The proposed framework allows multiple organisations to join
forces in the design, training, and evaluation of a robust ML-based network
intrusion detection system. The threat intelligence scheme utilises two
critical aspects for its application; the availability of network data traffic
in a common format to allow for the extraction of meaningful patterns across
data sources. Secondly, the adoption of a federated learning mechanism to avoid
the necessity of sharing sensitive users' information between organisations. As
a result, each organisation benefits from other organisations cyber threat
intelligence while maintaining the privacy of its data internally. The model is
trained locally and only the updated weights are shared with the remaining
participants in the federated averaging process. The framework has been
designed and evaluated in this paper by using two key datasets in a NetFlow
format known as NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and NF-BoT-IoT-v2. Two other common scenarios
are considered in the evaluation process; a centralised training method where
the local data samples are shared with other organisations and a localised
training method where no threat intelligence is shared. The results demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework by designing a
universal ML model effectively classifying benign and intrusive traffic
originating from multiple organisations without the need for local data

that plays a significant role in the design of reliable and stable optical
networks. A fiber measurement system that combines automated data acquisition
and processing represents a disruptive impact in the management of optical
fiber networks with fast and reliable event detection. It has been shown in the
literature that the linearized Bregman iterations (LBI) algorithm and
variations can be successfully used for processing and accurately identifying
faults in a fiber profile. One of the factors that impact the performance of
these algorithms is the degradation of spatial resolution, which is mainly
caused by the appearance of fault clusters due to a reduced number of
iterations. In this paper, a method is proposed based on an approximate
deconvolution approach for increasing the spatial resolution, possible after a
thorough analysis of fault clusters that appear in the algorithm's output. The
effect of such approximate deconvolution is shown to extend beyond the
improvement of spatial resolution, allowing for better performances to be
reached at shorter processing times. An efficient hardware architecture that
implements the approximate deconvolution, compatible with the hardware
structure recently presented for the LBI algorithm, is also proposed and
discussed.

mass loading, but the interaction is dependent on cometary activity. We
investigate the details of this process at comet 67P using the Rosetta Ion
Composition Analyzer. Aims: This study aims to compare the interaction of the
solar wind and cometary ions during two different time periods in the Rosetta
mission. Methods: We compared both the integrated ion moments (density,
velocity, and momentum flux) and the velocity distribution functions for two
days, four months apart. The velocity distribution functions were projected
into a coordinate system dependent on the magnetic field direction and averaged
over three hours. Results: The first case shows highly scattered H+ in both ion
moments and velocity distribution function. The He2+ ions are somewhat
scattered, but less so, and appear more like those of H2O+ pickup ions. The
second case shows characteristic evidence of mass-loading, where the solar wind
species are deflected, but the velocity distribution function is not
significantly changed. Conclusions: The distributions of H+ in the first case,
when compared to He2+ and H2O+ pickup ions, are indicative of a narrow
cometosheath on the scale of the H+ gyroradius. Thus, He2+ and H2O+, with
larger gyroradii, are largely able to pass through this cometosheath. An
examination of the momentum flux tensor suggests that all species in the first
case have a significant non-gyrotropic momentum flux component that is higher
than that of the second mass-loaded case. Mass loading is not a sufficient
explanation for the distribution functions and momentum flux tensor in the
first case, and so we assume this is evidence of bow shock formation.

design concept for the coordination of future TSO/DSO- and
DSO/DSO-interactions. Hierarchical approaches are based on the aggregation of
decentralized ancillary service potentials, represented by converter-coupled,
communicable active and reactive power flexibility providing units (FPU) (e.g.
wind turbines) at vertical system interfaces. The resulting PQ-polygon made
available by the DSO for a potential request of ancillary service flexibilities
by the TSO is called feasible operation region (FOR). A monetarization of the
FOR is necessary for the implementation as operational degree of freedom within
higher-level grid control. This paper presents an approach for the
monetarization of the FOR in the context of a hierarchical multi-level
flexibility market by a cost structure using metadata from population based
optimization methods. Multiple FPU flexibility polygons at a single bus are
aggregated for a reduction of the search space dimensions. The main
contribution of the proposed method is the cost-optimal disaggregation of a
flexibility demand to the single FPUs within the aggregated FPU by a mixed
integer linear program (MILP). Therefore, a local flexibility market
considering bids for the active and reactive power flexibilities by the FPUs
stakeholders is assumed. The approach is applied within a case-study of the
Cigr\'e medium voltage system.

on the machine. However, these hardware extensions might not cope with the
security and safety requirements of the specific use case, and additionally,
they might not always be available. A notable example is the emerging RISC-V
architecture, that is today gaining a lot of traction in the mixed criticality
field, but that do not offer today hardware virtualization extensions. In this
paper VOSySmonitoRV is proposed as a mixed-criticality solution for RISC-V

in a secure and isolated manner by running in the highest privileged machine
level. A specific benchmark, measuring the interrupt latency and context switch

claims that form the core of their work. We will correct these claims and put
them into the right perspective: First, the conformal invariance as proposed by
Waclawczyk et al. is not related to the result that zero-isolines of the scalar
field in the inverse energy cascade display a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE).
Second, the conformal invariance is not a Lie-group for all values of the
scalar field since it inherently violates the smoothness axiom of a Lie-group
action, with the effect that a physical PDF gets mapped to a non-physical one.
Third, although Waclawczyk et al. recognize that their conformal invariance
does not constitute a symmetry but only a weaker equivalence transformation, it
is still not classified correctly. The claim that their equivalence can map
between solutions is not true. This fact will be demonstrated by using an
illustrative example.

large impacts on democracy and business. Computer science can, for the first
time in history, provide for truly anonymous communication. We investigate this
in relation to the values and rights of accountability, fairness and data
protection, focusing on opportunities and limitations of the anonymity that can
be provided computationally; possible consequences of outsourcing
whistleblowing support; and challenges for the interpretation and use of some
relevant laws. We conclude that to address these questions, whistleblowing and
anonymous whistleblowing must rest on three pillars, forming a 'triangle of
whistleblowing protection and incentivisation' that combines anonymity in a
formal and technical sense; whistleblower protection through laws; and other
norms and practices including organisational error culture.

study emergent communication between agents, yet little focus has been given to
continuous acoustic communication. This would be more akin to human language
acquisition; human infants acquire language in large part through continuous
signalling with their caregivers. We therefore ask: Are we able to observe
emergent language between agents with a continuous communication channel? Our
goal is to provide a platform to begin bridging the gap between human and agent
communication, allowing us to analyse continuous signals, how they emerge,
their characteristics, and how they relate to human language acquisition. We
propose a messaging environment where a Speaker agent needs to convey a set of
attributes to a Listener over a noisy acoustic channel. Using DQN to train our
agents, we show that: (1) unlike the discrete case, the acoustic Speaker learns
redundancy to improve Listener coherency, (2) the acoustic Speaker develops
more compositional communication protocols which implicitly compensates for
transmission errors over a noisy channel, and (3) DQN has significant
performance gains and increased compositionality when compared to previous
methods optimised using REINFORCE.

full-wave three-dimensional calculations to quantify the performance of
conventional and topological photonic crystal waveguides as chiral
emitter-photon interfaces. Specifically, the ability of these structures to
support and enhance directional interactions while suppressing subsequent
backscattering losses is quantified. Broken symmetry waveguides, such as the
non-topological glide-plane waveguide and topological bearded interface
waveguide are found to act as efficient chiral interfaces, with the topological
waveguide modes allowing for operation at significantly higher Purcell
enhancement factors. Finally, although all structures suffer from
backscattering losses due to fabrication imperfections, these are found to be
smaller at high enhancement factors for the topological waveguide. These
reduced losses occur because the optical mode is pushed away from the
air-dielectric interfaces where scattering occurs, and not because of any
topological protection. These results are important to the understanding of
light-matter interactions in topological photonic crystals and to the design of

  Systems with Colluding Vehicles",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The rapid advancements of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial
intelligence (AI) have catalyzed the development of adaptive traffic signal
control systems (ATCS) for smart cities. In particular, deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) methods produce the state-of-the-art performance and have great
potentials for practical applications. In the existing DRL-based ATCS, the
controlled signals collect traffic state information from nearby vehicles, and
then optimal actions (e.g., switching phases) can be determined based on the
collected information. The DRL models fully ""trust"" that vehicles are sending
the true information to the signals, making the ATCS vulnerable to adversarial
attacks with falsified information. In view of this, this paper first time
formulates a novel task in which a group of vehicles can cooperatively send
falsified information to ""cheat"" DRL-based ATCS in order to save their total
travel time. To solve the proposed task, we develop CollusionVeh, a generic and
effective vehicle-colluding framework composed of a road situation encoder, a
vehicle interpreter, and a communication mechanism. We employ our method to
attack established DRL-based ATCS and demonstrate that the total travel time
for the colluding vehicles can be significantly reduced with a reasonable
number of learning episodes, and the colluding effect will decrease if the
number of colluding vehicles increases. Additionally, insights and suggestions
for the real-world deployment of DRL-based ATCS are provided. The research
outcomes could help improve the reliability and robustness of the ATCS and
better protect the smart mobility systems.

1)$, we distribute a cluster of nanoparticles enjoying moderately contrasting
relative permittivity and permeability which can be anisotropic.
  We show that the effective permittivity and permeability generated by such
cluster is explicitly characterized by the corresponding electric and magnetic
polarization tensors of the fixed shape. The error of the approximation of the
scattered fields corresponding to the cluster and the effective medium is
inversely proportional to the dilution parameter $c_r:=\frac{\delta}{a}$ where
$a$ is the maximum diameter of the nanoparticles and $\delta$ the minimum
distance between them. The constant of the proportionality is given in terms of
a priori bounds on the cluster of nanoparticles (i.e. upper and lower bounds on
their permittivity and permeability parameters, upper bound on the dilution
parameter $c_r$, the used incident frequency and the domain $\Omega$).
  A key point of the analysis is to show that the Foldy-Lax field appearing in
the meso-scale approximation, derived in \cite{AM}, is a discrete form of a
(continuous) system of Lippmann-Schwinger equations with a related effective
permittivity and permeability contrasts. To derive this, we prove that the
Lippmann-Schwinger operator, for the Maxwell system, is invertible in the
H\""{o}lder spaces. As a by-product, this shows a H\""{o}lder regularity property
of the electromagnetic fields up to the boundary of the inhomogeneity.

measurability from the viewpoint of quantum measurement theory. Very often,
quantum work and fluctuation theorems are discussed in the framework of
projective two-point measurement (TPM) schemes. According to a well known no-go
theorem, there is no work observable which satisfies both (i) an average work
condition and (ii) the TPM statistics for diagonal input states. Such
projective measurements represent a restrictive class among all possible
measurements. It is desirable, both from a theoretical and experimental point
of view, to extend the scheme to the general case including suitably designed
unsharp measurements. This shifts the focus to the question what information
about work and its fluctuations one is able to extract from such generalized
measurements. We show that the no-go theorem no longer holds if the observables
in a TPM scheme are jointly measurable for any intermediate unitary evolution.
We explicitly construct a model with unsharp energy measurements and derive
bounds for the visibility that ensure joint measurability. In such an unsharp
scenario a single work measurement apparatus can be constructed that allows us
to determine the correct average work and to obtain free energy differences
with the help of a Jarzynski equality.

each client by a linear combination of all local soft predictions using a
knowledge coefficient matrix, which can adaptively reinforce the collaboration
among clients who own similar data distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the
contributions of each client to others' personalized training, the knowledge
coefficient matrix is parameterized so that it can be trained simultaneously
with the models. The knowledge coefficient matrix and the model parameters are
alternatively updated in each round following the gradient descent way.
Extensive experiments on various datasets (EMNIST, Fashion\_MNIST, CIFAR-10)
are conducted under different settings (heterogeneous models and data
distributions). It is demonstrated that the proposed framework is the first
federated learning paradigm that realizes personalized model training via
parameterized group knowledge transfer while achieving significant performance
gain comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.

can render the results of an analysis unreliable. Numerous corrections for the
effects of measurement error have been proposed and studied, often under the
assumption of a normally distributed, additive measurement error model. One
such method is simulation extrapolation, or SIMEX. In many situations observed
data are non-symmetric, heavy-tailed, or otherwise highly non-normal. In these
settings, correction techniques relying on the assumption of normality are
undesirable. We propose an extension to the simulation extrapolation method
which is nonparametric in the sense that no specific distributional assumptions
are required on the error terms. The technique is implemented when either
validation data or replicate measurements are available, and is designed to be
immediately accessible for those familiar with simulation extrapolation.

The heavy gluonium with : $[M_{P_2}, f_{P_2}]=[2751(140),500(43)]$ MeV

theory. This kind of quantum nonlocality is based on the task of local
discrimination of quantum states. Recently, Bandyopadhyay and Halder [Phys.
Rev. A 104, L050201 (2021)] studied the problem: is there any set of orthogonal
states which can be locally distinguishable, but under some orthogonality
preserving local measurement, each outcome will lead to a locally
indistinguishable set. We say that the set with such property has hidden
nonlocality. Moreover, if such phenomenon can not arise from discarding
subsystems which is termed as local irredundancy, we call it genuine hidden
nonlocality. There, they presented several sets of entangled states with
genuine hidden nonlocality. However, they doubted the existence of a set
without entanglement but with genuine hidden nonlocality. In this paper, we
eliminate this doubt by constructing a series of sets without entanglement but
whose nonlocality can be genuinely activated. We derive a method to tackle with
the local irredundancy problem which is a key tricky for the systems whose
local dimensions are composite numbers. As Bandyopadhyay and Halder have been
pointed out, sets with genuine hidden nonloclity would lead to some
applications on the data hiding.

an effective model to include the environment because it significantly affects
the quantum dynamics. A prototypical effect known as Environment-Assisted
Quantum Transport (ENAQT) consists in the modulation and sometimes enhancement
of the transfer efficiency by the interaction with an environment. A simple
description of this phenomenon is obtained by a quantum master equation
describing a quantum walk over the molecular network in the presence of
inter-site decoherence. We consider the problem of simulating the dynamics
underlying ENAQT in a digital quantum computer. Two different quantum
algorithms are introduced, the first one based on stochastic Hamiltonians and
the second one based on a collision scheme. We test both algorithms by
simulating ENAQT in a small molecular network on a quantum computer emulator
and provide a comparative analysis of the two approaches. Both algorithms can
be implemented in a memory efficient encoding with the number of required
qubits scaling logarithmically with the size of the simulated system while the
number of gates increases quadratically. We discuss the algorithmic quantum
trajectories generated by the two simulation strategies showing that they
realize distinct unravellings of the site-dephasing master equation. In our
approach, the non-unitary dynamics of the open system is obtained through
effective representations of the environment, paving the way to digital quantum
simulations of quantum transport influenced by structured environments.

contain frequency domain interpolation, which is not differentiable with
respect to the sampling pattern, complicating the use of gradient methods. This
paper describes an efficient and accurate approach for computing approximate
gradients involving NUFFTs. Multiple numerical experiments validated the
improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approximation. As an
application to computational imaging, the NUFFT Jacobians were used to optimize
non-Cartesian MRI sampling trajectories via data-driven stochastic
optimization. Specifically, the sampling patterns were learned with respect to
various model-based reconstruction algorithms, including quadratic regularized
reconstruction and compressed sensing-based reconstruction. The proposed
approach enables sampling optimization for image sizes that are infeasible with
standard auto-differentiation methods due to memory limits. The synergistic
acquisition and reconstruction lead to remarkably improved image quality. In
fact, we show that model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) methods with
suitably optimized imaging parameters can perform nearly as well as CNN-based
methods.

shown that the binary populations of high-mass, high-density star clusters like
the ONC may substantially differ from those in low-mass associations. Very low
mass stellar and sub-stellar binaries at wide separations, $>$20AU, are
statistically rare in the Galactic field and have been identified in stellar
associations like Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus. They also may be susceptible to
dynamical interactions, and their formation may be suppressed by feedback from

conditions for high-order accurate finite-difference approximations. The
approach, called the Local Compatibility Boundary Condition (LCBC) method, uses
boundary conditions and compatibility boundary conditions derived from the
governing equations, as well as interior and boundary grid values, to construct
a local polynomial, whose degree matches the order of accuracy of the interior
scheme, centered at each boundary point. The local polynomial is then used to
derive a discrete formula for each ghost point in terms of the data. This
approach leads to centered approximations that are generally more accurate and
stable than one-sided approximations. Moreover, the stencil approximations are
local since they do not couple to neighboring ghost-point values which can
occur with traditional compatibility conditions. The local polynomial is
derived using continuous operators and derivatives which enables the automatic
construction of stencil approximations at different orders of accuracy. The
LCBC method is developed here for problems governed by second-order partial

beams.These methods are based on the spin-dependent AC-Stark shifts of the
$^3$P$_2$ states, or the $^3$P$_2$-$^3$P$_0$ Raman coupling. We show that due
to the structure of alkaline-earth (like) atoms, the heating effects induced by
the laser beams of our methods are very weak. For instance, for ultracold Yb
atoms, AC-Stark-shift difference of variant spin states of the $^3$P$_2(F=3/2)$
level, or the strength of the $^3$P$_2$-$^3$P$_0$ Raman coupling, could be of
the order of $(2\pi)$MHz, while the heating rate (photon scattering rate) is
only of the order of Hz. As a result, the Feshbach resonances, with which one
can efficiently control the SEI by changing the laser intensity, may be induced
by the laser beams with low-enough heating rate, even if the scattering lengths
of the bare inter-atomic interaction are so small that being comparable with
the length scale associated with the van der Waals interaction.

CNED if the conformal modulus of a curve family is not affected when one
restricts to the subfamily intersecting $E$ at countably many points. We show

$n$-integrable quasihyperbolic distance. Thus, this work puts in common
framework many known results on the problem of quasiconformal removability and
provides evidence that the CNED condition should also be necessary for
removability. We prove that countable unions of closed (C)NED sets are (C)NED,

line-of-sight (LOS) environment, with stable communication links. We propose a
map-assisted method to quantify the system parameters based on positions and
reduce real-time computing overhead. We explore the possibility of using a few
patterns in the maps, and investigate its performance loss. We first
investigate the features of OAM beams, and find that the link gain ratio
between any two sub-channels remains unchanged at some postions. Then, we prove
that a fixed constellation can be adopted for the positions where the link gain
matrices are sufficiently close to be proportional. Moreover, we prove that the
system can adopt a fixed power vector to generate a multidimensional
constellation if the difference between fixed power vector and optimal power
vector is small. Finally, we figure out that the constellation design for all
receiver locations can be represented by a few constellation sets.

commonly generated by some underlying dynamical system (DS) which is the target
of scientific interest. There is an increasing interest to harvest machine
learning methods to reconstruct this latent DS in a data-driven, unsupervised
way. In many areas of science it is common to sample time series observations
from many data modalities simultaneously, e.g. electrophysiological and
behavioral time series in a typical neuroscience experiment. However, current
machine learning tools for reconstructing DSs usually focus on just one data
modality. Here we propose a general framework for multi-modal data integration
for the purpose of nonlinear DS reconstruction and the analysis of cross-modal
relations. This framework is based on dynamically interpretable recurrent
neural networks as general approximators of nonlinear DSs, coupled to sets of
modality-specific decoder models from the class of generalized linear models.
Both an expectation-maximization and a variational inference algorithm for
model training are advanced and compared. We show on nonlinear DS benchmarks
that our algorithms can efficiently compensate for too noisy or missing
information in one data channel by exploiting other channels, and demonstrate
on experimental neuroscience data how the algorithm learns to link different
data domains to the underlying dynamics.

because of extremely large amounts of data they produce and the limited I/O

one of the most effective solutions to the above problem. In practice, however,
the best-fit compression method often needs to be customized/optimized in
particular because of diverse characteristics in different datasets and various
user requirements on the compression quality and performance. In this paper, we
develop a novel modular, composable compression framework (namely SZ3), which
involves three significant contributions. (1) SZ3 features a modular
abstraction for the prediction-based compression framework such that the new
compression modules can be plugged in easily. (2) SZ3 supports multialgorithm
predictors and can automatically select the best-fit predictor for each data
block based on the designed error estimation criterion. (3) SZ3 allows users to
easily compose different compression pipelines on demand, such that both
compression quality and performance can be significantly improved for their
specific datasets and requirements. (4) In addition, we evaluate several lossy
compressors composed from SZ3 using the real-world datasets. Specifically, we
leverage SZ3 to improve the compression quality and performance for different
use-cases, including GAMESS quantum chemistry dataset and Advanced Photon
Source (APS) instrument dataset. Experiments show that our customized
compression pipelines lead to up to 20% improvement in compression ratios under
the same data distortion compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

upon a set of mediators which are not observed, yet error prone proxies of the
hidden mediators are measured. Specifically, (i) We establish causal hidden
mediation analysis, which extends classical causal mediation analysis methods
for identifying natural direct and indirect effects under no unmeasured

causal effect called population intervention indirect effect remains possible
with hidden mediators in settings where challenges in (i) and (ii) might
co-exist. We view (i)-(iii) as important steps towards the practical
application of front-door criteria and mediation analysis as mediators are
almost always measured with error and thus, the most one can hope for in

from the Sun's brightening over its lifetime to the fluctuations commonly
associated with magnetic activity over minutes to years. The latter activity
includes most prominently the 11-year sunspot solar cycle and its modulations.
Space weather events, in the form of solar flares, solar energetic particles,
coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms, have long been known to
approximately follow the solar cycle occurring more frequently at solar maximum
than solar minimum. These events can significantly impact our advanced
technologies and critical infrastructures, making the prediction for the
strength of future solar cycles particularly important.
  Several methods have been proposed to predict the strength of the next solar
cycle, cycle 25, with results that are generally not always consistent. Most of
these methods are based on the international sunspot number time series, or
other indicators of solar activity. We present here a new approach that uses
more than 100 years of measured fractional areas of the visible solar disk
covered by sunspots and plages and an empirical relationship for each of these
two indices of solar activity in even-odd cycles. We anticipate that cycle 25
will peak in 2024 and will last for about 12 years, slightly longer than cycle
24. We also found that, in terms of sunspot and plage areas coverage, the
amplitude of cycle 25 will be substantially similar or slightly higher than
cycle 24.

populating vertices with low and high multiplicity magnetic charges, causing
asymmetric magnetization, in applied current of opposite polarity. High

evolutionary histories, we investigate whether these apparent tensions in the
BH populations can be explained by GW observational selection effects alone. We
find that this is indeed the case for the discrepancy between BH masses in BBHs
and the observed high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), when we account for
statistical uncertainty from the small sample size of just three HMXBs. On the
other hand, the BHs in observed low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are
significantly lighter than the astrophysical BBH population, but this may just
be due to a correlation between component masses in a binary system. Given
their light stellar companions, we expect light BHs in LMXBs. The observed
spins in HMXBs and LMXBs, however, are in tension with the inferred BBH spin
distribution at the $>99.9\%$ level. We discuss possible scenarios behind the
significantly larger spins in observed BH-XRBs. One possibility is that a small
subpopulation (conservatively $<30\%$) of BBHs have rapidly spinning primary
components, indicating that they may have followed a similar evolutionary
pathway to the observed HMXBs. In LMXBs, it has been suggested that BHs can
spin up by accretion. If LMXB natal spins follow the BBH spin distribution, we
find LMXBs must gain an average dimensionless spin of $0.47^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$,
but if their natal spins follow the observed HMXB spins, the average spinup
must be $<0.03$.

investigating their assembly history and evolution. We investigate the resolved
stellar content and the extended halo of NGC 5128 as a function of
galactocentric distance. We used HST images to resolve individual red giant
branch (RGB) stars in 28 independent pointings. Star counts from deep VI
color-magnitude diagrams reaching at least 1.5 mag below the tip of the RGB are
used to derive the surface density distribution of the halo. The contamination
by Milky Way stars is assessed with a new control field, with models, and by
combining optical and near-IR photometry. We present a new calibration of the
WFC3 F606W+F814W photometry to the ground-based VI photometric system. The
photometry shows that the stellar halo of NGC 5128 is dominated by old RGB
stars that are present in all fields. The V-band surface brightness changes
from 23 to 32 mag/arcsec$^2$ between 8.3 kpc from the galaxy center to our
outermost halo fields located 140 kpc away from the center along the major axis
and 92 kpc along the minor axis. Within ~30 kpc, we also find evidence for a
2-3 Gyr old population traced by bright asymptotic giant branch stars. This
population contributes only up to 10% in total stellar mass if it is 2 Gyr old,
but a larger fraction of 30-40% is required if its age is 3 Gyr. The stellar
surface density profile is well fit by a r$^{1/4}$ curve or a power-law $\sim
r^{-3.1}$ over the full radial range, with no obvious break in the slope, but
with large field-to-field scatter. The ellipticity measured from
integrated-light photometry in the inner parts, $e=(b/a)=0.77$, flattens to
$e=0.54 \pm 0.02$ beyond 30 kpc. Considering the flattening of the outer halo,
the projection of the elliptical isophote on the semimajor axis for our most
distant field reaches nearly 30 effective radii. [abridged]

problem. One of candidate solutions, the dark matter (DM) annihilation, has
been recently tested with other astrophysical observations, such as AMS-02
electron-positron spectra, Fermi Dwarf spheroidal galaxies gamma-ray data, and
so on. By assuming that the DM particles annihilate purely into a normal
charged fermion pair, Di Mauro and Winkle (2021) claimed that only a muon-pair
is compatible with the null detection of all the corresponding astrophysical
measurements and can explain GCE simultaneously. On the other hand, a
muonphilic DM model may also lead to a signal in the recent Fermilab muon $g-2$
measurement or be constrained by the latest PandaX-4T limit. In this work, we
comprehensively study interactions between DM and muon, including various
combinations of DM and mediator spins. In agreement with GCE (not only $2\mu$
but also $4\mu$ final states), we test these interactions against all the
thermal DM constraints. Our results show that only the parameter space near the
resonance region of mediator can explain GCE and relic density simultaneously,
and larger parameter spaces are still allowed if other poorly-known systematic
uncertainties are included. Regardless of the DM spin, only the interactions
with the spin-0 mediator can explain the recent muon $g-2$ excess on top of
GCE, relic density, and other DM and mediator constraints.

signifying the occurrence of the polaron orthogonality catastrophe. Asymptotic
configurations of the systems' ground state wave function in the strongly
interacting regime are obtained by means of a Schmidt decomposition, which in
turn accounts for the observed orthogonality catastrophe of the polaron. We
exemplify that depending on the repulsion of the Bose gas, three distinct
residue behaviors appear with respect to the impurity-bath coupling. These
residue regimes are characterized by two critical values of the bosonic
repulsion and originate from the interplay between the intra- and the interband
excitations of the impurity. Moreover, they can be clearly distinguished in the
corresponding species reduced density matrices with the latter revealing a
phase separation on either the one- or the two-body level. The impact of the
interspecies mass-imbalance on the impurity's excitation processes is
appreciated yielding an interaction shift of the residue regions. Our results

$n\gtrsim (k\log d)/\alpha^2$ and optimal error rate $O(\sqrt{(k\log d)/(n\cdot

dimensions and $k$ is the sparsity of the parameter vector, allowing the
fraction of inliers to be inverse-polynomial in the number of samples. Prior to
this work, no estimator was known to be consistent when the fraction of inliers
$\alpha$ is $o(1/\log \log n)$, even for (non-spherical) Gaussian design
matrices. Results holding under weak design assumptions and in the presence of
such general noise have only been shown in dense setting (i.e., general linear
regression) very recently by d'Orsi et al. [dNS21]. In the context of PCA, we
attain optimal error guarantees under broad spikiness assumptions on the
parameter matrix (usually used in matrix completion). Previous works could
obtain non-trivial guarantees only under the assumptions that the measurement
noise corresponding to the inliers is polynomially small in $n$ (e.g., Gaussian
with variance $1/n^2$).
  To devise our estimators, we equip the Huber loss with non-smooth
regularizers such as the $\ell_1$ norm or the nuclear norm, and extend d'Orsi

applications. In this study, we generated laser-induced plasma through single
and successive laser energy deposition. The lifetime of the plasma is of
paramount importance in most practical applications. However, this cannot be
achieved with a single high-energy pulse due to some practical challenges.
Therefore we carried out experimental and numerical investigations on the
successive laser energy deposition and demonstrated its importance compared to
the single pulse energy deposition. It has been observed that during successive
energy deposition, the absorption of energy from the second pulse is nonlinear,
and the reason for such behaviour is explained in this study. Due to the
nonlinear absorption from the second pulse, this study therefore aims to
present the pulse interval configuration between the successive pulses with
which it is effective for practical use. In this study, some interesting and
first direct observations of some new physical phenomena (generation of
fourth-lobe and multiple shock waves) are observed during successive energy
deposition when the pulse interval is 50 $ \mu{s} $ and 100 $ \mu{s} $. This
study also adopted new approch based on Maxwell's theory of momentum exchange
between light and matter to explain the newly observed and some previously
unexplained physical phenomena. Finally, to understand the evolution of the
laser-induced plasma, the volume and volumetric expansion rate are calculated,
which can be useful in determining its lifetime and mixing rate with the
surrounding medium.

and deep reinforcement learning (deep-RL) is developed for control of a
fly-scale flexible-winged flyer in complex flow. Dynamics of the flyer in
complex flow is highly unsteady and nonlinear, which makes modeling the
dynamics challenging. Thus, conventional control methodologies, where the
dynamics is modeled, are insufficient for regulating such complicated dynamics.
Therefore, in the present study, the integrated framework, in which the whole
governing equations for fluid and structure are solved, is proposed to generate
a control policy for the flyer. For the deep-RL to successfully learn the
control policy, accurate and ample data of the dynamics are required. However,
satisfying both the quality and quantity of the data on the intricate dynamics
is extremely difficult since, in general, more accurate data are more costly.
In the present study, two strategies are proposed to deal with the dilemma. To
obtain accurate data, the CFD-CSD is adopted for precisely predicting the
dynamics. To gain ample data, a novel data reproduction method is devised,
where the obtained data are replicated for various situations while conserving
the dynamics. With those data, the framework learns the control policy in
various flow conditions and the learned policy is shown to have remarkable
performance in controlling the flyer in complex flow fields.

  Analysis","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LO cs.FL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Autonomous systems with machine learning-based perception can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors that are difficult to quantify, let alone verify. Such
behaviors are convenient to capture in probabilistic models, but probabilistic
model checking of such models is difficult to scale -- largely due to the
non-determinism added to models as a prerequisite for provable conservatism.
Statistical model checking (SMC) has been proposed to address the scalability
issue. However it requires large amounts of data to account for the
aforementioned non-determinism, which in turn limits its scalability. This work
introduces a general technique for reduction of non-determinism based on
assumptions of ""monotonic safety'"", which define a partial order between system
states in terms of their probabilities of being safe. We exploit these
assumptions to remove non-determinism from controller/plant models to
drastically speed up probabilistic model checking and statistical model
checking while providing provably conservative estimates as long as the safety
is indeed monotonic. Our experiments demonstrate model-checking speed-ups of an
order of magnitude while maintaining acceptable accuracy and require much less
data for accurate estimates when running SMC -- even when monotonic safety does
not perfectly hold and provable conservatism is not achieved.

Each lattice site is populated by a non-negative real number, its energy. Upon

large $\mu$, the dynamics is well-described as a diffusion process, where the
order parameter, spatial variance $\sigma$, is removed. States at intermediate

interspersed by much more complex phases of far longer periods. Phases are
separated by discontinuous jumps in $\sigma$ or $\partial_{\mu}\sigma$ - akin
to first and higher-order phase transitions. Overall, the energy landscape is
dominated by few energy levels which occur as sharp spikes in the single-site

the study of contact networks for spread of disease, or social networks for
their impact on geopolitics, it has become necessary to study machine learning
tools that are scalable to very large networks, often containing millions of
nodes. One major class of such scalable algorithms is known as network
representation learning or network embedding. These algorithms try to learn
representations of network functionals (e.g.~nodes) by first running multiple
random walks and then using the number of co-occurrences of each pair of nodes
in observed random walk segments to obtain a low-dimensional representation of
nodes on some Euclidean space. The aim of this paper is to rigorously
understand the performance of two major algorithms, DeepWalk and node2vec, in
recovering communities for canonical network models with ground truth
communities. Depending on the sparsity of the graph, we find the length of the
random walk segments required such that the corresponding observed
co-occurrence window is able to perform almost exact recovery of the underlying
community assignments. We prove that, given some fixed co-occurrence window,
node2vec using random walks with a low non-backtracking probability can succeed
for much sparser networks compared to DeepWalk using simple random walks.
Moreover, if the sparsity parameter is low, we provide evidence that these
algorithms might not succeed in almost exact recovery. The analysis requires
developing general tools for path counting on random networks having an
underlying low-rank structure, which are of independent interest.

scale-out with a well-defined interface and robust performance. However, their
traditional get/put interface is unable to exploit data locality at its
fullest, and limits reaching its peak performance. In particular, there is one
way to improve data locality that has not yet achieved mainstream adoption: the
active object store. Although there are some projects that have implemented the
main idea of the active object store such as Swift's Storlets or Ceph Object
Classes, the scope of these implementations is limited.
  We believe that there is a huge potential for active object stores in the
current status quo. Hyper-converged nodes are bringing more computing
capabilities to storage nodes --and viceversa. The proliferation of
non-volatile memory (NVM) technology is blurring the line between system memory
(fast and scarce) and block devices (slow and abundant). More and more
applications need to manage a sheer amount of data (data analytics, Big Data,
Machine Learning & AI, etc.), demanding bigger clusters and more complex
computations. All these elements are potential game changers that need to be
evaluated in the scope of active object stores.
  In this article we propose an active object store software stack and evaluate
it on an NVM-populated node. We will show how this setup is able to reduce
execution times from 10% up to more than 90% in a variety of representative
application scenarios. Our discussion will focus on the active aspect of the

isolated chains in unconfined domains, we show how the coupling of active flows
with polymer conformations leads to emergent dynamics. Systems with contractile
dipoles behave similarly to passive Brownian chains with enhanced fluctuations
due to dipolar flows. In systems with extensile dipoles, however, our
simulations uncover an active coil-stretch transition whereby the polymer
spontaneously unfolds and stretches out in its own self-induced hydrodynamic
flow, and we characterize this transition in terms of a dimensionless activity
parameter comparing active dipolar forces to thermal fluctuations. We discuss
our findings in the context of the classic coil-stretch transition of passive
polymers in extensional flows, and complement our simulations with a simple
kinetic model for an active trimer.

on human sleep. Teaching a machine to carry out routine tasks would be a
tremendous reduction in workload for clinicians. Sleep staging, a fundamental
step in sleep practice, is a suitable task for this and will be the focus in
this article. Recently, automatic sleep staging systems have been trained to
mimic manual scoring, leading to similar performance to human sleep experts, at
least on scoring of healthy subjects. Despite tremendous progress, we have not
seen automatic sleep scoring adopted widely in clinical environments. This
review aims to give a shared view of the authors on the most recent
state-of-the-art development in automatic sleep staging, the challenges that
still need to be addressed, and the future directions for automatic sleep
scoring to achieve clinical value.

skeptical belief, then by showing that the pseudo-classical belief is not
appropriate for modeling the belief of an adversary in a CPA-experiment we
justify proposing the notion of skeptical belief. Furthermore, we prove the

  using Mobile Network Data","added figures",,"10.6339/22-JDS1043",,"cs.SI econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The COVID-19 pandemic has created a sudden need for a wider uptake of
home-based telework as means of sustaining the production. Generally,
teleworking arrangements impacts directly worker's efficiency and motivation.
The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance between positive
effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and autonomy) and its
downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work life). Moreover,
these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of
workers, such as women. The first step in understanding the implications of
teleworking on women is to have timely information on the extent of teleworking
by age and gender. In the absence of timely official statistics, in this paper
we propose a method for nowcasting the teleworking trends by age and gender for
20 Italian regions using mobile network operators (MNO) data. The method is
developed and validated using MNO data together with the Italian quarterly
Labour Force Survey. Our results confirm that the MNO data have the potential
to be used as a tool for monitoring gender and age differences in teleworking
patterns. This tool becomes even more important today as it could support the
adequate gender mainstreaming in the ``Next Generation EU'' recovery plan and
help to manage related social impacts of COVID-19 through policymaking.

K-theory that takes into account higher semiadditive structure, as enjoyed for
example by the $K(n)$- and $T(n)$-local categories. We prove that it satisfies
a form of the redshift conjecture. Namely, that if $R$ is a ring spectrum of
height $\leq n$, then its semiadditive algebraic K-theory is of height $\leq
n+1$. Under further hypothesis on $R$, which are satisfied for example by the
Lubin-Tate spectrum $E_n$, we show that its semiadditive algebraic K-theory is
of height exactly $n+1$. Finally, we show that for any $p$-invertible ring
spectrum, its semiadditive algebraic K-theory coincides with the
$T(1)$-localization of its ordinary algebraic K-theory.

  arXiv:2110.12239",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) combine model-free (Mf)-RL
algorithms with model-based (Mb)-RL approaches to get the best from both:
asymptotic performance of Mf-RL and high sample-efficiency of Mb-RL. Inspired
by these works, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates online
learning for the Mb-trajectory optimization with off-policy methods for the
Mf-RL. In particular, two loops are proposed, where the Dynamic Mirror Descent
based Model Predictive Control (DMD-MPC) is used as the inner loop Mb-RL to
obtain an optimal sequence of actions. These actions are in turn used to
significantly accelerate the outer loop Mf-RL. We show that our formulation is
generic for a broad class of MPC-based policies and objectives, and includes
some of the well-known Mb-Mf approaches. We finally introduce a new algorithm:
Mirror-Descent Model Predictive RL (M-DeMoRL), which uses Cross-Entropy Method
(CEM) with elite fractions for the inner loop. Our experiments show faster
convergence of the proposed hierarchical approach on benchmark MuJoCo tasks. We
also demonstrate hardware training for trajectory tracking in a 2R leg and
hardware transfer for robust walking in a quadruped. We show that the
inner-loop Mb-RL significantly decreases the number of training iterations
required in the real system, thereby validating the proposed approach.
