a graph that preserves the estimates of local structural properties and the

method with subgraph sampling using a crawling method and the existing method
for generating a graph that structurally resembles the original graph via a

accurately reproduces the local and global structural properties on average and
the visual representation of the original graph than the compared methods. We
expect that our method will lead to exhaustive analyses of social graphs with
limited data access.

task. Existing 3D pose estimation suffers from 1) the inherent ambiguity
between the 2D and 3D data, and 2) the lack of well labeled 2D-3D pose pairs in
the wild. Human beings are able to imagine the human 3D pose from a 2D image or
a set of 2D body key-points with the least ambiguity, which should be
attributed to the prior knowledge of the human body that we have acquired in
our mind. Inspired by this, we propose a new framework that leverages the
labeled 3D human poses to learn a 3D concept of the human body to reduce the
ambiguity. To have consensus on the body concept from 2D pose, our key insight
is to treat the 2D human pose and the 3D human pose as two different domains.
By adapting the two domains, the body knowledge learned from 3D poses is
applied to 2D poses and guides the 2D pose encoder to generate informative 3D
""imagination"" as embedding in pose lifting. Benefiting from the domain
adaptation perspective, the proposed framework unifies the supervised and
semi-supervised 3D pose estimation in a principled framework. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on standard benchmarks. More importantly, it is validated that the
explicitly learned 3D body concept effectively alleviates the 2D-3D ambiguity
in 2D pose lifting, improves the generalization, and enables the network to
exploit the abundant unlabeled 2D data.

appealing to the variational principle for the subregion, which selects a

teacher-assistant-student network to establish multiple knowledge transfer

learns the knowledge of complete shape. The student network takes the

assistant modules not only help to transfer the knowledge of complete shape
from the teacher to the student, but also judge the learning effect of the
student network. As a result, KTNet makes use of a more comprehensive

experimental data to be accounted for in accordance with their uncertainties
and, above all, it allows the different variations observed between the
different authors to be explained. Particularly in the case of thallium, this
theory makes it possible to represent viscosity data with much better precision
than the so-called reference equation of state. The dilute-gas limit laws
connecting various parameters of the theory obtained in the case of water are
confirmed here and thus give them a universal character. The elastic mode
theory is accompanied by the development of new equations of state, mainly to
describe properties along the saturated vapor pressure curve, which greatly
extend the temperature range of application of these equations compared to
those found in the literature. The whole analysis thus makes it possible to
propose precise values of various thermodynamic parameters at the melting and

  Progressive Training Strategy","5 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL)approach to solve a
cooperative, multi-agent Volt-Var Control (VVC) problem for high solar
penetration distribution systems. The ingenuity of our RL method lies in a
novel two-stage progressive training strategy that can effectively improve
training speed and convergence of the machine learning algorithm. In Stage
1(individual training), while holding all the other agents inactive, we
separately train each agent to obtain its own optimal VVC actions in the action
space: {consume, generate, do-nothing}. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all
agents are trained again coordinatively to share VVC responsibility. Rewards
and costs in our RL scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an
action), (ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and(iii) an
agent-level action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be
dynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while
accounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action cost. The
proposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified IEEE 123-bus system
using realistic PV and load profiles. Simulation results confirm that the
proposed approach is robust and computationally efficient; and it achieves
desirable volt-var control performance under a wide range of operation
conditions.

  Design","18 pages, 14 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing an optimal energy system with large shares of renewable energy
sources is computationally challenging. Considering greater spatial horizon and
level of detail, during the design, exacerbates this challenge. This paper
investigates spatial and technology aggregation of energy system model, as a
complexity-reduction technique. To that end, a novel two-step aggregation
scheme based on model parameters such as Variable Renewable Energy Sources
(VRES) time series and capacities, transmission capacities and distances, etc,
is introduced. First, model regions are aggregated to obtain reduced region
set. The aggregation is based on a holistic approach that considers all model
parameters and spatial contiguity of regions. Next, technology aggregation is
performed on each VRES, present in each newly-defined region. Each VRES is
aggregated based on the temporal profiles to obtain a representative set. The
impact of these aggregations on accuracy and computational complexity of a
cost-optimal energy system design is analyzed for a European energy system
scenario.The aggregations are performed to obtain different combinations of
number of regions and VRES types, and the results are benchmarked against
initial spatial resolution of 96 regions and 68 VRES types in each region. The
results show that the system costs deviate significantly when lower number of
regions and/or VRES types are considered. As the spatial resolution is
increased in terms of both number of regions and VRES types, the system cost
fluctuates at first and stabilizes at some point, approaching the benchmark
value. Optimal combination can be determined based on an acceptable cost
deviation and the point of stabilization. For instance, if <5% deviation is
acceptable, 33 regions and 38 VRES types in each region is optimal. With this
setting, the system cost is under-estimated by 4.42% but the run time is
reduced by 92.95%.

prescribed magnetic fields, we derive predictions for the particle scattering
rates, which can be characterized by the relative perturbation amplitude
$A\simeq \delta B/B$, and the particle Larmor radius normalized by the
field-aligned wavelength of the perturbations, $\rho_L/\lambda_{\|}$. Particles
with $\rho_L/\lambda_{\|}\simeq1$, are subject to strong pitch angle

different from and more diverse than previous models ([Nature Physics 2021,

that the general problem of deciding whether a simple graph can be obtained via
the DPG process from a small seed (DPG feasibility) is, as expected,
NP-complete. It is an important open problem to uncover whether there is a
structural reason behind the DPG-constructibility of real-world networks.

promising new electrode materials for high-rate lithium ion batteries. In order
to rationalise and improve upon material performance, it is crucial to
understand the fundamental ion-intercalation and degradation mechanisms
occurring during realistic battery operation, on the nano- to meso-scale. Here
we apply a straightforward laboratory-based operando optical scattering
microscopy method to study micron-sized rods of the high-rate anode material
Nb$_{14}$W$_3$O$_{44}$ during cycling at rates of up to 30C. We directly
visualise an elongation of the rods, which, by comparison with ensemble X-ray
diffraction, allows us to determine the state of charge (SOC) of the individual

enabling observation of a non-equilibrium kinetic phase separation within
individual particles. Phase field modelling (informed by pulsed-field-gradient
nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical experiments) is used to verify
the kinetic origin of this separation, which arises from a dependence of the
Li-ion diffusion coefficient upon SOC. Finally, we witness how such
intra-particle SOC heterogeneity can lead to particle cracking; we follow the
cycling behaviour of the resultant fragments, and show that they may become
electrically disconnected from the electrode. These results demonstrate the

the nonlocal alignment force using conventional comparison principles. We
construct \emph{invariant regions} such that the solution trajectories cannot

also derived which leads to finite-time singularity formations. To handle the
oscillation and the nonlocality, we introduce a new way to construct invariant

Our result is extended to the case when the alignment force is weakly singular.

continuous data assimilation. The flow is unknown within a region of the
channel. Beyond this region the velocity field is provided, and is directly
prescribed in the simulation, while the pressure is unknown throughout the
entire domain. Synchronization takes place when the simulation recovers the
full true state of the flow, or in other words when the missing region is
accurately re-established, spontaneously. Successful synchronization depends on
the orientation, location and size of the missing layer. For friction Reynolds
numbers up to one thousand, wall-attached horizontal layers can synchronize as
long as their thickness is less than approximately thirty wall units. When the
horizontal layer is detached from the wall, the critical thickness increases
with height and is proportional to the local wall-normal Taylor microscale. A
flow-parallel, vertical layer that spans the height of the channel synchronizes
when its spanwise width is on the order of the near-wall Taylor microscale,
while the criterion for a crossflow vertical layer is set by the advection
distance within a Lyapunov timescale. Finally, we demonstrate that
synchronization is possible when only planar velocity data are available,
rather than the full outer state, as long as the unknown region satisfies the
condition for synchronization in one direction. These numerical experiments
demonstrate the capacity of accurately reconstructing, or synchronizing, the
missing scales of turbulence from observations, using continuous data

top experiments. In this work we inspect the capacity for correlated many body
systems to probe non-classicalities of spacetime through modifications of the
commutation relations. We find an analytic derivation of the dynamics for a
single mode light field interacting with a single mechanical oscillator and
with coupled oscillators to first order corrections to the commutation
relations. Our solution is valid for any coupling function as we work out the
full Magnus expansion. We numerically show that it is possible to have
superquadratic scaling of a non-classical phase term, arising from the
modification to the commutation relations, with coupled mechanical oscillators.

attenuation in enclosed cavities or acoustic waveguides. It is made of a
loudspeaker (the actuator) and one or more microphones (the sensors). So far,
the desired acoustic behaviour, expressed in terms of a linear relationship
between sound pressure and vibrational motion, has been more efficiently
achieved by a model-inversion strategy which is implemented by driving the
electrical current in the loudspeaker coil, based upon the measured pressure.
The corrector transfer function is hence digitally executed by the classical
infinite-impulse response technique. In order to enforce non-linear, instead of
linear, operators between the pressure and vibrational motion of the speaker
diaphragm, in the same pressure-based, current-driven architecture, the
transfer-function-based control strategies must be abandoned. In this
manuscript, we present a novel technique based upon real-time integration of
potentially any target dynamics (either linear or nonlinear). Then, we
experimentally validate such control strategy by enforcing a Duffing type
dynamics at excitation levels far below the linearity limit of the
mechano-acoustical dynamics of the resonator. Such control strategy
demonstrates to efficiently reproduce nonlinear operators, opening the doors
for the experimental investigation of noise-control by a potentially vast
spectrum of programmable non-linear boundaries, under the ordinary sound

carefully chooses among replication and EC, as well as among various DC

topology strongly impacts the synchronizablity of the system, and the analysis
of their relationship remains an open challenge. We know that the eigenvalue
distribution determines a network's synchronizability, but analytical
expressions that connect network topology and all relevant eigenvalues (e.g.,
the extreme values) remain elusive.
  Here, we accurately determine its synchronizability by proposing an
analytical method to estimate the extreme eigenvalues using perturbation
theory. Our analytical method exposes the role global and local topology
combine to influence synchronizability. We show that the smallest non-zero
eigenvalue which determines synchronizability is estimated by the smallest
degree augmented by the inverse degree difference in the least connected nodes.
From this, we can conclude that there exists a clear negative relationship
between the smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the local assortativity of nodes
with smallest degree values. We validate the accuracy of our framework within
the setting of a Scale-free (SF) network and can be driven by commonly used
ODEs (e.g., 3-dimensional Rosler or Lorenz dynamics). From the results, we
demonstrate that the synchronizability of the network can be tuned by rewiring
the connections of these particular nodes while maintaining the general degree
profile of the network.

satisfies an energy estimate analogous to that of the standard model, and
maintains the positive semi-definiteness of the conformation tensor. This
results in the unique existence and stability of global solutions in a periodic
domain. To be precise, given an initial velocity $u_0$ and initial conformation
tensor $\sigma_0$, both with components in $H^2$, we obtain a velocity $u$ and
conformation tensor $\sigma$ both with components in $C([0, T]; H^2)$ for all
$T>0$. Assuming better regularity for the initial data allows us to obtain
better regularity for the solutions. We treat both the diffusive and
non-diffusive cases of the model. Notably, the regularization in the equation
for the conformation tensor in our new model has been applied only to the
velocity, rather than to the conformation tensor, unlike other available
regularization techniques \cite{barrett;suli2009}. This is desired since the
stress, and thus the conformation tensor, is typically less regular than the
velocity for the creeping flow of non-Newtonian fluids. In
\cite{constantinnote} the existence and regularity of solutions to the
non-regularized two dimensional diffusive Oldroyd-B model was established.
However, the proof cannot be generalized to three dimensions nor to the
non-diffusive case. The proposed regularization overcomes these obstacles.
Moreover, we show that the solutions in the diffusive case are stable in the
$H^2$ norm. In the non-diffusive case, we are able to establish that the

of the covariance kernel of $U$. When compared to previous similar results, the
novelty lies in that the equality $T(U) = 0$ is understood in the \textit{sense
of distributions}, which is a relevant framework for PDEs. This theorem
provides precious insights during the second part of this article, devoted to
performing ""physically informed"" machine learning for the homogeneous 3

(GPR) on pointwise observations of a solution of this PDE. To do so, we
propagate Gaussian processes (GP) priors over its initial conditions through
the wave equation. We obtain explicit formulas for the covariance kernel of the
propagated GP, which can then be used for GPR. We then explore the particular
cases of radial symmetry and point source. For the former, we derive
convolution-free GPR formulas; for the latter, we show a direct link between
GPR and the classical triangulation method for point source localization used
in GPS systems. Additionally, this Bayesian framework provides a new answer for
the ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing initial conditions for the wave

inference of physical parameters from these data. Finally, we illustrate this

Reaction-diffusion models have advanced our understanding of how biological
systems develop spatial structures, starting from homogeneity. However,
biological processes inherently involve multiple spatial and temporal scales
and transition from one pattern to another over time, rather than progressing
from homogeneity to a pattern. To deal with such multiscale systems,
coarse-graining methods are needed that allow the dynamics to be reduced to the
relevant degrees of freedom at large scales, but without losing information
about the patterns at the small scales. Here, we present a
semi-phenomenological approach which exploits mass-conservation in pattern
formation, and enables to reconstruct information about patterns from the
large-scale dynamics. The basic idea is to partition the domain into distinct
regions (coarse-grain) and determine instantaneous dispersion relations in each
region, which ultimately inform about local pattern-forming instabilities. We
illustrate our approach by studying the Min system, a paradigmatic model for
protein pattern formation. By performing simulations, we first show that the
Min system produces multiscale patterns in a spatially heterogeneous geometry.
This prediction is confirmed experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the
Min system. Using a recently developed theoretical framework for
mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems, we show that the spatiotemporal
evolution of the total protein densities on large-scales reliably predicts the
pattern-forming dynamics. Our approach provides an alternative and versatile
theoretical framework for complex systems where analytical coarse-graining
methods are not applicable, and can in principle be applied to a wide range of
systems with an underlying conservation law.

into the nanoscale interactions driving physical processes. However, a
limitation for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is that they must be
performed on finite-sized systems in order to map onto computational resources.
To minimize artifacts arising from finite-sized simulation systems, it is
common practice for MD simulations to be performed with periodic boundary
conditions (PBC). However, in order to calculate specific physical properties,
such as mean square displacements to calculate diffusion coefficients,
continuous particle trajectories where the atomic movements are continuous and
do not jump between cell faces are required. In these cases, modifying atomic
coordinates through unwrapping schemes are an essential post-processing tool to
remove these jumps. Here, two established trajectory unwrapping schemes are
applied to 1us wrapped trajectories for a small water box. The existing schemes
can result in spurious diffusion coefficients, long bonds within unwrapped
molecules, and inconsistent atomic coordinates when coordinates are rewrapped
after unwrapping. We determine that prior unwrapping schemes do not account for
changing periodic box dimensions, and introduce an additional correction term
to the existing displacement unwrapping scheme by von Bulow et al. to correct
for these artifacts. We also demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a
hybrid between the existing heuristic and displacement unwrapping schemes.
After treatment with this new unwrapping scheme, molecular geometries are
correct even after long simulations. In anticipation for longer molecular
dynamics trajectories, we develop implementations for this new scheme in
multiple PBC handling tools.

sufficiently many L2 speakers are present in a speech community in relation to
the number of first-language (L1) speakers, then those features which present a
difficulty in L2 acquisition may be prone to disappearing from the language.
This paper presents a mathematical account of such contact situations based on
a stochastic model of learning and nonlinear population dynamics. The
equilibria of a deterministic reduction of the model, describing a mixed
population of L1 and L2 speakers, are fully characterized. Whether or not the
language changes in response to the introduction of L2 learners turns out to
depend on three factors: the overall proportion of L2 learners in the
population, the strength of the difficulty speakers face in acquiring the
language as an L2, and the language-internal utilities of the competing
linguistic variants. These factors are related by a mathematical formula
describing a phase transition from retention of the L2-difficult feature to its
loss from both speaker populations. This supplies predictions that can be
tested against empirical data. Here, the model is evaluated with the help of
two case studies, morphological levelling in Afrikaans and the erosion of null
subjects in Afro-Peruvian Spanish; the model is found to be broadly in

powerful tool to probe coupled electronic-nuclear dynamics in photo-excited
molecules. Theoretical studies to date have established that time-resolved
X-ray absorption spectroscopy is an atom-specific probe of excited-state wave
packet passage through a seam of conical intersections (CIs). However, in many
molecular systems, there are competing dynamical pathways involving CIs of
different electronic and nuclear character. Discerning these pathways remains
an important challenge. Here, we demonstrate that time-resolved X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (TRXAS) has the potential to resolve competing channels
in excited-state non-adiabatic dynamics. Using the example of 1,3-butadiene, we
show how TRXAS discerns the different electronic structures associated with
passage through multiple conical intersections. Trans 1,3-butadiene exhibits a
branching between polarized and radicaloid pathways associated with ethylenic
""twisted-pyramidalized"" and excited-state cis-trans isomerization dynamics,
respectively. The differing electronic structures along these pathways give
rise to different XAS signals, indicating the possibility of resolving them.
Furthermore, this indicates that XAS, and other core-level spectroscopic
techniques, offer the appealing prospect of directly probing the effects of
selective chemical substitution and its ability to affect chemical control over
excited-state molecular dynamics.

how the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring,
albeit controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics
of empirically observed neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that
brain networks operate in a dynamical regime near the edge of a phase
transition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant
scale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we
present a data-driven analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings
of the activity of thousands of individual neurons in various regions of the
mouse brain. To analyze these data, we synergistically combine cutting-edge
methods for the study of brain activity (such as a phenomenological
renormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general dynamical
state of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This
strategy allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is
""quasi-universal"" across brain regions and reveal that all these areas operate,
to a greater or lesser extent, near the edge of instability. Furthermore, this
framework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity
and non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, this study provides
strong evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime

substrate of activity covariances that can sustain optimal input

function of effective temperature and the amount of convective overshoot within
the star. However, only models with metallicities of Z = 0.02 were examined,

varying the models' mass, rotation speed, convective overshoot, and

the updated convective boundary treatment in MESA changes the overshoot

technologies, and the increasing degree of so-called sector coupling
necessitates optimization-based energy system models with high temporal and
spatial resolutions, which significantly increases their runtimes and limits
their maximum sizes. In order to maintain the computational viability of these
models for large-scale application cases, temporal aggregation has emerged as a
technique for reducing the number of considered time steps by reducing the
original time horizon down to fewer, more representative ones. This study
presents advanced but generally applicable clustering techniques that allow for
ad-hoc improvements of state-of-the-art approaches without requiring profound
knowledge of the individual energy system model. These improvements comprise
the optimal tradeoff between the number of typical days and inner-daily
temporal resolutions, as well as constituting a representation method that can
reproduce the value distribution of the original time series. We prove the
superiority of these approaches by applying them to two fundamentally different
model types, namely a single-node building energy system and a European
carbon-neutral energy scenario, and benchmark these against state-of-the-art
approaches. This is performed for a variety of temporal resolutions, which
leads to many hundreds of model runs. The results show that the proposed
improvements on current methods strictly dominate the status quo with respect
to Pareto-optimality in terms of runtime and accuracy. Although a speeding up
factor of one magnitude could be achieved using traditional aggregation methods
within a cost deviation range of two percent, the algorithms proposed herein
achieve this accuracy with a runtime speedup by a factor of two orders of
magnitude.

secondary eclipse depth of $731 \pm 46$ ppm, as well as phase-curve variations

the presence of periodic loss and gain. The canonical realization of
dissipative solitons is Kerr-lens mode locking in lasers, which delicately
balance nonlinear and linear propagation in both time and space to generate
ultrashort optical pulses. This linear-nonlinear balance dictates a unique
pulse energy, which cannot be increased (say by elevated pumping), indicating
that excess energy is expected to be radiated in the form of dispersive or
diffractive waves. Here we show that Kerr-lens mode-locked lasers can overcome
this expectation. Specifically, by breaking the spatial symmetry between the
forward and backward halves of the round-trip in a linear cavity, the laser can
modify the soliton in space to incorporate the excess energy. Increasing the
pump power leads therefore to a different soliton solution, rather than to
dispersive / diffractive loss. We predict this symmetry breaking by a complete
numerical simulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics in the cavity, and confirm
it experimentally in a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser with
quantitative agreement to the simulation. The simulation opens a window to
directly observe the nonlinear space-time dynamics that molds the soliton
pulse, and possibly to optimize it.

the realization of magnetism in two dimensions (2D). However, metallic magnetic
vdW systems are still uncommon. In addition, they rarely host high-mobility

elaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive
experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets to show our superior
performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. One highlight is that,
unlike most transformer networks needed pretraining from large-scale datasets,
the proposed PhysFormer can be easily trained from scratch on rPPG datasets,

ability of the transformer. To address this challenge, this work targets to
mitigate the gap between the pre-training and ReID datasets from the

self-supervised learning (SSL) methods with Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained
on unlabelled person images (the LUPerson dataset), and empirically find it
significantly surpasses ImageNet supervised pre-training models on ReID tasks.
To further reduce the domain gap and accelerate the pre-training, the
Catastrophic Forgetting Score (CFS) is proposed to evaluate the gap between
pre-training and fine-tuning data. Based on CFS, a subset is selected via
sampling relevant data close to the down-stream ReID data and filtering
irrelevant data from the pre-training dataset. For the model structure, a
ReID-specific module named IBN-based convolution stem (ICS) is proposed to
bridge the domain gap by learning more invariant features. Extensive

scale of $l_{\min}\simeq13\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Combining the MST and power
spectrum allows for many of the individual degeneracies to be broken; on its
own the MST provides tighter constraints on the sum of neutrino masses

by the MST's sensitivity to small scale clustering, where the effect of
neutrino free-streaming becomes relevant, and high-order statistical
information in the cosmic web. The MST is shown to be a powerful tool for
cosmology and neutrino mass studies, and therefore could play a pivotal role in

each independent total mass measurement into a cumulative dynamical mass using
all four planets. The dynamical mass of HR 8799 is 1.47$^{+0.12}_{-0.17}$ \Msun

weakly informative prior based on spectroscopy. There is a strong covariance
between the planets' eccentricities and the total system mass; when the

motivated by dynamical stability, our mass measurement improves to
1.43$^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ \Msun. Our dynamical mass and other fundamental measured

non-Lagrangian Stiefel liquid. These states can emerge as a consequence of the
competition between a magnetic state and a non-magnetic state. We identify all
possible realizations of these states on systems with $SO(3)\times

Many interesting examples are discovered, including a DQCP adjacent to a
ferromagnet, stable DSLs on square and honeycomb lattices, and a class of
quantum critical spin-quadrupolar liquids of which the most relevant spinful
fluctuations carry spin-$2$. In particular, there is a realization of
spin-quadrupolar DSL that is beyond the usual parton construction. We further
use our formalism to analyze the stability of these states under

example, we find that a DSL can be stable in a recently proposed candidate

not been fruitful. For planets, accretion tracers should come from the shock
itself, exposing them to extinction by the accreting material. High-resolution
(R>5e4) spectrographs at Ha should soon allow studying how the incoming
material shapes the line profile. We calculate how much the gas and dust
accreting onto a planet reduce the Ha flux from the shock at the planetary
surface and how they affect line shapes. We also study the absorption-modified
relationship between Ha luminosity and Mdot. We compute the high-resolution
radiative transfer of the Ha line using a 1D velocity-density-temperature
structure for the inflowing matter in three representative accretion
geometries: spherical symmetry, polar inflow, and magnetospheric accretion. For
each, we explore wide ranges of Mdot and planet mass M. We use detailed gas
opacities and estimate dust opacities. At Mdot<3e-6 MJ/yr, gas extinction is
negligible for spherical or polar inflow and at most A_Ha<0.5 mag for
magnetospheric accretion. Up to Mdot~3e-4 MJ/yr, the gas has A_Ha<4 mag. This
decreases with M. We estimate realistic dust opacities at Ha as ~0.01-10
cm^2/g, i.e., 10-1e4 times lower than in the ISM. Extinction flattens the
L_Ha-Mdot relationship, which becomes non-monotonic with a maximum L_Ha~1e-4
LSun near Mdot~1e-4 MJ/yr for M~10 MJ. In magnetospheric accretion, the gas can
introduce features in line profiles, but the velocity gradient smears them out
in other geometries. For most of parameter space, extinction by the accreting
matter should be negligible, simplifying interpretation of observations,
especially for planets in gaps. At high Mdot, strong absorption reduces the Ha
flux, and some measurements can be interpreted as two Mdot values. Line
profiles at R~1e5 can provide complex constraints on the accretion flow's
thermal-dynamical structure.

as NGC1052-DF2 (hereafter DF2) can result from tidal stripping. An important
question, though, is whether such a stripping scenario can explain DF2's large
specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs). After all, tidal stripping and
shocking preferentially remove matter from the outskirts. We examine this using
idealized, high-resolution simulations of a regular dark matter dominated
galaxy that is accreted onto a massive halo. As long as the initial
(pre-infall) dark matter halo of the satellite is cored, which is consistent
with predictions of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations, the tidal remnant
can be made to resemble DF2 in all its properties, including its GC population.
The required orbit has a peri-centre at the 8.3 percentile of the distribution
for subhaloes at infall, and thus is not particularly extreme. On this orbit
the satellite loses 98.5 (30) percent of its original dark matter (stellar)
mass, and thus evolves into a DMDG. The fraction of GCs that is stripped off
depends on the initial radial distribution. If, at infall, the median projected
radius of the GC population is roughly two times that of the stars, consistent
with observations of isolated galaxies, only $\sim 20$ percent of the GCs are
stripped off. This is less than for the stars, which is due to dynamical
friction counteracting the tidal stirring. We predict that, if indeed DF2 was
crafted by strong tides, its stellar outskirts should have a very shallow
metallicity gradient.

investigation of a large sample of type I X-ray bursts from Aql X-1 with
improved sensitivity at low energies. We detect 22 X-ray bursts including two
short recurrence burst events in which the separation was only 451 s and 496 s.
We perform time resolved spectroscopy of the bursts using the fixed and scaled
background (f_a method) approaches. We show that the use of a scaling factor to
the pre-burst emission is the statistically preferred model in about 68% of all
the spectra compared to the fixed background approach. Typically the f_a values
are clustered around 1-3, but can reach up to 11 in a burst where photospheric
radius expansion is observed. Such f_a values indicate a very significant
increase in the pre-burst emission especially at around the peak flux moments
of the bursts. We show that the use of the f_a factor alters the best fit

generalize the approach of Polchinski and Strassler (2001) in two ways. (i) We
analyze several holographic confining backgrounds in particular the hard wall
model, the soft wall model and Witten's model. (ii) In addition to deriving the
asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes at fixed angle and in the Regge limit, we
also expand the amplitudes around their poles, integrate over the holographic
direction and then re-sum the expansion. Due to dependence of the string
tension on the holographic coordinate, the resulting singularities take the
form of branch points rather than poles and the amplitudes display branch cuts
and acquire a finite imaginary part. This may signal the failure of the PS
prescription to reproduce the correct analytic structure at low energies. We
also observe that the peaks are more pronounced in the region of small $s$ but
fade away for large $s$. In the fixed angle approximation we find in the hard
and soft wall models that ${\cal A}\sim s^{2-\Delta/2}$ whereas in Witten's
model ${\cal A} \sim s^{3-\Delta/2}$ and ${\cal A} \sim s^{7/3-2\Delta/3}$ for
the 11D and 10D formulations, respectively. In the Regge regime ${\cal A}\sim
{s^{2}}\,t^{-2+\alpha}\,(\log{s/ t})^{-1+\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ is the power
found in the fixed angle regime. Using the pole expansion the result for each
model is $Re[{\cal A}] \sim s^{-1}$, $Im[{\cal A}] \sim s^{\alpha}$. We compute
the corresponding amplitudes for mesons using open strings and find
qualitatively similar results as for closed strings.

that has an action composed of a Lagrangian $f(R,\cal R)$, where $f$ is a
function of the metric Ricci scalar $R$ and a new Ricci scalar $\cal R$ formed
from a Palatini connection, plus a matter Lagrangian. This theory can be
rewritten by trading the new geometric degrees of freedom of $f(R,\cal R)$ into
two scalar fields, $\varphi$ and $\psi$, yielding an equivalent scalar-tensor
theory. Given a spacetime theory, the next step is to find solutions. To
construct solutions it is often necessary to know the junction conditions
between two regions at a separation hypersurface $\Sigma$, with each region
being an independent solution. The junction conditions for the generalized
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are found here, in the geometric and in the
scalar-tensor representations, and in addition, for each representation, the
junction conditions for a matching with a thin-shell and for a smooth matching
at $\Sigma$ are worked out. These junction conditions are applied to three
configurations, a star, a quasistar with a black hole, and a wormhole. The star
has a Minkowski interior, a thin shell at the interface with all the energy
conditions being satisfied, and a Schwarzschild exterior with mass $M$, and for
this theory the matching can only be performed at the shell radius given by
$r_\Sigma=\frac{9M}4$, the Buchdahl radius in general relativity. The quasistar
with a black hole has an interior Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a
thick shell that matches smoothly to a mass $M$ Schwarzschild exterior at the
light ring, and with the energy conditions being satisfied everywhere. The
wormhole has an interior that contains the throat, a thin shell at the

newly-identified type of supernova (Type Icn) hallmarked by strong, narrow, P
Cygni carbon features at early times. The SN appears as a fast and luminous
blue transient at early times, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of -20 within
3 days due to strong interaction between fast SN ejecta (v ~ 30000 km/s) and a
massive, dense, fast-moving C/O wind shed by the WC-like progenitor months
before explosion. The narrow line features disappear from the spectrum 10-20
days after explosion and are replaced by a blue continuum dominated by broad Fe
features, reminiscent of Type Ibn and IIn supernovae and indicative of weaker
interaction with more extended H/He-poor material. The transient then abruptly
fades ~60 days post-explosion when interaction ceases. Deep limits at later
phases suggest minimal heavy-element nucleosynthesis, a low ejecta mass, or
both, and imply an origin distinct from that of classical Type Ic supernovae.
We place SN 2021csp in context with other fast-evolving interacting transients,
and discuss various progenitor scenarios: an ultrastripped progenitor star, a
pulsational pair-instability eruption, or a jet-driven fallback supernova from
a Wolf-Rayet star. The fallback scenario would naturally explain the similarity
between these events and radio-loud fast transients, and suggests a picture in
which most stars massive enough to undergo a WR phase collapse directly to
black holes at the end of their lives.

binary stars faces two major uncertainties: the common-envelope phase and
supernova kicks. These two processes are critical for the final orbital
configuration of double compact-object systems with neutron stars and black
holes. Predictive one-dimensional models of common-envelope interaction are
lacking and multidimensional simulations are challenged by the vast range of
relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of the common-envelope interaction of an initially
$10\,M_{\odot}$ red supergiant primary star with a black-hole and a
neutron-star companion. We show that the high-mass regime is accessible to full
ab-initio simulations. Nearly complete envelope ejection is reached assuming
that all recombination energy still available at the end of our simulation
continues to help unbinding the envelope. In contrast to previous assumptions,
we find that the dynamical plunge-in of both companions terminates at orbital
separations too wide for gravitational waves to merge the systems in a Hubble
time. We discuss the further evolution of the system based on analytical
estimates. A subsequent mass-transfer episode from the remaining $3\,M_{\odot}$
core of the supergiant to the compact companion does not shrink the orbit
sufficiently either. A neutron-star--neutron-star and neutron-star--black-hole
merger is still expected for a fraction of the systems if the supernova kick
aligns favorably with the orbital motion. For double neutron star
(neutron-star--black-hole) systems we estimate mergers in about $9 \%$ ($1 \%$)
of cases while about $77 \%$ ($94 \%$) of binaries are disrupted, i.e.,
supernova kicks actually enable gravitational-wave mergers in our cases;
however, we expect a reduction in predicted gravitational-wave merger events.

expressions. State-of-the-art TRSs in compilers use a greedy algorithm that
applies a set of rewriting rules in a predefined order (where some of the rules
are not axiomatic). This leads to a loss of the ability to simplify certain
expressions. E-graphs and equality saturation sidestep this issue by
representing the different equivalent expressions in a compact manner from
which the optimal expression can be extracted. While an e-graph-based TRS can
be more powerful than a TRS that uses a greedy algorithm, it is slower because
expressions may have a large or sometimes infinite number of equivalent
expressions. Accelerating e-graph construction is crucial for making the use of
e-graphs practical in compilers. In this paper, we present Caviar, an
e-graph-based TRS for proving expressions within compilers. The main advantage
of Caviar is its speed. It can prove expressions much faster than base e-graph
TRSs. It relies on three techniques: 1) a technique that stops e-graphs from
growing when the goal is reached, called Iteration Level Check; 2) a mechanism
that balances exploration and exploitation in the equality saturation
algorithm, called Pulsing Caviar; 3) a technique to stop e-graph construction
before reaching saturation when a non-provable pattern is detected, called
Non-Provable Patterns Detection (NPPD). We evaluate caviar on Halide, an
optimizing compiler that relies on a greedy-algorithm-based TRS to simplify and
prove its expressions. The proposed techniques allow Caviar to accelerate
e-graph expansion for the task of proving expressions. They also allow Caviar
to prove expressions that Halide's TRS cannot prove while being only 0.68x
slower.

Motivated by these considerations, we propose using physically motivated
synthetic spectral energy distributions in redshift estimation. In addition,
the synthetic data would have to span a domain in colour-redshift space
concordant with that of the targeted observational surveys. With a matched
distribution and realistically modelled synthetic data in hand, a suitable
regression algorithm can be appropriately trained; we use a mixture density
network for this purpose. We also perform a zero-point re-calibration to reduce
the systematic differences between noise-free synthetic data and the
(unavoidably) noisy observational data sets. This new redshift estimation
framework, SYTH-Z, demonstrates superior accuracy over a wide range of

aiming for pixel-wise classification: (a) most vehicle classification studies
use object detection methods, and most publicly available datasets are designed
for this task, (b) creating instance segmentation datasets is laborious, and
(c) traditional instance segmentation methods underperform on this task since
the objects are small. Thus, the present research objectives are: (1) propose a
novel semi-supervised iterative learning approach using GIS software, (2)
propose a box-free instance segmentation approach, and (3) provide a city-scale
vehicle dataset. The iterative learning procedure considered: (1) label a small
number of vehicles, (2) train on those samples, (3) use the model to classify
the entire image, (4) convert the image prediction into a polygon shapefile,
(5) correct some areas with errors and include them in the training data, and
(6) repeat until results are satisfactory. To separate instances, we considered
vehicle interior and vehicle borders, and the DL model was the U-net with the
Efficient-net-B7 backbone. When removing the borders, the vehicle interior
becomes isolated, allowing for unique object identification. To recover the
deleted 1-pixel borders, we proposed a simple method to expand each prediction.
The results show better pixel-wise metrics when compared to the Mask-RCNN (82%
against 67% in IoU). On per-object analysis, the overall accuracy, precision,
and recall were greater than 90%. This pipeline applies to any remote sensing

labelling must encompass ""things"" and ""stuff"" classes, and (c) the annotation
format is complex. Thus, aiming to solve and increase the operability of
panoptic segmentation in remote sensing, this study has five objectives: (1)
create a novel data preparation pipeline for panoptic segmentation, (2) propose
an annotation conversion software to generate panoptic annotations; (3) propose
a novel dataset on urban areas, (4) modify the Detectron2 for the task, and (5)
evaluate difficulties of this task in the urban setting. We used an aerial

revealed concentric regions of dust rings and gaps. The object's proximity and

testbed for hydrodynamical studies in direct comparison to observations. We
employ two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of gas and multiple dust
species to test whether the observed structure conforms with the presence of
giant planets embedded in the disc. We then perform radiative transfer
calculations of sky images, which we filter for the telescope response for
comparison with near-infrared and millimetre observations. We find that the
existing data are in excellent agreement with a flared disc and the presence of
two giant planets, at 9$\,$au and 20$\,$au, respectively. The different ring
widths are recovered by diffusion-balanced dust trapping within the gas
pressure maxima. In our radiative transfer model, the diffusion in vertical
direction is reduced in comparison to the radial value by a factor of five to
recover the spectral energy distribution. Further, we report a previously
unaddressed, azimuthally-confined intensity decrement on the bright inner ring
in the near-infrared scattered light observation. Our model shows that this
decrement can be explained by a shadow cast by a circumplanetary disc around
the same giant planet that creates the inner cavity in the hydrodynamical
simulations. We examine the shape of the intensity indentation and discuss the
potential characterisation of a giant planet and its associated disc by its
projected shadow in scattered light observations.

returns explicit protocols realizing any allowed transformation. These
protocols use as building blocks elementary thermalizations, which we prove to
be universal controls. Finally, we also present an algorithm constructing the

Markovian thermal processes and provide a $\texttt{Mathematica}$ implementation

rigorous analysis divides the disk sequences of jammed microstates into
overlapping tiles from which we construct a small number of species of

control parameters inferred from ratios between measures of expansion work
against the pistons, gravitational potential energy, and intensity of random

equivariant and invariant operators on graphs with anisotropic left-invariant

preactivations in layer $l_0\leq l$. We derive recurrence relations for the
norms of partial Jacobians and utilize these relations to analyze criticality
of deep fully connected neural networks with LayerNorm and/or residual
connections. We derive and implement a simple and cheap numerical test that
allows to select optimal initialization for a broad class of deep neural
networks. Using these tools we show quantitatively that proper stacking of the
LayerNorm (applied to preactivations) and residual connections leads to an
architecture that is critical for any initialization. Finally, we apply our
methods to analyze the MLP-Mixer architecture and show that it is everywhere
critical.

increased pressure on ever better NPCs AI-agents forced complexity of
handcrafted BTs to became barely-tractable and error-prone. On the other hand,
while many just-launched on-line games suffer from player-shortage, the
existence of AI with a broad-range of capabilities could increase players
retention. Therefore, to handle above challenges, recent trends in the field
focused on automatic creation of AI-agents: from deep- and
reinforcementlearning techniques to combinatorial (constrained) optimization
and evolution of BTs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
semi-automatic construction of AI-agents, that mimic and generalize given human
gameplays by adapting and tuning of expert-created BT under a developed
similarity metric between source and BT gameplays. To this end, we formulated
mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, in which topological and
functional changes of the BT are reflected in numerical variables, and
constructed a dedicated hybrid-metaheuristic. The performance of presented
approach was verified experimentally in a prototype real-time strategy game.
Carried out experiments confirmed efficiency and perspectives of presented

extensive in silico investigation. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), based on
constrained optimization, was successfully applied in the Warburg Effect

objective severely limits the applicability of the previous FBA models.
Meanwhile, we note that cell types with different objectives show different
extents of the Warburg Effect. To extend the applicability of the previous
model and model the disparate cellular pathway preferences in different cell
types, we built a Nonlinear Multi-Objective FBA (NLMOFBA) model by including
three key objective terms (ATP production rate, lactate generation rate and ATP
yield) into one objective function through linear scalarization. By
constructing a cellular objective map and iteratively varying the objective
weights, we showed disparate cellular pathway preferences manifested by
different cell types driven by their unique cellular objectives, and we gained
insights about the causal relationship between cellular objectives and the
Warburg Effect. In addition, we obtained other biologically consistent results
by using our NLMOFBA model. For example, augmented with the constraint
associated with inefficient mitochondria function or limited substrate, NLMOFBA
predicts cellular pathways supported by the biology literature. Collectively,
NLMOFBA can help build a complete understanding towards the Warburg Effect in
different cell types.

mechanisms that can deliver planetesimals to the immediate vicinity of their

Recent studies of cool white dwarfs samples have identified a significant

larger samples of old polluted H- and He-atmosphere white dwarfs. We find no

accretion rates decrease by no more than a factor of the order of 10, which is

ad is often associated with functional impairments in language and reading. The
study enrolled five adults with mild ad in a nine to thirteen week BCI EEG
based neurofeedback intervention to improve attention and reading skills. Two
participants completed intervention entirely. The remaining three participants
could not complete the intervention phase because of restrictions related to
covid. Pre and post assessment measures were used to assess reliability of
outcome measures and generalization of treatment to functional reading,
processing speed, attention, and working memory skills. Participants
demonstrated steady improvement in most cognitive measures across experimental
phases, although there was not a significant effect of NFB on most measures of
attention. One subject demonstrated significantly significant improvement in
letter cancellation during NFB. All participants with mild AD learned to
operate a BCI system with training. Results have broad implications for the
design and use of bci systems for participants with cognitive impairment.
Preliminary evidence justifies implementing NFB-based cognitive measures in AD.

of three levels: pose, motif, and choreography. The pose level consists of an
LSTM component that generates temporally coherent sequences of poses. The motif
level guides sets of consecutive poses to form a movement that belongs to a

unit, our procedure reports the $\Gamma$-value, a number which quantifies the
minimum strength of confounding needed to explain away the evidence for ITE.
Our approach rests on the reliable predictive inference of counterfactuals and
ITEs in situations where the training data is confounded. Under the marginal
sensitivity model of Tan (2006), we characterize the shift between the
distribution of the observations and that of the counterfactuals. We first
develop a general method for predictive inference of test samples from a
shifted distribution; we then leverage this to construct covariate-dependent
prediction sets for counterfactuals. No matter the value of the shift, these
prediction sets (resp. approximately) achieve marginal coverage if the
propensity score is known exactly (resp. estimated). We describe a distinct
procedure also attaining coverage, however, conditional on the training data.
In the latter case, we prove a sharpness result showing that for certain
classes of prediction problems, the prediction intervals cannot possibly be
tightened. We verify the validity and performance of the new methods via

efficient software to fit spatial models to large data sets is scarce or
absent. We introduce the spOccupancy R package designed to fit single-species,
multi-species, and integrated spatially-explicit occupancy models. Using a
Bayesian framework, we leverage P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation and Nearest
Neighbor Gaussian Processes to ensure models are computationally efficient for
potentially massive data sets. spOccupancy provides user-friendly functions for
data simulation, model fitting, model validation (by posterior predictive
checks), model comparison (using information criteria and k-fold
cross-validation), and out-of-sample prediction. We illustrate the package's
functionality via a vignette, simulated data analysis, and two bird case
studies, in which we estimate occurrence of the Black-throated Green Warbler
(Setophaga virens) across the eastern USA and species richness of a
foliage-gleaning bird community in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New
Hampshire, USA. The spOccupancy package provides a user-friendly approach to
fit a variety of single and multi-species occupancy models, making it
straightforward to address detection biases and spatial autocorrelation in
species distribution models even for large data sets.

prediction, which could result in the suppression of classes that tend to
co-occur in the data. Inspired by language emergence literature, we propose
multi-label iterated learning (MILe) to incorporate the inductive biases of
multi-label learning from single labels using the framework of iterated

description of the image by propagating binary predictions through successive
generations of teacher and student networks with a learning bottleneck.
Experiments show that our approach exhibits systematic benefits on ImageNet
accuracy as well as ReaL F1 score, which indicates that MILe deals better with
label ambiguity than the standard training procedure, even when fine-tuning
from self-supervised weights. We also show that MILe is effective reducing
label noise, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world large-scale
noisy data such as WebVision. Furthermore, MILe improves performance in class
incremental settings such as IIRC and it is robust to distribution shifts.

(BH) or Be+stripped He-star systems. Two data-sets (ESO/VLT and SALT) of
multi-epoch optical spectra of NGC 2004#115, separated by baseline of $\sim$20
years, lead us conclude it is a triple system hosting an inner binary with a
period of 2.92 d, eccentricity $\sim$0.0 and mass function $\sim$0.07
$M_\odot$. The inner binary harbours a B-type star (the primary) with projected
rotational velocity of 10km/s, and luminosity $\log L/L_\odot$=3.87,
contributing $\sim$60% of the V-band light to the system. The secondary is not
detected, while the tertiary, which contributes 40% of the light, is
tentatively identified as a less luminous B-type star with high projected
rotational velocity. No ellipsoidal light variability is detected, with
stringent limits being set by MACHO and Gaia data. Assuming the primary to be a
main sequence star yields a mass of 8.6$ M_\odot$, while the additional
assumption of synchronous rotation constrains the inclination to be almost
pole-on with i~9 degrees, implying the secondary is a BH with a mass of
$\sim$25 $M_\odot$. A low mass stripped star with similar luminosity is ruled
out as a potential solution as its mass implies a Roche radius that is
substantially smaller than the stellar radius. The outer period likely exceeds
120 days and, while the disk-like emission is variable (it is almost absent in
the SALT dataset), it may be associated with the inner binary rather than the
rapidly rotating tertiary. XMM-Newton provides an upper limit of 5x$10^{33}$
ergs/s on the X-ray flux, consistent with, though not constraining of, the
system hosting a quiescent B+BH binary. A number of caveats to this scenario
are discussed in the paper.

work used pre-determined categories for annotations, and did not investigate
what consumers really deem as important from their perspective. In this paper,
we instead combine crowdsourcing with an open definition of ""what is important""
in T&Cs. We present a workflow consisting of pairwise comparisons, agreement
validation, and Bradley-Terry rank modeling, to effectively establish rankings
of T&C statements from non-expert crowdworkers on this open definition, and
further analyzed consumers' preferences. We applied this workflow to 1,551 T&C
statements from 27 e-commerce websites, contributed by 3,462 unique crowd
workers doing 203,068 pairwise comparisons, and conducted thematic and
readability analysis on the statements considered as important/unimportant. We
found that consumers especially cared about policies related to after-sales and
money, and tended to regard harder-to-understand statements as more important.
We also present machine learning models to identify T&C clauses that consumers
considered important, achieving at best a 92.7% balanced accuracy, 91.6%
recall, and 89.2% precision. We foresee using our workflow and model to
efficiently and reliably highlight important T&Cs on websites at a large scale,

its putative exotic behavior in the supercooled state. It also represents a
strong practical limitation to cryopreservation of biological systems. Adding
some concentration of glycerol, which has a cryoprotective effect preventing to
some degree water crystallization, has been proposed as a possible way out,
provided the concentration is small enough for water to retain some of its bulk
character and/or for limiting the damage caused by glycerol on living
organisms. Contrary to previous expectations, we show that in the ``marginal''
glycerol molar concentration $\approx18\%$, at which vitrification is possible
with no crystallization on rapid cooling, water crystallizes upon isothermal
annealing even below the calorimetric glass transition of the solution. Through
a time-resolved polarized neutron scattering investigation, we extract key
parameters, size and shape of the ice crystallites, fraction of water that
crystallizes, crystallization time, which are important for cryoprotection, as
a function of the annealing temperature. We also characterize the nature of the
out-of-equilibrium liquid phases that are present at low temperature, providing
more arguments against the presence of an iso-compositional liquid-liquid

is the dipole. The simplest interpretation of the dipole is that it is due to
our motion with respect to the rest frame of the CMB. As well as creating the
$\ell$=1 mode of the CMB sky, this motion affects all astrophysical
observations by modulating and aberrating sources across the sky. It can be
seen in galaxy clustering, and in principle its time derivative through a
dipole-shaped acceleration pattern in quasar positions. Additionally, the
dipole modulates the CMB temperature anisotropies with the same frequency
dependence as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and so these modulated
CMB anisotropies can be extracted from the tSZ maps produced by Planck.
Unfortunately, this measurement cannot determine if the dipole is due to our
motion, but it does provide an independent measure of the dipole and a
validation of the y maps. This measurement, and a description of the
first-order terms of the CMB dipole, are outlined here.

in the design of magnetic materials. These alloys exhibit long-range structural
order coupled with limited or no chemical order. As a result, extreme local
environments exist with a large opposing magnetic energy term, which can
manifest large changes in the magnetic behavior. In the current work, the
magnetic properties of (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) alloys are presented. These materials
were prepared by room-temperature combinatorial sputtering, resulting in a
range of compositions with a single BCC structural phase and no chemical
ordering. The combinatorial growth technique allows CCMs to be prepared outside
of their thermodynamically stable phase, enabling the exploration of otherwise
inaccessible order. The mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions
in these alloys causes frustrated magnetic behavior, which results in an
extremely low coercivity (<1 mT), which increases rapidly at 50 K. At low
temperatures, the coercivity achieves values of nearly 500 mT, which is
comparable to some high-anisotropy magnetic materials. Commensurate with the
divergent coercivity is an atypical drop in the temperature dependent
magnetization. These effects are explained by a mixed magnetic phase model,
consisting of ferro-, antiferro , and frustrated magnetic regions, and are
rationalized by simulations. A machine-learning algorithm is employed to
visualize the parameter space and inform the development of subsequent
compositions. Annealing the samples at 600 {\deg}C orders the sample, more-than
doubling the Curie temperature and increasing the saturation magnetization by
as much as 5x. Simultaneously, the large coercivities are suppressed, resulting
in magnetic behavior that is largely temperature independent over a range of

technologies and permanent magnet applications. The magnetic configuration and
response to temperatures and magnetic fields in these heterostructures are
considered to be highly dependent on the interfacial coupling. However, the
intrinsic properties of each of the layers, such as the saturation
magnetization and layer thickness, also strongly influence the magnetic
configuration. Changing these parameters provides an effective method to tailor
magnetic properties in composite magnets. Here, we use polarized neutron
reflectometry (PNR) to experimentally probe the interfacial magnetic
configurations in hard/soft bilayer thin films: L10-FePt/A1-FePt, [Co/Pd]
/CoPd, [Co/Pt] /FeNi and L10-FePt/Fe, which all have a perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy in the hard layer. These films were designed with different soft and
hard layer thicknesses (t_soft and t_hard) and saturation magnetization
(M_s^soft and M_s^hard), respectively. The influences of an in-plane magnetic
field (H_ip) and temperature (T) are also studied using a L10 FePt/A1-FePt
bilayer sample. Comparing the PNR results to micromagnetic simulations reveals
that the interfacial magnetic configuration is highly dependent on t_soft,
M_s^soft and the external factors (H_ip and T), and has a relatively weak
dependence on t_hard and M_s^hard. Key among these results, for thin t_soft,
the hard and soft layers are rigidly coupled in the out-of-plane direction,
then undergo a transition to relax in-plane. This transition can be delayed to
larger t_soft by decreasing M_s^soft. Understanding the influence of these
parameters on the magnetic configuration is critical to designing functional
composite magnets for applications.

Imbibition front positions are determined by descriptive statistics. A first
approach involves the evaluation of frequency densities of single-pore
imbibition lengths, a second one the evaluation of the statistical brightness
dispersion within the probed volume as a function of the distance from the pore
mouths. We plotted average imbibition front positions against systematically
varied powers of the imbibition time and determined the optimal exponent of the
imbibition time by considering the correlation coefficients of the
corresponding linear fits. Thus, slight deviations from the proportionality of
the average imbibition front position to the square root of the imbibition time
predicted by the Lucas-Washburn theory were found. A meaningful preexponential
factor in the power law relating imbibition front position and imbibition time
may only be determined after ambiguities regarding the exponent of the

imbibition front in frequency densities of single-pore imbibition lengths and
in brightness dispersion profiles plotted against the pore depth is suggested
as measure of the imbibition front width. Phase-contrast X-ray computed

whether there are any resultant fixed points, and how they are characterised.
Working within the threat model of Locked Shields, Europe's largest

classifiers. Given already existing attack capabilities, we question the
utility of optimal evasion attack frameworks based on minimal evasion
distances. Instead, we suggest a novel reinforcement learning setting that can
be used to efficiently generate arbitrary adversarial perturbations. We then
argue that attacker-defender fixed points are themselves general-sum games with
complex phase transitions, and introduce a temporally extended multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework in which the resultant dynamics can be
studied. We hypothesise that one plausible fixed point of AI-NIDS may be a

  Filtering Enhancement: Current Work and Future Proposal","13 pages, 6 Tables and 2 Figures",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Collaborative filtering (CF) is an important approach for recommendation
system which is widely used in a great number of aspects of our life, heavily
in the online-based commercial systems. One popular algorithms in CF is the
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, in which the similarity measures are used
to determine nearest neighbors of a user, and thus to quantify the dependency
degree between the relative user/item pair. Consequently, CF approach is not
just sensitive to the similarity measure, yet it is completely contingent on
selection of that measure. While Jaccard - as one of those commonly used
similarity measures for CF tasks - concerns the existence of ratings, other
numerical measures such as cosine and Pearson concern the magnitude of ratings.
Particularly speaking, Jaccard is not a dominant measure, but it is long proven
to be an important factor to improve any measure. Therefore, in our continuous
efforts to find the most effective similarity measures for CF, this research
focuses on proposing new similarity measure via combining Jaccard with several
numerical measures. The combined measures would take the advantages of both
existence and magnitude. Experimental results on, Movie-lens dataset, showed
that the combined measures are preeminent outperforming all single measures
over the considered evaluation metrics.

reproducibility of issues discussed in 400 Java and 400 Python questions. We
parsed, compiled, executed, and carefully examined the code segments from these
questions to reproduce the reported programming issues. The outcomes of our
study are three-fold. First, we found that we can reproduce approximately 68%
of Java and 71% of Python issues, whereas we were unable to reproduce
approximately 22% of Java and 19% of Python issues using the code segments. Of
the issues that were reproducible, approximately 67% of the Java code segments

reproduce the issues. Second, we carefully investigated why programming issues
could not be reproduced and provided evidence-based guidelines for writing
effective code examples for Stack Overflow questions. Third, we investigated
the correlation between the issue reproducibility status of questions and the
corresponding answer meta-data, such as the presence of an accepted answer.
According to our analysis, a reproducible question has at least two times
higher chance of receiving an accepted answer than an irreproducible question.
Besides, the median time delay in receiving accepted answers is double if the
issues reported in questions could not be reproduced. We also investigate the
confounding factors (e.g., reputation) and find that confounding factors do not
hurt the correlation between reproducibility status and answer meta-data.

in which a model must indicate the regions used to predict each abnormality. To
solve this task, we propose a multiple instance learning convolutional neural

sub-slice regions. We prove that for AxialNet, HiResCAM explanations are
guaranteed to reflect the locations the model used, unlike Grad-CAM which
sometimes highlights irrelevant locations. Armed with a model that produces
faithful explanations, we then aim to improve the model's learning through a
novel mask loss that leverages HiResCAM and 3D allowed regions to encourage the
model to predict abnormalities based only on the organs in which those
abnormalities appear. The 3D allowed regions are obtained automatically through
a new approach, PARTITION, that combines location information extracted from
radiology reports with organ segmentation maps obtained through morphological
image processing. Overall, we propose the first model for explainable

plasma lensing. Unlike gravitational lensing, plasma lensing causes both
magnification and strong de-magnification effects to background sources. We
study the cross section of plasma lensing for two density profiles, the
Gaussian and power-law models. In general, the cross section increases with the
density gradient. Radio sources can be used to measure the free electron
density along the line of sight. However, plasma lensing de-magnification
causes an underestimate of the electron density. Such a bias increases with the
electron density, and can be up to $\sim 15\%$ in the high density region.
There is a large probability that high density clumps will be missed due to
this bias. The magnification of plasma lensing can also change the luminosity
function of the background sources. The number density of sources on both the
high and low luminosity ends can be overestimated due to this biasing effect.

transactions used in the field of data mining, high utility-occupancy pattern
mining (HUOPM) has recently attracted widespread attention. Unlike high-utility
pattern mining (HUPM), which involves the enumeration of high-utility (e.g.,
profitable) patterns, HUOPM aims to find patterns representing a collection of
existing transactions. In practical applications, however, not all patterns are
used or valuable. For example, a pattern might contain too many items, that is,
the pattern might be too specific and therefore lack value for users in real
life. To achieve qualified patterns with a flexible length, we constrain the
minimum and maximum lengths during the mining process and introduce a novel
algorithm for the mining of flexible high utility-occupancy patterns. Our
algorithm is referred to as HUOPM+. To ensure the flexibility of the patterns
and tighten the upper bound of the utility-occupancy, a strategy called the
length upper-bound (LUB) is presented to prune the search space. In addition, a
utility-occupancy nested list (UO-nlist) and a frequency-utility-occupancy
table (FUO-table) are employed to avoid multiple scans of the database.
Evaluation results of the subsequent experiments confirm that the proposed

agree with this result and present our findings. First, we examine different
typical diagonalizable noises acting on the oracles in GSA and find that the
success probability decreases and oscillates around $1/2$ as the number of
iterations increases. Secondly, our results show that the performance of GSA
can be improved by certain types of noise, such as bit flip and bit-phase flip

achieve a desired success probability and demonstrate that GSA with bit-phase
flip noise still outperforms its classical counterpart. These results suggest
new avenues for research in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing,
such as evaluating the feasibility of quantum algorithms with noise and
exploring their applications in machine learning.

  multi-organ segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation is crucial for transferring the knowledge from the source
labeled CT dataset to the target unlabeled MR dataset in abdominal multi-organ
segmentation. Meanwhile, it is highly desirable to avoid the high annotation
cost related to the target dataset and protect the source dataset privacy.
Therefore, we propose an effective source-free unsupervised domain adaptation
method for cross-modality abdominal multi-organ segmentation without source
dataset access. The proposed framework comprises two stages. In the first
stage, the feature map statistics-guided model adaptation combined with entropy
minimization is developed to help the top segmentation network reliably segment
the target images. The pseudo-labels output from the top segmentation network
are used to guide the style compensation network to generate source-like
images. The pseudo-labels output from the middle segmentation network is used
to supervise the learning progress of the desired model (bottom segmentation
network). In the second stage, the circular learning and pixel-adaptive mask
refinement are used to further improve the desired model performance. With this
approach, we achieved satisfactory abdominal multi-organ segmentation
performance, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation
methods. The proposed approach can be easily extended to situations in which
target annotation data exist. With only one labeled MR volume, the performance
can be levelled with that of supervised learning. Furthermore, the proposed
approach is proven to be effective for source-free unsupervised domain
adaptation in reverse direction.

principle for the transfer matrix of the 2D Ising model, which naturally leads
us to the matrix product state (MPS) and the corner transfer matrix (CTM). We
then explain how the CTM can be evolved to such MPS-based approaches as density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and infinite time-evolved block decimation.
We also elucidate that the finite-size DMRG played an intrinsic role for
incorporating various quantum information concepts in subsequent developments
in the TN. After surveying higher-dimensional generalizations like tensor
product states or projected entangled pair states, we describe tensor
renormalization groups (TRGs), which are a fusion of TNs and Kadanoff-Wilson

structures. We then discuss how the difficulty in TRGs for critical systems can
be overcome in the tensor network renormalization and the multi-scale
entanglement renormalization ansatz.

proved to be both efficient and robust. However, a serious problem of

Maxwell Telescope. Theoretical models predict that the magnetic field lines in
a filament will tend to be dragged radially inward (i.e., pinched) toward the
central axis due to the filament's self-gravity. We study the cross-sectional
profiles of the total intensity ($I$) and polarized intensity (PI) of dust
emission in four segments of filaments unaffected by local star formation that
are expected to retain a pristine magnetic field structure. We find that the
filaments' FWHM in PI are not the same as those in $I$, with two segments being
appreciably narrower in PI (FWHM ratio $\simeq 0.7-0.8$) and one segment being
wider (FWHM ratio $\simeq 1.3$). The filament profiles of the polarization
fraction ($P$) do not show a minimum at the spine of the filament, which is not
in line with an anticorrelation between $P$ and $I$ normally seen in molecular
clouds and protostellar cores. Dust grain alignment variation with density
cannot reproduce the observed $P$ distribution. We demonstrate numerically that
the $I$ and PI cross-sectional profiles of filaments in magnetohydrostatic
equilibrium will have differing relative widths depending on the viewing angle.
The observed variations of FWHM ratios in NGC 1333 are therefore consistent
with models of pinched magnetic field structures inside filaments, and
especially if they are magnetically near-critical or supercritical.

steganalysis network (called UCNet) in spatial and JPEG domains. The proposed
method includes preprocessing, convolutional, and classification modules. To
preserve the steganographic artifacts in each color channel, in preprocessing
module, we firstly separate the input image into three channels according to
the corresponding embedding spaces (i.e. RGB for spatial steganography and
YCbCr for JPEG steganography), and then extract the image residuals with 62
fixed high-pass filters, finally concatenate all truncated residuals for
subsequent analysis rather than adding them together with normal convolution
like existing CNN-based steganalyzers. To accelerate the network convergence
and effectively reduce the number of parameters, in convolutional module, we
carefully design three types of layers with different shortcut connections and
group convolution structures to further learn high-level steganalytic features.
In classification module, we employ a global average pooling and fully
connected layer for classification. We conduct extensive experiments on ALASKA
II to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results
compared with the modern CNN-based steganalyzers (e.g., SRNet and J-YeNet) in
both spatial and JPEG domains, while keeping relatively few memory requirements
and training time. Furthermore, we also provide necessary descriptions and many
ablation experiments to verify the rationality of the network design.

depend on the choices made by other investors who hold such convertible

privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a

where preserving the adversary's state is essential.
  In this work, we develop new techniques for quantum rewinding in the context
of extraction and zero-knowledge simulation:
  (1) We show how to extract information from a quantum adversary by rewinding
it without disturbing its internal state. We use this technique to prove that
important interactive protocols, such as the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson
protocol for graph non-isomorphism and the Feige-Shamir protocol for NP, are
zero-knowledge against quantum adversaries.
  (2) We prove that the Goldreich-Kahan protocol for NP is post-quantum zero
knowledge using a simulator that can be seen as a natural quantum extension of
the classical simulator.
  Our results achieve (constant-round) black-box zero-knowledge with negligible
simulation error, appearing to contradict a recent impossibility result due to
Chia-Chung-Liu-Yamakawa (FOCS 2021). This brings us to our final contribution:
  (3) We introduce coherent-runtime expected quantum polynomial time, a
computational model that (a) captures all of our zero-knowledge simulators, (b)
cannot break any polynomial hardness assumptions, and (c) is not subject to the
CCLY impossibility. In light of our positive results and the CCLY negative

the proposed DDNet detector consistently outperforms other detectors under all

fast radio bursts (FRBs) is coherent emission by bunches, either via curvature
radiation or inverse Compton scattering (ICS). It has been suggested that the
plasma oscillation effect can significantly suppress coherent emission power by
bunches. We examine this criticism in this paper. The suppression factor
formalism was derived within the context of radio pulsars in which radio waves
are in the low-amplitude, linear regime and cannot directly be applied to the
large-amplitude, non-linear regime relevant for FRBs. Even if one applies this
linear treatment, plasma suppression is not important for two physical reasons.
First, for an efficient radiation mechanism such as ICS, the required plasma
density is not high so that a high-density plasma may not exist. Second, both
bunched coherent mechanisms demand that a large global parallel electric field
($E_\parallel$) must exist in the emission region in order to continuously
inject energy to the bunches to power an FRB. In order to produce typical FRB
duration via coherent curvature or ICS radiation, a parallel electric field
must be present to balance the acceleration and radiation back-reaction. The
plasma suppression factor should be modified with the existence of
$E_\parallel$. We show that the correction factor for curvature radiation,
$f_{\rm cur}$, increases with $E_\parallel$ and becomes 1 when $E_\parallel$
reaches the radiation-reaction-limited regime. We conclude that the plasma
suppression effect can be ignored for realistic FRB emission models invoking
bunched coherent radio emission.

develops an analytical framework that determines and analyzes the most dominant
factors impacting human mobility and travel in the U.S. during this pandemic.
In particular, the study uses Granger causality to determine the important
predictors influencing daily vehicle miles traveled and utilize linear
regularization algorithms, including Ridge and LASSO techniques, to model and
predict mobility. State-level time-series data were obtained from various
open-access sources for the period starting from March 1, 2020 through June 13,

train the three different reduced order models by ordinary least square
regression, Ridge regression, and LASSO regression algorithms. Finally, the
prediction accuracy of the developed models was examined on the test data. The
results indicate that the factors including the number of new COVID cases,
social distancing index, population staying at home, percent of out of county
trips, trips to different destinations, socioeconomic status, percent of people
working from home, and statewide closure, among others, were the most important
factors influencing daily VMT. Also, among all the modeling techniques, Ridge

the abrupt changes in quantized weights during training often lead to severe

Minimization (SAM) has been proposed to smooth the loss landscape and improve
the generalization performance of the models. Nevertheless, directly applying
SAM to the quantized models can lead to perturbation mismatch or diminishment
issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, dubbed Sharpness-Aware Quantization (SAQ), to explore the effect of SAM
in model compression, particularly quantization for the first time.
Specifically, we first provide a unified view of quantization and SAM by
treating them as introducing quantization noises and adversarial perturbations
to the model weights, respectively. According to whether the noise and
perturbation terms depend on each other, SAQ can be formulated into three
cases, which are analyzed and compared comprehensively. Furthermore, by
introducing an efficient training strategy, SAQ only incurs a little additional
training overhead compared with the default optimizer (e.g., SGD or AdamW).
Extensive experiments on both convolutional neural networks and Transformers
across various datasets (i.e., ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, Oxford Flowers-102,
Oxford-IIIT Pets) show that SAQ improves the generalization performance of the
quantized models, yielding the SOTA results in uniform quantization. For
example, on ImageNet, SAQ outperforms AdamW by 1.2% on the Top-1 accuracy for
4-bit ViT-B/16. Our 4-bit ResNet-50 surpasses the previous SOTA method by 0.9%

to collect this data, especially for resource-poor languages. To overcome this
difficulty, our proposed method utilizes well-prepared large datasets in

reflects knowledge of multiple languages while the decoder specializes in
knowledge of just the resource-poor language. To this end, the proposed method
pre-trains the encoder by using a multilingual dataset that combines the
resource-poor language's dataset and the resource-rich language's dataset to
learn language-invariant knowledge for scene text recognition. The proposed
method also pre-trains the decoder by using the resource-poor language's

  turbulent Taylor-Couette flows","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study we report numerical results of turbulent transport of heat $Nu$
and angular momentum $\nu_{t}/\nu$ in Taylor-Couette (TC) flows subjected to a
radial temperature gradient. Direct numerical simulations are performed in a TC
cell with a radius ratio $\eta=0.5$ and an aspect ratio $\Gamma=8$ for two
Rayleigh numbers ($Ra=10^5$, $10^6$) and two Prandtl numbers ($Pr=0.7$,
$4.38$), while the Reynolds number $Re$ varies in the range of $0 \le Re \le
15000$. With increasing $Re$, the flows undergo two distinct transitions: the
first transition being from the convection-dominated regime to the transitional
regime, with the large-scale meridional circulation evolving into spiral
vortices; the second transition occurring in the rotation-dominated regime when
Taylor vortices turn from a weakly non-linear state into a turbulent state. In
particular, when the flows are governed by turbulent Taylor vortices, we find
that both transport processes exhibit power-law scaling: $Nu\sim
Re^{0.619\pm0.015}$ for $Pr=4.38$, $Nu\sim Re^{0.590\pm0.025}$ for $Pr=0.7$ and
$\nu_{t}/\nu\sim Re^{0.588\pm0.036}$ for both $Pr$.These scaling exponents
suggest an analogous mechanism for the radial transport of heat and angular
momentum, which is further evidenced by the fact that the ratio of turbulent
viscosity to diffusivity is independent of $Re$. To illustrate the underlying
mechanism of turbulent transport, we extract the coherent structures by
analyzing the spatial distributions of heat and momentum flux densities. Our
results reveal mutual turbulent structures through which both heat and angular
momentum are transported efficiently.

Earlier research has shownthat the cache miss latency is responsible for more

policies. In thispaper, we study the various methods that do so by attempting
to decrease the CPU cache miss ratio.Graph Reordering attempts to exploit the
power-law distribution of graphs -- few sparsely-populated vertices in the
graph have high number of connections -- to keep the frequently accessed
vertices together locally and hence decrease the cache misses. However,
reordering the graph by keeping the hot vertices together may affect the
spatial locality of the graph, and thus add to the total CPU compute time.Also,
we also need to have a control over the total reordering time and its inverse
relation with thefinal CPU execution timeIn order to exploit this trade-off
between reordering as per vertex hotness and spatial locality, we introduce the
light-weight Community-based Reordering. We attempt to maintain the

However, recent studies have empirically shown that training from scratch has
the final performance that is no worse than this pre-training strategy once the

revisit this phenomenon from the perspective of generalization analysis by
using excess risk bound which is popular in learning theory. The result reveals
that the excess risk bound may have a weak dependency on the pre-trained model.

for diagnostic imaging of diseases, but its image quality may be suffered by
the long acquisition time. The compressive sensing (CS) based strategy may
decrease the reconstruction time greatly, but it needs efficient reconstruction
algorithms to produce high-quality and reliable images. This paper focuses on
the algorithmic improvement for the sparse reconstruction of CS-MRI, especially
considering a non-smooth convex minimization problem which is composed of the
sum of a total variation regularization term and a $\ell_1$-norm term of the
wavelet transformation. The partly motivation of targeting the dual problem is
that the dual variables are involved in relatively low-dimensional subspace.
Instead of solving the primal model as usual, we turn our attention to its
associated dual model composed of three variable blocks and two separable
non-smooth function blocks. However, the directly extended alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) must be avoided because it may be
divergent, although it usually performs well numerically. In order to solve the
problem, we employ a symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique based ADMM.
Compared with the directly extended ADMM, this method only needs one additional
iteration, but its convergence can be guaranteed theoretically. Besides, we
also propose a generalized variant of ADMM because this method has been
illustrated to be efficient for solving semidefinite programming in the past
few years. Finally, we do extensive experiments on MRI reconstruction using
some simulated and real MRI images under different sampling patterns and
ratios. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms
significantly achieve high reconstruction accuracies with fast computational
speed.

paper, we make the first attempt to demonstrate the importance of both regions
in cropping from a complete perspective and propose a simple yet effective
pretext task called Region Contrastive Learning (RegionCL). Specifically, given
two different images, we randomly crop a region (called the paste view) from
each image with the same size and swap them to compose two new images together

pairs can be efficiently constructed according to the following simple
criteria, i.e., each view is (1) positive with views augmented from the same
original image and (2) negative with views augmented from other images. With
minor modifications to popular SSL methods, RegionCL exploits those abundant
pairs and helps the model distinguish the regions features from both canvas and

the PDVs are mapped to feature vectors of the size of dictionary, instead of
LBP histograms of very high dimension. Such an encoding scheme could extract

that has attracted much attention in various fields ranging from video game
industry to robot manipulators. Despite its remarkable performance
demonstrations, plain reinforcement learning controllers do not guarantee
stability which compromises their applicability in industry. To provide such
guarantees, measures have to be taken. This gives rise to what could generally
be called stabilizing reinforcement learning. Concrete approaches range from
employment of human overseers to filter out unsafe actions to formally verified
shields and fusion with classical stabilizing controllers. A line of attack
that utilizes elements of adaptive control has become fairly popular in the
recent years. In this note, we critically address such an approach in a fairly
general actor-critic setup for nonlinear time-continuous environments. The
actor network utilizes a so-called robustifying term that is supposed to
compensate for the neural network errors. The corresponding stability analysis
is based on the value function itself. We indicate a problem in such a
stability analysis and provide a counterexample to the overall control scheme.
Implications for such a line of attack in stabilizing reinforcement learning
are discussed. Furthermore, unfortunately the said problem possess no fix
without a substantial reconsideration of the whole approach. As a positive
message, we derive a stochastic critic neural network weight convergence
analysis provided that the environment was stabilized.

the linear response regime. The Leggett mode is a collective mode unique to
multiband superconductors that arises from relative phase fluctuations of
superconducting orders for different bands. We use the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)
description to study the collective modes in multiband systems. We find that
multiband superconductors generally allow a linear coupling between the Leggett
mode and external electric fields due to the presence of a cross term between
different components of superconducting orders in the GL theory. The presence
of a linear coupling for the Leggett mode is in sharp contrast with the absence
of that for Higgs (amplitude) modes in single-band superconductors that only
support nonlinear optical responses such as third harmonic generation (THG). We
further confirm such a linear coupling in multiband superconductors by a more
microscopic description based on a diagrammatic approach. We study the
collective modes within the random phase approximation (RPA) and compute their
contribution to the linear optical conductivity. These findings suggest a new
route to observe the Leggett mode by optical absorption.

Motivated by this exciting observation, we conjecture that encouraging feature
consistency of different views may be a promising way to boost FAS models. In
this paper, we explore this way thoroughly by enhancing both Embedding-level

production, microgrids have become an effective way for tackling environmental
pollution and energy crisis issues. With the increasing penetration of
renewables, how to coordinate demand response and renewable generations is a
critical and challenging issue in the field of microgrid scheduling. To this
end, a bi-level scheduling model is put forward for isolated microgrids with
consideration of multi-stakeholders in this paper, where the lower- and
upper-level models respectively aim to the minimization of user cost and
microgrid operational cost under real-time electricity pricing environments. In
order to solve this model, this research combines Jaya algorithm and interior
point method (IPM) to develop a hybrid analysis-heuristic solution method
called Jaya-IPM, where the lower- and upper- levels are respectively addressed
by the IPM and the Jaya, and the scheduling scheme is obtained via iterations
between the two levels. After that, the real-time prices updated by the
upper-level model and the electricity plans determined by the lower-level model
will be alternately iterated between the upper- and lower- levels through the
real-time pricing mechanism to obtain an optimal scheduling plan. The test
results show that the proposed method can coordinate the uncertainty of
renewable generations with demand response strategies, thereby achieving a
balance between the interests of microgrid and users; and that by leveraging
demand response, the flexibility of the load side can be fully exploited to
achieve peak load shaving while maintaining the balance of supply and demand.
In addition, the Jaya-IPM algorithm is proven to be superior to the traditional
hybrid intelligent algorithm (HIA) and the CPLEX solver in terms of
optimization results and calculation efficiency.

leads to desirable generalization. An interesting research therefore is how to
improve modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper
presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple
and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the
global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents
the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this
direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global
and local models. The new model, which we call decoupled PLDA, is tested on a
speaker verification task. Experimental results show that it consistently
outperforms the vanilla PLDA when the model is based on raw speaker vectors.
However, when the speaker vectors are processed by length normalization, the
advantage of decoupled PLDA will be largely lost, suggesting future research on
non-linear local models.

further aggravated for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) LC where the adversary can spam the

show that 'download along the longest header chain', a natural download rule
for Proof-of-Work (PoW) LC, is insecure for PoS LC. We propose a simple rule
'download towards the freshest block', formalize two common heuristics 'not

bandwidth-constrained networks. In experiments, we validate our claims and
showcase the behavior of these download rules under attack. By composing
multiple instances of a PoS LC protocol with a suitable download rule in

fluctuations. The possibility that the state is an extraordinary-log state
seems unlikely. For the $S=1$ system, we find surface behaviors similar to that
of the three-dimensional classical XY model with sufficiently enhanced surface
coupling, suggesting an extraordinary-log state at the bulk critical point.

$\mathbb{R}^n$.
  We prove that if $M$ is such a manifold then the space
$\mathscr{C}_0^\infty(M)$ is dense in $W^{1,p}(M,\partial M)$ (the kernel of
the trace operator) for all $p\le p_M$, where $p_M$ is the codimension in $M$
of the singular locus of $\overline{M}\setminus M$. In the case where $M$ is
normal, i.e. when $B(x_0,\varepsilon)\cap M$ is connected for every
$x_0\in\overline{M}$ and $\varepsilon>0$ small, we show that
$\mathscr{C}^\infty(\overline{M})$ is dense in $W^{1,p}(M)$ for all such $p$.
This yields some duality results between $W^{1,p}(\Omega,\partial \Omega)$ and
$W^{-1,p'}(\Omega)$ in the case where $1< p\le p_\Omega$ and $\Omega$ is a
bounded subanalytic open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and consequently that
$W^{1,p}(\Omega,\partial \Omega)$ is reflexive for such $p$. As a byproduct, we
deduce uniqueness of the (weak) solution of the Dirichlet problem associated
with the Laplace equation. We then prove a version of Sobolev's Embedding
Theorem for subanalytic bounded manifolds, show Gagliardo-Nirenberg's
inequality (for all $p\in [1,\infty)$), and derive some versions of
Poincar\'e-Friedrichs' inequality. We finish with a generalization of Morrey's
Embedding Theorem.

that superimposes onto the Frequency-Time (FT) domain both the legacy
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation scheme and a sensing
signal, purposely designed in the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The power of the
two signals is properly allocated in FT and DD domains, respectively, to reduce
their mutual interference and optimize both communication and sensing tasks.
Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed JC\&S waveform design
approach, yielding target communication and sensing performance with a full

  Reconstruction-guided Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation","CVPR 2021 (updated references in this version)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Event cameras sense per-pixel intensity changes and produce asynchronous
event streams with high dynamic range and less motion blur, showing advantages
over conventional cameras. A hurdle of training event-based models is the lack
of large qualitative labeled data. Prior works learning end-tasks mostly rely
on labeled or pseudo-labeled datasets obtained from the active pixel sensor
(APS) frames; however, such datasets' quality is far from rivaling those based
on the canonical images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called
\textbf{EvDistill}, to learn a student network on the unlabeled and unpaired
event data (target modality) via knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher
network trained with large-scale, labeled image data (source modality). To
enable KD across the unpaired modalities, we first propose a bidirectional
modality reconstruction (BMR) module to bridge both modalities and
simultaneously exploit them to distill knowledge via the crafted pairs, causing
no extra computation in the inference. The BMR is improved by the end-tasks and
KD losses in an end-to-end manner. Second, we leverage the structural
similarities of both modalities and adapt the knowledge by matching their
distributions. Moreover, as most prior feature KD methods are uni-modality and
less applicable to our problem, we propose to leverage an affinity graph KD
loss to boost the distillation. Our extensive experiments on semantic
segmentation and object recognition demonstrate that EvDistill achieves
significantly better results than the prior works and KD with only events and
APS frames.

The proposed protocol relies on an unusual kinetics combining the effects of
the entropic stabilization and low energy barrier for the nucleation of a

the tilt of the external magnetic field one can selectively generate chiral
droplets or $\pi$-skyrmions in a single system. The coexistence of two distinct

opens up the possibility for the construction of more complex magnetic textures
such as skyrmion bags and skyrmions with chiral kinks.

utilized for predicting the human body parts by preserving the characteristics
of the reference person. This is especially good for handling cross-category
try-on task (\eg long sleeves \(\leftrightarrow\) short sleeves or long pants
\(\leftrightarrow\) skirts, \etc), where the exposed arms or legs with the skin
colors and details can be reasonably predicted; 2) Improved Geometric Matching
Module, which is designed to warp clothes according to the geometry of the
target person. We improve the TPS based warping method with a compactly
supported radial function (Wendland's \(\Psi\)-function); 3) Trade-Off Fusion
Module, which is to trade off the characteristics of the warped clothes and the

nuclear network routine that is coupled with the hydrodynamic simulation code.
When these studies are performed in more than one dimension, the size of the
network is severely limited by computational issues. In this work, we propose a
nuclear network, net87, which is close to one hundred nuclei and could be
appropriate to simulate supernova explosions in multidimensional studies. One
relevant feature is that electron and positron captures on free protons and
neutrons have been incorporated to the network. Such addition allows for a
better track of both, the neutronized species and the gas pressure. A second
important feature is that the reactions are implicitly coupled with the
temperature, which enhances the stability in the nuclear statistical
equilibrium (NSE) regime. Here we analyze the performance of net87 in light of
both: the computational overhead of the algorithm and the outcome in terms of
the released nuclear energy and produced yields in typical Type Ia Supernova
conditions.

  by mid-infrared pulses",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The competition between the electron-hole Coulomb attraction and the
three-dimensional dielectric screening dictates the optical properties of
layered semiconductors. In low-dimensional materials, the equilibrium
dielectric environment can be significantly altered by the ultrafast excitation
of photo-carriers, leading to renormalized band gap and exciton binding
energies. Recently, black phosphorus emerged as a 2D material with strongly
layer-dependent electronic properties. Here, we resolve the coherent response
of screening to sub-gap photo-excitation in bulk black phosphorus and find that
mid-infrared pulses tuned across the band gap drive a transient non-thermal
suppression of the dielectric screening, which is revealed by the emergence of
the single-layer exciton resonance. Our work exposes the role of interlayer
interactions in determining the electronic properties of 2D materials and
discloses the possibility of optically manipulate them, which is of great
relevance for the engineering of versatile van der Waals low-dimensional
materials.

it remains challenging to deploy the segmentation models to unseen domains due
to domain biases. Domain adaptation can help in this regard by transferring
knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous
methods typically attempt to perform the adaptation on global features,
however, the local semantic affiliations accounting for each pixel in the
feature space are often ignored, resulting in less discriminability. To solve
this issue, we propose a novel semantic prototype-based contrastive learning
framework for fine-grained class alignment. Specifically, the semantic
prototypes provide supervisory signals for per-pixel discriminative
representation learning and each pixel of source and target domains in the
feature space is required to reflect the content of the corresponding semantic
prototype. In this way, our framework is able to explicitly make intra-class
pixel representations closer and inter-class pixel representations further
apart to improve the robustness of the segmentation model as well as alleviate
the domain shift problem. Our method is easy to implement and attains superior
results compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as is demonstrated with a
number of experiments. The code is publicly available at

topological superconductors (HOTSC) and show how it can be used to detect and
braid Majorana corner modes (MCMs). This class of HOTSC is composed of
two-dimensional topological insulators with s-wave superconductivity and
in-plane magnetic fields, which offers advantages in experimental
implementation. The spin polarization of the MCMs in this class is
perpendicular with the applied magnetic field direction and is opposite on
intrinsic orbitals, resulting in an overall ferrimagnetic spin texture. As a
result, we find that the spin-selective Andreev reflection can be observed in a
transverse instead of parallel direction to the applied magnetic field.
Meanwhile, this spin texture leads to the gate-tunable $4\pi$ periodic $\phi_0$
Josephson current that performs qualitatively different behavior from the
topologically trivial $\phi_0$-junction under rotating the in-plane magnetic
field. Meanwhile, the existence of the MCMs in this class does not depend on
the in-plane magnetic field direction. This gives rise to great advantage in
constructing all electronically controlled Majorana network for braiding, which
is confirmed through our numerical simulation. We thus provide a comprehensive
scheme for probing non-Abelian statistics in this class of HOTSCs.

redundant execution is not always feasible due to resource constraints. In this
paper, we address the need for feasible and efficient perception monitors and
propose a lightweight approach that helps to protect the integrity of the

contrast to existing solutions, the monitor is realized by a well-balanced
combination of sensor checks -- here using LiDAR information -- and
plausibility checks on the object motion history. It is designed to detect
relevant errors in the distance and velocity of objects in the environment of
the automated vehicle. In conjunction with an appropriate planning system, such

this is a challenging endeavour as (sub-)solar mass companions at angular
separations ($\rho$) below 1"" (corresponding to 1000-3000 au in nearby young

significant constraints on the presence and properties of low-mass companions
around massive stars at a previously unreachable observing window ($\Delta
\mathrm{mag} \gtrsim 10$ at $\rho \lesssim$ 1""). In this second paper in the
series, we focus on the Trumpler 14 cluster, which harbours some of the
youngest and most massive O-type stars in the Milky Way. We obtained VLT-SPHERE
observations of seven O-type objects in Trumpler 14 using the IRDIFS_EXT mode.
These allow us to search for companions at separations larger than 0.""15

fitting to detect sources and measure their flux relative to that of the

in the range of 2 to 12. The closest companion, at only 0.""26, is characterised
as a 1.4M$_{\odot}$ stars with an age of 0.6Myr, in excellent agreement with

One focus is a study of the heating efficiency of interstellar gas as traced by
the [CII] line to test models of the photoelectric heating of neutral gas by
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and very small grains. We make
use of a one-square-degree map of velocity-resolved [CII] line emission toward
the Orion Nebula complex, and split this out into the individual spatial
components, the expanding Veil Shell, the surface of OMC4, and the PDRs
associated with the compact HII region of M43 and the reflection nebula NGC
1977. We employed Herschel far-infrared photometric images to determine dust
properties. Moreover, we compared with Spitzer mid-infrared photometry to trace
hot dust and large molecules, and velocity-resolved IRAM 30m CO(2-1)
observations of the molecular gas. The [CII] intensity is tightly correlated
with PAH emission in the IRAC 8$\mu$m band and far-infrared emission from warm
dust. The correlation between [CII] and CO(2-1) is very different in the four
subregions and is very sensitive to the detailed geometry. Constant-density PDR
models are able to reproduce the observed [CII], CO(2-1), and integrated
far-infrared (FIR) intensities. We observe strong variations in the
photoelectric heating efficiency in the Veil Shell behind the Orion Bar and
these variations are seemingly not related to the spectral properties of the
PAHs. The [CII] emission from the Orion Nebula complex stems mainly from
moderately illuminated PDR surfaces. Future observations with the James Webb
Space Telescope can shine light on the PAH properties that may be linked to
these variations.

hosts other features of scientific import, including a radio relic, along with
a bridge of emission connecting it with the halo. It is thus a well-studied
object. In this paper, we show the first confirmed NenuFAR detection of the
radio halo and radio relic of the Coma cluster at 34.4 MHz, with associated
intrinsic flux density estimates: we find an integrated flux value of 106.3 +-
3.5 Jy for the radio halo, and 102.0 +- 7.4 Jy for the radio relic. These are
upper bound values, as they do not include point-source subtraction. We also
give an explanation of the technical difficulties encountered in reducing the
data, along with steps taken to resolve them. This will be helpful for other
scientific projects which will aim to make use of standalone NenuFAR imaging
observations in the future.

paper, we present a Multimodal Pyramid Attentional Network

the attentive feature pyramid module. This module captures temporal pyramid
features via several stacking pyramid units, each of them is composed of a
fixed-size attention block and dilated convolution block. We also design an
adaptive semantic fusion module, which leverages a unit-level attention block
and a selective fusion block to integrate pyramid features interactively.
Extensive experiments on audio-visual event localization and weakly-supervised

time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) were used. Effects of
temperature on the A and B exciton peak energies and linewidths in the optical
transmission spectra were compared between the alloy and pure MoS2 and WS2. On
increasing the temperature from 25 K to 293 K the energy of the A and B exciton
peaks decreases, while their linewidth increases due to exciton-phonon
interactions. The exciton-phonon interactions in the alloy are closer to those
for MoS2 than WS2. This suggests that the exciton wave functions in the alloy
have a larger amplitude on Mo atoms than on W atoms. The experimental
absorption spectra could be reproduced by TDDFT calculations. Interestingly,
for the alloy the Mo and W atoms had to be distributed over all layers.
Conversely, we could not reproduce the experimental alloy spectrum by
calculations on a structure with alternating layers, in which every other layer
contains only Mo atoms and the layers in between also W atoms. For the latter
atomic arrangement, the TDDFT calculations yielded an additional optical
absorption peak that could be due to excitons with some charge transfer
character. From these results we conclude that ALD yields an alloy in which Mo
and W atoms are distributed uniformly among all layers.

theory for complexation of two oppositely charged PEs, a process known to be
the precursor to the formation of complex coacervates in PE solutions, to
explore the underlying thermodynamics of complex formation, at low salts.
Explicit calculation of the free energy of complexation and its components
indicates that the entropy of free counterions and salt ions and the Coulomb
enthalpy of bound ion-pairs dictate the equilibrium of PE complexation. This
helps decouple the self-consistent dependency of charge and size of the
uncomplexed parts of the polyions, derive an analytical expression for charge,
and evaluate the free energy components as functions of chain overlap.
Complexation is observed to be driven by enthalpy gain at low Coulomb
strengths, driven by entropy gain of released counterions but opposed by
enthalpy loss due to reduction of ion-pairs at moderate Coulomb strengths, and
finally prohibited by enthalpy loss at higher Coulomb strengths. Phase diagrams
are constructed which identify the stability of fully-, partially- and

predictions from our model are in good quantitative agreement with simulations

determination of the ground state of the BN polymorphs, such as hexagonal and
zinc-blende, is difficult because of the elusive Van der Waals interaction,
which plays a decisive role in some of the polymorphs, making quantitative
prediction highly challenging. Hence, despite multiple theoretical studies,
there has been no consensus on the ground state yet, primarily due to
contradicting reports. In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art ab initio
framework - fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC), to four well known BN
polymorphs, namely hexagonal, rhombohedral, wurtzite, and zinc-blende BNs. Our
FNDMC calculations show that hBN is thermodynamically the most stable among the
four polymorphs at 0 K as well as at 300K. This result agrees with the
experimental data of Corrigan~{\it et al.} and Fukunaga. The conclusions are
consistent with those obtained using other high-level methods, such as coupled
cluster. We demonstrate that the FNDMC is a powerful method to address
polymorphs that exhibit bonds of various forms. It also provides valuable
information, like reliable reference energies, when reliable experimental data
are missing or difficult to access. Our findings should promote the application
of FNDMC for other van der Waals materials.

superconductivity with a transition temperature (Tc) of 6.4 K, which is close
to the Tc of V3Ge. The upper critical field (Bc2(0)) of V3X estimated from

change-making problem to be solvable with a greedy algorithm. The change-making
problem is to minimize the number of coins used to pay a given value in a
specified currency system. This problem is NP-hard, and therefore the greedy
algorithm does not always yield an optimal solution. Yet for almost all real
currency systems, the greedy algorithm outputs an optimal solution. A currency
system for which the greedy algorithm returns an optimal solution for any value

give characterization of canonical systems with six types of coins, and we
propose a partial generalization of characterization of canonical systems.

equations having a strongly regular singularity of first order with a
one-dimensional nullspace. Our two main results are as follows. First, we show
that the use of a preceding Newton-like step ensures convergence for starting
points in a starlike domain with density 1. This extends the domain of
convergence of these methods significantly. Second, we establish that the
matrix updates of Broyden's method converge q-linearly with the same asymptotic
factor as the iterates. This contributes to the long-standing question whether
the Broyden matrices converge by showing that this is indeed the case for the
setting at hand. Furthermore, we prove that the Broyden directions violate
uniform linear independence, which implies that existing results for
convergence of the Broyden matrices cannot be applied. Numerical experiments of
high precision confirm the enlarged domain of convergence, the q-linear
convergence of the matrix updates, and the lack of uniform linear independence.
In addition, they suggest that these results can be extended to singularities
of higher order and that Broyden's method can converge r-linearly without
converging q-linearly. The underlying code is freely available.

within a population tends to be non-ergodic, even after rescaling the
individual wealth with the population average. Despite these discoveries, the
way in which non-ergodicity manifests itself in models of economic interactions
remains an open issue. Here, we shed valuable insight on these properties by
studying the non-ergodicity of the population average wealth in a simple model
for wealth dynamics in a growing and reallocating economy called Reallocating
geometric Brownian motion (RGBM). When the effective wealth reallocation in the
economy is from the poor to the rich, the model allows for the existence of
negative wealth within the population. We show that then, in RGBM ergodicity
breaks as the difference between the time-average and the ensemble growth rate
of the average wealth in the population. In particular, the ensemble average
wealth grows exponentially whereas the time-average growth rate is
non-existent. Moreover, we find that the system is characterized with a
critical self-averaging time period. Before this time period, the ensemble
average is a fair approximation for the population average wealth. Afterwards,
the non-ergodicity forces the population average to oscillate between positive
and negative values since then the magnitude of this observable is determined
by the most extreme wealth values in the population. This implies that the
dynamics of the population average is an unstable phenomenon in a non-ergodic
economy. We use this result to argue that one should be cautious when
interpreting economic well-being measures that are based on the population
average wealth in non-ergodic economies.

a model coined as Dictionary-based Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA). While earlier
contributions focused on finding factor columns inside a dictionary of
candidate columns, i.e. one-sparse approximations, this work is the first to
tackle DLRA with sparsity larger than one. I propose to focus on the
sparse-coding subproblem coined Mixed Sparse-Coding (MSC) that emerges when
solving DLRA with an alternating optimization strategy. Several algorithms
based on sparse-coding heuristics (greedy methods, convex relaxations) are
provided to solve MSC. The performance of these heuristics is evaluated on
simulated data. Then, I show how to adapt an efficient MSC solver based on the
LASSO to compute Dictionary-based Matrix Factorization and Canonical Polyadic
Decomposition in the context of hyperspectral image processing and
chemometrics. These experiments suggest that DLRA extends the modeling
capabilities of low-rank approximations, helps reducing estimation variance and
enhances the identifiability and interpretability of estimated factors.

introduce an attack on said schemes based on two observations: (1) highly
similar facial representations usually originate from face images with similar

same terrain is necessary for change detection, object
classification/segmentation, and map-making tasks. However, traditional RRN
models are not robust, disturbing by object change, and RRN models precisely
considering object change can not robustly obtain the no-change set. This paper
proposes auto robust relative radiometric normalization methods via latent
change noise modeling. They utilize the prior knowledge that no change points
possess small-scale noise under relative radiometric normalization and that
change points possess large-scale radiometric noise after radiometric
normalization, combining the stochastic expectation maximization method to
quickly and robustly extract the no-change set to learn the relative
radiometric normalization mapping functions. This makes our model theoretically
grounded regarding the probabilistic theory and mathematics deduction.
Specifically, when we select histogram matching as the relative radiometric
normalization learning scheme integrating with the mixture of Gaussian
noise(HM-RRN-MoG), the HM-RRN-MoG model achieves the best performance. Our
model possesses the ability to robustly against clouds/fogs/changes. Our method
naturally generates a robust evaluation indicator for RRN that is the no-change
set root mean square error. We apply the HM-RRN-MoG model to the latter
vegetation/water change detection task, which reduces the radiometric contrast
and NDVI/NDWI differences on the no-change set, generates consistent and
comparable results. We utilize the no-change set into the building change
detection task, efficiently reducing the pseudo-change and boosting the
precision.

suitable framework to aid in the solution of Bayesian inference problems, as
they are designed to generate samples from complicated high-dimensional
distributions. By training a GAN to sample from a low-dimensional latent space
and then embedding it in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we can highly
efficiently sample from the posterior, by replacing both the high-dimensional
prior and the expensive forward map. We prove that the proposed methodology
converges to the true posterior in the Wasserstein-1 distance and that sampling
from the latent space is equivalent to sampling in the high-dimensional space
in a weak sense. The method is showcased on two test cases where we perform
both state and parameter estimation simultaneously. The approach is shown to be
up to two orders of magnitude more accurate than alternative approaches while
also being up to two orders of magnitude computationally faster, in multiple
test cases, including the important engineering setting of detecting leaks in
pipelines.

presence of more than two interacting contracts. Existing methods are however
limited to analyze a maximum of two contracts at the same time. Detecting
cross-contract vulnerabilities is highly non-trivial. With multiple interacting

results in disparate discrete spectral distribution. In particular, it could be
more complicated and difficult to obtain the symmetry of scattering data under
the circumstance of double poles. Besides, we also analyse the asymptotic state

algorithm is applied to research the data-driven soliton solutions of the
nonzero nonlocal Hirota equation by using the training data obtained from the
Riemann-Hilbert method. Most strikingly, the integrable nonlocal equation is
firstly solved via PINN algorithm. As we all know, the nonlocal equations
contain the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry $\mathcal{P}:x\rightarrow -x,$ or
$\mathcal{T}:t\rightarrow -t,$ which are different with local ones. Adding the

paper as an alternative to conventional papers which are generally used for
writing and printing purposes. This paper is prepared by casting a
crosslinkable silicone on a porous template, leading to hierarchical random
patterns having dimensions ranging from tens of nanometer to hundreds of
micron. On the resultant rough surface, ink particles of wide ranging sizes and
different surface chemical characteristics adhere via physical forces. Unlike
conventional papers, in which particles get trapped inside the porous network
of the cellulose fibers, here the ink particles remain accessible for cleaning
via gentle shear with a rough and wet substrate. It is possible to write on
this paper by different commercially available pens and to print using
different printers. In almost all cases, the ink particles adhere to the paper
surface strongly enough that they can not be dislodged by gentle shearing, yet
adhesion can be decreased by inserting a liquid between the particles and the
surface. Because of the resultant reversibility in adhesion, the paper remains
usable over 200 cycles. This reusable paper is expected to be a viable
alternative to the conventional papers that we use today.

with a large number of passengers who are different in terms of destinations
and travel preferences. Passengers with similar itineraries can match each
other and share the same vehicle for their potentially different destinations;
and reneging passengers, who become impatient and leave the service system
after waiting long time for shared rides, are considered in our model. We aim
to maximize the long-run average revenue of the ride service vendor, which is
defined as the difference between the long-run average reward earned by
providing ride services and the long-run average penalty incurred by reneging
passengers. The problem is complicated by its scale, the heterogeneity of
passengers, and the reneging behavior. To this end, we formate the
ride-matching problem as a specific Markov decision process and propose a
scalable ride-matching policy, referred to as Bivariate Index (BI) policy. We
demonstrate that the ride-matching problem reduces to a conventional restless
multi-armed bandit problem in a special case, for which the BI policy reduces
to the well-known Whittle index policy that prioritizes passengers with the
highest Whittle indices. For the general case, following the Whittle relaxation
technique, BI prioritizes passengers according to their bivariate indices that
are curves in a real-valued coordinate and are assigned to each passengers. We
prove that the ranking of the bivariate indices can be derived by the ranking
of corresponding Whittle indices in a surrogate system. Through extensive
numerical simulations for systems with real-world travel demands, it is
demonstrated that BI significantly outperforms baseline policies.

remnants they leave behind (black holes and neutron stars), are major open
questions in astrophysics. Many massive stars are stripped of their outer
hydrogen envelopes as they evolve. Such Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars emit strong and
rapidly expanding (v_wind>1000 km/s) winds indicating a high escape velocity
from the stellar surface. A fraction of this population is also helium
depleted, with spectra dominated by highly-ionized emission lines of carbon and
oxygen (Types WC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly-observed
supernova (SN) explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (Types Ib/Ic) cannot
result from massive WC/WO stars, leading some to suggest that most such stars
collapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosions.
Here, we present observations of supernova SN 2019hgp, discovered about a day
after explosion. The short rise time and rapid decline place it among an
emerging population of rapidly-evolving transients (RETs). Spectroscopy reveals
a rich set of emission lines indicating that the explosion occurred within a
nebula composed of carbon, oxygen, and neon. Narrow absorption features show
that this material is expanding at relatively high velocities (>1500 km/s)
requiring a compact progenitor. Our observations are consistent with an
explosion of a massive WC/WO star, and suggest that massive W-R stars may be
the progenitors of some rapidly evolving transients.

simulations. Here, we introduce new quantum algorithms for computing molecular

Under cost models appropriate for noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices we
demonstrate how low rank factorizations and other tomography schemes can be

that our techniques reduce the number of circuit repetitions required by many
orders of magnitude for even modest systems. In the context of fault-tolerant
algorithms, we develop new methods of estimating energy derivatives with
Heisenberg limited scaling incorporating state-of-the-art techniques for block

systematically studied in the form of a comprehensive synthesis map. We,
furthermore, report on a detailed analysis of marcasite single crystal growth
by a space-separated hydrothermal synthesis. We observe that single phase
product of marcasite forms only on the surface under the involvement of H$_2$S

allows us to measure the fundamental physical properties, including an allowed
direct optical bandgap of 0.76 eV, temperature independent diamagnetism, an
electronic transport gap of 0.11 eV, and a room-temperature carrier

humans is in general influenced by the conversational structure, polarity and
topic of the context. We then propose to bring these findings into
computational detection models by introducing and evaluating (a) neural
architectures for contextual toxicity detection that are aware of the
conversational structure, and (b) data augmentation strategies that can help
model contextual toxicity detection. Our results have shown the encouraging
potential of neural architectures that are aware of the conversation structure.
We have also demonstrated that such models can benefit from synthetic data,
especially in the social media domain.

decouples the generation of such features while maintaining good representation

instance-level action pattern from the video-level labels, where a significant
challenge is action-context confusion. To overcome this challenge, one recent
work builds an action-click supervision framework. It requires similar
annotation costs but can steadily improve the localization performance when
compared to the conventional weakly supervised methods. In this paper, by
revealing that the performance bottleneck of the existing approaches mainly
comes from the background errors, we find that a stronger action localizer can
be trained with labels on the background video frames rather than those on the
action frames. To this end, we convert the action-click supervision to the
background-click supervision and develop a novel method, called BackTAL.
Specifically, BackTAL implements two-fold modeling on the background video
frames, i.e. the position modeling and the feature modeling. In position
modeling, we not only conduct supervised learning on the annotated video frames
but also design a score separation module to enlarge the score differences
between the potential action frames and backgrounds. In feature modeling, we
propose an affinity module to measure frame-specific similarities among
neighboring frames and dynamically attend to informative neighbors when
calculating temporal convolution. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are
conducted, which demonstrate the high performance of the established BackTAL
and the rationality of the proposed background-click supervision. Code is
available at https://github.com/VividLe/BackTAL.

Arrhenius activation energies, and transitivity functions for the fission-track

Arrhenius, parallel curvilinear, fanning Arrhenius, and fanning curvilinear

consistent with a single activation energy mechanism and a reaction order model
of order ~ -4. However, the fanning curvilinear model is the one that results
in better fits laboratory data and predictions in better agreement with
geological evidence. Fanning models seem to describe a more complex picture,
with concurrent recombination mechanisms presenting activation energies varying
with time and temperature, and the reaction order model seems not to be the
most appropriate. It is apparent from the transitivity analysis that the

flow characteristics and provide accurate pressure and flux predictions across
the range of idealized and image-based scenarios investigated at a fraction of

superconductivity in the $\eta$-carbide type suboxides Ti$_4$M$_2$O with M =

displays a semimetallic behavior. Hence, the octahedral void-filling oxygen
plays a crucial role for the overall physical properties, even though its
effect on the crystal structure is small. Our results indicate that the design
of new superconductors by incorporation of electron-acceptor atoms may in the
Ti$_2$Ni-type structures and other materials with crystallographic void

executions of a business process deviate, in a negative or positive way, with
respect to {their} expected or desirable outcomes. Deviant executions of a
business process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions
that undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned
with uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing event logs
stored by the systems supporting the execution of a business process. In this
paper, the problem of explaining deviations in business processes is first
investigated by using features based on sequential and declarative patterns,
and a combination of them. Then, the explanations are further improved by
leveraging the data attributes of events and traces in event logs through
features based on pure data attribute values and data-aware declarative rules.
The explanations characterizing the deviances are then extracted by direct and
indirect methods for rule induction. Using real-life logs from multiple
domains, a range of feature types and different forms of decision rules are
evaluated in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between
non-deviant and deviant executions of a process as well as in terms of
understandability of the final outcome returned to the users.

detected. Infrared aperture-synthesis imaging provides us with a unique

intensity distribution of the disk of FS CMa in the mid-infrared L and N bands.
Methods: We performed aperture-synthesis imaging of FS CMa with the MATISSE
instrument (Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) in the low
spectral resolution mode to obtain images in the L and N bands. We computed
radiative transfer models that reproduce the L- and N-band intensity
distributions of the resolved disks. Results: We present L- and N-band
aperture-synthesis images of FS CMa reconstructed in the wavelength bands of
3.4-3.8 and 8.6-9.0 micrometer. In the L-band image, the inner rim region of an
inclined circumstellar disk and the central object can be seen with a spatial
resolution of 2.7 milliarcsec (mas). An inner disk cavity with an angular
diameter of 6x12mas is resolved. The L-band disk consists of a bright
northwestern (NW) disk region and a much fainter southeastern (SE) region. The
images suggest that we are looking at the bright inner wall of the NW disk rim,
which is on the far side of the disk. In the N band, only the bright NW disk
region is seen. In addition to deriving the inclination and the inner disk
radius, fitting the reconstructed brightness distributions via radiative
transfer modeling allows one to constrain the innermost disk structure, in
particular the shape of the inner disk rim.

zinc using two state-of-the-art theories based on quantified nuclear
interactions: the ab-initio coupled cluster theory and nuclear density
functional theory. Both theories reproduce the smooth rise of differential
charge radii and their weak dependence on the atomic number. By considering a
large set of isotopic chains, we show that this trend can be captured by just
two parameters: the slope and curvature of ${\delta\langle r^2_c\rangle(n)}$.
We demonstrate that these parameters show appreciable model dependence, and the
statistical analysis indicates that they are not correlated with any single
model property, i.e., they are impacted by both bulk nuclear properties as well
as shell structure.

decades in which we have witnessed a migration from research laboratories to

about the main vulnerabilities and security threats related to these systems.
Among these threats presentation attacks stand out as some of the most relevant
and studied. Presentation attacks can be defined as presentation of human
characteristics or artifacts directly to the capture device of a biometric
system trying to interfere its normal operation. In the case of the iris, these
attacks include the use of real irises as well as artifacts with different
level of sophistication such as photographs or videos. This chapter introduces
iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) methods that have been developed to
reduce the risk posed by presentation attacks. First, we summarise the most
popular types of attacks including the main challenges to address. Secondly, we
present a taxonomy of Presentation Attack Detection methods as a brief
introduction to this very active research area. Finally, we discuss the
integration of these methods into Iris Recognition Systems according to the
most important scenarios of practical application.

exist for mitigating the effects of selection bias in user ratings on the
evaluation and optimization of RSs. However, these methods treat selection bias
as static, despite the fact that the popularity of an item may change
drastically over time and the fact that user preferences may also change over
time. We focus on the age of an item and its effect on selection bias and user
preferences. Our experimental analysis reveals that the rating behavior of
users on the MovieLens dataset is better captured by methods that consider
effects from the age of item on bias and preferences. We theoretically show
that in a dynamic scenario in which both the selection bias and user
preferences are dynamic, existing debiasing methods are no longer unbiased. To
address this limitation, we introduce DebiAsing in the dyNamiC scEnaRio

debiasing method to account for dynamic selection bias and user preferences.
Our experimental results indicate that DANCER improves rating prediction
performance compared to debiasing methods that incorrectly assume that

DANCER is the first debiasing method that accounts for dynamic selection bias

2) simply ignoring the latent relation between the MS and PAN image and fusing
them directly. To solve these problems, we propose a novel unsupervised network

thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for systems with power-law interactions $\sim

at least for systems with $\alpha\geq 0.6$, which include Coulomb,
monopole-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions. Compared with short-range

(DNNs) capture better feature representations than the previous hand-crafted
feature engineering, which leads to a significant performance improvement. In
this paper, we move a tiny step towards understanding the dynamics of feature
representations over layers. Specifically, we model the process of class
separation of intermediate representations in pre-trained DNNs as the evolution
of communities in dynamic graphs. Then, we introduce modularity, a generic
metric in graph theory, to quantify the evolution of communities. In the
preliminary experiment, we find that modularity roughly tends to increase as
the layer goes deeper and the degradation and plateau arise when the model
complexity is great relative to the dataset. Through an asymptotic analysis, we
prove that modularity can be broadly used for different applications. For
example, modularity provides new insights to quantify the difference between
feature representations. More crucially, we demonstrate that the degradation
and plateau in modularity curves represent redundant layers in DNNs and can be
pruned with minimal impact on performance, which provides theoretical guidance
for layer pruning. Our code is available at

combination of small functions, discrete graphical models (GMs) provide a
powerful framework to analyze stochastic and deterministic systems of

the extremum of this joint function. This is known as the Weighted Constraint
Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) on deterministic Cost Function Networks and as
Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference on stochastic Markov Random Fields.
Algorithms for approximate WCSP inference typically rely on local consistency
algorithms or belief propagation. These methods are intimately related to
linear programming (LP) relaxations and often coupled with reparametrizations
defined by the dual solution of the associated LP. Since the seminal work of
Goemans and Williamson, it is well understood that convex SDP relaxations can
provide superior guarantees to LP. But the inherent computational cost of
interior point methods has limited their application. The situation has
improved with the introduction of non-convex Burer-Monteiro style methods which
are well suited to handle the SDP relaxation of combinatorial problems with
binary variables (such as MAXCUT, MaxSAT or MAP/Ising). We compute low rank SDP
upper and lower bounds for discrete pairwise graphical models with arbitrary
number of values and arbitrary binary cost functions by extending a
Burer-Monteiro style method based on row-by-row updates. We consider a
traditional dualized constraint approach and a dedicated Block Coordinate
Descent approach which avoids introducing large penalty coefficients to the
formulation. On increasingly hard and dense WCSP/CFN instances, we observe that
the BCD approach can outperform the dualized approach and provide tighter

Fe-rich composition, we investigate the effect of randomly inserting additional
Fe into the nominal Ni planes of the perfectly ordered structure. We find that

to the input graph, $d$ the maximum degree, and $k$ is the maximum distance in
the subgraphs considered. Although the iterative algorithm supports values of
$k>1$, it requires nested data structures for the message passing that are
memory-inefficient. Thus, we extended the base summarization algorithm by a
hash-based messaging mechanism to support a scalable iterative computation of
graph summarizations based on $k$-bisimulation for arbitrary $k$. We
empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithms using benchmark and
real-world datasets. The incremental algorithm almost always outperforms the
batch computation. We observe in our experiments that the incremental algorithm
is faster even in cases when $50\%$ of the graph database changes from one
version to the next. The incremental computation requires a three-layered hash
index, which has a low memory overhead of only $8\%$ ($\pm 1\%$). Finally, the
incremental summarization algorithm outperforms the batch algorithm even with
fewer cores. The iterative parallel $k$-bisimulation algorithm computes
summaries on graphs with over $10$M edges within seconds. We show that the
algorithm processes graphs of $100+\,$M edges within a few minutes while having
a moderate memory consumption of $<150$ GB. For the largest BSBM1B dataset with

students desiring to pursue a STEM career. A major challenge with this course
is that there is a large spread in the students' incoming physics preparation,
and this level of preparation is strongly predictive of a students'
performance. The level of incoming preparation is also largely determined by a
student's educational privilege, and so this course can amplify inequities in
K-12 education and provide a barrier to a STEM career for students from
marginalized groups. Here, we present a novel introductory course design to
address such equity challenges in physics 1. We designed the course based on
the concept of deliberate practice to give students targeted, scaffolded, and
repeated opportunities to engage in research-identified practices and decisions
required for effective problem-solving. We used real-world problems, as they
carry less resemblance to physics high school problems, and so even the
students with the best high school physics instruction have little experience
or skill in solving them. The students learned the physics content knowledge
they needed in future courses, particularly in engineering, and their
problem-solving skills improved substantially. Furthermore, the success in the
course was not correlated with incoming physics preparation, in stark contrast
to the outcomes from traditional physics 1 courses. These findings suggest that
we made physics 1 more equitable by employing a deliberate practice approach in
the context of real-world problem-solving.

accelerate derivative pricing quadratically in the target error and we extend
this to a quadratic error scaling advantage in market risk computation. We show
that employing quantum gradient estimation algorithms can deliver a further
quadratic advantage in the number of the associated market sensitivities,
usually called greeks. By numerically simulating the quantum gradient
estimation algorithms on financial derivatives of practical interest, we
demonstrate that not only can we successfully estimate the greeks in the
examples studied, but that the resource requirements can be significantly lower

additional advantage in the computation of financial market risk lowers the
estimated logical clock rate required for financial quantum advantage from
Chakrabarti et al. [Quantum 5, 463 (2021)] by a factor of ~7, from 50MHz to
7MHz, even for a modest number of greeks by industry standards (four).
Moreover, we show that if we have access to enough resources, the quantum
algorithm can be parallelized across 60 QPUs, in which case the logical clock
rate of each device required to achieve the same overall runtime as the serial
execution would be ~100kHz. Throughout this work, we summarize and compare
several different combinations of quantum and classical approaches that could

ceiling recession rate and the alcove opening area evolution are shown to be
given to first order by the critical Rayleigh number. By tracking passive
tracers in the fluid phase, we show that the alcoves are shaped by the

learning method successfully predicts the horizontal velocities for each
convection simulation in terms of the global-correlation-coefficient, which is
often used for evaluating the prediction accuracy of the methods. The coherence
spectrum reveals the strong dependence of the correlation coefficients on the
spatial scales. Although coherence spectra are higher than 0.9 for large-scale
structures, they drastically decrease to less than 0.3 for small-scale
structures wherein the global-correlation-coefficient indicates a high value of
approximately 0.95. We determined that this decrease in the coherence spectrum

and a weakening of its mechanical properties. However, it remains elusive which
aspect is the leading cause of the disease. To investigate this question, we
combined a multiscale model with a patient-geometry in order to simulate the
mechanical response of healthy and pathological corneas under intraocular
pressure. The constitutive behavior of the cornea is described through an
energy function which takes into account the isotropic matrix of the cornea,
the geometric structure of collagen lamellae and the quasi-incompressibility of
the tissue. A micro-sphere description is implemented to take into account the
typical features of the collagen lamellae as obtained experimentally, namely
their orientation, their stiffness and their dispersion, as well as the their
unfolding stretch, at which they start to provide a significant force. A set of
reference parameters is obtained to fit experimental inflation data of the
literature. We show that the most sensitive parameter is the unfolding stretch,
as a small variation of this parameter induces a major change in the corneal
apex displacement. The keratoconus case is then studied by separating the
impact of the geometry and the one of the mechanics. We computed the evolution
of the SimK (a clinical indicator of cornea curvature) and elevation maps: we
were able to reproduce the reported changes of SimK with pressure only by a
mechanical weakening, and not by a change in geomtry. More specifically, the
weakening has to target the lamellae and not the matrix. The mechanical
weakening leads to elevations close to early stage keratoconus, but our model
lacks the remodeling component to couple the change in mechanics with changes

In this paper, we demonstrate a route towards a scaleable source of time-bin
encoded Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and linear cluster states from a
solid-state quantum dot embedded in a nanophotonic crystal waveguide. By
utilizing a self-stabilizing double-pass interferometer, we measure a
spin-photon Bell state with $(67.8\pm0.4)\%$ fidelity and devise steps for
significant further improvements. By employing strict resonant excitation, we
demonstrate a photon indistinguishability of $(95.7\pm0.8)\%$, which is
conducive to fusion of multiple cluster states for scaling up the technology
and producing more general graph states.

represented as networks with a common set of nodes linked by multiple types
(colors) of edges. We report a novel discontinuous phase transition in this
problem. This anomalous transition occurs in networks of three or more layers
without unconnected nodes, $P(0)=0$. Above a critical value of a control
parameter, the removal of a tiny fraction $\Delta$ of nodes or edges triggers a
failure cascade which ends either with the total collapse of the network, or a
return to stability with the system essentially intact. The discontinuity is
not accompanied by any singularity of the giant component, in contrast to the
discontinuous hybrid transition which usually appears in such problems. The
control parameter is the fraction of nodes in each layer with a single
connection, $\Pi=P(1)$. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the collapse time
and relaxation time, above and below the critical point $\Pi_c$, respectively.
In the limit $\Delta\to0$ the total collapse for $\Pi>\Pi_\text{c}$ takes a
time $T \propto 1/(\Pi-\Pi_\text{c})$, while there is an exponential relaxation
below $\Pi_\text{c}$ with a relaxation time $\tau \propto

trained on one source domain do not generalize well to other unseen domains. In
this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem:
training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition
that training data is only available from one source domain, which is common in
medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of
cross-domain medical image segmentation. Under this scenario, domain shifts are
mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple
causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to
synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep
model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a
family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images
using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious
correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness.
These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for
making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these
spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling
the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed
approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation tasks: cross-modality
(CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI
segmentation, and cross-center prostate MRI segmentation. The proposed approach
yields consistent performance gains compared with competitive methods when
tested on unseen domains.

whether it is possible to build a generic MLP-Like architecture on video domain
has not been explored, due to complex spatial-temporal modeling with large
computation burden. To fill this gap, we present an efficient self-attention
free backbone, namely MorphMLP, which flexibly leverages the concise
Fully-Connected (FC) layer for video representation learning. Specifically, a
MorphMLP block consists of two key layers in sequence, i.e., MorphFC_s and
MorphFC_t, for spatial and temporal modeling respectively. MorphFC_s can
effectively capture core semantics in each frame, by progressive token
interaction along both height and width dimensions. Alternatively, MorphFC_t
can adaptively learn long-term dependency over frames, by temporal token
aggregation on each spatial location. With such multi-dimension and multi-scale
factorization, our MorphMLP block can achieve a great accuracy-computation
balance. Finally, we evaluate our MorphMLP on a number of popular video
benchmarks. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art models, MorphMLP
significantly reduces computation but with better accuracy, e.g., MorphMLP-S
only uses 50% GFLOPs of VideoSwin-T but achieves 0.9% top-1 improvement on
Kinetics400, under ImageNet1K pretraining. MorphMLP-B only uses 43% GFLOPs of
MViT-B but achieves 2.4% top-1 improvement on SSV2, even though MorphMLP-B is
pretrained on ImageNet1K while MViT-B is pretrained on Kinetics400. Moreover,
our method adapted to the image domain outperforms previous SOTA MLP-Like

the shift in Fermi energy of 0.5 eV accounting for the charge transfer of
approximately two electrons from each Co ion into the NbS$_2$ layers. However,
we observe significant departures from the 2H-NbS$_2$ rigid band picture:
Entirely unrelated to the 2H-NbS$_2$ electronic structure, a shallow electronic
band is found crossing the Fermi level near the boundary of the first Brillouin
zone of the superstructure imposed by the intercalation. The evolution of the
experimental spectra upon varying the incident photon energy suggests the Co
origin of this band. Second, the Nb bonding band, found deeply submerged below
the Fermi level at the $\Gamma$ point, indicates the interlayer-hybridization
being very much amplified by intercalation, with Co magnetic ions probably
acting as covalent bridges between NbS$_2$ layers. The strong hybridization
between conducting and magnetic degrees of freedom suggests dealing with
strongly correlated electron system where the interlayer coupling plays an
exquisite role.

results based on Monte Carlo simulations, and find that this typically reduces
the significance by roughly $1\,\sigma$ with respect to the na\""ive

oscillations from reactor data. On the other hand, gallium data (dominated by
the BEST result) show more than $5\,\sigma$ of evidence supporting the
sterile-neutrino hypothesis, favoring oscillation parameters in agreement with
constraints from reactor data. This explanation is, however, in significant
tension ($\sim 3\,\sigma$) with solar neutrino experiments. In order to assess
the robustness of the signal for gallium experiments we present a discussion of
the impact of cross-section uncertainties on the results.

useful in many applications. However, most existing signal-based measures are
designed to be applied to single-channel signals. Measures specifically
designed to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often
intrusive - characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal - and
typically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before
making predictions. This paper proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that
computes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector
quantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. VQ-CPC
feature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is
instead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and
output features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting
function parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are
considered in this paper. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are
trained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on
simulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground
truth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural STOI. Results are
presented in terms of correlations and MSE and demonstrate that VQ-CPC features
are able to capture information relevant to modelling SI and outperform all the
considered benchmarks - even when evaluating on data comprising of different
noise field types.

behaviour of the out-of-sample variance, the out-of-sample relative loss, and
of their empirical counterparts in the high-dimensional setting, i.e., when
both ratios $p/n$ and $p/m$ tend to some positive constants as $m\to\infty$ and
$n\to\infty$, where $p$ is the portfolio dimension, while $n$ and $m$ are the
sample sizes from the in-sample and out-of-sample periods, respectively. The
results are obtained for the traditional estimator of the global minimum
variance (GMV) portfolio, for the two shrinkage estimators introduced by
\cite{frahm2010} and \cite{bodnar2018estimation}, and for the equally-weighted
portfolio, which is used as a target portfolio in the specification of the two
considered shrinkage estimators. We show that the behaviour of the empirical
out-of-sample variance may be misleading is many practical situations. On the
other hand, this will never happen with the empirical out-of-sample relative
loss, which seems to provide a natural normalization of the out-of-sample
variance in the high-dimensional setup. As a result, an important question
arises if this risk measure can safely be used in practice for portfolios
constructed from a large asset universe.

finite time simulation. Although system models are typically used for
simulation over a finite time, most of the metrics (and pseudo-metrics) used
for model accuracy assessment consider asymptotic behavior e.g., Hankel
singular values and Kullback-Leibler(KL) rate metric. These metrics could
further be used for model order reduction. Hence, in this paper, we propose a
generalization of KL divergence-based metric called n-step KL rate metric,
which could be used to compare models over a finite time horizon. We then
demonstrate that the asymptotic metrics for comparing dynamical systems may not
accurately assess the model prediction uncertainties over a finite time
horizon. Motivated by this finite time analysis, we propose a new pragmatic
approach to compute the influence of a subset of states on a combination of
states called information transfer (IT). Model reduction typically involves the
removal or truncation of states. IT combines the concepts from the n-step KL

paper aims to develop a robot that balances cost and accuracy by using machine
learning to predict the best obstacle avoidance move based on distance inputs
from four ultrasonic sensors that are strategically mounted on the front,
front-left, front-right, and back of the robot. The underlying hardware
consists of an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi 3B. The machine learning model is
first trained on the data collected by the robot. Then the Arduino continuously
polls the sensors and calculates the distance values, and in case of critical
need for avoidance, a suitable maneuver is made by the Arduino. In other
scenarios, sensor data is sent to the Raspberry Pi using a USB connection and
the machine learning model generates the best move for navigation, which is
sent to the Arduino for driving motors accordingly. The system is mounted on a
2-WD robot chassis and tested in a cluttered indoor setting with most
impressive results.

building trust in various stages of a machine learning pipeline: from cleaning
poor-quality samples and tracking important ones to be collected during data

why certain behaviors of a model emerge during deployment. Specifically,
ModelPred learns a parameterized function that takes a dataset $S$ as the input
and predicts the model obtained by training on $S$. Our work differs from the
recent work of Datamodels [1] as we aim for predicting the trained model
parameters directly instead of the trained model behaviors. We demonstrate that
a neural network-based set function class is capable of learning the complex
relationships between the training data and model parameters. We introduce
novel global and local regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and we
rigorously characterize the expressive power of neural networks (NN) in
approximating the end-to-end training process. Through extensive empirical
investigations, we show that ModelPred enables a variety of applications that
boost the interpretability and accountability of machine learning (ML), such as
data valuation, data selection, memorization quantification, and model

the existence of two local minimizers of $W$ at \textit{different} levels

Archimedean lattices in two dimensions. Each vertex of the lattice is occupied
by a particle, and in each model the patch size and number are monodisperse.
When there are more than one patches on the surface of a particle, they are
symmetrically decorated. As the proportion $\chi$ of the particle surface
covered by the patches increases, the clusters connected by the patches grow
and the system percolates at the threshold $\chi_c$. We combine Monte Carlo
simulations and the critical polynomial method to give precise estimates of
$\chi_c$ for disks with one to six patches and spheres with one to two patches
on the $11$ lattices. For one-patch particles, we find that the order of
$\chi_c$ values for particles on different lattices is the same as that of
threshold values $p_c$ for site percolation on same lattices, which implies
that $\chi_c$ for one-patch particles mainly depends on the geometry of
lattices. For particles with more patches, symmetry become very important in
determining $\chi_c$. With the estimates of $\chi_c$ for disks with one to six
patches, by analyses related to symmetry, we are able to give precise values of
$\chi_c$ for disks with an arbitrary number of patches on all $11$ lattices.
The following rules are found for patchy disks on each of these lattices: (i)
as the number of patches $n$ increases, values of $\chi_c$ repeat in a periodic
way, with the period $n_0$ determined by the symmetry of the lattice; (ii) when
$\mod(n,n_0)=0$, the minimum threshold value $\chi_{\rm min}$ appears, and the
model is equivalent to site percolation with $\chi_{\rm min}=p_c$; (iii) disks

macroscopic photoresponses are clear, it is unclear how large the changes of

small-angle X-ray scattering to measure the thickness of photoswitchable lipid

unexpected dependency of photoswitching upon aqueous phase composition,
highlighting smaller-than-expected photoswitching with deionized water, and

limit variance in the case of Gaussian coefficients and $c_2(\phi)$ is the
coefficient of order $2$ in the decomposition of $\phi$ in the Hermite

in any application that requires domain expertise in order to actually use the
generated images is that there generally is not adequate or automatic means of
assessing the domain-relevant quality of generated images. In this work, we
demonstrate several objective tests of images output by two popular GAN

image features that can be recovered after generation by a trained GAN. Several
of these features are high-order, algorithmic pixel-arrangement rules which are
not readily expressed in covariance matrices. We designed and validated
statistical classifiers to detect specific effects of the known arrangement
rules. We then tested the rates at which two different GANs correctly
reproduced the feature context under a variety of training scenarios, and
degrees of feature-class similarity. We found that ensembles of generated
images can appear largely accurate visually, and show high accuracy in ensemble
measures, while not exhibiting the known spatial arrangements. Furthermore,
GANs trained on a spectrum of distinct spatial orders did not respect the given
prevalence of those orders in the training data. The main conclusion is that
SCMs can be engineered to quantify numerous errors, per image, that may not be
captured in ensemble statistics but plausibly can affect subsequent use of the
GAN-generated images.

lot of plastic waste on the surface of rivers and lakes. The Ganga river is one
of the 10 rivers which account for 90 percent of the plastic that ends up in
the sea and there are major cases of local nalaas and lakes being contaminated
due to this waste. This limits the source of clean water which leads to major
depletion in water sources. From 2001 to 2012, in the city of Hyderabad, 3245
hectares of lakes dissipated. The water recedes by nine feet a year on average
in southern New Delhi. Thus, cleaning of these local water bodies and rivers is
of utmost importance. Our aim is to develop a water surface cleaning bot that
is deployed across the shore. The bot will detect garbage patches on its way
and collect the garbage thus making the water bodies clean. This solution
employs a surveillance mechanism in order to alert the authorities in case
anyone is found polluting the water bodies. A more sustainable system by using
solar energy to power the system has been developed. Computer vision algorithms
are used for detecting trash on the surface of the water. This trash is
collected by the bot and is disposed of at a designated location. In addition
to cleaning the water bodies, preventive measures have been also implemented
with the help of a virtual fencing algorithm that alerts the authorities if
anyone tries to pollute the water premises. A web application and a mobile app
is deployed to keep a check on the movement of the bot and shore surveillance

learning. This is primarily due to effective token mixing through self
attention. However, this scales quadratically with the number of pixels, which
becomes infeasible for high-resolution inputs. To cope with this challenge, we
propose Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) as an efficient token mixer
that learns to mix in the Fourier domain. AFNO is based on a principled
foundation of operator learning which allows us to frame token mixing as a
continuous global convolution without any dependence on the input resolution.
This principle was previously used to design FNO, which solves global
convolution efficiently in the Fourier domain and has shown promise in learning
challenging PDEs. To handle challenges in visual representation learning such
as discontinuities in images and high resolution inputs, we propose principled
architectural modifications to FNO which results in memory and computational
efficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel
mixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the
frequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. The resulting model is
highly parallel with a quasi-linear complexity and has linear memory in the
sequence size. AFNO outperforms self-attention mechanisms for few-shot
segmentation in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. For Cityscapes
segmentation with the Segformer-B3 backbone, AFNO can handle a sequence size of
65k and outperforms other efficient self-attention mechanisms.

for in-person interaction. Modelled on social interaction with Twitter customer
support accounts, transformer-based chatbot models are initially assigned to
learn one domain from an initial random weight distribution. Given shared
vocabulary, each model is then tasked with learning another domain by
transferring knowledge from the previous. Following studies on 19 different

The chatbots are finally implemented on Temi and Pepper robots, with

such analysis namely: i) Discovery of differentiating patterns exhibited by

the discovery phase, an array of approaches in the anomalous pattern detection
literature have been employed to reveal differentiating patterns, especially to
identify anomalous subgroups. However, these techniques are limited to
describing the anomalous subgroups and offer little in form of insightful
characterization, thereby limiting interpretability and understanding of these

an approach to perform post-discovery analysis of anomalous subsets, in which

oscillating up and down without volume change, situated at the center of an
elastic material spherical shell, which in turn is situated inside an infinite
(possible different) elastic medium. The solution is based on symmetry
considerations and the continuity of the displacement both at the core and the
shell - outer medium boundaries as well as the continuity of the stress at the
outer edge of the shell. Furthermore, a separation into longitudinal and
transverse waves is used. Analysis of the solution shows that a surprisingly
complex range of physical phenomena can be observed when the frequency is
changed while keeping the material parameters the same, especially when
compared to the case of a core without any shell. With a careful choice of
materials, shell thickness and vibration frequency, it is possible to filter
out most of the longitudinal waves and generate pure tangential waves in the
infinite domain (and vice-versa, we can filter out the tangential waves and
generate longitudinal waves). When the solution is applied to different
frequencies and with the help of a fast Fourier transform (FFT), a pulsed
vibration is shown to exhibit the separation of the longitudinal (L) and
transverse (T) waves (often called P- and S-waves in earthquake terminology).

  Segmentation in Urban Scenes",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly segmentation is a crucial task for safety-critical applications, such
as autonomous driving in urban scenes, where the goal is to detect
out-of-distribution (OOD) objects with categories which are unseen during
training. The core challenge of this task is how to distinguish hard
in-distribution samples from OOD samples, which has not been explicitly
discussed yet. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple approach named
Consensus Synergizes with Memory (CosMe) to address this challenge, inspired by
the psychology finding that groups perform better than individuals on memory
tasks. The main idea is 1) building a memory bank which consists of seen
prototypes extracted from multiple layers of the pre-trained segmentation model
and 2) training an auxiliary model that mimics the behavior of the pre-trained
model, and then measuring the consensus of their mid-level features as
complementary cues that synergize with the memory bank. CosMe is good at
distinguishing between hard in-distribution examples and OOD samples.
Experimental results on several urban scene anomaly segmentation datasets show
that CosMe outperforms previous approaches by large margins.

graph-structured data and computing node-level representations via aggregation
of information from the neighborhood of each node. However, this aggregation
implies an increased risk of revealing sensitive information, as a node can
participate in the inference for multiple nodes. This implies that standard
privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, such as differentially private
stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) - which are designed for situations where
each data point participates in the inference for one point only - either do
not apply, or lead to inaccurate models. In this work, we formally define the
problem of learning GNN parameters with node-level privacy, and provide an
algorithmic solution with a strong differential privacy guarantee. We employ a
careful sensitivity analysis and provide a non-trivial extension of the
privacy-by-amplification technique to the GNN setting. An empirical evaluation
on standard benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method is indeed able to
learn accurate privacy-preserving GNNs which outperform both private and
non-private methods that completely ignore graph information.

layer, which is widely used in Transformer-based models, is redundant for the
model performance. Attention, in its original formulation, has to be seen
rather as a human-level tool to explore and/or visualize relevancy scores in
sequential data. However, the way how it is constructed leads to significant
computational complexity. Instead, we present SimpleTRON: Simple Transformer
with O(N) Complexity, a simple and fast alternative without any approximation
that, unlike other approximation models, does not have any architecture-related
overhead and therefore can be seen as a purely linear Transformer-like model.
This architecture, to the best of our knowledge, outperforms existing
sub-quadratic attention approximation models on several tasks from the
Long-Range Arena benchmark. Moreover, we show, that SimpleTRON can benefit from
weight transfer from pretrained large language models, as its parameters can be
fully transferable.

various modalities has resulted in efficient fake news detection. At present,
there is an abundance of surveys consolidating textual fake news detection
algorithms. This review primarily deals with multi-modal fake news detection

Together with liquid derivatives markets, this poses a unique opportunity to
study risk management, especially the hedging of options, in a turbulent
market. We study the hedge behaviour and effectiveness for the class of affine
jump diffusion models and infinite activity Levy processes. First, market data
is calibrated to stochastic volatility inspired (SVI)-implied volatility
surfaces to price options. To cover a wide range of market dynamics, we
generate Monte Carlo price paths using an SVCJ model (stochastic volatility
with correlated jumps), a close-to-actual-market GARCH-filtered kernel density
estimation as well as a historical backtest. In all three settings, options are
dynamically hedged with Delta, Delta-Gamma, Delta-Vega and Minimum Variance
strategies. Including a wide range of market models allows to understand the
trade-off in the hedge performance between complete, but overly parsimonious
models, and more complex, but incomplete models. The calibration results reveal
a strong indication for stochastic volatility, low jump frequency and evidence
of infinite activity. Short-dated options are less sensitive to volatility or
Gamma hedges. For longer-dated options, tail risk is consistently reduced by
multiple-instrument hedges, in particular by employing complete market models
with stochastic volatility.

that describe the electromagnetic field outside the relativistic uniform system
in the form of a charged sphere rotating at a constant speed. For the near,
middle and far zones the corresponding expressions are found for the scalar and
vector potentials, as well as for the electric and magnetic fields. Then these
expressions are assessed for correspondence to the Laplace equations for
potentials and fields. One of the purposes is to test the truth of the
assumption that the scalar potential and the electric field depend neither on
the value of the angular velocity of rotation of the sphere nor on the
direction to the point where the field is measured. However, calculations show
that potentials and fields increase as the observation point gets closer to the
sphere's equator and to the sphere's surface, compared with the case for a
stationary sphere. In this case, additions are proportional to the square of
the angular velocity of rotation, the square of the sphere's radius and
inversely proportional to the square of the speed of light. The largest found
relative increase in potentials and fields could reach the value of 4% for the
rapidly rotating neutron star PSR J1614-2230, if the star were charged. For a
proton, a similar increase in fields on its surface near the equator reaches
54%.
