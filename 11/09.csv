consuming vast amounts of data, it is essential for businesses to digitally
transform and be equipped to derive the most value out of data. Data analytics
techniques can be used to augment strategic decision-making. While this overall
objective of data analytics remains fairly constant, the data itself can be
available in numerous forms and can be categorized under various contexts. In
this paper, we aim to research terms such as 'small' and 'big' data, understand
their attributes, and look at ways in which they can add value. Specifically,
the paper probes into the question ""If we didn't solve small data in the past,
how can we solve Big Data today?"". Based on the research, it can be inferred
that, regardless of how small data might have been used, organizations can
still leverage big data with the right technology and business vision.

in $ G $ (so $ |V /_{\le_G}| \le |V| $ and $ |E /_{\le_G}| \le |E| $) and $ q $
is the width of the maximum co-lex relation on $ G $.
  Our results have relevant applications in automata theory. First, we can
build a succinct data structure to decide whether a string is accepted by a
given automaton. Second, starting from an automaton $ \mathcal{A} $, one can
define a relation $ \preceq_\mathcal{A} $ and a quotient automaton that capture
the nondeterminism of $ \mathcal{A} $, improving the results in [SODA 2021].

developed to account for this asymmetry issue: the Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm

paradigm does not require a specification of costs. Most previous works on the
NP paradigm focused on the binary case. In this work, we study the multi-class
NP problem by connecting it to the CS problem and propose two algorithms. We
extend the NP oracle inequalities and consistency from the binary case to the
multi-class case, showing that our two algorithms enjoy these properties under
certain conditions. The simulation and real data studies demonstrate the

segregation to minimize the GB energy is a commonly observed phenomenon. In
this paper, a deposition process to obtain pure tilt GBs in titanium (Ti) thin
films is presented. By increasing the power density, a transition from
polycrystalline film growth to a maze bicrystalline Ti film on SrTiO$_3$ (001)
substrate is triggered. All the GBs in the bicrystalline thin film are
characterized to be $\Sigma$13 [0001] coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries.
The GB planes are seen to distinctly facet into symmetric {$\bar{7}520$} and
asymmetric {$10\bar{1}0$} // {$11\bar{2}0$} segments of 20-50~nm length.
Additionally, EDS reveals preferential segregation of iron (Fe) in every
alternate symmetric {$\bar{7}520$} segment. Both the faceting and the
segregation are explained by a difference in the CSL density between the facet
planes. Furthermore, in the GB plane containing Fe segregation, atom probe
tomography is used to experimentally determine the GB excess solute to be
1.25~atoms/nm$^{2}$. In summary, the study reveals for the first time a
methodology to obtain bicrystalline Ti thin films with strong faceting and
anisotropy in iron (Fe) segregation behaviour within the same family of planes.

to three approaches: image processing, artificial intelligence, and combined

methods to determine the porosity from 3D uCT and MRI images: an image
processing method with Image Resolution Optimized Gaussian Algorithm (IROGA);
advanced image recognition method enabled by Machine Learning Difference of
Gaussian Random Forest (MLDGRF). We have built reference 3D micro models and
collected images for calibration of IROGA and MLDGRF methods. To evaluate the
predictive capability of these calibrated approaches, we ran them on 3D uCT and
MRI images of natural heterogeneous carbonate rock. We measured the porosity
and lithology of the carbonate rock using three and two industry-standard ways,
respectively, as reference values. Notably, IROGA and MLDGRF have produced
porosity results with an accuracy of 96.2% and 97.1% on the training set and
91.7% and 94.4% on blind test validation, respectively, in comparison with the

increased by using fully learned filterbanks with short windows. On the other
hand it is widely known that, for conventional beamforming techniques,
performance increases with long analysis windows. This applies also to most
hybrid neural beamforming methods which rely on a deep neural network (DNN) to
estimate the spatial covariance matrices. In this work we try to bridge the gap
between these two worlds and explore fully end-to-end hybrid neural beamforming
in which, instead of using the Short-Time-Fourier Transform, also the analysis
and synthesis filterbanks are learnt jointly with the DNN. In detail, we
explore two different types of learned filterbanks: fully learned and analytic.
We perform a detailed analysis using the recent Clarity Challenge data and show
that by using learnt filterbanks it is possible to surpass oracle-mask based
beamforming for short windows.

However, due to the complexity of system dynamics, it is challenging and
time-consuming to apply these methods directly to non-control-affine systems,
which cover a large group of dynamic systems, such as UAVs and systems with
data-driven Neural Network Dynamic Models (NNDMs). Although all dynamic systems
can be written in control-affine forms through dynamic extension, it remains
unclear how to optimally design a computationally efficient algorithm to safely
control the extended system. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing
an optimal approach to synthesize safe control for the extended system under
the framework of energy-function-based safe control. The proposed method first
extends the energy function and then performs hyperparameter optimization to
maximize performance while guaranteeing safety. It has been theoretically
proved that our method guarantees safety (forward invariance of the safe set)
and performance (bounded tracking error and smoother trajectories). It has been
numerically validated that the proposed method is computationally efficient for
non-control-affine systems.

numerically evaluating a discretized PDE-based model. The degrees of freedom of
such a model can be partitioned in free and prescribed sets to define the
boundary conditions. A multi-partition problem involves multiple partitions of
the same discretization, typically corresponding to different loading
scenarios. As a result, solving multi-partition problems involves multiple
factorization/preconditionings of the system matrix, requiring a high
computational effort. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to efficiently
calculate the responses and accompanying design sensitivities in such
multi-partition problems using static condensation for use in gradient-based
topology optimization. A main problem class that benefits from the proposed

complexity analysis to estimate computational advantages for both direct and

neutron-star mass is fixed to be $1.35M_\odot$. We find that after the tidal

together with the formation of a massive accretion disk. Subsequently, the
magnetic field in the disk is amplified by the magnetic winding and
magnetorotational instability, establishing a turbulent state and inducing the
angular momentum transport. The post-merger mass ejection by the
magnetically-induced viscous effect sets in at $\sim 300$-500\,ms after the

10^{51.5}\,{\rm erg/s}$, and continues for several hundreds ms. A magnetosphere
near the rotational axis of the black hole is developed after the matter and
magnetic flux fall into the black hole from the accretion disk, and
high-intensity Poynting flux generation sets in at a few hundreds ms after the
tidal disruption. The intensity of the Poynting flux becomes low after the

wavelengths $\lambda$ (denoting the periodicity of the charge inhomogeneity)
and character (bond- or site-centered) are stabilized for sufficiently large
values of the electron-electron interaction $U/t$. The general trend is that
$\lambda$ increases going from negative to positive values of $t^\prime/t$ and
decreases by increasing $U/t$. In particular, the $\lambda=8$ stripe obtained

to passive cooling, which brings a system to its ground state, is based on
feedback to stabilise the system actively around a target state. This
alternative, if realised, offers additional control capabilities for the design

stabilising the collective state of an ensemble from an infinite-temperature

of the major threats to the DNN privacy is model extraction attacks where
adversaries attempt to steal sensitive information in DNN models. Recent
studies show hardware-based side channel attacks can reveal internal knowledge
about DNN models (e.g., model architectures) However, to date, existing attacks
cannot extract detailed model parameters (e.g., weights/biases). In this work,
for the first time, we propose an advanced model extraction attack framework
DeepSteal that effectively steals DNN weights with the aid of memory
side-channel attack. Our proposed DeepSteal comprises two key stages. Firstly,
we develop a new weight bit information extraction method, called HammerLeak,
through adopting the rowhammer based hardware fault technique as the
information leakage vector. HammerLeak leverages several novel system-level
techniques tailed for DNN applications to enable fast and efficient weight
stealing. Secondly, we propose a novel substitute model training algorithm with
Mean Clustering weight penalty, which leverages the partial leaked bit
information effectively and generates a substitute prototype of the target

popular image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100/GTSRB) and four DNN architectures
(e.g., ResNet-18/34/Wide-ResNet/VGG-11). The extracted substitute model has
successfully achieved more than 90 % test accuracy on deep residual networks

sirens will be able to provide a completely independent measurement. Dark
sirens (binary black hole or neutron star mergers with no electromagnetic
counterparts) can be informative if the missing redshift information is
provided through the use of galaxy catalogues to identify potential host
galaxies of the merger. However, galaxy catalogue incompleteness affects this
analysis, and accurate modelling of it is essential for obtaining an unbiased
measurement of $H_0$. Previously this has been done by assuming uniform
completeness within the sky area of a gravitational wave event. This paper
presents an updated methodology in which the completeness of the galaxy
catalogue is estimated in a directionally-dependent matter, by pixelating the
sky and computing the completeness of the galaxy catalogue along each line of
sight. The $H_0$ inference for a single event is carried out on a
pixel-by-pixel basis, and the pixels are combined for the final result. A
reanalysis of the events in the first gravitational wave transient catalogue

throughout time (i.e., longitudinal studies) for the fundamental task of
frequency estimation under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) guarantees.
Contrary to frequency estimation of a single attribute, the multidimensional
aspect demands particular attention to the privacy budget. Besides, when
collecting user statistics longitudinally, privacy progressively degrades.
Indeed, the ""multiple"" settings in combination (i.e., many attributes and
several collections throughout time) impose several challenges, for which this
paper proposes the first solution for frequency estimates under LDP. To tackle
these issues, we extend the analysis of three state-of-the-art LDP protocols
(Generalized Randomized Response -- GRR, Optimized Unary Encoding -- OUE, and
Symmetric Unary Encoding -- SUE) for both longitudinal and multidimensional
data collections. While the known literature uses OUE and SUE for two rounds of
sanitization (a.k.a. memoization), i.e., L-OUE and L-SUE, respectively, we
analytically and experimentally show that starting with OUE and then with SUE
provides higher data utility (i.e., L-OSUE). Also, for attributes with small
domain sizes, we propose Longitudinal GRR (L-GRR), which provides higher
utility than the other protocols based on unary encoding. Last, we also propose
a new solution named Adaptive LDP for LOngitudinal and Multidimensional
FREquency Estimates (ALLOMFREE), which randomly samples a single attribute to
be sent with the whole privacy budget and adaptively selects the optimal
protocol, i.e., either L-GRR or L-OSUE. As shown in the results, ALLOMFREE
consistently and considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art L-SUE and L-OUE
protocols in the quality of the frequency estimates.

nevertheless experienced a certain degree of metamorphism after their formation
in the early solar system. Maximum temperatures of metamorphism depend mainly
on formation time and the abundance of the main heating source, which is
short-lived 26Al. Enstatite chondrites formed under reducing conditions and
include many strongly metamorphosed members of petrologic type 6. We model the
thermal evolution of the parent body of the low metal enstatite chondrite class
(EL). The model takes into account accretion, heating, sintering and compaction
by hot pressing of the initially porous material, temperature dependent heat
conductivity, and insulation effects by the remaining regolith layer. Key
parameters of the parent body (formation time, radius, and porosity) are
estimated by fitting thermal histories of EL6 chondrites (LON 94100,
Neuschwanstein, Khairpur, Blithfield, Daniel's Kuil), constrained mainly by
I-Xe and Ar-Ar ages and their respective closure temperatures. Viable fits are
obtained for parent bodies with 120 -- 210 km radius, formed c. 1.8 -- 2.1 Ma
after Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), and an initial porosity of 30%, relatively
independent on initial disk temperatures. Thermal histories of the different
EL6 chondrites are indistinguishable and so are their burial depths. While the
exact layering depth is somewhat model dependent (c. 12--20 km), the thickness
of the layer from which all five EL6 chondrites stem is < 1 km. Hence, an
origin from a quite small asteroidal fragment is possible, particular as most
excavation ages inferred from cosmic ray exposure data are compatible with a
separation as meter sized meteoroids from a small Apollo asteroid 33 Ma ago.

Facility (NIF) to compress deuterium and tritium (DT) fuel to densities and
temperatures sufficient to achieve fusion and energy gain. The primary approach
being investigated is indirect drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where a
high-Z radiation cavity (a hohlraum) is heated by lasers, converting the
incident energy into x-ray radiation which in turn drives the DT fuel filled
capsule causing it to implode. Previous experiments reported DT fuel gain
exceeding unity [O.A. Hurricane et al., Nature 506, 343 (2014)] and then
exceeding the kinetic energy of the imploding fuel [S. Le Pape et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 120, 245003 (2018)]. We report on recent experiments that have
achieved record fusion neutron yields on NIF, greater than 100 kJ with
momentary fusion powers exceeding 1PW, and have for the first time entered the
burning plasma regime where fusion alpha-heating of the fuel exceeds the energy
delivered to the fuel via compression. This was accomplished by increasing the
size of the high-density carbon (HDC) capsule, increasing energy coupling,
while controlling symmetry and implosion design parameters. Two tactics were
successful in controlling the radiation flux symmetry and therefore the
implosion symmetry: transferring energy between laser cones via plasma waves,
and changing the shape of the hohlraum. In conducting these experiments, we
controlled for known sources of degradation. Herein we show how these
experiments were performed to produce record performance, and demonstrate the
data fidelity leading us to conclude that these shots have entered the burning
plasma regime.

characterize precisely conditions on the information exchange that guarantee
privacy-preservation for a specific node. The protocol also provides a
criterion that allows the nodes to determine, in a distributed manner (while
running the enhanced gossip protocol), when to terminate their operation

  migration: revisiting the eccentricity distribution of hot Jupiters","18 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac5627",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  High-eccentricity tidal migration is a potential formation channel for hot
Jupiters. During this process, the planetary f-mode may experience a phase of
diffusive growth, allowing its energy to quickly build up to large values. In
Yu et al. (2021, ApJ, 917, 31), we demonstrated that nonlinear mode
interactions between a parent f-mode and daughter f- and p-modes expand the
parameter space over which the diffusive growth of the parent is triggered. We
extend that study by incorporating (1) the angular momentum transfer between
the orbit and the mode, and consequently the evolution of the pericenter
distance, (2) a phenomenological correction to the nonlinear frequency shift at
high parent mode energies, and (3) dissipation of the parent's energy due to
both turbulent convective damping of the daughter modes and strongly nonlinear
wave-breaking events. The new ingredients allow us to follow the coupled
evolution of the mode and orbit over $\gtrsim 10^4$ years, covering the
diffusive evolution from its onset to its termination. We find that the
semi-major axis shrinks by a factor of nearly ten over $10^4$ years,
corresponding to a tidal quality factor $\mathcal{Q}\sim10$. The f-mode's
diffusive growth terminates while the eccentricity is still high, at around
e=0.8-0.95. Using these results, we revisit the eccentricity distribution of
proto-hot Jupiters. We estimate that less than 1 proto-HJ with eccentricity
>0.9 should be expected in Kepler's data once the diffusive regime is accounted
for, explaining the observed paucity of this population.

Specifically, we first derive the equations of motion (EOM) of the race car and
simplify them to a convex form. Second, we leverage convex models of the
electric motors (EMs) and battery, and frame the time-optimal final-drives
design and EMs control problem in space domain. The resulting optimization
problem is fully convex and can be efficiently solved with global optimality
guarantees using second-order conic programming algorithms. Finally, we
validate our modeling assumptions via the original non-convex EOM, and simulate
our framework on the Formula Student Netherlands endurance race track. Thereby,
we compare a torque vectoring with a fixed power split configuration, showing
that via torque vectoring we can make a better use of the individual tyre grip,
and significantly improve the achievable lap time by more than 4%. Finally, we
present a design study investigating the respective impact of the front and
rear EM size on lap time, revealing that the rear motor sizing is predominant

counterstreaming of supersonic plasma flows, is known for its ability to
convert the free energy associated with anisotropic momentum distributions into
kinetic-scale magnetic fields. The saturation of this instability has been
extensively studied in symmetric configurations where the interpenetrating
plasmas share the same properties (velocity, density, temperature). In many
physical settings, however, the most common configuration is that of asymmetric
plasma flows. For instance, the precursor of relativistic collisionless shock
waves involves a hot, dilute beam of accelerated particles reflected at the
shock front and a cold, dense inflowing background plasma. To determine the
appropriate criterion for saturation in this case, we have performed
large-scale 2D particle-in-cell simulations of counterstreaming
electron-positron pair and electron-ion plasmas. We show that, in
interpenetrating pair plasmas, the relevant criterion is that of magnetic
trapping as applied to the component (beam or plasma) that carries the larger
inertia of the two; namely, the instability growth suddenly slows down once the
quiver frequency of those particles equals or exceeds the instability growth
rate. We present theoretical approximations for the saturation level. These
findings remain valid for electron-ion plasmas provided that electrons and ions
are close to equipartition in the plasma flow of larger inertia. Our results
can be directly applied to the physics of relativistic, weakly magnetized shock
waves, but they can also be generalized to other cases of study.

important challenges in steganography. In this paper, a new block steganography
model is presented using the bargain method so that a competitive model is
introduced. In this game, the blocks are the same players. The bargain is
provided with the aim of embedding information without reducing capacity as
well as increasing security. The proposed model shows that it can be used both
of the special domain and the transform domain, which are two important methods
of steganography. For this purpose, an example of a special domain model is
introduced in which, In the first step, the image is divided into $n \times n$
blocks, and in the second step using the graph coloring algorithm, pixels are
considered to embed confidential information in each block. In the third step,
regarding the bargaining method in game theory, each block plays the role of a
player, that the competition between players is based on the defined goal
function, and in the best blocks in terms of two criteria of capacity and
security, which here means each block has a higher security-to-capacity ratio,
so it has a higher priority, which is determined based on the bargaining model.
Also, information embedded in LSB two bits. An example of a conversion domain
method is also shows that security increases without decreasing in capacity.
The conclusion is evaluated by three criteria: PSNR, histogram, and
$\epsilon-secure$ also, 2000 standard images were evaluated and observed that
the proposed method improves the block methods of embedding information.

undergo quantum interference which converts their types, or flavours.
High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, first observed by the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory, are known to propagate unperturbed over a billion light years in
vacuum. These neutrinos act as the largest quantum interferometer and are
sensitive to the smallest effects in vacuum due to new physics. Quantum gravity
(QG) aims to describe gravity in a quantum mechanical framework, unifying
matter, forces and space-time. QG effects are expected to appear at the
ultra-high-energy scale known as the Planck energy, $E_{P}\equiv 1.22\times
10^{19}$~giga-electronvolts (GeV). Such a high-energy universe would have
existed only right after the Big Bang and it is inaccessible by human
technologies. On the other hand, it is speculated that the effects of QG may
exist in our low-energy vacuum, but are suppressed by the Planck energy as
$E_{P}^{-1}$ ($\sim 10^{-19}$~GeV$^{-1}$), $E_{P}^{-2}$ ($\sim
10^{-38}$~GeV$^{-2}$), or its higher powers. The coupling of particles to these
effects is too small to measure in kinematic observables, but the phase shift
of neutrino waves could cause observable flavour conversions. Here, we report
the first result of neutrino interferometry~\cite{Aartsen:2017ibm} using
astrophysical neutrino flavours to search for new space-time structure. We did
not find any evidence of anomalous flavour conversion in IceCube astrophysical
neutrino flavour data. We place the most stringent limits of any known
technologies, down to $10^{-42}$~GeV$^{-2}$, on the dimension-six operators
that parameterize the space-time defects for preferred astrophysical production
scenarios. For the first time, we unambiguously reach the signal region of
quantum-gravity-motivated physics.

For instance in developing animal embryos, effective phase separation
descriptions have been used to account for the spatial organization of
different tissue types. Similarly, separation of different tissue types and the
emergence of a polar organization is also observed in cell aggregates mimicking
early embryonic axis formation. Here, we describe such aggregates as deformable
two-phase fluid droplets, which are suspended in a fluid environment (third
phase). Using hybrid finite-volume Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we
numerically explore the out-of-equilibrium routes that can lead to the polar
equilibrium state of such a droplet (Janus droplet). We focus on the interplay
between spinodal decomposition and advection with hydrodynamic flows driven by
interface tensions, which we characterize by a Peclet number $Pe$. Consistent
with previous work, for large $Pe$ the coarsening process is generally
accelerated. However, for intermediate $Pe$ we observe long-lived, strongly
elongated droplets, where both phases form an alternating stripe pattern. We
show that these ``croissant'' states are close to mechanical equilibrium and
coarsen only slowly through diffusive fluxes in an Ostwald-ripening-like
process. Finally, we show that a surface tension asymmetry between both droplet
phases leads to transient, rotationally symmetric states whose resolution leads
to flows reminiscent of Marangoni flows. Our work highlights the importance of
advection for the phase separation process in finite, deformable systems.

fitness advantage, as all tissue gets enough supply to survive while waste is
minimized. How do animals build such a uniform perfusing flow system? We
propose a local adaptation rule for the vessel radii that is able to equalize
perfusion, while minimizing energy dissipation to circulate the flow and the
material cost. The rule is a combination of different objective cost functions

optical data in order to locate the optical counterparts and determine their

constructed in terms of the first-degree prime ideals of $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$
and $\mathbb{Z}[\beta]$, and vice-versa. We also classify the cases in which
this correspondence does not hold, by providing explicit counterexamples. We
show that for every pair of coprime integers $d,e \in \mathbb{Z}$, such a
correspondence almost always respects the divisibility of principal ideals of
the form $(e+d\theta)\mathbb{Z}[\theta]$, with a few exceptions that we
characterize. Finally, we discuss the computational improvement of such an
approach, and we verify the reduction in time needed for computing such primes
for certain concrete cases.

cyber-physical systems (CPS) like self-driving cars (SDC) because they are more
efficient and less dangerous than field operational tests. Despite this,
thoroughly testing SDCs in simulated environments remains challenging because
SDCs must be tested in a sheer amount of long-running test scenarios. Past
results on software testing optimization have shown that not all the tests
contribute equally to establishing confidence in test subjects' quality and
reliability, with some \uninformative"" tests that can be skipped (or removed)
to reduce testing effort. However, this problem was partially addressed in the
context of SDC simulation platforms. In this paper, we investigate test
selection strategies to increase the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based
testing in the context of SDCs. We propose an approach called SDC-Scissor (SDC
coSt-effeCtIve teSt SelectOR), which leverages machine learning (ML) strategies
to identify and skip tests that are unlikely to detect faults in SDCs before
executing them. Specifically, SDC-Scissor extract features concerning the
characteristics of the test scenarios being executed in the simulation
environment and via ML strategies predict tests that lead to faults before
executing them. Our evaluation shows that SDC-Scissor achieved high
classification accuracy (up to 93.4%) in classifying tests leading to a fault
which allows improving testing cost-effectiveness: SDC-Scissor was able to
reduce (ca. 170%) the time spent in running irrelevant tests as well as
identified 33% more failure triggering tests compared to a randomized baseline.
Interestingly, SDC-Scissor does not introduce significant computational
overhead in the SDCs testing process, which is critical to SDC development in
industrial settings.

unwanted interactions between qubits (so-called parasitic gates) can be
particularly problematic and degrade the performance of quantum applications.
In this work, we present two software methods to mitigate parasitic two-qubit
gate errors. The first approach is built upon the KAK decomposition and keeps
the original unitary decomposition for the error-free native two-qubit gate. It
counteracts a parasitic two-qubit gate by only applying single-qubit rotations
and therefore has no two-qubit gate overhead. We show the optimal choice of
single-qubit mitigation gates. The second approach applies a numerical
optimisation algorithm to re-compile a target unitary into the error-parasitic
two-qubit gate plus single-qubit gates. We demonstrate these approaches on the
CPhase-parasitic iSWAP-like gates. The KAK-based approach helps decrease
unitary infidelity by a factor of 3 compared to the noisy implementation
without error mitigation. When arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed,
recompilation could completely mitigate the effect of parasitic errors but may
require more native gates than the KAK-based approach. We also compare their
average gate fidelity under realistic noise models, including relaxation and
depolarising errors. Numerical results suggest that different approaches are
advantageous in different error regimes, providing error mitigation guidance
for near-term quantum computers.

operations, rather than any specific connection pattern in typical search

irrelevant. This intuition is orthogonal to any specific search strategy and
can be applied to a diverse set of NAS algorithms. Through extensive validation
on 4 data-sets and 4 NAS techniques (Bayesian optimisation, differentiable
search, local search and random search), we show that the operation
distribution (1) holds enough discriminating power to reliably identify a
solution and (2) is significantly easier to optimise than traditional
encodings, leading to large speed-ups at little to no cost in performance.
Indeed, this simple intuition significantly reduces the cost of current
approaches and potentially enable NAS to be used in a broader range of

dielectric spacers whose thickness can influence both the photonic, electronic,

protection of the active layers in the heterostructure. For these critical
roles, hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) is the dominant choice due to its large
bandgap, atomic flatness, low defect density, and encapsulation properties.
However, the broad catalogue of 2D insulators offers exciting opportunities to
replace hBN in certain applications that require transparent thin layers with
additional optical degrees of freedom. Here we investigate the potential of
single-crystalline Molybdenum Oxide (MoO$_3$) as an alternative 2D insulator
for the design of nanodevices that require precise adjustment of the light
polarization at the nanometer scale. First, we measure the wavelength-dependent
refractive indices of MoO$_3$ along its three main crystal axes and determine
the in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy of its optical properties. We find the
birefringence in MoO$_3$ nanosheets compares favorably with other 2D materials
that exhibit strong birefringence, such as black phosphorus, ReS$_2$, or
ReSe$_2$, in particular in the visible spectral range where MoO$_3$ has the
unique advantage of transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of
MoO$_3$ for dielectric encapsulation by reporting linewidth narrowing and
reduced inhomogeneous broadening of 2D excitons and optically active quantum
emitters, respectively, in a prototypical monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenide semiconductor. These results show the potential of MoO$_3$ as a

{\gamma}-ray-initiated showers in the atmosphere changes as the telescopes age

reconstructed energies of the events and {\gamma}-ray fluxes. Aims. This work
discusses the implementation of signal calibration methods for the Very
Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to account for
changes in the optical throughput and detector performance over time. Methods.
The total throughput of a Cherenkov telescope is the product of
camera-dependent factors, such as the photomultiplier tube gains and their
quantum efficiencies, and the mirror reflectivity and Winston cone response to
incoming radiation. This document summarizes different methods to determine how
the camera gains and mirror reflectivity have evolved over time and how we can
calibrate this changing throughput in reconstruction pipelines for imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The implementation is validated against seven
years of observations with the VERITAS telescopes of the Crab Nebula, which is
a reference object in very-high-energy astronomy. Results. Regular optical
throughput monitoring and the corresponding signal calibrations are found to be
critical for the reconstruction of extensive air shower images. The proposed
implementation is applied as a correction to the signals of the photomultiplier
tubes in the telescope simulation to produce fine-tuned instrument response
functions. This method is shown to be effective for calibrating the acquired
{\gamma}-ray data and for recovering the correct energy of the events and
photon fluxes. At the same time, it keeps the computational effort of
generating Monte Carlo simulations for instrument response functions affordably
low.

train the PINN against experimental data from the literature, showing that this
approach provides both better fidelity to the experiments, and a novel
understanding of the relative roles of the hypothesized migration fluxes. We
first verify the PINN approach for solving the inverse problem of radial
particle migration in a non-Brownian suspension in an annular Couette flow. In
this classical case, the PINN yields the same value (as reported in the
literature) for the ratio of the two parameters of the empirical model. Next,
we apply the PINN approach to analyze experiments on particle migration in both
non-Brownian and Brownian suspensions in Poiseuille slot flow, for which a
definitive calibration of the phenomenological migration model has been
lacking. Using the PINN approach, we identify the unknown/empirical parameters
in the physical model through the inverse solver capability of PINNs.
Specifically, the values are significantly different from those for the Couette
cell, highlighting an inconsistency in the literature that uses the latter
value for Poiseuille flow. Importantly, the PINN results also show that the
inferred values of the empirical model's parameters vary with the shear
P\'eclet number and the particle bulk volume fraction of the suspension,
instead of being constant as assumed in some previous literature.

only water demand is uncertain. For comparison, both ES and PPO learn neural

this challenge, both ES and PPO learn good general purpose policies that
outperform mean forecast and two-stage stochastic MPC controllers in terms of

  videofluoroscopic swallowing study: Killing two birds with one stone?",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) is a gold-standard imaging
technique for assessing swallowing, but analysis and rating of VFSS recordings
is time consuming and requires specialized training and expertise. Researchers
have recently demonstrated that it is possible to automatically detect the
pharyngeal phase of swallowing and to localize the bolus in VFSS recordings via
computer vision, fostering the development of novel techniques for automatic
VFSS analysis. However, training of algorithms to perform these tasks requires
large amounts of annotated data that are seldom available. We demonstrate that
the challenges of pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization can be
solved together using a single approach. We propose a deep-learning framework
that jointly tackles pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization in a
weakly-supervised manner, requiring only the initial and final frames of the
pharyngeal phase as ground truth annotations for the training. Our approach
stems from the observation that bolus presence in the pharynx is the most
prominent visual feature upon which to infer whether individual VFSS frames
belong to the pharyngeal phase. We conducted extensive experiments with
multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a dataset of 1245 bolus-level
clips from 59 healthy subjects. We demonstrated that the pharyngeal phase can
be detected with an F1-score higher than 0.9. Moreover, by processing the class
activation maps of the CNNs, we were able to localize the bolus with promising
results, obtaining correlations with ground truth trajectories higher than 0.9,
without any manual annotations of bolus location used for training purposes.
Once validated on a larger sample of participants with swallowing disorders,
our framework will pave the way for the development of intelligent tools for
VFSS analysis to support clinicians in swallowing assessment.

promise as a fast, affordable, and safe modality to image the brain using
ultrasound. However, its high computational cost and memory footprint currently
limit its clinical applicability. Here, we address these challenges through a
frequency-adaptive discretisation of the imaging domain and lossy compression
techniques. Because full-waveform inversion relies on the adjoint-state method,
every iteration involves solving the wave equation over a discretised
spatiotemporal grid and storing the numerical solution to calculate gradient
updates. The computational cost depends on the grid size, which is controlled
by the maximum frequency being modelled. Since the propagated frequency
typically varies during the reconstruction, we reduce reconstruction time and
memory use by allowing the grid size to change throughout the inversion.
Moreover, we combine this approach with multiple lossy compression techniques
that exploit the sparsity of the wavefield to further reduce its memory
footprint. We explore applying these techniques in the spatial, wavelet, and
wave atom domains. Numerical experiments using a human-head model show that our
methods lead to a 30% reduction in reconstruction time and up to three orders
of magnitude less memory, while negligibly affecting the accuracy of the
reconstructions.

represents an attractive scenario for the generation of primordial
hypermagnetic fields. The description of this scenario is, however, complicated
by the Schwinger effect, which gives rise to highly nonlinear dynamics.
Hypermagnetogenesis during axion inflation in the absence of nonlinear effects
is well studied and known to result in a hypermagnetic energy density that
scales like $H^4\,e^{2\pi\xi}/\xi^5$, where $\xi$ is proportional to the time
derivative of the axion-vector coupling in units of the Hubble rate $H$. In
this paper, we generalize this result to the full SM case by consistently
taking into account the Schwinger pair production of all SM fermions. To this
end, we employ the novel gradient-expansion formalism that we recently
developed in [2109.01651], and which is based on a set of vacuum expectation
values for bilinear hyperelectromagnetic functions in position space. We
parametrize the numerical output of our formalism in terms of three parameters
($\xi$, $H$, and $\Delta$, where the latter accounts for the damping of
subhorizon gauge-field modes because of the finite conductivity of the medium)
and work out semianalytical fit functions that describe our numerical results
with high accuracy. Finally, we validate our results by comparing them to
existing estimates in the literature as well as to the explicit numerical
results in a specific inflationary model, which leads to good overall
agreement. We conclude that the systematic uncertainties in the description of
hypermagnetogenesis during axion inflation, which previously spanned up to
several orders of magnitude, are now reduced to typically less than 1 order of
magnitude, which paves the way for further phenomenological studies.

Offline RL algorithms is still hardly investigated. The dataset characteristics
are determined by the behavioral policy that samples this dataset. Therefore,
we define characteristics of behavioral policies as exploratory for yielding
high expected information in their interaction with the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) and as exploitative for having high expected return. We implement two
corresponding empirical measures for the datasets sampled by the behavioral
policy in deterministic MDPs. The first empirical measure SACo is defined by
the normalized unique state-action pairs and captures exploration. The second
empirical measure TQ is defined by the normalized average trajectory return and
captures exploitation. Empirical evaluations show the effectiveness of TQ and
SACo. In large-scale experiments using our proposed measures, we show that the
unconstrained off-policy Deep Q-Network family requires datasets with high SACo

algorithms perform well on datasets with high TQ and SACo. Finally, the

particles opens the possibility of self-assembling a zoo of complex structures,
including those with one or more self-limited length scales. An undesirable
feature of systems with self-limited length scales is that thermal fluctuations
can lead to the assembly of nearby, off-target states. We investigate
strategies for limiting off-target assembly by using multiple types of
subunits. Using simulations and energetics calculations, we explore this
concept by considering the assembly of tubules built from triangular subunits
that bind edge to edge. While in principle, a single type of triangle can
assemble into tubules with a monodisperse width distribution, in practice, the
finite bending rigidity of the binding sites leads to the formation of
off-target structures. To increase the assembly specificity, we introduce
tiling rules for assembling tubules from multiple species of triangles. We show
that the selectivity of the target structure can be dramatically improved by
using multiple species of subunits, and provide a prescription for choosing the
minimum number of subunit species required for near-perfect yield. Our approach

passing have recently set the state of the art on multiple molecular property
prediction tasks. However, they rely on atom position information that is often
unavailable, and obtaining it is usually prohibitively expensive or even
impossible. In this paper we propose synthetic coordinates that enable the use
of advanced GNNs without requiring the true molecular configuration. We propose
two distances as synthetic coordinates: Distance bounds that specify the rough
range of molecular configurations, and graph-based distances using a symmetric
variant of personalized PageRank. To leverage both distance and angular
information we propose a method of transforming normal graph neural networks
into directional MPNNs. We show that with this transformation we can reduce the
error of a normal graph neural network by 55% on the ZINC benchmark. We
furthermore set the state of the art on ZINC and coordinate-free QM9 by
incorporating synthetic coordinates in the SMP and DimeNet++ models. Our
implementation is available online.

centrifugal barrier ought to clear a low-density cavity around the binary and

the low-density cavity, but show that any mass flowing from large scales into
the circumbinary disk is eventually transferred onto the binary components.
Even though many numerical studies confirm this picture, it is still not
understood precisely how gas parcels overcome the centrifugal barrier and
ultimately accrete. We present a detailed analysis of the binary accretion
process, using an accurate prescription for evolving grid-based hydrodynamics
with Lagrangian tracer particles that track the trajectories of individual gas
parcels. We find that binary accretion can be described in four phases: (1) gas
is viscously transported through the circumbinary disk up to the centrifugal
barrier at the cavity wall, (2) the cavity wall is tidally distorted into
accretion streams consisting of near-ballistic gas parcels on eccentric orbits,
(3) the portion of each stream moving inwards of an ``accretion horizon''
radius $\bar r \simeq a$ -- the radius beyond which no material is returned to
the cavity wall -- becomes bound to a minidisk orbiting an individual binary
component, and (4) the minidisk gas accretes onto the binary component through
the combined effect of viscous and tidal stresses.

of fluid dynamics, and in the relativistic case the fluid velocity is upper
bounded by the speed of light, etc. As widely realized, it is crucial to
develop bound-preserving numerical methods that preserve such intrinsic
constraints. Exploring provably bound-preserving schemes has attracted much
attention and is actively studied in recent years. This is however still a
challenging task for many systems especially those involving nonlinear
constraints.
  Based on some key insights from geometry, we systematically propose an
innovative and general framework, referred to as geometric quasilinearization
(GQL), which paves a new effective way for studying bound-preserving problems
with nonlinear constraints. The essential idea of GQL is to equivalently
transfer all nonlinear constraints into linear ones, through properly
introducing some free auxiliary variables. We establish the fundamental
principle and general theory of GQL via the geometric properties of convex
regions, and propose three simple effective methods for constructing GQL. We
apply the GQL approach to a variety of partial differential equations, and
demonstrate its effectiveness and remarkable advantages for studying
bound-preserving schemes, by diverse challenging examples and applications
which cannot be easily handled by direct or traditional approaches.

Furthermore, processing satellite and ground survey data requires domain

denoising score matching, and has become an important component in many
applications, such as image generation and audio synthesis. Higher order
derivatives provide additional local information about the data distribution
and enable new applications. Although they can be estimated via automatic
differentiation of a learned density model, this can amplify estimation errors
and is expensive in high dimensional settings. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a method to directly estimate high order derivatives (scores) of a
data density from samples. We first show that denoising score matching can be
interpreted as a particular case of Tweedie's formula. By leveraging Tweedie's
formula on higher order moments, we generalize denoising score matching to
estimate higher order derivatives. We demonstrate empirically that models
trained with the proposed method can approximate second order derivatives more
efficiently and accurately than via automatic differentiation. We show that our
models can be used to quantify uncertainty in denoising and to improve the
mixing speed of Langevin dynamics via Ozaki discretization for sampling
synthetic data and natural images.

seems rather arbitrary, and additional physics is required to reproduce the
observed neutrino masses and mixings. We address these shortcomings by
embedding $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ in the vectorial SU(3) gauge symmetry of lepton
flavor. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of scalar fields in the
fundamental, six-dimensional and adjoint representations allow for
phenomenologically viable lepton and gauge boson masses. The octet scalar gives
rise to charged lepton masses, and together with the triplet scalar generates
masses for all the leptophilic gauge bosons except for the $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$
one. The latter gets its smaller mass from the sextet VEVs, which also generate
the neutrino masses, and are determined up to an overall scaling by the
observed masses and mixings. The model predicts three heavy neutral leptons at
the GeV-TeV scale as well as vectorlike charged lepton partners; it requires
the mass of the lightest active neutrino to exceed $10^{-4}\,$eV, and it
naturally provides a resolution of the Cabibbo angle anomaly.

physics contributions to $b \to c \tau \overline{\nu}$. They are analyzed not
only within the dimension-six effective field theory (EFT) but also in explicit
leptoquark (LQ) models with the LQ non-decoupled. The former is realized by
taking a limit of large LQ mass in the latter. It is clarified that the LHC
sensitivity is sensitive to the LQ mass for $O(1)$ TeV even in the search of
$pp \to \tau_h \overline{b} + E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$. Although the LQ models
provide a weaker sensitivity than the EFT limit, it is found that the

four-dimensional theory takes the form of an axidilaton model where the scalars
couple to the Gauss-Bonnet and Pontryagin densities. Thus, the actual string
gravity is a generalization of the well-studied Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet
and dynamical Chern-Simons models. Using this action we compute the stringy
corrections to the Kerr geometry and we obtain, for the first time, the
corrections to the entropy of the Kerr black hole at order $\alpha'^2$. We
check that the first law of black hole mechanics is satisfied and discuss
several properties of the solution. Our results suggest that there exist black
hole solutions with $J>M^2$ and therefore the extremal ratio $J/M^2$ must be
modified positively.

the halo. We construct a dark matter gravitational potential consistent with
this density profile, and we use a ""cosmological"" potential that accounts for
gas evolution consistent with Hubble expansion at large radii. Gas is
initialized with a density $\approx$ 0.2 times the dark matter density,
consistent with the universal baryon fraction $\rho_{\rm g}/(\rho_{\rm
g}+\rho_{\rm DM}) \approx 0.17$. We study the formation of the virial shock and
evolution of the baryon fraction, including the effects of radiative cooling
and AGN jet feedback. The feedback is powered by the accretion of cold gas onto
a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The cores of the halo exhibit heating
and cooling cycles, whose strength and duration depend on the feedback
efficiency and the halo mass. The central SMBH initially grows exponentially
with time in the early quasar phase, but the growth slows down at later times.
The baryon fraction in the core decreases with increasing feedback efficiency
and decreasing halo mass. While the halo outskirts evolve self-similarly, the
core density is non-evolving, in agreement with cluster observations. We
analyze the correlations between the properties of the gas and the central
SMBH, and explore the existence of a fundamental plane.

frequency between CMB and interferometer scales, this motivates us to move
beyond the commonly adopted approximation of a pure power-law GW spectrum. We
consider a broken power-law parametrization for the SGWB spectrum, which turns
from blue to red above the break frequency: while phenomenological, this choice
maps to various well-motivated early-Universe models, including scenarios
featuring non-instantaneous reheating or a non-standard background expansion

resulting SGWB to the early-Universe radiation energy density, we constrain the

the tensor-to-scalar ratio on CMB scales, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints

potential effects of a proposed policy, but often represent energy-efficient
technologies and policies in an overly simplified way. Most ESOMs include
different end-use technologies with varying efficiencies and select
technologies for deployment based solely on least-cost optimization, which
drastically oversimplifies consumer decision-making. In this paper, we change
the structure of an existing ESOM to model energy efficiency in way that is
consistent with microeconomic theory. The resulting model considers the
effectiveness of energy-efficient technologies in meeting energy service
demands, and their potential to substitute electricity usage by conventional
technologies. To test the revised model, we develop a simple hypothetical case
and use it to analyze the welfare gain from an energy efficiency subsidy versus
a carbon tax policy. In the simple test case, the maximum recovered welfare
from an efficiency subsidy is less than 50% of the first-best carbon tax
policy.

integrated-light measurements and previously published data. We find a steady
rise in the velocity dispersion from $300^{\prime\prime}$ into the center. The
integrated-light kinematics provide a velocity dispersion of $11.76\pm0.66$
km/s inside $75^{\prime\prime}$. After applying appropriate corrections to
crowding in the central regions, we achieve consistent velocity dispersion
values using velocities from individual stars. Crowding corrections need to be
applied when targeting individual stars in high density stellar environments.
From integrated light, we measure the surface brightness profile and find a
shallow cusp towards the center. Axisymmetric, orbit-based models measure the
stellar mass-to-light ratio, black hole mass and parameters for a dark matter
halo. At large radii it is important to consider possible tidal effects from
the Milky Way so we include a variety of assumptions regarding the tidal
radius. For every set of assumptions, models require a central black hole
consistent with a mass $(3.3 \pm 2) \times 10^6\, M_\odot$. The no-black-hole
case for any of our assumptions is excluded at over 95% significance, with
$6.4<\Delta\chi^2<14$. A black hole of this mass would have significant effect
on dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. The dark halo parameters are heavily
affected by the assumptions for the tidal radii, with the circular velocity
only constrained to be above 30 km/s. Reasonable assumptions for the tidal
radius result in stellar orbits consistent with an isotropic distribution in
the velocities. These more realistic models only show strong constraints for
the mass of the central black hole.

material models. It was presented first in a previous paper providing
one-dimensional simulations for damage and plasticity. The present paper
focuses on a two-dimensional implementation for elasto-damage models
(quasi-brittle fracture). The incremental potential used in the Lip-field
approach is the non-regularized one. The regularization comes from the addition
of a Lipschitz constraint on the damage field. In other words, the free energy
does not depend on the damage gradient. The search of the displacement and
damage fields from one time-step to the next is based on an iterative staggered
scheme. The displacement field is sought for a given damage field. Then, a
Lipschitz continuous damage field is sought for a given displacement field.
Both problems are convex. The solution to the latter benefits from bounds
proven in a previous paper and used here. The paper details the implementation
of the Lipschitz regularity on a finite element mesh and details the overall
solution scheme. Four numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new
approach.

average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give
upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods.
As applications, we estimate average-case error for digital Hamiltonian
simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and $k$-local Hamiltonians. In
particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with $n$ spins, the error
is quadratically reduced from $\mathcal O(n)$ in the worst case to $\mathcal
O(\sqrt{n})$ on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method.
Numerical evidence suggests that this theory accurately characterizes the
average error for concrete models. We also apply our results to error analysis
in the simulation of quantum scrambling.

crucial for understanding their impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. For
radio AGN, their evolutionary stage can be identified from a combination of
morphological and spectral properties. We summarise the results we have
obtained in the last few years by studying radio galaxies in various crucial
phases of their lives, such as remnant and restarted sources. We used
morphological information derived from LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) images at
150 MHz, combined with resolved spectral indices maps, obtained using recently
released images at 1400 MHz from the APERture Tile In Focus (Apertif)
phased-array feed system installed on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope.
Our study, limited so far to the Lockman Hole region, has identified radio
galaxies in the dying and restarted phases. We found large varieties in their
properties, relevant for understanding their evolutionary stage. We started by
quantifying their occurrences, the duration of the 'on' (active) and 'off'
(dying) phase, and we compared the results with models of the evolution of
radio galaxies. In addition to these extreme phases, the resolved spectral
index images can also reveal interesting secrets about the evolution of
apparently normal radio galaxies. The spectral information can be connected
with, and used to improve, the Fanaroff--Riley classification, and we present
one example of this, illustrating what the combination of the LOFAR and Apertif
surveys now allow us to do routinely.

contains 516 clusters with mean mass <M200m> = 1e14.9 msol and redshift <z> =
0.55. We analyze in parallel a set of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations from
The Three Hundred project. The SPT-SZ data show two features: (i) a pressure
deficit at R/R200m = $1.08 \pm 0.09$, measured at $3.1\sigma$ significance and
not observed in the simulations, and; (ii) a sharp decrease in pressure at
R/R200m = $4.58 \pm 1.24$ at $2.0\sigma$ significance. The pressure deficit is
qualitatively consistent with a shock-induced thermal non-equilibrium between
electrons and ions, and the second feature is consistent with accretion shocks
seen in previous studies. We split the cluster sample by redshift and mass, and
find both features exist in all cases. There are also no significant
differences in features along and across the cluster major axis, whose
orientation roughly points towards filamentary structure. As a consistency
test, we also analyze clusters from the Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope
Polarimeter surveys and find quantitatively similar features in the pressure
profiles. Finally, we compare the accretion shock radius (Rsh_acc) with
existing measurements of the splashback radius (Rsp) for SPT-SZ and constrain
the lower limit of the ratio, Rsh_acc/Rsp > $2.16 \pm 0.59$.

practice, very often, the performance can abruptly drop over 10% without
obvious reasons. The key challenge is that there is not much visibility into ML
inference execution on edge devices, and very little awareness of potential
issues during the edge deployment process. We present ML-EXray, an end-to-end
framework, which provides visibility into layer-level details of the ML
execution, and helps developers analyze and debug cloud-to-edge deployment
issues. More often than not, the reason for sub-optimal edge performance does
not only lie in the model itself, but every operation throughout the data flow
and the deployment process. Evaluations show that ML-EXray can effectively
catch deployment issues, such as pre-processing bugs, quantization issues,
suboptimal kernels, etc. Using ML-EXray, users need to write less than 15 lines
of code to fully examine the edge deployment pipeline. Eradicating these
issues, ML-EXray can correct model performance by up to 30%, pinpoint
error-prone layers, and guide users to optimize kernel execution latency by two
orders of magnitude. Code and APIs will be released as an open-source

transformed accordingly, from purely sensory to PS-related. These hypotheses
were tested using 7T fMRI at high spatial resolution. In response to images of
different visual stimuli across a range of virtual distances, we found two
categories of distance encoding in functionally corresponding columns within
parietal cortex. First, PD (personal distance) columns responded selectively to
moving and stationary face images presented at virtual distances nearer (but
not further) than each subjects behaviorally-defined PS boundary. In the
majority of PD columns, BOLD response amplitudes increased monotonically and
nonlinearly with increasing virtual face proximity. In the remaining PD
columns, BOLD responses decreased with increasing proximity. These fMRI
response functions appear related to previously-reported variations in
subjective discomfort levels, and physiologic arousal, during intrusion into
but not beyond personal space. Secondly, DD (disparity distance) columns in
parietal cortex responded selectively to disparity-based near or far distances,
in random dot stimuli, like disparity-selective columns described previously in
occipital cortex. In parietal cortex, maps of DD columns were systematically

that the transformation of spatial information, from visual to higher-order,

understanding information coming from multiple modalities (i.e., images,
language). In VQA, a series of questions are posed based on a set of images and
the task at hand is to arrive at the answer. To achieve this, we take a
symbolic reasoning based approach using the framework of formal logic. The
image and the questions are converted into symbolic representations on which
explicit reasoning is performed. We propose a formal logic framework where (i)
images are converted to logical background facts with the help of scene graphs,
(ii) the questions are translated to first-order predicate logic clauses using
a transformer based deep learning model, and (iii) perform satisfiability
checks, by using the background knowledge and the grounding of predicate
clauses, to obtain the answer. Our proposed method is highly interpretable and
each step in the pipeline can be easily analyzed by a human. We validate our
approach on the CLEVR and the GQA dataset. We achieve near perfect accuracy of
99.6% on the CLEVR dataset comparable to the state of art models, showcasing
that formal logic is a viable tool to tackle visual question answering. Our
model is also data efficient, achieving 99.1% accuracy on CLEVR dataset when

electron-positron collider operating at centre-of-mass energies of up to 3 TeV.
It incorporates a novel two-beam acceleration technique offering accelerating
gradient of up to 100 MeV/m. CLIC would be built and operated in a staged
approach with three centre-of-mass energy stages currently assumed to be 380
GeV, 1.5 TeV, and 3 TeV. The first CLIC stage will be focused on precision
Higgs and top quark measurements. The so called ""Higgs-strahlung"" process ($e^+
e^- \to \mathrm{ZH}$) is a key for a model independent measurement of Higgs
boson decays and extraction of its couplings. Precision top quark measurements
will include the pair-production threshold scan, which is assumed to be the
most precise method for the top-quark mass determination. The two subsequent
energy stages will allow for extended Standard Model studies, including the
direct measurement of the Higgs self-coupling and the top Yukawa coupling, but
their main goals will be to search for signatures of Beyond the Standard Model
phenomena.
  Presented in this contribution is a selection of recent results showing
sensitivity of CLIC experiment to diverse BSM physics scenarios. Compared with
hadron colliders, the low background conditions at CLIC provide extended
discovery potential, in particular for the production through electroweak
and/or Higgs boson interactions. This includes scenarios with extended scalar
sectors, also motivated by dark matter, which can be searched for using
associated production processes or cascade decays involving electroweak gauge
bosons. In a wide range of models, new particles can be discovered almost up to
the kinematic limit while the indirect search sensitivity extends up to
${\cal{O}}(100)$ TeV scales.

topological transforms that generalize from shapes to fields, $f:\mathbf{R}^3

direction $v\in S^{d-1}$ a summary obtained by scanning the field in the
direction $v$. The transforms we introduce are of interest for both
applications as well as their theoretical properties. The topological
transforms for shapes are based on an Euler calculus on sets. A key insight in
this paper is that via a lifting argument one can develop an Euler calculus on
real valued functions from the standard Euler calculus on sets, this idea is at
the heart of the two transforms we introduce. We prove the transforms are
injective maps. We show for particular moduli spaces of functions we can upper
bound the number of directions needed determine any particular function.

of unit-length and while they showed that first-fit needs at most $2w-1$

constants as proposed first in Kapur's congruence closure algorithm (RTA97).
The framework is general, flexible, and has been extended also to develop
congruence closure algorithms for the cases when associative-commutative
function symbols can have additional properties including idempotency,
nilpotency, identities, cancellativity and group properties as well as their
various combinations. Algorithms are modular; their correctness and termination
proofs are simple, exploiting modularity. Unlike earlier algorithms, the
proposed algorithms neither rely on complex AC compatible well-founded
orderings on nonvariable terms nor need to use the associative-commutative
unification and extension rules in completion for generating canonical rewrite
systems for congruence closures. They are particularly suited for integrating
into the Satisfiability modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. A new way to view
Groebner basis algorithm for polynomial ideals with integer coefficients as a

behaviour. This study identifies the timesteps when a driver in different
circumstances (rush, mental conflicts, reprisal) begins to drive aggressively.
An observer (real or virtual) is needed to examine driving behaviour to
discover aggressive driving occasions; we overcome this problem by using a
smartphone's GPS sensor to detect locations and classify drivers' driving
behaviour every three minutes. To detect timeseries patterns in our dataset, we
employ RNN (GRU, LSTM) algorithms to identify patterns during the driving
course. The algorithm is independent of road, vehicle, position, or driver
characteristics. We conclude that three minutes (or more) of driving (120
seconds of GPS data) is sufficient to identify driver behaviour. The results
show high accuracy and a high F1 score.

various stages of interaction and span a range of environments. We detect clear
hallmarks of tidal interactions through the presence of HI bridges, and diffuse
HI extensions that surround the dwarfs. We overlay the HI data on Pan-STARRS
r-band images and find further evidence of tidal interactions through
coincident distorted HI and tidal stellar features in NGC 3264 and UGC 4638,
and an unwound spiral arm pointing towards its smaller companion in NGC 3264.
In UGC 4638, both the gas and diffuse stars are extended to similar radii east
of the primary, which could indicate that the smaller dwarf in the system has
already completed one pass through the primary. We additionally find that our
three systems, and those from the Local Volume TiNy Titans survey, are not HI
deficient and thus the interaction has not resulted in a loss of gas from the
systems. A comparison with non-interacting dwarf galaxies shows that the
interactions have a significant impact on the kinematics of the systems. Our
new resolved HI kinematics, combined with detailed stellar and HI morphologies,
provide crucial constraints for future dynamical modelling of hierarchical

  problems \emph{via} two-scale asymptotic expansions",,,,,"math.OC math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the bang-bang property for fairly general classes of
$L^\infty-L^1$ constrained bilinear optimal control problems in two cases: that
of the one-dimensional torus, in which case we consider parabolic equations,
and that of general $d$ dimensional domains for time-discrete parabolic models.
Such a study is motivated by several applications in applied mathematics, most
importantly in the study of reaction-diffusion models. The main equation in the
one-dimensional case writes $\partial_t u_m-\Delta u_m=mu_m+f(t,x,u_m)$, where
$m=m(x)$ is the control, which must satisfy some $L^\infty$ bounds ($0\leq
m\leq 1$ a.e.) and an $L^1$ constraint ($\int m=m_0$ is fixed), and where $f$
is a non-linearity that must only satisfy that any solution of this equation is
positive at any given time. The time-discrete models are simply
time-discretisations of such equations. The functionals we seek to optimise are
rather general; in the case of the torus, they write $\mathcal
J(m)=\iint_{(0,T)\times \mathbb T} j_1(t,x,u_m)+\int_{\mathbb T}
j_2(x,u_m(T,\cdot))$. Roughly speaking we prove in this article that, if $j_1$
and $j_2$ are increasing, then any maximiser $m^*$ of $\mathcal J$ is bang-bang
in the sense that it writes $m^*=1_E$ for some subset $E$ of the torus. It
should be noted that such a result rewrites as an existence property for a
shape optimisation problem. Our proofs rely on second order optimality
conditions, combined with a fine study of two-scale asymptotic expansions. In
the conclusion of this article, we offer several possible generalisations of
our results to more involved situations (for instance for controls of the form
$m\varphi(u_m)$), and we discuss the limits of our methods by explaining which
difficulties may arise in other contexts.

very powerful tool in data science in general and econometrics in particular.
Unfortunately, the crossing problem has been confounding researchers and
practitioners alike for over 4 decades. Numerous attempts have been made to
find a simple and general solution. This paper describes a unique and elegant
solution to the problem based on a flexible check function that is easy to
understand and implement in R and Python, while greatly reducing or even
eliminating the crossing problem entirely. It will be very important in all
areas where quantile regression is routinely used and may also find application
in robust regression, especially in the context of machine learning. From this
perspective, we also utilize the flexible check function to provide insights
into the root causes of the crossing problem.

pair in an external electric field, we are able to investigate the effect of
the electric field on the different phases of the background which are the
thermal AdS and the black hole phases. This is helpful for better understanding
the confining character and also the phase transitions of the system. We find
out that the field theory dual to the black hole solution is always deconfined.
However, although the thermal AdS phase describes the confining phase in
general, for the quark pairs parallel to $B$ (longitudinal case) and
$B>B_{\mathrm{critical}}$ the response of the system to the electric field
mimics the deconfinement. We moreover consider the effect of the magnetic field
and the chemical potential on the Schwinger effect. We observe that when we are
in the black hole phase with sufficiently small values of $\mu$ or in the
thermal AdS phase, and for both longitudinal and transverse cases, the magnetic
field increase leads to the enhancement of the Schwinger effect, which can be
termed as the inverse magnetic catalysis. This is deduced both from the
decrease of the critical electric fields and from the decreasing the height and
width of the total potential barrier that the quarks are facing with. However,
by increasing $\mu$ to high enough values, the inverse magnetic catalysis turns
into magnetic catalysis, as can also be observed from the diagram of the
Hawking-Page phase transition temperature versus $B$ for the background

the ice-induced attenuation of ocean waves in polar oceans, the physical
processes governing this wave attenuation phenomenon are still poorly
understood. Most analyses have attempted to relate the spatial rate of wave
attenuation to wave frequency, but have not considered how this relationship
depends on ice, wave and atmospheric conditions. An in-depth analysis of the
wave-buoy data collected during the 2017 PIPERS programme in the Ross Sea is
conducted. Standard techniques are used to estimate the spatial rate of wave
attenuation $\alpha$ and the influence of a number of potential physical
drivers on its dependence on wave period $T$ is investigated. A power-law is
shown to consistently describe the $\alpha(T)$ relationship, in line with other
recent analyses. The two parameters describing this relationship are found to
depend significantly on sea ice concentration, mean wave period and wind
direction, however. Looking at cross-correlations between these physical
drivers, three regimes of ice-induced wave attenuation are identified, which
characterise different ice, wave and wind conditions, and very possibly
different processes causing this observed attenuation. This analysis suggests
that parametrisations of ice-induced wave decay in spectral wave models should
be piecewise, so their dependence on local ice, wave and wind conditions is
described in some way.

MassFormer outperforms competing approaches for spectrum prediction on multiple
datasets, and is able to recover prior knowledge about the effect of collision
energy on the spectrum. By employing gradient-based attribution methods, we
demonstrate that the model can identify relationships between fragment peaks.
To further highlight MassFormer's utility, we show that it can match or exceed
existing prediction-based methods on two spectrum identification tasks. We
provide open-source implementations of our model and baseline approaches, with
the goal of encouraging future research in this area.

representations for the nodes in a network, thereby enabling their use in
standard machine learning models. These methods aim to preserve relational
information, such that nodes that are similar in the graph are found close to
one another in the representation space. Similarity can be based largely on one
of two notions: connectivity or structural role. In tasks where node structural
role is important, connectivity based methods show poor performance. Recent
work has begun to focus on scalability of learning methods to massive graphs of
millions to billions of nodes and edges. Many unsupervised node representation
learning algorithms are incapable of scaling to large graphs, and are unable to
generate node representations for unseen nodes. In this work, we propose
Inferential SIR-GN, a model which is pre-trained on random graphs, then
computes node representations rapidly, including for very large networks. We
demonstrate that the model is able to capture node's structural role

However, traditional dependence analysis is either inapplicable or of very
limited utility for distributed programs due to the decoupled components of
these programs that run in concurrent processes at physically separated
machines. Motivated by the need for dependence analysis of distributed software
and the diverse cost-effectiveness needs of dependence-based applications, this
paper presents D$^2$ABS, a framework of dynamic dependence abstraction for
distributed programs. By partial-ordering distributed method-execution events
and inferring causality from the ordered events, D$^2$ABS abstracts
method-level dependencies both within and across process boundaries. Further,
by exploiting message-passing semantics across processes, and incorporating
static dependencies and statement coverage within individual components, we
present three additional instantiations of D$^2$ABS that trade efficiency for
better precision. We present the design of the D$^2$ABS framework and evaluate
the four instantiations of D$^2$ABS on distributed systems of various
architectures and scales using our implementation for Java. Our empirical
results show that D$^2$ABS is significantly more effective than existing
options while offering varied levels of cost-effectiveness tradeoffs. As our
framework essentially computes whole-system run-time dependencies, it naturally
empowers a range of other dependence-based applications.

characteristics. G-estimation and dynamic weighted ordinary least squares
(dWOLS) are double robust statistical methods that can be used to identify
optimal adaptive treatment strategies. They require both a model for the
outcome and a model for the treatment and are consistent if at least one of
these models is correctly specified. It is underappreciated that these methods
additionally require modeling all existing treatment-confounder interactions to
yield consistent estimators. Identifying partially adaptive treatment
strategies that tailor treatments according to only a few covariates, ignoring
some interactions, may be preferable in practice. It has been proposed to
combine inverse probability weighting and G-estimation to address this issue,
but we argue that the resulting estimator is not expected to be double robust.
Building on G-estimation and dWOLS, we propose alternative estimators of
partially adaptive strategies and demonstrate their double robustness. We
investigate and compare the empirical performance of six estimators in a
simulation study. As expected, estimators combining inverse probability
weighting with either G-estimation or dWOLS are biased when the treatment model
is incorrectly specified. The other estimators are unbiased if either the
treatment or the outcome model are correctly specified and have similar
standard errors. Using data maintained by the Centre des Maladies du Sein, the

Analysis which are in fact connected via a different approach to their proofs
using the results of Errett Bishop of volumes and limits of analytic varieties.
We start by proving Chow's theorem by a technique suggested long time ago in
the beautiful book by Gabriel Stolzenberg. We think this approach is very
attractive and easier for students and newcomers to understand; also the theory
presented here is linked to areas of mathematics that are not usually
associated with Chow's result. In addition, Bishop's results imply both Chow's
and Remmert-Stein's theorems directly, meaning that this view is simpler and
just as profound as Remmert-Stein's proof. After that, we give a comparison
table that explains how Bishop's theorems generalize to several complex
variables classical results of one complex variable and prove Montel's
compactness theorem using the techniques presented here. Finally we give an
alternative proof of a theorem of Edwards, Millet and Sullivan of foliations
with compact leaves for the case of complex foliations in K\""ahler manifolds.

customized, highly-conformal treatments for cancer patients. Creating IMRT
treatment plans, however, is a mathematically complex process, which is often
tackled in multiple, simpler stages. This sequential approach typically
separates radiation dose requirements from mechanical deliverability
considerations, which may result in suboptimal treatment quality. For patient
health to be considered paramount, holistic models must address these plan
elements concurrently, eliminating quality loss between stages. This combined
direct aperture optimization (DAO) approach is rarely paired with uncertainty
mitigation techniques, such as robust optimization, due to the inherent
complexity of both parts. This paper outlines a robust DAO (RDAO) model and
discusses novel methodologies for efficiently integrating salient constraints.
Because the highly-complex RDAO model is difficult to solve, an original
candidate plan generation (CPG) heuristic is proposed. The CPG produces rapid,
high-quality, feasible plans, which are immediately clinically viable, and can
also be used to generate a feasible incumbent solution for warm starting the
RDAO model. Computational results obtained using clinical patient datasets with
motion uncertainty show the benefit of incorporating the CPG, both in terms of
first incumbent solution and final output plan quality.

semi-empirical. They represent micro-scale ion and solvent behaviours that
control the macroscopic properties using small numbers of parameters whose
values are obtained by fitting to activities and other partial derivatives of
the Gibbs energy measured for the bulk solutions. We have conducted atomistic
simulations of aqueous electrolyte solutions (MgCl2 and CaCl2) to determine the
parameters of aqueous thermodynamic hydration models. We have implemented a
coopera-tive hydration model to categorize the water molecules in electrolyte
solutions into different subpopulations. The value of the electrolyte-specific
parameter, k, was determined from the ion-affected subpopulation with the
lowest absolute value of the free energy of removing the water molecule. The
other equilibrium constant parameter, K1, associated with the first degree of
hydra-tion, was computed from the free energy of hydration of hydrated clusters
in solution. The hydration number, h, was determined from a reorientation
dynamic analysis of the water subpopulations compared to bulk-like behaviour.
The computed values of these parameters were inserted in the Stokes & Robinson

availability of experimental data and could lead to aqueous thermodynamic

thermal and volumetric properties for a wide range of composition and
concentrations.

where, unlike traditional reinforcement learning, an agent receives feedback
only in terms of a 1 bit (0/1) preference over a trajectory pair instead of
absolute rewards for them. The success of the traditional RL framework
crucially relies on the underlying agent-reward model, which, however, depends
on how accurately a system designer can express an appropriate reward function
and often a non-trivial task. The main novelty of our framework is the ability
to learn from preference-based trajectory feedback that eliminates the need to
hand-craft numeric reward models. This paper sets up a formal framework for the
PbRL problem with non-markovian rewards, where the trajectory preferences are
encoded by a generalized linear model of dimension $d$. Assuming the transition
model is known, we then propose an algorithm with almost optimal regret

steep challenges, even with available sensor data, due to complex
electrical-thermal-mechanical interactions and hysteresis. This article
proposes a framework for in-situ sensing and dynamics modeling of actuator
states, particularly temperature of SMA wires, which is used to predict robot
motions. A planar soft limb is developed, actuated by a pair of SMA coils, that
includes compact and robust sensors for temperature and angular deflection.
Data from these sensors are used to train a neural network based on the long
short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to model both unidirectional (single SMA)
and bidirectional (both SMAs) motion. Predictions from the model demonstrate
that data from the temperature sensor, combined with control inputs, allow for
dynamics predictions over extraordinarily long open-loop timescales (10
minutes) with little drift. Prediction errors are on the order of the soft
deflection sensor's accuracy. This architecture allows for compact designs of
electrothermally-actuated soft robots that include sensing sufficient for
motion predictions, helping to bring these robots into practical application.

one of the most important differential equations in physics, chemistry, and

There are situations, when a, b, and a - b are integers, where one of these

consider and what the explicit formulas are for the two linearly independent
solutions of the confluent hypergeometric equation. Our results are summarized
in Table I in Section 3. As an example, we use these solutions to study the
bound states of the hydrogenic atom, going beyond the standard treatment in

this guide will aid physics instruction that involves the confluent

analysis of the small-capillary number, large-solutal Peclet number limit for
two evaporative models: a kinetic model, in which the evaporative flux is
constant across the droplet, and a diffusive model, in which the evaporative
flux is singular at the contact line. For both evaporative models, solute is
transported to the contact line by a capillary flow while, local to the contact
line, solute diffusion counters advection. The resulting interplay leads to the
formation of the nascent coffee ring. By exploiting a coordinate system
embedded in the contact line, we solve explicitly the local leading-order
problem, deriving a similarity profile (in the form of a gamma distribution)
that describes the coffee ring profile in its early stages. Notably, the ring
characteristics change due to the concomitant asymmetry in the shape of the

difficult to claim a secure detection due to the marginal fit improvement, lack
of consistency among different data sets, and difficulty in uniquely specifying
the nature of the tertiary component. With the observables of the event, it is
estimated that the masses of the planet and host are $\sim (6.9~M_\oplus,

classify IllustrisTNG galaxies in a way which is fully consistent with the
observations, and reproduce the observed photometric and environmental

of S0 galaxies back through time, identifying two main distinct pathways; those
which experienced gas stripping via group infalls (37 percent of S0s) or
significant merger events (57 percent). We find that those forming via mergers
feature a transient star-forming ring, whose present-day occurrence rate
matches observations. We find that these formation pathways together can
reproduce the range in rotational support in observed S0s, concluding that
there are two main formation pathways for S0 galaxies.

disturbances in which the agent is deployed. Those disturbances include moving
adversaries whose behavior can be unpredictable by the agent, and as a matter
of fact harmful to its learning. Ensuring the safety of critical systems also
requires methods that give formal guarantees on the behaviour of the agent
evolving in a perturbed environment. It is therefore necessary to propose new
solutions adapted to the learning challenges faced by the agent. In this paper,
first we generate adversarial agents that exhibit flaws in the agent's policy
by presenting moving adversaries. Secondly, We use reward shaping and a
modified Q-learning algorithm as defense mechanisms to improve the agent's
policy when facing adversarial perturbations. Finally, probabilistic model
checking is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of both mechanisms. We have
conducted experiments on a discrete grid world with a single agent facing
non-learning and learning adversaries. Our results show a diminution in the
number of collisions between the agent and the adversaries. Probabilistic model
checking provides lower and upper probabilistic bounds regarding the agent's
safety in the adversarial environment.

cellular respiration and energy production. Mito-nuclear incompatibility
reduces individual fitness and induces hybrid infertility, suggesting a
possible role in reproductive barriers and speciation. Here we develop a
birth-death model for evolution in spatially extended populations under
selection for mito-nuclear co-adaptation. Mating is constrained by physical and
genetic proximity, and offspring inherit nuclear genomes from both parents,
with recombination. The model predicts macroscopic patterns including a
community's long-term species diversity, its species abundance distribution,
speciation and extinction rates, as well as intra- and inter-specific genetic
variation. We explore how these long-term outcomes depend upon the microscopic
parameters of reproduction: individual fitness governed by mito-nuclear
compatibility, constraints on mating compatibility, and ecological carrying
capacity. We find that strong selection for mito-nuclear compatibility reduces
the equilibrium number of species after a radiation, increases the species'
abundances, while simultaneously increasing both speciation and extinction
rates. The negative correlation between species diversity and diversification
rates in our model agrees with the broad empirical pattern of lower species
diversity and higher speciation/extinction rates in temperate regions, compared
to the tropics. We therefore suggest that these empirical patterns may be
caused in part by latitudinal variation in metabolic demands, and corresponding
variation in selection on mito-nuclear function.

encoding of the problem that allows it to scale beyond single-node topologies.
We use TACCL to synthesize algorithms for three collectives and two hardware

data in the limit of high noise. The algorithms developed describe an extensive
toolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the
context of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.
We offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a
system x' = f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an
extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression
method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and
yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x'. These
innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from
high-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers
the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient
estimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and
23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined
into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in
other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on
high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model
discovery method based on x' = f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered
model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this
non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model's accuracy and thus a discovery
method's effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies
among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that
is closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered
model's accuracy.

by generating more pairwise labels to provide additional information in
learning a metric to enhance clustering performance. Furthermore, we increase
the robustness of metric learning by updating the learned metric sequentially

novel active query strategy that evaluates the information gain of instance
pairs more accurately by incorporating the neighborhood structure, which
improves clustering efficiency without extra labeling cost. In theory, we
provide a tighter error bound of the proposed metric learning method utilizing
augmented queries compared with methods using existing constraints only.
Furthermore, we also investigate the improvement using the active query
strategy instead of random selection. Numerical studies on simulation settings

collectively react to an imminent attack. The antipredator response may
influence spatial pattern formation and ecosystem stability but requires an
organism's cost to contribute to the collective effort. We investigate a
nonhierarchical tritrophic system, whose predator-prey interactions are
described by the rock-paper-scissors game rules. In our spatial stochastic
simulations, the radius of antipredator response defines the maximum prey group
size that disturbs the predator's action, determining the individual cost to
participate in antipredator strategies. We consider that each organism
contributes equally to the collective effort, having its mobility limited by
the proportion of energy devoted to the antipredator reaction. Our outcomes
show that the antipredator response leads to spiral patterns, with the
segregation of organisms of the same species occupying departed spatial
domains. We found that a less localized antipredator response increases the
average size of the single-species patches, improving the protection of
individuals against predation. Finally, our findings show that although the
increase of the predation risk for a more localized antipredator response, the
high mobility constraining benefits species coexistence. Our results may help
ecologists understand the mechanisms leading to the stability of biological
systems where locality is crucial to behavioral interactions among species.

$A\in\mathbb R^{n \times d}$ and loss $\|\cdot\|$.
  For $p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\infty$, we give an algorithm based on
Lewis weight sampling outputting a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution using
just $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries to $b$ for $p\in(0,1)$,
$\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$ queries for $1<p<2$, and
$\tilde{O}(d^{p/2}/\epsilon^p)$ queries for $2<p<\infty$. For $0<p<2$, our
bounds are optimal up to log factors, settling the query complexity for this
range. For $2<p<\infty$, our dependence on $d$ is optimal, while our dependence
on $\epsilon$ is off by at most $\epsilon$, up to log factors. Our result
resolves an open question of [CD21], who gave near optimal bounds for the $1$

  We also give the first total sensitivity bound of

$\tilde O(d^{1+\max\{1,p/2\}}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ queries for such loss
functions, including the Tukey and Huber losses, answering another question of

have many applications, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings, robust

responsible for the variation in women's attitude towards intimate partner
violence (IPV). Methods: A nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and
Health Survey 2014 data of 17,863 women is used to address the research
questions. In the study, two response variables are constructed from the five
attitude questions, and a series of individual and community-level predictors
are tested. The preliminary statistical methods employed in the study include
univariate and bivariate distributions, while the adopted statistical models
include binary logistic, ordinal logistic, mixed-effects multilevel logistic
models for each response variable, and finally, the generalized ordinal
logistic regression. Results: Statistical analyses reveal that among the
individual-level independent variables age at first marriage, respondent's
education, decision score, religion, NGO membership, access to information,
husband's education, normalized wealth score, and division indicator have
significant effects on the women's attitude towards IPV. Among the three
community-level variables, only the mean decision score is found significant in
lowering the likelihood. Conclusions: It is evident that other than religion,
NGO membership, and division indicator, the higher the value of the variable,
the lower the likelihood of justifying IPV. However, being a Muslim, NGO
member, and resident of other divisions, women are found more tolerant of IPV
from their respective counterparts. These findings suggest the government,
policymakers, practitioners, academicians, and all other stakeholders to work
on the significant determinants to divert women's wrong attitude towards IPV,
and thus help to take away this deep-rooted problem from society.

such as the inability to generalize from one patient population to another. We
analyze the performance of a ResNet-50 classifier for the purposes of
Tuberculosis screening using the four most popular public datasets with
geographically diverse sources of imagery. We show that without domain
adaptation, ResNet-50 has difficulty in generalizing between imaging
distributions from a number of public Tuberculosis screening datasets with
imagery from geographically distributed regions. However, with the
incorporation of DIFL, the out-of-domain performance is greatly enhanced.
Analysis criteria includes a comparison of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
and AUC over both the baseline, as well as the DIFL enhanced algorithms. We
conclude that DIFL improves generalizability of Tuberculosis screening while
maintaining acceptable accuracy over the source domain imagery when applied
across a variety of public datasets.

unstructured free-text data as well. This paper reviews studies that use
multimodal data, i.e. a combination of structured and unstructured data, from

multimodal EHR studies. Results and Discussion: With the final 94 included

spin and the particle angular momenta, but decrease with an increase of one of
the inductive charge parameter and magnetic field parameter. The radii of
stable circular orbits on the equatorial plane also increase, whereas those of
the innermost stable circular orbits decrease. On the other hand, the effects
of small variations of the parameters on the orbital regular and chaotic

photon circular orbit is of utmost importance. In this work, we derive bounds
on the location of the photon circular orbit around compact objects within the

contrary to the earlier results in the context of general relativity, the bound
on the location of the photon circular orbit is not necessarily an upper bound,
rather depending on the matter content it is possible to arrive at a lower
bound as well. This have interesting implications for the quasi-normal modes
and shadow radius, the two key observables related to the strong field tests of
gravity. Besides discussing the bound for higher dimensional general
relativity, we have also considered how the bound on the photon circular orbits
gets modified in the braneworld scenario, for pure Lovelock and general
Lovelock theories of gravity. Implications of these results for compact objects

While reverse engineering efforts may be able to recover an HDL-netlist of the

portability. Additionally, the recovered design may benefit from other
computational technologies (e.g., $\mu$P, GPGPUs), but is restricted to the
domain of PLDs. In this work, we provide a new framework, vlang, which

especially on the single nanoparticle scale under operating conditions. In this
work, operando single-particle x-ray diffraction (oSP-XRD) is used to observe
single-particle rotation, interlayer spacing, and layer misorientation in a
functional sodium-ion battery. oSP-XRD is applied to
Na$_{2/3}$[Ni$_{1/3}$Mn$_{2/3}$]O$_{2}$, an archetypal P2-type sodium-ion
positive electrode material with the notorious P2-O2 phase transition induced
by sodium (de)intercalation. It is found that during sodium extraction, the
misorientation of crystalline layers inside individual particles increases
before the layers suddenly align just prior to the P2-O2 transition. The
increase in the long-range order coincides with an additional voltage plateau
signifying a phase transition prior to the P2-O2 transition. To explain the
layer alignment, a model for the phase evolution is proposed that includes a
transition from localized to correlated Jahn-Teller distortions. The model is
anticipated to guide further characterization and engineering of sodium-ion
intercalation materials with P2-O2 type transitions. oSP-XRD therefore opens a
powerful avenue for revealing complex phase behavior in heterogeneous

schemes based on distributive relaxation, Braess-Sarazin relaxation, and Uzawa
relaxation, for solving the Stokes equations discretized by the mark-and-cell
scheme. In our earlier work \cite{he2018local}, we discussed these three types
of relaxation schemes, where the weighted Jacobi iteration is used for
inventing the Laplacian involved in the Stokes equations. In
\cite{he2018local}, we show that the optimal smoothing factor is $\frac{3}{5}$
for distributive weighted-Jacobi relaxation and inexact Braess-Sarazin
relaxation, and is $\sqrt{\frac{3}{5}}$ for $\sigma$-Uzawa relaxation. Here, we
propose mass-based approximation inside of these three relaxations, where mass
matrix $Q$ obtained from bilinear finite element method is directly used to
approximate to the inverse of scalar Laplacian operator instead of using Jacobi
iteration. Using local Fourier analysis, we theoretically derive the optimal
smoothing factors for the resulting three relaxation schemes. Specifically,
mass-based distributive relaxation, mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation, and
mass-based $\sigma$-Uzawa relaxation have optimal smoothing factor
$\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$, respectively. Note that
the mass-based relaxation schemes do not cost more than the original ones using
Jacobi iteration. Another superiority is that there is no need to compute the
inverse of a matrix. These new relaxation schemes are appealing.

the obtained bound is tight when the pattern of size $4$ in consideration is
$[1342]$. Using ideas from our general results, we also obtain a complete

must decide between two alternative policies to maximize social welfare (e.g.,
the population mean of an outcome) based on a finite sample. The central
assumption is that the underlying, possibly infinite-dimensional parameter,
lies in a known convex set, potentially leading to partial identification of
the welfare effect. An example of such restrictions is the smoothness of
counterfactual outcome functions. As the main theoretical result, I obtain a
finite-sample decision rule (i.e., a function that maps data to a decision)
that is optimal under the minimax regret criterion. This rule is easy to
compute, yet achieves optimality among all decision rules; no ad hoc
restrictions are imposed on the class of decision rules. I apply my results to
the problem of whether to change a policy eligibility cutoff in a regression
discontinuity setup. I illustrate my approach in an empirical application to
the BRIGHT school construction program in Burkina Faso (Kazianga, Levy, Linden

scores computed from their characteristics. Under reasonable restrictions on
the smoothness of the counterfactual outcome function, the optimal decision
rule implies that it is not cost-effective to expand the program. I empirically
compare the performance of the optimal decision rule with alternative decision
rules.

progress on the face animation task. However, the complex scene structure of a
face image still makes it a challenge to generate videos with face poses
significantly deviating from the source image. On one hand, without knowing the
facial geometric structure, generated face images might be improperly
distorted. On the other hand, some area of the generated image might be
occluded in the source image, which makes it difficult for GAN to generate
realistic appearance. To address these problems, we propose a structure aware
face animation (SAFA) method which constructs specific geometric structures to
model different components of a face image. Following the well recognized
motion based face animation technique, we use a 3D morphable model (3DMM) to
model the face, multiple affine transforms to model the other foreground
components like hair and beard, and an identity transform to model the
background. The 3DMM geometric embedding not only helps generate realistic
structure for the driving scene, but also contributes to better perception of
occluded area in the generated image. Besides, we further propose to exploit
the widely studied inpainting technique to faithfully recover the occluded
image area. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results have shown the
superiority of our method. Code is available at

SiO emission is distributed toward the UCHII ring, where the 4kms-1 component
clumps of CS and H13CO+ also exist. The 12kms-1 component clumps of CS are
detected at the east and west of the UCHII ring with an apparent hole toward
the ring. The clump masses vary from 4.4x10^2 M_SUN to 4.9x10^4 M_SUN with the

derived from the SiO clumps seems significantly higher than those from the
others, probably because the SiO emission is produced in high density shocked
regions. The free fall time scale of the clumps is estimated to be ~3x10^4 yr,
which gives an accretion rate of 3x10-3-1M_SUN yr-1 onto a stellar core. The
observed clumps are, if they are undergoing free fall, capable of producing
dozens of massive stars in the next 10^5 yr. We propose a view that

challenging to achieve accurate modeling, Gaussian approximation can facilitate
the TE assessment only by estimating covariance matrices using multiple data
obtained from simultaneously measured time series representing the activation

nature of biochemical signals makes it difficult to theoretically assess the

resolve this difficulty by computationally assessing the sampling distributions

tested by using them in analyzing data generated from a theoretically tractable
time-varying signal model, which leads to the development of a method to screen
only statistically significant estimates. The usefulness of the developed
method is examined by applying it to real biological data experimentally

analysis of bone adaptation using the well-developed mathematics of geometric

topological changes such as holes forming in plates and rods disconnecting can
be treated formally and simulated naturally. First, the relationship between
biological theories of bone adaptation and the mathematical object describing
geometric flow is described. This is termed the adaptation function, $F$, and
is the multi-scale link described by Frost's Utah paradigm between cellular
dynamics and bone structure. Second, a model of age-related bone loss termed
curvature-based bone adaptation is presented. Using previous literature, it is
shown that curvature-based bone adaptation is the limiting continuous equation
of simulated bone atrophy, a discrete model of bone aging. Interestingly, the
parameters of the model can be defined in such a way that the flow is
volume-preserving. This implies that bone health can in principle change in
ways that fundamentally cannot be measured by areal or volumetric bone mineral
density, requiring structure-level imaging. Third, a numerical method is
described and two in silico experiments are performed demonstrating the
non-volume-preserving and volume-preserving cases. Taken together, recognition
of bone adaptation as a geometric flow permits the recruitment of mathematical

the surrogate model is trained in Phase 1, the optimal control can be inferred

financial predictions and business optimization. Modern datasets can have
multiple correlated time series, which are often generated with global (shared)
regularities and local (specific) dynamics. In this paper, we seek to tackle
such forecasting problems with DeepDGL, a deep forecasting model that
disentangles dynamics into global and local temporal patterns. DeepDGL employs
an encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of two encoders to learn global and
local temporal patterns, respectively, and a decoder to make multi-step
forecasting. Specifically, to model complicated global patterns, the vector
quantization (VQ) module is introduced, allowing the global feature encoder to
learn a shared codebook among all time series. To model diversified and
heterogenous local patterns, an adaptive parameter generation module enhanced
by the contrastive multi-horizon coding (CMC) is proposed to generate the
parameters of the local feature encoder for each individual time series, which
maximizes the mutual information between the series-specific context variable
and the long/short-term representations of the corresponding time series. Our
experiments on several real-world datasets show that DeepDGL outperforms

point cloud \textit{a posteriori} after projecting the imperfect depth data
onto 3D space. Instead, we enhance depth measurements directly on the sensed
images \textit{a priori}, before synthesizing a 3D point cloud. By enhancing
near the physical sensing process, we tailor our optimization to our depth
formation model before subsequent processing steps that obscure measurement

  Specifically, we model depth formation as a combined process of

designed model is validated (with parameters fitted) using collected empirical

sparse linear interpolation. This leads to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) graph

in the ocean, would be greater than that on Earth. In this study, we explore
the effects of extremely high diffusivity on the ocean circulation and surface
climate of Earth-like planets in one asynchronous rotation orbit. The response
of planetary climate to 10 and 100 times greater vertical diffusivity than that
found on Earth is investigated using a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general

modern Earth, Earth's orbit, land-sea configuration, and present levels of

vertical diffusivity intensifies the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
in the ocean, which transports more heat to polar regions and melts sea ice
there. Feedback associated with sea ice, clouds, and water vapor act to further
amplify surface warming. When the vertical diffusivity is 10 (100) times the
present-day value, the magnitude of MOC increases by $\approx$3 (18) times, and
the global-mean surface temperature increases by $\approx$4$^{\circ}$C

$\sigma^-(G)=\min \Sigma^{-}(G)$. In other words, $\sigma^-(G)$ is the smallest

$\Sigma^{-}(G)=\left\{\sigma^{-}(G)\right\}$ if and only if $G$ is $K_{1, n-1}

$rna$ number: for any graph $G$ on $m$ edges and $n$ ($n\geq 4$) vertices,
$\sigma^{-}(G)\leq \lfloor \frac{m}{2}+\frac{n}{4} \rfloor$. We show that
$K_n$, $K_n-e$ and $K_n-\triangle$ are the only three graphs reaching this
bound. This is the first upper bound for the $rna$ number so far. Finally, we
prove that: for any graph $G$, $\sigma^-(G)+\sigma^-(\overline{G})\leq
\sigma^-(G\cup \overline{G})$, where $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G$.

computing the max-flow between all $n\choose 2$ pairs of vertices in an

max-flow algorithm. Even assuming a linear-time max-flow algorithm, this yields
a running time of $O(mn)$, which is $O(n^3)$ when $m = \Theta(n^2)$. While
subsequent work has improved this bound for various special graph classes, no
subcubic-time algorithm has been obtained in the last 60 years for general
graphs. We break this longstanding barrier by giving an $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$-time
algorithm on general, weighted graphs. Combined with a popular complexity
assumption, we establish a counter-intuitive separation: all-pairs max-flows
are strictly easier to compute than all-pairs shortest-paths.
  Our algorithm produces a cut-equivalent tree, known as the Gomory-Hu tree,
from which the max-flow value for any pair can be retrieved in near-constant
time. For unweighted graphs, we refine our techniques further to produce a
Gomory-Hu tree in the time of a poly-logarithmic number of calls to any
max-flow algorithm. This shows an equivalence between the all-pairs and
single-pair max-flow problems, and is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors.
Using the recently announced $m^{1+o(1)}$-time max-flow algorithm (Chen et al.,

attractive type of cover objects due to their high embedding rates. There exist
many techniques for performing steganography in both the literature and the
practical world. Meanwhile, the definition of the steganographic capacity for
multimedia and how to be calculated has not taken full attention. In this
paper, for multivariate quantized-Gaussian-distributed multimedia, we study the
maximum achievable embedding rate with respect to the statistical properties of
cover objects against the maximum achievable performance by any steganalytic
detector. Toward this goal, we evaluate the maximum allowed entropy of the
hidden message source subject to the maximum probability of error of the
steganalytic detector which is bounded by the KL-divergence between the
statistical distributions for the cover and the stego objects. We give the
exact scaling constant that governs the relationship between the entropies of
the hidden message and the cover object.

signal processing and machine vision. Nowadays, hardware solutions based on
emerging nanodevices are designed to reduce the power consumption of these
networks. Spintronics devices are promising for information processing because
of the various neural and synaptic functionalities they offer. However, due to
their low OFF/ON ratio, performing all the multiplications required for
convolutions in a single step with a crossbar array of spintronic memories
would cause sneak-path currents. Here we present an architecture where synaptic
communications have a frequency selectivity that prevents crosstalk caused by
sneak-path currents. We first demonstrate how a chain of spintronic resonators
can function as synapses and make convolutions by sequentially rectifying
radio-frequency signals encoding consecutive sets of inputs. We show that a
parallel implementation is possible with multiple chains of spintronic
resonators to avoid storing intermediate computational steps in memory. We
propose two different spatial arrangements for these chains. For each of them,
we explain how to tune many artificial synapses simultaneously, exploiting the
synaptic weight sharing specific to convolutions. We show how information can
be transmitted between convolutional layers by using spintronic oscillators as
artificial microwave neurons. Finally, we simulate a network of these
radio-frequency resonators and spintronic oscillators to solve the MNIST
handwritten digits dataset, and obtain results comparable to software
convolutional neural networks. Since it can run convolutional neural networks
fully in parallel in a single step with nano devices, the architecture proposed
in this paper is promising for embedded applications requiring machine vision,
such as autonomous driving.

derived. Based on a discrete-time unified individual model of heterogeneous

problem. Therefore, the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) method is used for
derivation. By analyzing the redundancy of all possible constraints in the FME
process, the mathematical expression and calculation method for the exact AFR
is proposed. The number of constraints is linear with the number of resources
and is exponential with the number of time intervals, respectively. The
computational complexity has been dramatically simplified compared with the
original FME. However, the number of constraints in the model is still
exponential and cannot be simplified anymore. Hence, In Part II of this paper,
several approximation methods are proposed and analyzed in detail.

Preserving loss (LSP), which matches local structural relationships defined
over edges across the student and teacher's node embeddings. This paper studies
whether preserving the global topology of how the teacher embeds graph data can
be a more effective distillation objective for GNNs, as real-world graphs often
contain latent interactions and noisy edges. We propose Graph Contrastive
Representation Distillation (G-CRD), which uses contrastive learning to
implicitly preserve global topology by aligning the student node embeddings to
those of the teacher in a shared representation space. Additionally, we
introduce an expanded set of benchmarks on large-scale real-world datasets
where the performance gap between teacher and student GNNs is non-negligible.
Experiments across 4 datasets and 14 heterogeneous GNN architectures show that
G-CRD consistently boosts the performance and robustness of lightweight GNNs,
outperforming LSP (and a global structure preserving variant of LSP) as well as
baselines from 2D computer vision. An analysis of the representational
similarity among teacher and student embedding spaces reveals that G-CRD
balances preserving local and global relationships, while structure preserving

problem encoding and ansatz parametrization, and (iii) run all experiments

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to
improve the signal transmission quality of wireless communications by
controlling the reconfigurable passive elements with less hardware cost and
lower power consumption. However, accurate, low-latency and low-pilot-overhead
channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a considerable challenge in
RIS-assisted systems due to the large number of RIS passive elements. In this
paper, we propose a three-stage joint channel decomposition and prediction
framework to require CSI. The proposed framework exploits the two-timescale
property that the base station (BS)-RIS channel is quasi-static and the
RIS-user equipment (UE) channel is fast time-varying. Specifically, in the
first stage, we use the full-duplex technique to estimate the channel between a
BS's specific antenna and the RIS, addressing the critical scaling ambiguity
problem in the channel decomposition. We then design a novel deep neural
network, namely, the sparse-connected long short-term memory (SCLSTM), and
propose a SCLSTM-based algorithm in the second and third stages, respectively.
The algorithm can simultaneously decompose the BS-RIS channel and RIS-UE
channel from the cascaded channel and capture the temporal relationship of the
RIS-UE channel for prediction. Simulation results show that our proposed
framework has lower pilot overhead than the traditional channel estimation
algorithms, and the proposed SCLSTM-based algorithm can also achieve more
accurate CSI acquisition robustly and effectively.

Though recent advances have been made by incorporating prototype-based metric
learning, existing methods still show limited performance under extreme
intra-class object variations and semantically similar inter-class objects due
to their poor feature representation. To tackle this problem, we propose a dual
prototypical contrastive learning approach tailored to the FSS task to capture
the representative semanticfeatures effectively. The main idea is to encourage
the prototypes more discriminative by increasing inter-class distance while
reducing intra-class distance in prototype feature space. To this end, we first
present a class-specific contrastive loss with a dynamic prototype dictionary
that stores the class-aware prototypes during training, thus enabling the same
class prototypes similar and the different class prototypes to be dissimilar.
Furthermore, we introduce a class-agnostic contrastive loss to enhance the
generalization ability to unseen classes by compressing the feature
distribution of semantic class within each episode. We demonstrate that the
proposed dual prototypical contrastive learning approach outperforms
state-of-the-art FSS methods on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets. The code is

manifested in solar flares and coronal mass ejection. Observations have shown
that the core of eruption-productive regions are often a sheared magnetic
arcade, i.e., a single bipolar configuration, and, particularly, the
corresponding magnetic polarities at the photosphere are elongated along a
strong-gradient polarity inversion line (PIL). It remains unclear what
mechanism triggers the eruption in a single bipolar field and why the one with
a strong PIL is eruption-productive. Recently, using high accuracy simulations,
we have established a fundamental mechanism of solar eruption initiation that a
bipolar field as driven by quasi-static shearing motion at the photosphere can
form an internal current sheet, and then fast magnetic reconnection triggers
and drives the eruption. Here we investigate the behavior of the fundamental
mechanism with different photospheric magnetic flux distributions, i.e.,
magnetograms, by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Our
study shows that the bipolar fields of different magnetograms, as sheared
continually, all exhibit similar evolutions from the slow storage to fast
release of magnetic energy in accordance with the fundamental mechanism, which
demonstrates the robustness of the mechanism. We further found that the
magnetograms with stronger PIL produce larger eruptions, and the key reason is
that the sheared bipolar fields with stronger PIL can achieve more
non-potentiality, and their internal current sheet can form at a lower height
and with a larger current density, by which the reconnection can be more
efficient. This also provides a viable trigger mechanism for the observed
eruptions in active region with strong PIL.

limit the classification performance. To tackle these problems, in this paper,
we propose a novel bilinear pooling and metric learning network (BMNet), which

density distribution (LDD) of electrons of a $p$-initiated shower is due to
superposition of several electromagnetic (EM) sub-showers developed at a very
early stage in the atmosphere from the decay of neutral pions ($\pi^{0}$s).
Thanks to the superposition property of the electron LDD in a $p$ shower, a
plausible analytical parametrization has been worked out by giving well
represented analytic function for the electron LDDs of $p$- and
$\pi^{0}$-initiated showers. Based on cosmic ray extensive air shower
simulations, we have validated how the various characteristics of $s$ can be
understood in the context of the present analytical argument. The $s$ parameter
of a $p$ shower and its correlations with the shower ages of electron- and
$\pi^{0}$-initiated showers supports the idea that the result of superposition
of several EM sub-showers initiated by $\pi^{0}$s with varied energies at a
very early stage might produce the LDD of electrons of a $p$ shower. It is also
noticed with the simulated data that the stated feature still persists

paper, we study two important topics related to the randomized work-stealing
scheduler.
  Our first contribution is a simplified, classroom-ready version of analysis
for the RWS scheduler. The theoretical efficiency of the RWS scheduler has been
analyzed for a variety of settings, but most of them are quite complicated. In
this paper, we show a new analysis, which we believe is easy to understand, and
can be especially useful in education. We avoid using the potential function in
the analysis, and we assume a highly asynchronous setting, which is more
realistic for today's parallel machines.
  Our second and main contribution is some new parallel cache complexity for
algorithms using the RWS scheduler. Although the sequential I/O model has been
well-studied over the past decades, so far very few results have extended it to
the parallel setting. The parallel cache bounds of many existing algorithms are
affected by a polynomial of the span, which causes a significant overhead for
high-span algorithms. Our new analysis decouples the span from the analysis of
the parallel cache complexity. This allows us to show new parallel cache bounds
for a list of classic algorithms. Our results are only a polylogarithmic factor
off the lower bounds, and significantly improve previous results.

SparTen, actively exploit the two-sided or full sparsity, that is, sparsity in
both weights and activations, for performance gains. These accelerators,
however, either have inefficient micro-architecture, which limits their
performance, have no support for non-unit stride convolutions and
fully-connected (FC) layers, or suffer massively from systematic load
imbalance. To circumvent these issues and support both sparse and dense models,
we propose Phantom, a multi-threaded, dynamic, and flexible neural
computational core. Phantom uses sparse binary mask representation to actively
lookahead into sparse computations, and dynamically schedule its computational
threads to maximize the thread utilization and throughput. We also generate a
two-dimensional (2D) mesh architecture of Phantom neural computational cores,
which we refer to as Phantom-2D accelerator, and propose a novel dataflow that
supports all layers of a CNN, including unit and non-unit stride convolutions,
and FC layers. In addition, Phantom-2D uses a two-level load balancing strategy
to minimize the computational idling, thereby, further improving the hardware
utilization. To show support for different types of layers, we evaluate the
performance of the Phantom architecture on VGG16 and MobileNet. Our simulations
show that the Phantom-2D accelerator attains a performance gain of 12x, 4.1x,
1.98x, and 2.36x, over dense architectures, SCNN, SparTen, and Eyeriss v2,

region in the orbital plane of Ceres, we were able to distinguish between
stable and unstable orbits. Subsequently, based on the FLI maps (for mean
anomaly $M=60^\circ$ and also $M=30^\circ$), 500 of the most stable and 500 of
the most unstable particles were integrated for $15\,Myr$ for each map.
Long-term integration in the case of $M=60^\circ$ showed that most of the
stable particles evolved, in general, in uneventful ways with only 0.8\% of
particles reaching the limit of q $\leq$ 1.3 $AU$. However, in the case of
$M=30^\circ$, a stable evolution was not confirmed. Over 40\% of particles
reached orbits with q $\leq$ 1.3 $AU$ and numerous particles were ejected to
hyperbolic orbits or orbits with a > 100 $AU$. The results for stable particles
indicate that short-term FLI maps are more suitable for finding chaotic orbits,
than for detecting the stable ones. A rough estimate shows that it is possible
for material released from Ceres to get to the region of 8:3 MMR with Jupiter.
A long-term integration of unstable particles in both cases showed that
transportation of material via 8:3 MMR close to the Earth is possible.

brings the need of designing algorithms that operate directly on compressed
representations of data. In the compressed pattern matching problem we are
given a compressed representation of the text, with $n$ being the length of the
compressed representation and $N$ being the length of the text, and an
uncompressed pattern of length $m$. The most challenging (and yet relevant when
working with highly repetitive data, say biological information) scenario is
when the chosen compression method is capable of describing a string of
exponential length (in the size of its representation). An elegant formalism

especially in life science, offering non-destructive interaction with matter
due to its low photon energies. However, wavelengths above $100{\mu}m$
principally limit its spatial resolution in the far-field by diffraction to
this regime, making it not sufficient to image biological cells in the
micrometer scale. Therefore, super-resolution imaging techniques are required
to overcome this restriction. Near-field-imaging using spintronic emitters
offers the most feasible approach because of its simplicity and potential for
wide-ranging applications. In our study, we investigate THz-radiation generated
by fs-laser-pulses in CoFeB/Pt heterostructures, based on spin currents,
detected by commercial LT-GaAs Auston switches. The spatial resolution is
evaluated applying a 2D scanning technique with motorized stages allowing
scanning steps in the sub-micrometer range. By applying near-field imaging we
can increase the spatial resolution to the dimensions of the laser spot size in
the micrometer scale. For this purpose, the spintronic emitter is directly
evaporated on a gold test pattern separated by a 300 nm spacer layer. Moving
these structures with respect to the femtosecond laser spot which generates the
THz radiation allows for resolution determination using the knife-edge method.
We observe a full-width half-maximum THz beam diameter of $4.9(4){\mu}$m at 1
THz. The possibility to deposit spintronic emitter heterostructures on simple
glass substrates makes them an interesting candidate for near-field imaging for
a large number of applications.

address the question of whether two naturally associated generating functions

cone; the second series is that of the excursion probabilities P($\tau$ > n, Sn

with a global effort of the combinatorial community to classify the algebraic
nature of the series counting random walks in cones; second, rationality
questions of the generating functions are strongly associated with the
asymptotic behaviors of the above probabilities, which have their own interest.
Using wellknown relations between rationality of a series and possible
asymptotics of its coefficients, recent probabilistic estimates immediately
imply that the excursion generating function is not rational. Regarding the
survival probabilities generating function, we propose a short, elementary and
selfcontained proof that it cannot be rational neither.

such that one can study the quantum-many-body dynamics of atoms moving within

and truncated Wigner theory. Our simulations focus in particular on the
scenario of multiple sequential Rydberg excitations on the same Rubidium

increased the epitaxial strain of the films that are in-plane locked to the

finding optima of expensive functions, has exploded in popularity in recent
years. In particular, much attention has been paid to improving its efficiency
on problems with many parameters to optimize. This attention has trickled down
to the workhorse of high dimensional BO, high dimensional Gaussian process
regression, which is also of independent interest. The great flexibility that
the Gaussian process prior implies is a boon when modeling complicated, low
dimensional surfaces but simply says too little when dimension grows too large.
A variety of structural model assumptions have been tested to tame high
dimensions, from variable selection and additive decomposition to low
dimensional embeddings and beyond. Most of these approaches in turn require
modifications of the acquisition function optimization strategy as well. Here
we review the defining structural model assumptions and discuss the benefits

Universe is biased or deviates from each other. In this work, by comparing the
results derived from IllustrisTNG and WIGEON simulations, we find that many
results obtained from TNG are similar to those from WIGEON data, but
differences between the two simulations do exist. For the ratio of density
power spectrum between dark matter and baryonic matter, as scales become
smaller and smaller, the power spectra for baryons are increasingly suppressed
for WIGEON simulations; while for TNG simulations, the suppression stops at
$k=15-20h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the power spectrum ratios increase when
$k>20h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The suppression of power ratio for WIGEON is also
redshift-dependent. From $z=1$ to $z=0$, the power ratio decreases from about
70% to less than 50% at $k=8h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. For TNG simulation, the
suppression of power ratio is enhanced with decreasing redshifts in the scale
range $k>4h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, but is nearly unchanged with redshifts in $k<4h{\rm

consequence to suppress the power ratio between baryons and dark matter.
Regarding the power suppression for TNG simulations as the norm, the power
suppression by turbulence for WIGEON simulations is roughly estimated to be 45%

spectrum is done by assuming some variations around a single temperature
greybody approximation. For example, the foreground modelling of Planck mission
maps involves a unique dust temperature T along a given line-of-sight with a
unique emissivity index \b{eta}. The two parameters are then fitted and
therefore variable from one line-of-sight to the other. Aims. Our aim is to go
beyond that modelling in an economical way. Methods. We model the dust spectrum
with a temperature distribution around the mean value and show that only the
second temperature moment matters. We advocate the use of the temperature
logarithm as the proper variable. Results. If the interstellar medium is not
too heterogeneous, there is a universal analytical spectrum, which is derived
here, that goes beyond the greybody assumption. We show how the Cosmic
Microwave Background radiatively interacts with the dust spectrum (a
non-negligible corrective term at millimetre wavelengths). Finally, we
construct a universal ladder of discrete temperatures which gives a minimal and
fast description of dust emission spectra as measured by photometric mapping
instruments that lends itself to an almost linear fitting. This data modelling

binary interaction with a stellar or planetary companion is thought to be the

UV radiation originating from a stellar companion in our chemical kinetics
model. The one-dimensional model provides a first approximation of its effects
on the chemistry throughout the outflow. The presence of a close-by stellar
companion can strongly influence the chemistry within the entire outflow. Its
impact depends on the intensity of the radiation (set by the stellar radius and
blackbody temperature) and on the extinction the UV radiation experiences (set
by the outflow density, density structure, and assumed radius of dust
formation). Parent species can be photodissociated by the companion, initiating
a rich photon-driven chemistry in the inner parts of the outflow. The outcome
depends on the balance between two-body reactions and photoreactions. If
two-body reactions dominate, chemical complexity within the outflow increases.
This can make the abundance profiles of daughters appear like those of parents,
with a larger inner abundance and a gaussian decline. If photoreactions
dominate, the outflow can appear molecule-poor. We model three stellar
companions. The impact of a red dwarf companion is limited. Solar-like
companions show the largest effect, followed by a white dwarf. A stellar
companion can also lead to the formation of unexpected species. The outflow's
molecular content, especially combined with abundance profiles, can indicate a
stellar companion's presence. Our results pave the way for further
outflow-specific (three-dimensional) model development.

discovered serendipitously. Here, we present a dynamical study of asteroid 2020

confirmed that it is a new Earth Trojan. However, its eccentric orbit brings it
close encounters with Venus on a frequent basis. Based on our N-body
integration, we found that the asteroid was captured into the current Earth
Trojan status in the 15th century, and then it has a likelihood of 99.5% to
leave the $L_4$ region within the next $\sim$10 kyr. Therefore, it is most
likely that 2020 XL$_5$ is dynamically unstable over this timescale.

Visible-Thermal cross-modal Person Reidentification (VT-ReID), where query and

the modalities in pixel and feature spaces by either using adversarial learning

knowledge. We propose a simple but effective framework, MMD-ReID, that reduces
the modality gap by an explicit discrepancy reduction constraint. MMD-ReID
takes inspiration from Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a widely used
statistical tool for hypothesis testing that determines the distance between
two distributions. MMD-ReID uses a novel margin-based formulation to match
class-conditional feature distributions of visible and thermal samples to
minimize intra-class distances while maintaining feature discriminability.
MMD-ReID is a simple framework in terms of architecture and loss formulation.
We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively the effectiveness of MMD-ReID in aligning the marginal and class
conditional distributions, thus learning both modality-independent and
identity-consistent features. The proposed framework significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets. Code will be

the former considerably, although its origin is purely phenomenological. We use
the Markov Chain Montecarlo method combined with standard statistical

about their market and competition. Focused crawlers meet this demand by
crawling and indexing specific parts of the Web. Critically, a focused crawler
must quickly find new pages that have not yet been indexed. Since a new page
can be discovered only by following a new outlink, predicting new outlinks is
very relevant in practice. In the literature, many feature designs have been
proposed for predicting changes in the Web. In this work we provide a
structured analysis of this problem, using new outlinks as our running
prediction target. Specifically, we unify earlier feature designs in a
taxonomic arrangement of features along two dimensions: static versus dynamic
features, and features of a page versus features of the network around it.
Within this taxonomy, complemented by our new (mainly, dynamic network)
features, we identify best predictors for new outlinks. Our main conclusion is
that most informative features are the recent history of new outlinks on a page
itself, and of its content-related pages. Hence, we propose a new 'look back,
look around' (LBLA) model, that uses only these features. With the obtained
predictions, we design a number of scoring functions to guide a focused crawler
to pages with most new outlinks, and compare their performance. The LBLA
approach proved extremely effective, outperforming other models including those
that use a most complete set of features. One of the learners we use, is the
recent NGBoost method that assumes a Poisson distribution for the number of new
outlinks on a page, and learns its parameters. This connects the two so far
unrelated avenues in the literature: predictions based on features of a page,
and those based on probabilistic modelling. All experiments were carried out on
an original dataset, made available by a commercial focused crawler.

  Function Search",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite achieving great success, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable
to adversarial examples. How to accurately evaluate the adversarial robustness
of DNNs is critical for their deployment in real-world applications. An ideal
indicator of robustness is adversarial risk. Unfortunately, since it involves
maximizing the 0-1 loss, calculating the true risk is technically intractable.
The most common solution for this is to compute an approximate risk by
replacing the 0-1 loss with a surrogate one. Some functions have been used,
such as Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and Difference of Logits Ratio (DLR) loss.
However, these functions are all manually designed and may not be well suited
for adversarial robustness evaluation. In this paper, we leverage AutoML to
tighten the error (gap) between the true and approximate risks. Our main
contributions are as follows. First, AutoLoss-AR, the first method to search
for surrogate losses for adversarial risk, with an elaborate search space, is
proposed. The experimental results on 10 adversarially trained models
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: the risks evaluated using
the best-discovered losses are 0.2% to 1.6% better than those evaluated using
the handcrafted baselines. Second, 5 surrogate losses with clean and readable
formulas are distilled out and tested on 7 unseen adversarially trained models.
These losses outperform the baselines by 0.8% to 2.4%, indicating that they can
be used individually as some kind of new knowledge. Besides, the possible
reasons for the better performance of these losses are explored.

plasma to suppress cross-field thermal conduction, attempting to reduce heat
losses and trap alpha particles to achieve ignition. However, the magnetic
field can introduce other transport effects, some of which are deleterious. An
understanding of these processes is thus crucial for accurate modelling of MIF.
We generalise past work exploiting self-similar solutions to describe transport
processes in planar geometry and compare the model to the
radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Chimera. We solve the 1D extended MHD
equations under pressure balance, making no assumptions about the ratio of
magnetic and thermal pressures in the plasma. The resulting ODE boundary value
problem is solved using a shooting method, combining an implicit ODE solver and
a Newton-Raphson root finder. We show that the Nernst effect dominates over
resistive diffusion in high $\beta$ plasma, but its significance is reduced as
the $\beta$ decreases. On the other hand, we find that Ettingshausen and Ohmic
heating effects are dominant in low $\beta$ plasma, and can be observable in
even order unity $\beta$ plasma, though in the presence of a strong temperature
gradient heat conduction remains dominant. We then present a test problem for
the Ohmic heating and Ettingshausen effects which will be useful to validate
codes modelling these effects. We also observe that the Ettingshausen effect
plays a role in preventing temperature separation when Ohmic heating is strong.
Neglecting this term may lead to overestimates for the electron temperature at
a vacuum-plasma interface, such as at the edge of a z-pinch. The model
developed can be used to provide test problems with arbitrary boundary
conditions for magnetohydrodynamics codes, with the ability to freely switch on
terms to compare their individual implementations.

on the four-dimensional sphere and hyperboloid, we prove properties of any such

the scaling dimension at large $n$ of the $n^\text{th}$ eigenoperator, is
$\lambda_n\propto b\, n\ln n$. The coefficient $b$ is non-universal, a
consequence of the single-metric approximation. The large $R$ limit is
universal on the hyperboloid, but not on the sphere where cutoff dependence
results from certain zero modes. For right-sign conformal mode cutoff, the
fixed points form at most a discrete set. The eigenoperator spectrum is
quantised. They are square integrable under the Sturm-Liouville weight. For
wrong sign cutoff, the fixed points form a continuum, and so do the
eigenoperators unless we impose square-integrability. If we do this, we get a
discrete tower of operators, infinitely many of which are relevant. These are
$f(R)$ analogues of novel operators in the conformal sector which were used
recently to furnish an alternative quantisation of gravity.

single news information, which is insufficient to encode news and user

title, category, and body, to enhance news and user representation. However,
these methods only use various attention mechanisms to fuse multi-view
embeddings without considering deep digging higher-level information contained
in the context. These methods encode news content on the word level and jointly
train the attention parameters in the recommendation network, leading to more
corpora being required to train the model. We propose an Event Extraction-based
News Recommendation (EENR) framework to overcome these shortcomings, utilizing
event extraction to abstract higher-level information. EENR also uses a
two-stage strategy to reduce parameters in subsequent parts of the
recommendation network. We train the Event Extraction module by external
corpora in the first stage and apply the trained model to the news
recommendation dataset to predict event-level information, including event
types, roles, and arguments, in the second stage. Then we fuse multiple channel
information, including event information, news title, and category, to encode
news and users. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that our
EENR method can effectively improve the performance of news recommendations.
Finally, we also explore the reasonability of utilizing higher abstract level
information to substitute news body content.

only learn the graph up to a ""Markov equivalence class"" (MEC). The remaining
undirected edges have to be oriented using interventions, which can be very
expensive to perform in applications. Thus, the problem of minimizing the
number of interventions needed to fully orient the MEC has received a lot of
recent attention, and is also the focus of this work. Our first result is a new
universal lower bound on the number of single-node interventions that any
algorithm (whether active or passive) would need to perform in order to orient
a given MEC. Our second result shows that this bound is, in fact, within a
factor of two of the size of the smallest set of single-node interventions that
can orient the MEC. Our lower bound is provably better than previously known
lower bounds. Further, using simulations on synthetic graphs and by giving
examples of special graph families, we show that our bound is often
significantly better. To prove our lower bound, we develop the notion of
clique-block shared-parents (CBSP) orderings, which are topological orderings
of DAGs without v-structures and satisfy certain special properties. We also
use the techniques developed here to extend our results to the setting of

article, we describe and discuss the two primary enforcement mechanisms

systems are expected to conduct, and the post-market monitoring plans that
providers must establish to document the performance of high-risk AI systems

promise to promote diversification and thus limit losses in times of financial
turmoil. However, recent studies have reported a significant level of
redundancy between these factors, which might enhance risk contagion among
multi-factor portfolios during financial crises. Therefore, it is of
fundamental importance to better understand the relationships among factors.
  Empowered by recent advances in causal structure learning methods, this paper
presents a study of the causal structure of financial risk factors and its
evolution over time. In particular, the data we analyze covers 11 risk factors
concerning the US equity market, spanning a period of 29 years at daily
frequency.
  Our results show a statistically significant sparsifying trend of the
underlying causal structure. However, this trend breaks down during periods of
financial stress, in which we can observe a densification of the causal network
driven by a growth of the out-degree of the market factor node. Finally, we
present a comparison with the analysis of factors cross-correlations, which
further confirms the importance of causal analysis for gaining deeper insights
in the dynamics of the factor system, particularly during economic downturns.
  Our findings are especially significant from a risk-management perspective.
They link the evolution of the causal structure of equity risk factors with
market volatility and a worsening macroeconomic environment, and show that, in
times of financial crisis, exposure to different factors boils down to exposure
to the market risk factor.

of metal vapor active media excited by a contracted discharge. We develop the
technique for constructing the leading term of the semiclassical asymptotics of
the Cauchy problem solution for the kinetic equation under the supposition of
weak diffusion. In terms of the approach developed, the local cubic nonlinear
term in the original kinetic equation is considered in a nonlocal form. This
allows one to transform the nonlinear nonlocal kinetic equation to an
associated linear partial differential equation with a given accuracy of the
asymptotic parameter using the dynamical system of moments of the desired
solution of the equation. The Cauchy problem solution for the nonlinear
nonlocal kinetic equation can be obtained from the solution of the associated
linear partial differential equation and some algebraic equations for the
coefficients of the linear equation. Within the developed approach, the plasma
relaxation in metal vapor active media is studied with asymptotic solutions
expressed in terms of higher transcendental functions. The qualitative analysis
of such the solutions is given.

resources they require become an obstacle for practitioners to develop their
own models. It has become common to collect data from the Internet or hire a
third party to train models. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that
these operations provide a viable pathway for maliciously injecting hidden
backdoors into DNNs. Several defense methods have been developed to detect
malicious samples, with the common assumption that the latent representations
of benign and malicious samples extracted by the infected model exhibit
different distributions. However, a comprehensive study on the distributional
differences is missing. In this paper, we investigate such differences
thoroughly via answering three questions: 1) What are the characteristics of
the distributional differences? 2) How can they be effectively reduced? 3) What
impact does this reduction have on difference-based defense methods? First, the
distributional differences of multi-level representations on the regularly
trained backdoored models are verified to be significant by introducing Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Energy Distance (ED), and Sliced Wasserstein Distance
(SWD) as the metrics. Then, ML-MMDR, a difference reduction method that adds
multi-level MMD regularization into the loss, is proposed, and its
effectiveness is testified on three typical difference-based defense methods.
Across all the experimental settings, the F1 scores of these methods drop from
90%-100% on the regularly trained backdoored models to 60%-70% on the models
trained with ML-MMDR. These results indicate that the proposed MMD
regularization can enhance the stealthiness of existing backdoor attack
methods. The prototype code of our method is now available at
https://github.com/xpf/Multi-Level-MMD-Regularization.

inescapable issue is the definition of temperature. We examine and compare
different possible ways of assigning temperatures to energies or equivalently
to eigenstates in such systems. A commonly used assignment of temperature in
the context of thermalization is based on the canonical energy-temperature
relationship, which depends only on energy eigenvalues and not on the structure
of eigenstates. For eigenstates, we consider defining temperature by minimizing
the distance between (full or reduced) eigenstate density matrices and
canonical density matrices. We show that for full eigenstates, the minimizing
temperature depends on the distance measure chosen and matches the canonical
temperature for the trace distance; however, the two matrices are not close.
With reduced density matrices, the minimizing temperature has fluctuations that
scale with subsystem and system size but appears to be independent of distance
measure. In particular limits, the two matrices become equivalent while the
temperature tends to the canonical temperature.

here show that the radius $r_p$ of photon sphere increased with cosmological
parameter $\alpha$ and dark matter parameter $\beta$, while the impact

thin-disk accretion, it turns out that the total observed intensity are mainly
composed of the direct emission, while lensing ring and photon ring only
contribute a small contribution and a negligible contribution, respectively.
And, we find that shadow and rings exhibit some different and interesting

infalling spherical accretions, it is obvious that the size of shadow is always

part of attack tree analysis is computing metrics. This paper focuses on
dynamic attack trees and their min time metric, i.e. the minimal time to attack
a system. For general attack trees, calculating min time efficiently is an open
problem, with the fastest current method being enumerating all minimal attacks,
which is NP-hard. This paper presents three tools for calculating min time.
First, we introduce a novel method for general dynamic attack trees based on
mixed integer linear programming. Second, we show how the computation can be
sped up by identifying the modules of an attack tree, i.e. subtrees connected
to the rest of the attack tree via only one node. Finally, we define a general
semantics for dynamic attack trees that significantly relaxes the restrictions
on attack trees compared to earlier work, allowing us to apply our methods to a
wide variety of attack trees. Experiments on both a case study of a server
cluster and a synthetic testing set of large attack trees verify that both the
integer linear programming approach and modular analysis considerably decrease
the computation time of attack time analysis.

paradigmatic selfsimilar model for anomalous diffusion. Specifically, varying
its Hurst exponent, FBM spans: sub-diffusion, regular diffusion, and
super-diffusion. As BM, also FBM is a symmetric and Gaussian process, with a
continuous trajectory, and with a stationary velocity. In contrast to BM, FBM
is neither a Markov process nor a martingale, and its velocity is correlated.
Based on a recent study of selfsimilar Ito diffusions, we explore an
alternative selfsimilar model for anomalous diffusion: fractional Ito motion
(FIM). The FIM model exhibits the same Hurst-exponent behavior as FBM, and it
is also a symmetric process with a continuous trajectory. In sharp contrast to
FBM, we show that FIM: is not a Gaussian process; is a Markov process; is a
martingale; and its velocity is not stationary and is not correlated. On the
one hand, FBM is hard to simulate, its analytic tractability is limited, and it
generates only a Gaussian dissipation pattern. On the other hand, FIM is easy
to simulate, it is analytically tractable, and it generates non-Gaussian
dissipation patterns. Moreover, we show that FIM has an intimate linkage to
diffusion in a logarithmic potential. With its compelling properties, FIM
offers researchers and practitioners a highly workable analytic model for

image is downscaled, it is difficult to be reconstructed via upscaling due to
the loss of information. To make these two processes more compatible and
improve the reconstruction performance, some efforts model them as a joint
encoding-decoding task, with the constraint that the downscaled (i.e. encoded)
low-resolution (LR) image must preserve the original visual appearance. To
implement this constraint, most methods guide the downscaling module by
supervising it with the bicubically downscaled LR version of the original
high-resolution (HR) image. However, this bicubic LR guidance may be suboptimal
for the subsequent upscaling (i.e. decoding) and restrict the final
reconstruction performance. In this paper, instead of directly applying the LR
guidance, we propose an additional invertible flow guidance module (FGM), which
can transform the downscaled representation to the visually plausible image
during downscaling and transform it back during upscaling. Benefiting from the
invertibility of FGM, the downscaled representation could get rid of the LR
guidance and would not disturb the downscaling-upscaling process. It allows us
to remove the restrictions on the downscaling module and optimize the
downscaling and upscaling modules in an end-to-end manner. In this way, these
two modules could cooperate to maximize the HR reconstruction performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve
state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both downscaled and reconstructed
images.

  nitride from a macroscopic phonon model","18 pages and 9 figures",,"10.1063/5.0081262",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phonon polaritons (PhPs) in freestanding and supported multilayers (MuLs) of
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are systematically studied using a macroscopic
optical-phonon model. The PhP properties such as confinement, group velocity,
propagation quality factor (PQF) and wavelength scaling are studied. Owing to
the nonlocal high-frequency screening, there is an upper frequency limit making
the two-dimensional (2D) PhPs have a frequency band, and also a maximum PQF
occurs near the centre frequency. The substrate's dielectric response should be
included to accurately calculate the PhP properties. While the simple
electrostatic approximation (ESA) is a proper treatment for PhP frequencies
$\omega$ above $\omega_0$ (e.g. $\omega>1.03\omega_0$ for the 30-layers;
$\omega_0$ is the $\Gamma$ point optical phonon frequency), it fails to
describe the PhP properties near $\omega_0$ and the effect of retardation
should be included for an accurate description. The PhP wavelength versus the
layer thickness near $\omega_0$ deviates significantly from a linear scaling
law given by the ESA due to strong phonon-photon coupling. The calculated PhP
dispersion, PQF and scaling are compared with experimental data of a number of
spectroscopic studies and good agreement is obtained. While the frequency of
incident light should be near the centre frequency to maximize the PQF, the PhP
wavelength, confinement and propagation length can be engineered by varying the
MuL thickness and its dielectric environment.

quality of the 3D FRONSAC images was evaluated using structural similarity

FRONSAC encoding did not significantly modify the contrast obtained in either

based processing, we demonstrate a super large (~ 0.75 mm^2), UV-Vis broadband
(365-633 nm), phototransistor made of WS_2 QDs decorated CVD graphene as active
channel with extraordinary stability and durability in ambient condition
(without any degradation of photocurrent till 4 months after fabrication).
Here, colloidal 0D WS_2-QDs are used as the photo absorbing material and
graphene acts as the conducting channel. A high photoresponsivity (3.1 x 10^2
A/W), higher detectivity (2.2 x 10^12 Jones) and low noise equivalent power (4
x 10^{-14} W/Hz^0.5) are obtained at a low bias voltage (V_{ds} = 1V) at an
illumination of 365 nm with an optical power as low as 0.8 \mu W/cm^2, which
can further be tuned by modulating the gate bias. While comparing the
photocurrent between two different morphologies of WS_2 (QDs and 2D
nanosheets), a significant enhancement of photocurrent is observed in case of
QDs based device. Ab initio density functional theory based calculations
further support our observation, revealing the role of quantum confinement for
the enhanced photo response. Our work reveals a strategy towards making a
scalable, cost-effective, highly performing hybrid two-dimensional (2D/0D)
photo detector with graphene-WS_2 QDs, paving the way towards the next
generation optoelectronic applications.

be observable via their atmospheres. Here, we investigate secondary volcanic
atmospheres as a key base case of how atmospheres may reflect planetary
geochemistry. We couple volcanic outgassing with atmospheric chemistry models
to simulate the growth of C-O-H-S-N atmospheres in thermochemical equilibrium,
focusing on what information about a planet's mantle fO$_2$ and bulk silicate
H/C ratio could be determined by atmospheric observation. 800K volcanic
atmospheres develop distinct compositional groups as the mantle fO$_2$ is
varied, which can be identified using sets of (often minor) indicator species:
Class O, representing an oxidised mantle and containing SO$_2$ and sulfur
allotropes; Class I, formed by intermediate mantle fO$_2$'s and containing
CO$_2$, CH$_4$, CO and COS; and Class R, produced by reduced mantles,
containing H$_2$, NH$_3$ and CH$_4$. These atmospheric classes are robust to a
wide range of bulk silicate H/C ratios. However, the H/C ratio does affect the
dominant atmospheric constituent, which can vary between H$_2$, H$_2$O and
CO$_2$ once the chemical composition has stabilised to a point where it no
longer changes substantially with time. This final atmospheric state is
dependent on the mantle fO$_2$, the H/C ratio, and time since the onset of
volcanism. The atmospheric classes we present are appropriate for the
closed-system growth of hot exoplanets, and may be used as a simple base for
future research exploring the effects of other open-system processes on
secondary volcanic atmospheres.

Including general relativity for the radiation driving, we also show that the
radiation field is affected by strong gravitational field in non linear manner,
making general relativistic analysis more significant. We obtained internal
shocks in jets close to the base, as a result of non-conical cross section and
nature of radiation field on jet dynamics. Theoretical evidence of internal
shocks is significant, as these are required to explain high energy tail of the
spectra of radio sources. Under thermal and radiative driving, jets with
electron-positron composition are obtained to be achieving relativistic speeds
up to Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 10$ while for electron-proton composition it
is $\gamma \sim 2$ for luminous discs. We also showed that extragalactic jets
around AGNs are faster than those around microquasars. We obtain that through
Compton scattering, relativistic jets generated with non relativistic
temperatures, are efficiently heated by temperatures up to $T \sim 10^{11-12}
\rm K$. Further, we obtained transonic solutions with relativistic terminal
speeds, for bound state of the jet at the base (that is, generalized Bernoulli
parameter $E < 1$), where gravity is dominant over thermal driving. In Thomson
scattering regime no transonic solutions could be obtained. This shows that
radiation, in fact, has greater role as it not only accelerates the unbound
matter of the jets, but the acceleration is effective even in absence of any
other accelerating agent such as thermal acceleration. A detailed analysis of
dependence of jet variables upon various parameters like plasma composition,
magnetic pressure in the disc, luminosity, accretion rate, jet geometry and jet

identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for
reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many
quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing
gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations
required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which
VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The
answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE
to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as
the noise levels are reduced.

Specifically, previous works employ implicit differentiation and solve the
exact gradient for the backward propagation. However, is it necessary to
compute such an exact but expensive gradient for training? In this work, we
propose a novel gradient estimate for implicit models, named phantom gradient,
that 1) forgoes the costly computation of the exact gradient; and 2) provides
an update direction empirically preferable to the implicit model training. We
theoretically analyze the condition under which an ascent direction of the loss
landscape could be found, and provide two specific instantiations of the
phantom gradient based on the damped unrolling and Neumann series. Experiments
on large-scale tasks demonstrate that these lightweight phantom gradients
significantly accelerate the backward passes in training implicit models by
roughly 1.7 times, and even boost the performance over approaches based on the
exact gradient on ImageNet.

the Universe, implying tantalizing hints of new physics beyond the Standard
Model. In this paper, we consider a simple flavor-specific two-Higgs-doublet
model, where the long-standing $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies can be addressed by a
one-flavor right-handed neutrino. One of the intriguing predictions resulting
from the parameter space for the $R_{K^{(*)}}$ resolution under flavor- and
collider-physics constraints points toward a shift of the effective neutrino
number, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}=N_{\rm eff}-N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$, as favored to
ease the $H_0$ tension. Depending on whether the neutrino is of Dirac or of
Majorana type, we show that the resulting shift is $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq
1.0$ for the former and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq 0.5$ for the latter case,
respectively. While the Dirac case is disfavored by the CMB polarization
measurements, the Majorana solution is consistent with the recent studies via a
combined data set from various sources. Consequently, such a simple
flavor-specific two-Higgs-doublet model provides a link between the
$R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies and the $H_0$ tension, which in turn can be readily
verified or falsified by the upcoming measurements.

risk-averse optimization problems governed by differential equations (ODEs
and/or PDEs) under uncertainty. As an example, we focus on the so-called
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), but the approach is equally applicable to
other coherent risk measures. Both the full and reduced space formulations are
considered. The algorithm is based on low rank tensor approximations of random
fields discretized using stochastic collocation. To avoid non-smoothness of the
objective function underpinning the CVaR, we propose an adaptive strategy to
select the width parameter of the smoothed CVaR to balance the smoothing and
tensor approximation errors. Moreover, unbiased Monte Carlo CVaR estimate can
be computed by using the smoothed CVaR as a control variate. To accelerate the
computations, we introduce an efficient preconditioner for the KKT system in
the full space formulation.The numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method enables accurate CVaR optimization constrained by large-scale
discretized systems. In particular, the first example consists of an elliptic
PDE with random coefficients as constraints. The second example is motivated by
a realistic application to devise a lockdown plan for United Kingdom under
COVID-19. The results indicate that the risk-averse framework is feasible with
the tensor approximations under tens of random variables.

There are, however, models predicting that interactions of high energy

They could be observed as some number of correlated air showers of relatively

Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) is to search for CRE using all
available data from different detectors and observatories including even small
but numerous detectors spread over large areas.
  Interpretation of such measurements require precise information on properties
of EAS in a very wide energy spectrum. Low energy EAS are analysed using events
from CORSIKA, the program performing air shower simulations. The primary cosmic
ray particle energy range extends from 1TeV up to 4000TeV. The secondary
particles at the ground level are studied in order to obtain their density
fluctuations and correlations in location. Although the fluctuations observed
in multiplicity distributions are consistent with random the more detailed
analysis reveals that near a selected particle the density of other particles
is enhanced over that expected in the absence of correlations. The results of
this analysis may be useful in further calculations, for example to obtain

the 6x2pt approach to the traditional one using only galaxy clustering and some
recently proposed combinations of galaxy and supernovae data and quantify the
possible gains by optimally extracting the linear information. We show that the
6x2pt method shrinks the uncertainty area in the $\sigma_8, \gamma$ plane by
more than half when compared to the traditional method. The combined clustering
and velocity data on the growth of structures has uncertainties at similar
levels to those of the CMB but exhibit orthogonal degeneracies, and the
combined constraints yield improvements of factors of 5 in each of the five
cosmological parameters here considered. Concerning the model-independent
results, we find that our method can improve the constraints on $H(z)/H_0$ in

an extended data set for six pulsars (DR2) and reported evidence for a common
red noise signal. Here we present a noise analysis for each of the six pulsars.
We consider several types of noise: (i) radio frequency independent,
""achromatic"", and time-correlated red noise; (ii) variations of dispersion
measure and scattering; (iii) system and band noise; and (iv) deterministic
signals (other than gravitational waves) that could be present in the PTA data.
We perform Bayesian model selection to find the optimal combination of noise
components for each pulsar. Using these custom models we revisit the presence
of the common uncorrelated red noise signal previously reported in the EPTA DR2
and show that the data still supports it with a high statistical significance.
Next, we confirm that there is no preference for or against the Hellings-Downs
spatial correlations expected for the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
The main conclusion of the EPTA DR2 paper remains unchanged despite a very
significant change in the noise model of each pulsar. However, modelling the
noise is essential for the robust detection of gravitational waves and its
impact could be significant when analysing the next EPTA data release, which
will include a larger number of pulsars and more precise measurements.

critical tasks, such as inspection and quality control. Distributed Data
Validation Networks (DDVNs) are used to validate the quality of the data.
However, they are prone to single points of failure when an attack occurs. This
paper proposes QUDOS, an approach that enhances the security of a distributed
DNN that is supported by DDVNs using quorums. The proposed approach allows
individual nodes that are corrupted due to an attack to be detected or excluded
when the DNN produces an output. Metrics such as corruption factor and success
probability of an attack are considered for evaluating the security aspects of
DNNs. A simulation study demonstrates that if the number of corrupted nodes is
less than a given threshold for decision-making in a quorum, the QUDOS approach
always prevents attacks. Furthermore, the study shows that increasing the size
of the quorum has a better impact on security than increasing the number of
layers. One merit of QUDOS is that it enhances the security of DNNs without
requiring any modifications to the algorithm and can therefore be applied to
other classes of problems.

interesting observation is the azimuthal anisotropy of the dilepton production,

external field. The competition between the centrifugal effect and the spin
polarization effect due to rotation results in a convex down behaviour of the

  Green deep learning is an increasingly hot research field that appeals to
researchers to pay attention to energy usage and carbon emission during model
training and inference. The target is to yield novel results with lightweight
and efficient technologies. Many technologies can be used to achieve this goal,
like model compression and knowledge distillation. This paper focuses on
presenting a systematic review of the development of Green deep learning
technologies. We classify these approaches into four categories: (1) compact

  In the horizontal rectangle stabbing problem (STABBING), the goal is to find
a set of horizontal line segments of minimum total length such that all

total length such that all rectangles are stabbed. Both variants are NP-hard.
Chan, van Dijk, Fleszar, Spoerhase, and Wolff [2018]initiated the study of

Eisenbrand, Gallato, Svensson, and Venzin [2021] have presented a QPTAS and a

for special cases of HV-Stabbing: (i) when all rectangles are squares, (ii)
when each rectangle's width is at most its height, and (iii) when all
rectangles are $\delta$-large, i.e., have at least one edge whose length is at
least $\delta$, while all edge lengths are at most 1. Our result also implies
improved approximations for other problems such as generalized minimum

furthermore show that harmless interpolation can occur in more general settings

galaxies (LTGs) is founded upon image decomposition into a S\'ersic model for
the central luminosity excess of the bulge and an exponential model for the
underlying disk. We argue that the standard practice of adopting an exponential
model for the disk all the way to its center is inadequate because it
implicitly neglects the fact of star formation (SF) quenching (SFQ) in the
centers of LTGs. Extrapolating the fit for the observable star-forming zone of
the disk (outside the bulge) inwardly overestimates the true surface brightness
of the disk in its SF-quenched central zone. We refer to this effect as Dio.
The primary consequence of the neglect of Dio in bulge-disk decomposition
studies is the oversubtraction of the disk underneath the bulge, leading to a
systematic underestimation of the luminosity of the latter. Framed in the
picture of galaxy downsizing and inside-out SFQ, Dio is expected to
differentially impact galaxies across redshift and stellar mass M*, thus
leading to systematic and complex biases in the scatter and slope of various
galaxy scaling relations. We conjecture that correction for Dio will lead to a
downbending of the bulge vs. super-massive black hole (SMBH) relation for
galaxies below log(M*/Msolar)~10.7. A decreasing M(SMBH)/M* ratio with
decreasing M* would help consistently explain the scarcity and weakness of
accretion-powered nuclear activity in low-mass spiral galaxies. A well
detectable Dio (~2 r mag) can emerge early on through inward migration of SF
clumps from the disk in combination with a strong contrast of emission-line
equivalent widths between the quenched proto-bulge and its SF periphery.
Spatially resolved studies with the JWST, ELT, and Euclid could therefore offer
key insights into the chronology and physical drivers of SFQ in the early phase
of galaxy assembly. (abridged)

into account the physical limitation of the surface in the stabilization trend,
a more advanced level of reliability is achieved that provides higher
functionalities such as push recovery on low-friction surfaces and prevents the
stabilizer from overreacting. The discrete event-based strategy consists of
modifying the step length and time period at the beginning of each footstep in
order to reestablish stability necessary conditions while taking into account
the surface friction limitation as a constraint to prevent slippage. Adjusting
footsteps to prevent slippage in confronting external disturbances is perceived
as a novel strategy for keeping stability, quite similar to human reaction. The
developed methodology consists of rough closed-form solutions utilizing
elementary math operations for obtaining the control inputs, allowing to reach
a balance between convergence and computational cost, which is quite suitable
for real-time operations even with modest computational hardware. Several
numerical simulations, including push recovery and switching between different
gates on low-friction surfaces, are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed controller. In correlation with human-gait experience, the
results also reveal some physical aspects favoring stability and the fact of
switching between gaits to reduce the risk of falling in confronting different

practice, the robot will not reside exactly on the reference at the impact

reaching the target contact state, but velocity feedback is disabled as this

reset to 0 and all other neurons receive an additional amount of potential

successive spikes, each neuron's potential follows a deterministic flow. In a
previous article we proved the convergence of the system, as $N \to \infty$, to
a limit nonlinear jumping stochastic differential equation. In the present

critical for its development to term and would be valuable in assessing the
potential of human embryos. However, tracking polarization requires invasive
fluorescence staining, impermissible in the in vitro fertilization clinic.
Here, we report the use of artificial intelligence to detect polarization from
unstained time-lapse movies of mouse embryos. We assembled a dataset of
bright-field movie frames from 8-cell-stage embryos, side-by-side with
corresponding images of fluorescent markers of cell polarization. We then used
an ensemble learning model to detect whether any bright-field frame showed an
embryo before or after onset of polarization. Our resulting model has an
accuracy of 85% for detecting polarization, significantly outperforming human
volunteers trained on the same data (61% accuracy). We discovered that our
self-learning model focuses upon the angle between cells as one known cue for
compaction, which precedes polarization, but it outperforms the use of this cue
alone. By compressing three-dimensional time-lapsed image data into
two-dimensions, we are able to reduce data to an easily manageable size for
deep learning processing. In conclusion, we describe a method for detecting a
key developmental feature of embryo development that avoids clinically
impermissible fluorescence staining.

that occurs due to a blockage of the coronary arteries feeding the myocardium.
An early diagnosis of MI and its localization can mitigate the extent of
myocardial damage by facilitating early therapeutic interventions. Following
the blockage of a coronary artery, the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA)
of the ischemic myocardial segments is the earliest change to set in.
Echocardiography is the fundamental tool to assess any RWMA. Assessing the
motion of the left ventricle (LV) wall only from a single echocardiography view
may lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that
specific view. Therefore, in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber
(A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which a total of 12 myocardial
segments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates
the motion of the LV wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track
the endocardial boundary to compute myocardial segment displacements. The
features are extracted from the A4C and A2C view displacements, which are
concatenated and fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions
of this study are 1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C
and A2C views in a total of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly
shared with the research community, 2) improving the performance of the prior
work of threshold-based APs by a Machine Learning based approach, and 3) a
pioneer MI detection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the
information of A4C and A2C views. Experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves 90.91% sensitivity and 86.36% precision for MI detection over

intelligence in the medical field. The digital pathology platform can make the
pathological resources digital and networked, and realize the permanent storage
of visual data and the synchronous browsing processing without the limitation
of time and space. It has been widely used in various fields of pathology.
However, there is still a lack of an open and universal digital pathology
platform to assist doctors in the management and analysis of digital
pathological sections, as well as the management and structured description of
relevant patient information. Most platforms cannot integrate image viewing,
annotation and analysis, and text information management. To solve the above
problems, we propose a comprehensive and extensible platform PIMIP. Our PIMIP
has developed the image annotation functions based on the visualization of
digital pathological sections. Our annotation functions support multi-user
collaborative annotation and multi-device annotation, and realize the
automation of some annotation tasks. In the annotation task, we invited a
professional pathologist for guidance. We introduce a machine learning module
for image analysis. The data we collected included public data from local
hospitals and clinical examples. Our platform is more clinical and suitable for
clinical use. In addition to image data, we also structured the management and
display of text information. So our platform is comprehensive. The platform
framework is built in a modular way to support users to add machine learning
modules independently, which makes our platform extensible.

companion separation distribution as a whole is double peaked and inconsistent
with the separation distribution of solar-type field stars, while the

field stars. The multiplicity statistics and companion separation distributions

also find that MFs/CFs may rise from Class 0 to Flat Spectrum protostars

evidence for migration of companions from $>$10$^3$~au to $<$10$^3$~au, and
that some companions between 10$^3$ and 10$^4$~au must be (or become) unbound.

particle in a cooling granular gas. Predictions and model assumptions range
from the conventional to very exotic dependence of the mean square distance
(MSD) on time. This problem is addressed here by calculating the MSD from
first-principles. The calculation is based on random-walking and it circumvents
the common use of continuum equations and equations of states, which involve
approximations that erode at low gas particle densities. The MSD is found to
increase logarithmically with time -- slower than even in anomalous diffusion.
This result is consistent with the well-established Haff's law for the decay of
the kinetic energy, which is also derived along the way from the same first
principles. This derivation also pins down Haff's time constant, alleviating
the usual need for a fitting parameter. The diffusion theory is then used to
calculate explicitly the time evolution of any initial particle velocity
distribution, yielding an unusual functional form. The limitations of the
theory are discussed and extensions to it are outlined.

of study. The model is based on external stimuli, the location of which are
chosen (\textbf{I}) randomly, (\textbf{II}) on the faults, (\textbf{III}) on
the highly active points in the region. We analyze all these cases and show
some universal behaviors of the system depending slightly on the method of
external stimuli. The multi-fractal analysis is exploited to extract the
spectrum of the Hurst exponent of time series obtained by each of these
schemes. Although the average Hurst exponent depends on the method of stimuli
(the three cases mentioned above), we numerically show that in all cases it is
lower than $0.5$, reflecting the anti-correlated nature of the system. The
lowest average Hurst exponent is for the case (\textbf{III}), in such a way
that the more active the stimulated sites are the lower the value for the
average Hurst exponent is obtained, i.e. the larger earthquakes are more
anticorrelated. However, the different activity fields in this study provide
the depth of the basement, the depth variation (topography) of the basement,

first, the model is capable of considering spatial and temporal dependencies in

modules; second, it enables capturing the influence of heterogeneous temporal
data streams that can signal flooding status, including physics-based features

Hurricane Harvey as the flood event. Results indicate that the model provides
superior performance for the nowcasting of urban flood inundation at the census
tract level, with a precision of 0.808 and a recall of 0.891, which shows the

show how double-plane lenses can be distinguished from single-plane lenses by

proposing techniques to detect (or classify) rumours. In the descriptive line
of works, where researchers have tried to analyse rumours using NLP approaches,
there isnt much emphasis on psycho-linguistics analyses of social media text.
These kinds of analyses on rumour case studies are vital for drawing meaningful
conclusions to mitigate misinformation. For our analysis, we explored the
PHEME9 rumour dataset (consisting of 9 events), including source tweets (both
rumour and non-rumour categories) and response tweets. We compared the rumour
and nonrumour source tweets and then their corresponding reply (response)
tweets to understand how they differ linguistically for every incident.
Furthermore, we also evaluated if these features can be used for classifying
rumour vs. non-rumour tweets through machine learning models. To this end, we
employed various classical and ensemble-based approaches. To filter out the
highly discriminative psycholinguistic features, we explored the SHAP AI
Explainability tool. To summarise, this research contributes by performing an
in-depth psycholinguistic analysis of rumours related to various kinds of
events.

  Isotopes","15 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.105.044309",,"nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The region around the doubly magic nuclide $^{100}Sn$ is very interesting for
nuclear physics studies in terms of structure, reaction and nuclear
astrophysics. The main ingredients in nuclear structure studies using the shell
model are the single-particle energies and the two-body matrix elements. To
obtain the former, experimental data of $^{101}Sn$ isotope spectrum are
necessary. Since there is not enough experimental data, different approaches
are used in the literature to obtain single-particle energies. In sn100pn
interaction, the hole excitation spectrum was used in $^{131}Sn$ to determine
neutron single-particle energies. The other approach is the use of the lightest
isotope, $^{107}Sn$, which figures the model space orbitals. In this study, we
estimated the spectrum of the $^{101}Sn$ isotope by artificial neural network
method in order to obtain neutron single-particle energies. After the training
was carried out by using the experimental spectra of the nuclei around
$^{100}Sn$ isotope, the $^{101}Sn$ spectrum was obtained. Subsequently, neutron
SPEs of the model space orbitals are defined. Shell model calculations for
$^{102-108}Sn$ isotopes are carried out and results are compared to the
experimental data and results obtained using the widely used interaction in the
region, sn100pn. According to the results, it is seen that the Sn isotope
spectra obtained with the new SPE values are more compatible with the
experimental data.
