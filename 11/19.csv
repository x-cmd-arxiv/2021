multipartite systems that cannot be distinguished by local operations and
classical communication. We first present two constructions of nonlocal
orthogonal product states in tripartite systems
$\mathcal{C}^{d}\otimes\mathcal{C}^{d}\otimes\mathcal{C}^{d}~(d\geq3)$ and
$\mathcal{C}^d\otimes \mathcal{C}^{d+1}\otimes \mathcal{C}^{d+2}~(d\geq 3)$.
Then for general tripartite quantum system
$\mathcal{C}^{n_{1}}\otimes\mathcal{C}^{n_{2}}\otimes\mathcal{C}^{n_{3}}$
$(3\leq n_{1}\leq n_{2}\leq n_{3})$, we obtain $2(n_{2}+n_{3}-1)-n_{1}$
nonlocal orthogonal product states. Finally, we put forward a new construction
approach in $\mathcal{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes \mathcal{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes\cdots\otimes
\mathcal{C}^{d_{n}}$ $(d_1,d_2,\cdots d_n\geq3,\, n>6)$ multipartite systems.
Remarkably, our indistinguishable sets contain less nonlocal product states
than the existing ones, which improves the recent results and highlights their
related applications in quantum information processing.

quantum computation. A powerful approach is to use multi-qubit network nodes
which provide the quantum memory and computational power to perform
entanglement distillation, quantum error correction, and information
processing. Nuclear spins associated with optically-active defects in diamond
are promising qubits for this role. However, their dephasing during
entanglement distribution across the optical network hinders scaling to larger
systems. In this work, we show that a single 13C spin in isotopically
engineered diamond offers a long-lived quantum memory that is robust to the
optical link operation of an NV centre. The memory lifetime is improved by two
orders-of-magnitude upon the state-of-the-art, and exceeds the best reported
times for remote entanglement generation. We identify ionisation of the NV
centre as a newly limiting decoherence mechanism. As a first step towards
overcoming this limitation, we demonstrate that the nuclear spin state can be
retrieved with high fidelity after a complete cycle of ionisation and
recapture. Finally, we use numerical simulations to show that the combination
of this improved memory lifetime with previously demonstrated entanglement
links and gate operations can enable key primitives for quantum networks, such
as deterministic non-local two-qubit logic operations and GHZ state creation
across four network nodes. Our results pave the way for test-bed quantum
networks capable of investigating complex algorithms and error correction.

financial industry. Over the past 20 years several attempts to include VaR in
the portfolio selection process have been proposed. However, using VaR as a
risk measure in portfolio optimization models leads to problems that are
computationally hard to solve. In view of this, few practical applications of
VaR in portfolio selection have appeared in the literature up to now. In this
paper, we propose to add the VaR criterion to the classical Mean-Variance
approach in order to better address the typical regulatory constraints of the
financial industry. We thus obtain a portfolio selection model characterized by
three criteria: expected return, variance, and VaR at a specified confidence
level. The resulting optimization problem consists in minimizing variance with
parametric constraints on the levels of expected return and VaR. This model can
be formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem. An
extensive empirical analysis on seven real-world datasets demonstrates the
practical applicability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the
out-of-sample performance of the optimal Mean-Variance-VaR portfolios seems to
be generally better than that of the optimal Mean-Variance and Mean-VaR
portfolios.

demonstrate that wiggling the weights consistently improves classification, we
choose a standard network and modify it to a transform-augmented network. On

networks to sample from observed distributions, also known as aleatoric or
residual uncertainty. Sampling from both distributions enables probabilistic

synaptic failure alone. We first define a biologically constrained neural
network and sampling scheme based on synaptic failure and lateral inhibition.
Within this framework, we derive drop-out based epistemic uncertainty, then
prove an analytic mapping from synaptic efficacy to release probability that
allows networks to sample from arbitrary, learned distributions represented by
a receiving layer. Second, our result leads to a local learning rule by which
synapses adapt their release probabilities. Our result demonstrates complete

the formation of stars and planetary systems by providing sources of heating

nuclear enrichment of our own Solar System, the goal of this paper is to
estimate the distributions of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) for the entire
population of stars forming within a molecular cloud. Here we focus on the
nuclear species $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al, which have the largest impact due to
their relatively high abundances. We construct molecular cloud models and
include nuclear contributions from both supernovae and stellar winds. The
resulting distributions of SLRs are time dependent with widths of $\sim3$
orders of magnitude and mass fractions $\rho_{\scriptstyle
SLR}/\rho_\ast\sim10^{-11}-10^{-8}$. Over the range of scenarios explored
herein, the SLR distributions show only modest variations with the choice of
cloud structure (fractal dimension), star formation history, and cluster
distribution. The most important variation arises from the diffusion length
scale for the transport of SLRs within the cloud. The expected SLR
distributions are wide enough to include values inferred for the abundances in
our Solar System, although most of the stars are predicted to have smaller
enrichment levels. In addition, the ratio of $^{60}$Fe/$^{26}$Al is predicted
to be greater than unity, on average, in contrast to Solar System results. One
explanation for this finding is the presence of an additional source for the
$^{26}$Al isotope.

univariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a
logarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the
quantum setting. Indeed, Heinrich ruled out the existence of a quantum
advantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller
than the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision
regime, there is a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator.
Our approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting,
where most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a
variety of additional algorithmic techniques such as amplitude amplification,
the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation.
Our analysis also uses concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated
statistics.
  We develop our quantum estimators in two different input models that showed
up in the literature before. The first one provides coherent access to the
binary representation of the random variable and it encompasses the classical
setting. In the second model, the random variable is directly encoded into the
phases of quantum registers. This model arises naturally in many quantum
algorithms but it is often incomparable to having classical samples. We adapt
our techniques to these two settings and we show that the second model is
strictly weaker for solving the mean estimation problem. Finally, we describe
several applications of our algorithms, notably in measuring the expectation
values of commuting observables and in the field of machine learning.

likelihood of the association between PSR J1734$-$3333 and G354.8$-$0.8 or
other nearby supernova remnants quantitatively, with the objective of shedding
light on the real age of this pulsar. Observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array were carried out in 2015 and 2019 that allow precise astrometric
measurements and consequently a proper motion estimate for the pulsar. The
proper motion was found to be $\mu_\alpha=10\pm10$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and
$\mu_\delta=-29\pm11$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (error bars are $1$-$\sigma$). Though
marginal, this detection rules out the association with G354.8$-$0.8 because it
means the pulsar is not moving away from the centre of the SNR. No SNR
consistent with the measured proper motion and an age $\sim\tau_c$ could be
found. We also present the first measurement of the spectral index for this
pulsar, $\alpha=-1.1\pm0.3$, measured between $1.5$ and $3.0$ GHz. The SNR
produced by the birth supernova of PSR J1734$-$3333 could have already faded to
undetectable brightness, for which estimates suggest timescales of $10$-$100$
kyr. This and other considerations lead us to conclude that the pulsar is
possibly older than $45$-$100$ kyr. PSR J1734$-$3333 is a pulsar with
rotational properties that place it between standard radio pulsars and
magnetars, and we interpret our result in the context of a possible future life
as a magnetar for this pulsar.

between an informed agent (the sender) and uninformed decision makers (the
receivers). The current rapidly-growing literature mostly assumes a dichotomy:
either the sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each
receiver (a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at
all (a.k.a. public persuasion). We study a model that smoothly interpolates
between the two, by considering a natural multi-channel communication structure
in which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication
channels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information
spillover is almost inevitable.
  We completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the
sender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility
universally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The
characterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one
receiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same
channels. We prove that a communication structure $M_1$ is (weakly) better than
$M_2$ if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in $M_1$ is
also such in $M_2$. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's
signaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of
information-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that
finding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is,
generally, computationally harder than under both public and private

time variable in a wave-type equation create a time-reversed focusing wave. We
consider the time-dependent three-dimensional Maxwell's equations, coupled to
Drude's model for the description of the surface current. The time mirror is
modeled by a sudden, strong, change in the Drude weight of the electrons on the

quantify the quality of refocusing. We establish that the latter depends on the
distance of the source to the sheet, and on some physical parameters such as
the relaxation time of the electrons. We also show that, in addition to the
plasmonic wave, the time mirror generates a free propagating wave that offers,
contrary to the surface wave, some resolution in the direction orthogonal to
the sheet. Blurring effects due to non-instantaneous mirrors are finally
investigated.

realistic pandemic scenarios with strongly varying situations, these model
parameters need to be assumed as time-dependent. While parameter estimation for
the typical case of time-constant parameters does not pose larger issues, the
determination of time-dependent parameters, e.g.~the transition rates of
compartmental models, remains notoriously difficult, in particular since the

Smoother in combination with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to
simultaneously estimate all time-dependent parameters in an SIRD compartmental

DICE provably reduces the output variance for OOD data, resulting in a sharper

studies of single-track laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) scans of AISI 316L
stainless steel, finite element analyses, and large-scale three-dimensional
discrete dislocation dynamics simulations to provide a unique understanding of
the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation of heterogeneous defect
structures in additively manufactured metals. Our results show that the
interruption of dislocation slip at solidification cell walls is responsible
for the formation of cellular dislocation structures, highlighting the
significance of solute segregation for plastic deformation of additively
manufactured components. This work provides a mechanistic perspective on
heterogeneous microstructure formation and opens the potential for a reliable
prediction of the resulting mechanical properties of additively manufactured
parts.

using a low-cost cubesat mission. The Belgian-led ESA CubeSpec mission is
specifically designed to provide space-based, low-cost spectroscopy with
specific capabilities that can be optimised for a particular science need.
Approved as an ESA in-orbit demonstrator, the CubeSpec satellite's primary
science objective will focus on obtaining high-cadence, high resolution optical
spectroscopic data to facilitate asteroseismology of pulsating massive stars.
Aims. In this first paper, we aim to search for pulsating massive stars
suitable for the CubeSpec mission, specifically $\beta$ Cep stars, which
typically require time series spectroscopy to identify the geometry of their
pulsation modes. Methods. Based on the science requirements needed to enable
asteroseismology of massive stars with the capabilities of CubeSpec's
spectrograph, we combine a literature study for pulsation with the analysis of
recent high-cadence time series TESS photometry to classify the variability for
stars brighter than V < 4 mag and between O9 and B3 in spectral type. Results.
Among the 90 stars that meet our magnitude and spectral type requirements, we
identify 23 promising $\beta$ Cep stars with high-amplitude (non-)radial
pulsation modes with frequencies below 7 d$^{-1}$. Using further constraints on
projected rotational velocities, pulsation amplitudes and number of pulsation
modes, we devise a prioritised target list for the CubeSpec mission according
to its science requirements and the potential of the targets for
asteroseismology. The full target catalogue further provide a modern TESS-based
review of line profile and photometric variability properties among bright
O9-B3 stars.

resolve this issue, we develop a general-purpose analytical ratio-quality model
based on the prediction-based lossy compression framework, which can
effectively foresee the reduced data quality and compression ratio, as well as
the impact of the lossy compressed data on post-hoc analysis quality. Our
analytical model significantly improves the prediction-based lossy compression
in three use-cases: (1) optimization of predictor by selecting the best-fit
predictor; (2) memory compression with a target ratio; and (3) in-situ
compression optimization by fine-grained error-bound tuning of various data
partitions. We evaluate our analytical model on 10 scientific datasets,
demonstrating its high accuracy (93.47% accuracy on average) and low
computational cost (up to 18.7X lower than the trial-and-error approach) for
estimating the compression ratio and the impact of lossy compression on
post-hoc analysis quality. We also verified the high efficiency of our
ratio-quality model using different applications across the three use-cases. In
addition, the experiment demonstrates that our modeling based approach reduces
the time to store the 3D Reverse Time Migration data by up to 3.4X over the
traditional solution using 128 CPU cores from 8 compute nodes.

increases the more strongly the closer the superconductor temperature has

and, coupled with an analysis of the user access rate, we optimize the
placement of the RRHs. This model allows us to formulate the location
optimization problem with a statistical constraint on fronthaul outage. Our
results are cautionary, showing that the fronthaul requires considerable
bandwidth to enable joint service to users. This requirement can be relaxed by
serving a low number of users on the same RB. Additionally, we show that, with
a fixed number of antennas, for the multicast fronthaul, it is prudent to
concentrate these antennas on a few RRHs. However, for the ZF beamforming
fronthaul, it is better to distribute the antennas on more RRHs. For the
parameters chosen, using a ZF beamforming fronthaul improves the typical access
rate by approximately 8% compared to multicast. Crucially, our work quantifies

provide new control parameters to probe different theoretical aspects. In the
theory of glassy dynamics, different length scales play pivotal roles. Here,
for the first time, we present results for the static length scale, $\xi_S$, in
an active glass via large-scale molecular dynamics simulations for model active
glasses in three spatial dimensions. We show that although the relaxation
dynamics are equilibrium-like, activity has non-trivial effects on $\xi_S$.
$\xi_S$ plays the central role in the random first-order transition (RFOT)
theory. Thus, our work provides critical tests for the active RFOT theory, a
phenomenological extension of its equilibrium counterpart. We find that the two
exponents, $\theta$ and $\psi$, within the theory, become activity-dependent,
exposing the non-trivial effects of activity on $\xi_S$. However, the
combination of $\theta$ and $\psi$, which controls the relaxation dynamics,
remains nearly independent of activity leading to the effectively
equilibrium-like behavior. Interestingly, $\xi_S$ shows higher growth in an
active glass; this should help better comparison of theories with simulations
and experiments.

of these algorithms remain largely unexplored. This is concerning considering
that, even under simplifying assumptions such as causal sufficiency, the
statistical risk of a model can differ significantly from its \textit{causal
risk}. Here, we study the problem of \textit{causal generalization} --
generalizing from the observational to interventional distributions -- in
forecasting. Our goal is to find answers to the question: How does the efficacy
of an autoregressive (VAR) model in predicting statistical associations compare
with its ability to predict under interventions?
  To this end, we introduce the framework of \textit{causal learning theory}
for forecasting. Using this framework, we obtain a characterization of the
difference between statistical and causal risks, which helps identify sources
of divergence between them. Under causal sufficiency, the problem of causal
generalization amounts to learning under covariate shifts, albeit with
additional structure (restriction to interventional distributions under the VAR
model). This structure allows us to obtain uniform convergence bounds on causal
generalizability for the class of VAR models. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees for causal
generalization in the time-series setting.

initialization can provide a means of combining their respective capabilities.
In this paper, we take the perspective that this ""merging"" operation can be
seen as choosing parameters that approximately maximize the joint likelihood of
the posteriors of the models' parameters. Computing a simple average of the
models' parameters therefore corresponds to making an isotropic Gaussian
approximation to their posteriors. We develop an alternative merging procedure
based on the Laplace approximation where we approximate each model's posterior
as a Gaussian distribution whose precision matrix corresponds to its Fisher
information. We first show that our ""Fisher merging"" technique provides a
performance boost in settings where simple parameter averaging is currently
used -- specifically, robust fine-tuning and model ensembling. Then, we compare
merging to standard gradient-based transfer learning and demonstrate that
merging enables a fundamentally different method for transferring capabilities
across models. Specifically, we show that Fisher merging is competitive with
gradient-based transfer learning approaches (while being significantly cheaper)
in intermediate-task training and domain-adaptive pre-training. We also show
that our merging procedure makes it possible to combine models in previously
unexplored ways. We release our code to facilitate future research into methods
for merging models.

the same as the ratio proposed in input interpolation. This may lead to a
strange phenomenon that sometimes there is no valid object in the mixed image

label space. To bridge such gap between the input and label spaces, we propose
TransMix, which mixes labels based on the attention maps of Vision
Transformers. The confidence of the label will be larger if the corresponding
input image is weighted higher by the attention map. TransMix is embarrassingly
simple and can be implemented in just a few lines of code without introducing
any extra parameters and FLOPs to ViT-based models. Experimental results show
that our method can consistently improve various ViT-based models at scales on
ImageNet classification. After pre-trained with TransMix on ImageNet, the
ViT-based models also demonstrate better transferability to semantic

halos, which drive sustained particle losses and result in gradual degradation
of accelerating structures. In large part, the growth of halos is facilitated
by internal space-charge forces within the beams, and detailed characterization
of this process constitutes an active area of ongoing research. A partial
understanding of dynamics that ensue within space-charge dominated beams is
presented by the particle-core interaction paradigm -- a mathematical model
wherein single particle dynamics, subject to the collective potential of the
core, are treated as a proxy for the broader behavior of the beam. In this
work, we investigate the conditions for the onset of large-scale chaos within
the framework of this model, and demonstrate that the propensity towards
stochastic evolution is strongly dependent upon the charge distribution of the
beam. In particular, we show that while particle motion within a uniformly
charged beam is dominantly regular, rapid deterministic chaos readily arises
within space-charge dominated Gaussian beams. Importantly, we find that for
sufficiently high values of the beam's space charge and beam pulsation
amplitude, enhanced chaotic mixing between the core and the halo can lead to an
enhanced radial diffusion of charged particles. We explain our results from
analytic grounds by demonstrating that chaotic motion is driven by the
intersection of two principal resonances of the system, and derive the relevant
overlap conditions. Additionally, our analysis illuminates a close connection
between the mathematical formulation of the particle-core interaction model and
the Andoyer family of integrable Hamiltonians.

degrees downstream of the break. There are significant differences in the

  arXiv:2107.08249",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Simultaneously evolving morphologies (bodies) and controllers (brains) of
robots can cause a mismatch between the inherited body and brain in the
offspring. To mitigate this problem, the addition of an infant learning period
by the so-called Triangle of Life framework has been proposed relatively long
ago. However, an empirical assessment is still lacking to-date. In this paper
we investigate the effects of such a learning mechanism from different
perspectives. Using extensive simulations we show that learning can greatly
increase task performance and reduce the number of generations required to
reach a certain fitness level compared to the purely evolutionary approach.
Furthermore, although learning only directly affects the controllers, we
demonstrate that the evolved morphologies will be also different. This provides
a quantitative demonstration that changes in the brain can induce changes in
the body. Finally, we examine the concept of morphological intelligence
quantified by the ability of a given body to learn. We observe that the
learning delta, the performance difference between the inherited and the
learned brain, is growing throughout the evolutionary process. This shows that
evolution is producing robots with an increasing plasticity, that is,
consecutive generations are becoming better and better learners which in turn
makes them better and better at the given task. All in all, our results
demonstrate that the Triangle of Life is not only a concept of theoretical
interest, but a system architecture with practical benefits.

follow here a slightly different approach in which one first selects key blocks

attracted the attention of the wireless communication community as a potential
candidate for the next $6$-th generation (6G) of wireless networks. Various
studies have been carried out on the RIS technology, which is capable of
enabling the control of the signal propagation environment by network
operators. However, when an RIS is used in its inherently passive structure, it
appears to be only a supportive technology for communications, while suffering
from a multiplicative path loss. Therefore, researchers have lately begun to
focus on RIS hardware designs with minimal active elements to further boost the
benefits of this technology. In this paper, we present a simple RIS hardware
architecture including a single and variable gain amplifier for reflection
amplification to confront the multiplicative path loss. The end-to-end signal
model for communication systems assisted with the proposed amplifying RIS
design is presented, together with an analysis focusing on the capacity
maximization and theoretical bit error probability performance, which is
corroborated by computer simulations. In addition, the major advantages of the
proposed amplifying RIS design compared to its passive counterpart are
discussed. It is shown that the proposed RIS-based wireless system
significantly eliminates the double fading problem appearing in conventional
passive RIS-assisted systems and improves the communication energy efficiency.

environment and apply this understanding to achieve a breadth of goals. This
problem, known as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), becomes
especially challenging for long-horizon goals. Current methods have tackled
this problem by augmenting goal-conditioned policies with graph-based planning
algorithms. However, they struggle to scale to large, high-dimensional state
spaces and assume access to exploration mechanisms for efficiently collecting
training data. In this work, we introduce Successor Feature Landmarks (SFL), a
framework for exploring large, high-dimensional environments so as to obtain a
policy that is proficient for any goal. SFL leverages the ability of successor
features (SF) to capture transition dynamics, using it to drive exploration by
estimating state-novelty and to enable high-level planning by abstracting the
state-space as a non-parametric landmark-based graph. We further exploit SF to
directly compute a goal-conditioned policy for inter-landmark traversal, which
we use to execute plans to ""frontier"" landmarks at the edge of the explored
state space. We show in our experiments on MiniGrid and ViZDoom that SFL
enables efficient exploration of large, high-dimensional state spaces and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-horizon GCRL tasks.

includes multiple statistical methods, such as principal component analysis,
correlation analysis as well as linear and binary regression analysis.
  Results: The results show a positive interrelation between collaboration and
innovation, indicating that coworkers are able to improve their innovative
capabilities by making use of strategic partnerships in coworking spaces.
Further, this study shows that business models are significantly affected by
the level of collaboration in coworking spaces, which suggests that coworking

represents the first empirical investigations which focuses on the effects of
collaboration on a firm-level in coworking spaces.
  Practical implications: The results indicate that organizations in coworking
spaces should embrace a collaborative mindset and should actively seek out
collaborative alliances and partnerships, as doing such is shown to increase
their innovativeness and/or develop their business model.
  Future Research: Future research should focus on the antecedents of
collaboration or could investigate the effects of collaboration in coworking

We find that magnification cannot be ignored in any single or combined

biases exist in the 3x2pt and cosmic shear from magnification of the shear

Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, will require detailed
simulation and advanced reconstruction algorithms to explore and maximise the
physics reach of proposed detector solutions. The optimisation process will
require maximal flexibility in changing detector geometries, materials and
sensitive areas, and efficient tools to quantify the overall performance. To
synergise such developments the CEPC, CLIC, FCC, ILC and SCT communities have
engaged in the commissioning of a `Turnkey Software Stack' (Key4hep), which
would provide all the necessary ingredients, from simulation to analysis, for
future experiments. This approach is based on the positive experience of the
linear collider projects ILC and CLIC, which have developed and used a common
software stack (iLCSoft) over the last decade. Key4hep aims to cover most, if
not all, future linear and circular machines colliding leptons (electrons,
muons), and hadrons. The common software ecosystem will facilitate writing
specific components for experiments ensuring coherency and maximising the
re-use of established solutions. Project-specific software frameworks will
require adaptation to fully profit from the common software base. In this essay
we present the status and plans for re-framing the FCC software framework,
FCCSW, around Key4hep and discuss the challenges associated with the

extremely difficult to synthesize photo-realistic and highly diverse images,
while acquiring representative characters of the target. Different from
existing approaches that adopt the vanilla fine-tuning strategy, we import two
lightweight modules to the generator and the discriminator respectively.
Concretely, we introduce an attribute adaptor into the generator yet freeze its
original parameters, through which it can reuse the prior knowledge to the most
extent and hence maintain the synthesis quality and diversity. We then equip
the well-learned discriminator backbone with an attribute classifier to ensure
that the generator captures the appropriate characters from the reference.
Furthermore, considering the poor diversity of the training data (i.e., as few
as only one image), we propose to also constrain the diversity of the
generative domain in the training process, alleviating the optimization
difficulty. Our approach brings appealing results under various settings,
substantially surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives, especially in terms of
synthesis diversity. Noticeably, our method works well even with large domain
gaps, and robustly converges within a few minutes for each experiment.

method for solving forward and inverse problems governed by partial

Here, we extend this framework to PDE-constrained optimal control problems, for
which the governing PDE is fully known and the goal is to find a control
variable that minimizes a desired cost objective. We provide a set of
guidelines for obtaining a good optimal control solution; first by selecting an
appropriate PINN architecture and training parameters based on a forward
problem, second by choosing the best value for a critical scalar weight in the
loss function using a simple but effective two-step line search strategy. We
then validate the performance of the PINN framework by comparing it to
adjoint-based nonlinear optimal control, which performs gradient descent on the
discretized control variable while satisfying the discretized PDE. This
comparison is carried out on several distributed control examples based on the
Laplace, Burgers, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Navier-Stokes equations. Finally,

When we define the
problem the robot needs to solve, we pretend that a designer specifies this
complex reward exactly, and it is set in stone from then on. In practice,
however, reward design is an iterative process: the designer chooses a reward,
eventually encounters an ""edge-case"" environment where the reward incentivizes
the wrong behavior, revises the reward, and repeats. What would it mean to
rethink robotics problems to formally account for this iterative nature of
reward design? We propose that the robot not take the specified reward for
granted, but rather have uncertainty about it, and account for the future
design iterations as future evidence. We contribute an Assisted Reward Design
method that speeds up the design process by anticipating and influencing this
future evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually encounter failure
cases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes the designer to
such environments during the development phase. We test this method in a
simplified autonomous driving task and find that it more quickly improves the
car's behavior in held-out environments by proposing environments that are

to exhibit a quantum anomaly, where a classical scale and conformal invariance
is broken by quantum effects at strong coupling. We argue that in a quasi
two-dimensional geometry, a conformal window remains at weak interactions.
Using degenerate perturbation theory, we verify the conformal symmetry by
computing the energy spectrum of mesoscopic particle ensembles in a harmonic
trap, which separates into conformal towers formed by so-called primary states
and their center-of-mass and breathing-mode excitations, the latter having
excitation energies at precisely twice the harmonic oscillator energy. In
addition, using Metropolis importance sampling, we compute the hyperradial
distribution function of the many-body wave functions, which are predicted by
the conformal symmetry in closed analytical form. The weakly interacting Fermi
gas constitutes a system where the nonrelativistic conformal symmetry can be
revealed using elementary methods, and our results are testable in current
experiments on mesoscopic Fermi gases.

is important in a wide range of physical processes including solidification,
growth of biological tissues, environmental processes, and additive
manufacturing. The description of accretion requires the addition of new
continuum particles to the body, and is therefore challenging for standard
continuum formulations for solids that require a reference configuration.
Recent work has proposed an Eulerian approach to this problem, enabling the
side-stepping of the issue of constructing the reference configuration.
However, this raises the complementary challenge of determining the stress
response of the solid, which typically requires the deformation gradient that
is not immediately available in the Eulerian formulation. To resolve this, the
approach introduced the elastic deformation as an additional kinematic
descriptor of the added material, and its evolution has been shown to be
governed by a transport equation. In this work, the method of characteristics
is applied to solve concrete simplified problems motivated by biomechanics and
manufacturing. Specifically, (1) for a problem with both ablation and accretion
in a fixed domain, and (2) for a problem with a time-varying domain, the
closed-form solution is obtained in the Eulerian framework using the method of
characteristics without explicit construction of the reference configuration.

exponentially in time in most cases, quickly becoming unmanageable. New methods
reduce the memory required by selectively discarding/dissipating parts of the
many-body wavefunction which are expected to have little effect on the
hydrodynamic observables typically of interest: for example, some methods
discard fine-grained correlations associated with $n$-point functions, with $n$
exceeding some cutoff $\ell_*$. In this work, we present a theory for the sizes
of `backflow corrections', i.e., systematic errors due to discarding this
fine-grained information. In particular, we focus on their effect on transport
coefficients. Our results suggest that backflow corrections are exponentially
suppressed in the size of the cutoff $\ell_*$. Moreover, the backflow errors
themselves have a hydrodynamical expansion, which we elucidate. We test our
predictions against numerical simulations run on random unitary circuits and
ergodic spin-chains. These results lead to the conjecture that transport

they describe the same set of entities, and this raises concerns when data from
multiple sources must be joined or cross-referenced. Such a formatting mismatch
is unavoidable when data is gathered from various public and third-party
sources. Commercial database systems are not able to perform the join when
there exist differences in data representation or formatting, and manual
reformatting is both time consuming and error-prone. We study the problem of
efficiently joining textual data under the condition that the join columns are
not formatted the same and cannot be equi-joined, but they become joinable
under some transformations. The problem is challenging simply because the
number of possible transformations explodes with both the length of the input
and the number of rows, even if each transformation is formed using very few
basic units. We show that an efficient algorithm can be developed based on the
common characteristics of the joined columns, and develop one such algorithm
over a rich set of basic operations that can be composed to form
transformations. We compare both the coverage and the running time of our
algorithm to a state-of-the-art approach, and show that our algorithm covers
every transformation that is covered in the state-of-the-art approach but is a
few orders of magnitude faster, as evaluated on various real and synthetic

information processing in which almost all advanced protocols would profit from
high-efficiency logic gates.

high-resolution transit transmission spectroscopy by resolving time-dependent

time in iron absorption in WASP-76b. Here, we search for other atoms/ions in

We detect Li I, Na I, Mg I, Ca II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Fe I, Ni I, and Sr II, and
tentatively detect H I, K I, and Co I, of which V, Cr, Ni, Sr II, and Co have
not been reported before. We notably do not detect Ti or Al, even though these

the detected species can be explained in different ways. We find a relation
between the expected condensation or ionization temperatures and the strength
of the observed asymmetry, which could indicate rain-out or recombination on
the nightside. However, we also find a dependence on the signal broadening,
which could imply a two-zoned atmospheric model, in which the lower atmosphere
is dominated by a day-to-night wind, while the upper atmosphere is dominated by
a vertical wind or outflow. These observations provide a new level of modeling

spectra of chaotic systems. Depending on symmetry with respect to time reversal
and the presence or absence of a spin 1/2 there are three ensembles, the
Gaussian orthogonal (GOE), Gaussian unitary (GUE), and Gaussian symplectic
(GSE) one. With a further particle-antiparticle symmetry the chiral variants of
these ensembles, the chiral orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles (the
BDI, AIII, and CII in Cartan's notation) appear which are the main point of
interest in this paper. Following a recently published work on chiral random
matrix ensembles and their experimental realizations (Rehemanjiang et al., PRL
124, 116801 (2020)), this is achieved by using dielectric cylinders placed
between two parallel aluminium plates. These cylinders act as microwave
resonators which are used to create tight-binding chains of finite length up to
N=5. The different ensembles are achieved by using different types of
couplings: For the orthogonal case spatial proximity is used, for the unitary
case microwave circulators are used, and for the symplectic case a combination
of circulators and cables is used to create the necessary symmetry. In all
cases the predicted repulsion behavior between positive and negative
eigenvalues for energies close to zero are verified by a comparison with theory
taking the finite size of the systems into account. We will show that the
difference to the expected universal behavior is given by logarithmic
corrections only. These corrections stem from the Hamiltonians having zero

is a particular case. In this regard, the errors are assumed to be distributed
according to a finite-variance $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian distribution.
Based on the probabilistic maximum-likelihood method we derive a
$\kappa$-objective function associated with the finite-variance
$\kappa$-Gaussian distribution. To demonstrate our proposal's
outlier-resistance, we analyze the robustness properties of the
$\kappa$-objective function with help of the so-called influence function. In
this regard, we discuss the role of the entropic index ($\kappa$) associated
with the Kaniadakis $\kappa$-entropy in the effectiveness in inferring physical
parameters by using strongly noisy data. In this way, we consider a classical
geophysical data-inverse problem in two realistic circumstances, in which the
first one refers to study the sensibility of our proposal to uncertainties in
the input parameters, and the second is devoted to the inversion of a seismic
data set contaminated by outliers. The results reveal an optimum $\kappa$-value
at the limit $\kappa \rightarrow 2/3$, which is related to the best results.

networks must be allowed to explore their action space to discover new
potentially viable solutions. However, in an online learning scenario with
physical hardware, this exploration must be constrained by relevant safety
considerations in order to avoid damage to the agent's hardware and
environment. We aim to address this problem by training a neural network, which
we will refer to as a ""safety network"", to estimate the region of attraction
(ROA) of a controlled autonomous dynamical system. This safety network can
thereby be used to quantify the relative safety of proposed control actions and
prevent the selection of damaging actions. Here we present our development of
the safety network by training an artificial neural network (ANN) to represent
the ROA of several autonomous dynamical system benchmark problems. The training
of this network is predicated upon both Lyapunov theory and neural solutions to
partial differential equations (PDEs). By learning to approximate the viscosity
solution to a specially chosen PDE that contains the dynamics of the system of
interest, the safety network learns to approximate a particular function,
similar to a Lyapunov function, whose zero level set is boundary of the ROA. We

  Interference and Outcome-Oriented Targets With Repeated Cross-Sectional
  Surveys",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  When developing allocation policies for infectious disease prevention,
policymakers often set outcome-oriented targets and measure the policy's
progress with repeated cross-sectional surveys. For example, the United
Nations' Integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhea (GAPPD)
recommended increasing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) resources to
reduce childhood diarrhea incidence and outlined a specific level of diarrhea
incidence to achieve. For policymakers, the goal is to design an allocation
rule that optimally allocates WASH resources to meet the outcome targets.
  The paper develops methods to estimate an optimal allocation rule that
achieves these pre-defined outcome-oriented targets using repeated
cross-sectional surveys. The estimated allocation rule helps policymakers
optimally decide what fraction of units in a region should get the resources
based on its characteristics. Critically, our estimated policies account for
spillover effects within regions in the form of partial interference, and we
characterize the policies' performance in terms of excess risk. We apply our
methods to design Senegal's WASH policy to prevent diarrheal diseases using the
2014-2017 Demographic and Health Survey. We show that our policy not only
outperforms competing policies but also provides new insights about how Senegal
should design WASH policies to achieve its outcome targets.

price based on customer and/or product features. Often only historical sales
data are available, so we observe whether a customer purchased a product at the
price prescribed rather than the customer's true valuation. Such observational
data are influenced by historical pricing policies, which introduce
difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of future policies. The goal of
this paper is to formulate loss functions that can be used for evaluating
pricing policies directly from observational data, rather than going through an
intermediate demand estimation stage, which may suffer from bias. To achieve
this, we adapt ideas from machine learning with corrupted labels, where we
consider each observed purchase decision as a known probabilistic
transformation of the customer's valuation. From this transformation, we derive
a class of unbiased loss functions. Within this class, we identify minimum
variance estimators and estimators robust to poor demand estimation.
Furthermore, we show that for contextual pricing, estimators popular in the
off-policy evaluation literature fall within this class of loss functions. We
offer managerial insights into scenarios under which these estimators are
effective.

hence vulnerable to large-scale code-reuse attacks, such as Jump-Oriented
Programming (JOP) attacks. Compiler-based diversification improves the
resilience of software systems by automatically generating different assembly
code versions of a given program. Existing techniques are efficient but do not
have a precise control over the quality of the generated variants. This paper
introduces Diversity by Construction (DivCon), a constraint-based approach to
software diversification. Unlike previous approaches, DivCon allows users to
control and adjust the conflicting goals of diversity and code quality. A key
enabler is the use of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) to generate highly
diverse code efficiently. For larger problems, we propose a combination of LNS
with a structural decomposition of the problem. To further improve the
diversification efficiency of DivCon against JOP attacks, we propose an
application-specific distance measure tailored to the characteristics of JOP
attacks. We evaluate DivCon with 20 functions from a popular benchmark suite
for embedded systems. These experiments show that the combination of LNS and
our application-specific distance measure generates binary programs that are
highly resilient against JOP attacks. Our results confirm that there is a
trade-off between the quality of each assembly code version and the diversity
of the entire pool of versions. In particular, the experiments show that DivCon
generates near-optimal binary programs that share a small number of gadgets.
For constraint programming researchers and practitioners, this paper
demonstrates that LNS is a valuable technique for finding diverse solutions.
For security researchers and software engineers, DivCon extends the scope of
compiler-based diversification to performance-critical and resource-constrained
applications.

time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) formulation which allows for
moving obstacles. To our knowledge, this is the first HJB formulation of the
problem which allows for moving obstacles. We design an upwind finite
difference scheme to approximate the equation and demonstrate the efficacy of
our model with a few synthetic examples.

reducing interference between separate communication channels, and triplets of

attributes related to application-specific performance, function or operation.
However, some QoS attributes like guaranteed bandwidth required by the
application do vary over time. For example, network bandwidth needs of video
streams from surveillance cameras can vary a lot depending on the environmental
conditions and the content in the video streams. In this paper, we propose a
novel, dynamic QoS attribute prediction technique that assists any application
to make optimal resource reservation requests at all times. Standard
forecasting using traditional cost functions like MAE, MSE, RMSE, MDA, etc.
don't work well because they do not take into account the direction (whether
the forecasting of resources is more or less than needed), magnitude (by how
much the forecast deviates, and in which direction), or frequency (how many
times the forecast deviates from actual needs, and in which direction). The
direction, magnitude and frequency have a direct impact on the application's
accuracy of insights, and the operational costs. We propose a new,
parameterized cost function that takes into account all three of them, and
guides the design of a new prediction technique. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that considers time-varying application requirements and
dynamically adjusts slice QoS requests to 5G networks in order to ensure a
balance between application's accuracy and operational costs. In a real-world
deployment of a surveillance video analytics application over 17 cameras, we
show that our technique outperforms other traditional forecasting methods, and
it saves 34% of network bandwidth (over a ~24 hour period) when compared to a
static, one-time reservation.

computational approach to modeling interactions between a fluid and an immersed
structure. This method uses a finite element (FE) method to approximate the
stresses and forces on a structural mesh and a finite difference (FD) method to
approximate the momentum of the entire fluid-structure system on a Cartesian
grid. The fundamental approach used by this method follows the immersed
boundary framework for modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI), in which a
force spreading operator prolongs structural forces to a Cartesian grid, and a
velocity interpolation operator restricts a velocity field defined on that grid
back onto the structural mesh. Force spreading and velocity interpolation both
require projecting data onto the finite element space. Consequently, evaluating
either coupling operator requires solving a matrix equation at every time step.
Mass lumping, in which the projection matrices are replaced by diagonal
approximations, has the potential to accelerate this method considerably.
Constructing the coupling operators also requires determining the locations on
the structure mesh where the forces and velocities are sampled. Here we show
that sampling the forces and velocities at the nodes of the structural mesh is
equivalent to using lumped mass matrices in the coupling operators. A key
theoretical result of our analysis is that if both of these approaches are used
together, the IFED method permits the use of lumped mass matrices derived from
nodal quadrature rules for any standard interpolatory element. This is
different from standard FE methods, which require specialized treatments to
accommodate mass lumping with higher-order shape functions. Our theoretical
results are confirmed by numerical benchmarks, including standard solid
mechanics tests and examination of a dynamic model of a bioprosthetic heart
valve.

the biggest challenges to the sustainability of the fruit industry. During
manual harvesting of some fresh-market crops like strawberries and table
grapes, pickers spend significant amounts of time walking to carry full trays
to a collection station at the edge of the field. A step toward increasing
harvest automation for such crops is to deploy harvest-aid collaborative robots
(co-bots) that transport the empty and full trays, thus increasing harvest
efficiency by reducing pickers' non-productive walking times. This work
presents the development of a co-robotic harvest-aid system and its evaluation
during commercial strawberry harvesting. At the heart of the system lies a
predictive stochastic scheduling algorithm that minimizes the expected
non-picking time, thus maximizing the harvest efficiency. During the evaluation
experiments, the co-robots improved the mean harvesting efficiency by around
10% and reduced the mean non-productive time by 60%, when the robot-to-picker
ratio was 1:3. The concepts developed in this work can be applied to robotic
harvest-aids for other manually harvested crops that involve walking for crop
transportation.

study the electric field inside thunderstorms, on a large scale, as it
progresses on top of the 700 km$^{2}$ detector, without dealing with the
limitation of narrow exposure in time and space using balloons and aircraft
detectors. In this work, variations in the cosmic ray intensity (single count
rate) using the TASD, were studied and found to be on average at the
$\sim(0.5-1)\%$ and up to 2\% level. These observations were found to be both
in excess and in deficit. They were also found to be correlated with lightning
in addition to thunderstorms. These variations lasted for tens of minutes;
their footprint on the ground ranged from 6 to 24 km in diameter and moved in
the same direction as the thunderstorm. With the use of simple electric field
models inside the cloud and between cloud to ground, the observed variations in
the cosmic ray single count rate were recreated using CORSIKA simulations.
Depending on the electric field model used and the direction of the electric

the past few decades. The development of quantum computers promises one path
toward safer and faster ways to treat, extract and transfer information.
However, despite the significant advantages of quantum computing, the
development of quantum devices operating at room temperature has been
compromised by the thermal decoherence process. In this scenario, this work
proposes a study of thermal qubit systems through Thermofield Dynamics (TFD),
applied in a quantum computing setup. The results show that the Bloch sphere
representation for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bogoliubov
transformation, which allows a practical construction for the thermal qubits in
a quantum computing setup. Therefore, these results open a broad avenue for
researching the thermal effects on quantum protocols through the TFD approach.

matter-proton scattering due to its high matter density and abundant hydrogen
content. Dark matter particles from the Galactic halo can elastically interact
with Solar nuclei, resulting in their capture and thermalization in the Sun.
The captured dark matter can annihilate into Standard Model particles including
an observable flux of neutrinos. We present the results of a search for
low-energy ($<$ 500 GeV) neutrinos correlated with the direction of the Sun
using 7 years of IceCube data. This work utilizes, for the first time, new
optimized cuts to extend IceCube's sensitivity to dark matter mass down to 5
GeV. We find no significant detection of neutrinos from the Sun. Our
observations exclude capture by spin-dependent dark matter-proton scattering
with cross-section down to a few times $10^{-41}$ cm$^2$, assuming there is
equilibrium with annihilation into neutrinos/anti-neutrinos for dark matter
masses between 5 GeV and 100 GeV. These are the strongest constraints at GeV
energies for dark matter annihilation directly to neutrinos.

We assume that appropriate models of the system dynamics and the output

propose robust output control barrier functions (ROCBFs) as a means to
guarantee safety, as defined through controlled forward invariance of a safe
set. We then present an optimization problem to learn ROCBFs from expert
demonstrations that exhibit safe system behavior, e.g., data collected from a
human operator. Along with the optimization problem, we provide verifiable
conditions that guarantee validity of the obtained ROCBF. These conditions are
stated in terms of the density of the data and on Lipschitz and boundedness
constants of the learned function and the models of the system dynamics and the
output measurement map. When the parametrization of the ROCBF is linear, then,
under mild assumptions, the optimization problem is convex. We validate our
findings in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and show how to learn safe
control laws from RGB camera images.

identifying COVID-19 in CXR images. They were applied to the COVIDx8B dataset,
a large COVID-19 dataset with 16,352 CXR images coming from patients of at
least 51 countries. Ensembles of CNNs were also employed and they showed better
efficacy than individual instances. The best individual CNN instance results
were achieved by DenseNet169, with an accuracy of 98.15% and an F1 score of
98.12%. These were further increased to 99.25% and 99.24%, respectively,

is becoming widespread. In today's world, where everyday tasks are inevitable
without technology, this extensive use of computers paves the way for malicious
activity. As a result, it is important to provide solutions to defend against
these threats. Malware is one of the well-known and widely used means utilized
for doing destructive activities by malicious attackers. Producing malware from
scratch is somewhat difficult, so attackers tend to obfuscate existing malware
and prepare it to become an unrecognizable program. Since creating new malware
from an old one using obfuscation is a creative task, there are some drawbacks
to identifying obfuscated malwares. In this research, we propose a solution to
overcome this problem by converting the code to an image in the first step and
then using a semi-supervised approach combined with contrastive learning. In
this case, an obfuscation in the malware bytecode corresponds to an
augmentation in the image. Hence, by utilizing meaningful augmentations, which
simulate some obfuscation changes and combine them to generate complex
ambiguity procedures, our proposed solution is able to construct, learn, and
detect a wide range of obfuscations. This work addresses two issues: 1) malware
classification despite the data deficiency and 2) obfuscated malware detection
by training on non-obfuscated malwares. According to the results, the proposed
method overcomes the data shortage problem in malware classification, as its
accuracy is 90.1% when just 10% of data is used for training the model.
Moreover, training on basic malwares without obfuscation achieved 96.21 percent

research's focus on attention mechanisms have been on spatial and temporal
attention, which are unable to take advantage of the inherent motion found in

Aware Attention (M2A) that explicitly incorporates motion characteristics. More
specifically, M2A extracts motion information between consecutive frames and
utilizes attention to focus on the motion patterns found across frames to
accurately recognize actions in videos. The proposed M2A mechanism is simple to
implement and can be easily incorporated into any neural network backbone
architecture. We show that incorporating motion mechanisms with attention

only a small increase in computational complexity. We further compared the

are complex, can exhibit non-trivial topology which is not present in Hermitian
systems. In one dimension, it was recently noted theoretically and demonstrated
experimentally that the eigenvalue topology is classified by the braid group.
The classification of eigenvalue topology in higher dimensions, however,
remained an open question. Here, we give a complete description of eigenvalue
topology in two and three dimensional systems, including the gapped and gapless
cases. We reduce the topological classification problem to a purely
computational problem in algebraic topology. In two dimensions, the Brillouin
zone torus is punctured by exceptional points, and each nontrivial loop in the
punctured torus acquires a braid group invariant. These braids satisfy the
constraint that the composite of the braids around the exceptional points is
equal to the commutator of the braids on the fundamental cycles of the torus.
In three dimensions, there are exceptional knots and links, and the
classification depends on how they are embedded in the Brillouin zone
three-torus. When the exceptional link is contained in a contractible ball, the
classification can be expressed in terms of the knot group of the link. Our
results provide a comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian eigenvalue
topology in higher dimensional systems, and should be important for the further
explorations of topologically robust open quantum and classical systems.

total-to-selective extinction ratios ($R_V \lesssim 2$) in comparison to that
of typical Milky Way dust ($R_V \approx 3.3$), and polarization curves that
rise steeply to blue wavelengths, with peak polarization values at short
wavelengths ($\lambda_{\rm max} < 0.4$ ${\mu}$m) in comparison to the typical
Galactic values ($\lambda_{\rm max} \approx 0.55$ ${\mu}$m). Understanding the
source of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of
SNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's
interstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the
continuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia
in dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalised galactocentric
distance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies
displaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host
galaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low
polarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies
display polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence
of such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This
indicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the
result of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The
peculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may
be explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or
the interstellar radiation field.

understand in general how evolution operates to generate increasing genetic and
functional complexity. Molecular recognition sites are short genome segments or

similarity. Such sites are simple, ubiquitous modules of sequence information,
cellular function, and evolution. Here we show that recognition sites, if
coupled to a time-dependent target, can rapidly evolve to complex states with
larger code length and smaller coding density than sites recognising a static
target. The underlying fitness model contains selection for recognition, which
depends on the sequence similarity between site and target, and a uniform cost
per unit of code length. Site sequences are shown to evolve in a specific
adaptive ratchet, which produces selection of different strength for code
extensions and compressions. Ratchet evolution increases the adaptive width of
evolved sites, accelerating the adaptation to moving targets and facilitating
refinement and innovation of recognition functions. We apply these results to
the recognition of fast-evolving antigens by the human immune system. Our
analysis shows how molecular complexity can evolve as a collateral to selection
for function in a dynamic environment.

DeMFI-Net jointly performs deblurring and MFI where its baseline version
performs feature-flow-based warping with FAC-FB module to obtain a

its extended version further improves the joint task performance based on

gathers the distributed blurry pixel information over blurry input frames in
feature-domain to improve the overall joint performances, which is
computationally efficient since its attentive correlation is only focused
pointwise. As a result, our DeMFI-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)

to stop sampling and which sources to identify as anomalous upon stopping, but
also which sources to sample at each time instance until stopping. A novel
formulation for this problem is proposed, in which the number of anomalous
sources is not necessarily known in advance and the number of sampled sources
per time instance is not necessarily fixed. Instead, an arbitrary lower bound
and an arbitrary upper bound are assumed on the number of anomalous sources,
and the fraction of the expected number of samples over the expected time until
stopping is required to not exceed an arbitrary, user-specified level. In
addition to this sampling constraint, the probabilities of at least one false
alarm and at least one missed detection are controlled below user-specified
tolerance levels. A general criterion is established for a policy to achieve
the minimum expected time until stopping to a first-order asymptotic
approximation as both familywise error rates go to zero. This criterion is used
to prove the asymptotic optimality of a family of policies that sample each
source at each time instance with a probability that depends on the past
observations only through the current estimate of the subset of anomalous
sources. In particular, the asymptotic optimality is established of a policy
that requires minimal computation under any setup of the problem.

investigate a parametric family of Gaussian DPPs with a clearly interpretable

modulation impacts the observed points by introducing directionality in their

we present a hybrid framework that combines fluid mechanics and machine

esophageal diagnostic device called endoscopic functional lumen imaging probe

set of mechanics-based parameters such as esophageal wall stiffness, muscle
contraction pattern and active relaxation of esophageal walls. The
mechanics-based parameters were then used to train a neural network that
consists of a variational autoencoder (VAE) that generates a latent space and a
side network that predicts mechanical work metrics for estimating
esophagogastric junction motility. The latent vectors along with a set of
discrete mechanics-based parameters define the VDL and form clusters

distinguishes different disorders but can also be used to predict disease
progression in time. Finally, we also demonstrate the clinical applicability of

that seeks to adapt proposals to the local geometry of the posterior
distribution. The specific form of the Hamiltonian used in RMHMC necessitates
{\it implicitly-defined} numerical integrators in order to sustain
reversibility and volume-preservation, two properties that are necessary to
establish detailed balance of RMHMC. In practice, these implicit equations are
solved to a non-zero convergence tolerance via fixed-point iteration. However,
the effect of these convergence thresholds on the ergodicity and computational
efficiency properties of RMHMC are not well understood. The purpose of this
research is to elucidate these relationships through numerous case studies. Our
analysis reveals circumstances wherein the RMHMC algorithm is sensitive, and
insensitive, to these convergence tolerances. Our empirical analysis examines
several aspects of the computation: (i) we examine the ergodicity of the RMHMC
Markov chain by employing statistical methods for comparing probability
measures based on collections of samples; (ii) we investigate the degree to
which detailed balance is violated by measuring errors in reversibility and
volume-preservation; (iii) we assess the efficiency of the RMHMC Markov chain
in terms of time-normalized ESS. In each of these cases, we investigate the
sensitivity of these metrics to the convergence threshold and further
contextualize our results in terms of comparison against Euclidean HMC. We
propose a method by which one may select the convergence tolerance within a
Bayesian inference application using techniques of stochastic approximation and
we examine Newton's method, an alternative to fixed point iterations, which can
eliminate much of the sensitivity of RMHMC to the convergence threshold.

naturalistic, less malicious-looking, physically realizable, highly effective
achieving high attack success rates, and universal. A TnT is universal because
any input image captured with a TnT in the scene will: i) misguide a network

(targeted attack). Interestingly, now, an adversarial patch attacker has the
potential to exert a greater level of control -- the ability to choose a
location-independent, natural-looking patch as a trigger in contrast to being
constrained to noisy perturbations -- an ability is thus far shown to be only
possible with Trojan attack methods needing to interfere with the model
building processes to embed a backdoor at the risk discovery; but, still
realize a patch deployable in the physical world. Through extensive experiments

has been widely investigated to study the origin of life and the chemical

However, SOM in primitive meteorites includes numerous chemical species besides
the biologically relevant ones, and the reaction mechanisms that
comprehensively explain the complex nature of SOM are unknown. Besides, the
initial reactants, which formed before asteroid accretion, were
uncharacterized. We examined the mass distribution of SOM extracted from three
distinct Tagish Lake meteorite fragments, which exhibit different degrees of
aqueous alteration though they originated from a single asteroid. We report
that mass distributions of SOM in the primordial fragments are well fit by the
SchulzZimm (SZ) model for the molecular weight distribution patterns found in
chain growth polymerization experiments. Also, the distribution patterns
diverge further from SZ with increasing degrees of aqueous alteration. These
observations imply that the complex nature of the primordial SOM (1) was
established before severe alteration on the asteroid, (2) possibly existed
before parent-body accretion, and (3) later became simplified on the asteroid.
Therefore, aqueous reactions on asteroids are not required conditions for
cultivating complex SOM. Furthermore, we found that overall H over C ratios of
SOM decrease with increasing aqueous alteration, and the estimate of H loss
from the SOM is 10% to 30%. Organics seem to be a significant H2 source that
may have caused subsequent chemical reactions in the Tagish Lake meteorite
parent body.

microvascular imaging. In the focal region, resolution of AR-PAM is determined
by the ultrasound transducer and ultimately limited by acoustic diffraction. In
the out-of-focus region, resolution deteriorates with increasing distance from
the focal plane, which restricts depth of focus (DOF). Besides, a trade-off
exists between resolution and DOF. Previously, synthetic aperture focusing
technique (SAFT) and/or deconvolution methods have been demonstrated to enhance
AR-PAM images. However, they suffer from issues in low resolution, low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and/or poor image fidelity. Here, we propose a
novel algorithm for AR-PAM to enhance image resolution, SNR, and fidelity. The
algorithm consists of a Fourier accumulation SAFT (FA-SAFT) and a directional
model-based (D-MB) deconvolution method. Inspired from Fourier denoising
technique and directional SAFT, FA-SAFT mainly compensates for the defocusing
effect. Besides, D-MB deconvolution enhances the resolution as well as
preserves the image fidelity, especially for the objects with line patterns
such as microvasculature. Full width at half maximum of 26-31 um over DOF of
1.8 mm and minimum resolvable distance of 46-49 um are experimentally achieved
by imaging tungsten wire phantom. Moreover, imaging of leaf skeleton phantom
and in vivo imaging of mouse blood vessels also prove that our algorithm is
capable of providing high-resolution, high-SNR, and good-fidelity results for

phase region. Due to the anisotropic structure, the compressibility is
different in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field. The
discontinuity of longitudinal compressibility with the chemical potential and
the temperature captures the signature of a first-order chiral phase transition
and the crossover at high temperature. Moreover, the
magnetic-field-and-temperature running coupling would have an important effect
on the position of the phase transition. Under the lowest landau level

For example, for a fixed precision value of 99%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6% of
all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall=0.936) while this rate is 76.3%

has fulfilled both objectives, simultaneously or cooperatively, in one coherent
framework. The visualization methods of these approaches were introduced for
explaining the output of a detection algorithm, not for data exploration that
facilitates a standalone visual detection. This is our point of departure:
UN-AVOIDS, an unsupervised and nonparametric approach for both visualization (a
human process) and detection (an algorithmic process) of outliers, that assigns
invariant anomalous scores (normalized to $[0,1]$), rather than hard
binary-decision. The main aspect of novelty of UN-AVOIDS is that it transforms
data into a new space, which is introduced in this paper as neighborhood
cumulative density function (NCDF), in which both visualization and detection
are carried out. In this space, outliers are remarkably visually
distinguishable, and therefore the anomaly scores assigned by the detection
algorithm achieved a high area under the ROC curve (AUC). We assessed UN-AVOIDS
on both simulated and two recently published cybersecurity datasets, and
compared it to three of the most successful anomaly detection methods: LOF, IF,
and FABOD. In terms of AUC, UN-AVOIDS was almost an overall winner. The article
concludes by providing a preview of new theoretical and practical avenues for
UN-AVOIDS. Among them is designing a visualization aided anomaly detection
(VAAD), a type of software that aids analysts by providing UN-AVOIDS' detection
algorithm (running in a back engine), NCDF visualization space (rendered to
plots), along with other conventional methods of visualization in the original
feature space, all of which are linked in one interactive environment.

the carrier system in SnSe is also determined by strong coupling to phonons by
directly visualizing polaron formation in the material. We employ ultrafast
electron diffraction and diffuse scattering to track the response of phonons in
both momentum and time to the photodoping of free carriers across the bandgap,
observing the bimodal and anisotropic lattice distortions that drive carrier
localization. Relatively large (\SI{18.7}{\angstrom}), quasi-1D polarons are
formed on the \SI{300}{\femto\second} timescale with smaller
(\SI{4.2}{\angstrom}) 3D polarons taking an order of magnitude longer

the profoundly anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in SnSe, with strong
Fr\""ohlich coupling only to zone center polar optical phonons. These results
demonstrate that carriers in SnSe at optimal doping levels results in a high
polaron density and that strong electron-phonon coupling is also critical to
the thermoelectric performance of this benchmark material and potentially
high-performance thermoelectrics more generally.

utilizes two layers with ReLU, which is a non-linear embedding for $Q, K$, and

topological fluctuations is accumulating, the origin of superconductivity in
the flat-band quantum moir\'e materials remains an open question. Here, instead
of attempting to pinpoint the origin of the superconductivity, we aim at
identifying universal properties of moir\'e flat bands that shall emerge in the
presence of inter-valley attractions. We show that by matching the interaction
strength of inter-valley attraction with intra-valley repulsion, the flat-band
limit becomes exactly solvable. Away from the flat-band limit, the system can
be simulated via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods without sign problem for any
fillings. Combining analytic solutions with large-scale numerical simulations,
we show that upon increasing temperature, the superconducting phase melts into
a bosonic fluid of Cooper pairs with large/diverging compressibility. In
contrast to flat-band attractive Hubbard models, where similar effects arise
only for on-site interactions, our study indicates this physics is a universal
property of moir\'e flat bands, regardless of microscopic details such as the
range of interactions and/or spin-oribt couplings. At higher temperature, the
boson fluid phase gives its way to a pseudo gap phase, where some Cooper pairs
are torn apart by thermal fluctuations, resulting in fermion density of states
inside the gap. Unlike the superconducting transition temperature, which is
very sensitive to doping and twisting angles, the gap and the temperature scale
of the boson fluid phase and the pseudo gap phase are found to be nearly
independent of doping level and/or flat-band bandwidth. The relevance of these
phases with experimental discoveries in the flat band quantum moir\'e materials
is discussed.

population-level transmissibility for the first time from such data; previous
studies have only inferred household-level transmissibility. To do this we
perform the inference at two levels, assuming one transmission rate parameter
for within-household infection, and another transmission rate parameter for
infection between different households. We use a simplifying assumption: that
between-household infections always occur in naive households; while still
performing full joint inference on the within-household infection parameters.
In addition, a novel technique is used to remove systematic bias when the
number of new infections per day is growing or decaying, as is common in real
outbreaks, without the need for contemporaneous estimates of the serial
interval. The method is validated on simulated data and is shown to perform
well, even when the number of infected households is relatively small.

decision rule is first derived for non-coherent detection of information bits
transmitted by multiple devices. To overcome the high complexity of the ML
detection, we propose a sub-optimal two-stage detection algorithm to balance
the computational complexity and error performance. In the first stage, we
identify transmit chirps (without knowing which EDs transmit them). In the
second stage, we determine the EDs that transmit the specific chirps identified
from the first stage. To improve the detection performance in the second stage,
we also optimize the transmit powers of EDs to minimize the similarity,
measured by the Jaccard coefficient, between the received powers of any pair of
EDs. As the power control optimization problem is non-convex, we use concepts
from successive convex approximation to transform it to an approximate convex
optimization problem that can be solved iteratively and guaranteed to reach a
sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate and justify the tradeoff
between transmit power penalties and network scalability of the proposed LoRa
network model. In particular, by allowing concurrent transmission of 2 or 3
EDs, the uplink capacity of the proposed network can be doubled or tripled over

correlative guidelines on its size and growth rate, along with a holistic
consideration of associated symptoms and pathologies. However, aneurysms can
exhibit significant growth or rupture before these criteria are met;
conversely, large aneurysms may exceed intervention criteria but remain stable
over time. Without methods to evaluate the key factors driving aneurysm
development, it is difficult to assign preventative treatment to patients most
in need. In this work, we propose a fluid-structure instability that may cause
blood vessels to dilate and form aneurysms, or induce existing aneurysms to
grow significantly. The ab-initio framework yields a stability parameter that
describes the onset of this ""fluttering"" of the aortic wall, which may drive or
signal the presence of abnormal aortic growth. A retrospective study was
conducted with 4D flow MRI data from 117 patients indicated for cardiac imaging
and 100 normal subjects recruited prospectively as healthy volunteers. Both
cohorts comprised subjects with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the
full thoracic aorta. The stability parameter was calculated for every subject
from the earliest MRI data. For a 72 patient subcohort with at least one
follow-up imaging exam after the initial MRI scan, the growth of each patient's
aneurysm was forecast by the stability parameter and compared to the maximum
growth rate observed in follow-up as well as any subsequent surgical
intervention. A receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to gauge
the stability parameter as a potential diagnostic physiomarker. The area under
the curve of the ROC analysis was 0.97. The proposed flutter type instability
appears to offer accurate prediction of aneurysm development from patient
specific data that can inform precise, targeted management of disease
progression.

some light in the AGN effects over the star formation, we analyzed the inner

integral field spectroscopy. We fitted the continuum spectra in order to derive
stellar age, metallicity, velocity and velocity dispersion maps in each source.
After stacking our sample and averaging their properties, we found that the
contribution of young SP, as well as that of AGN featureless continuum both
peak at the nucleus. The fraction of intermediate-age SPs is smaller in the
nucleus if compared to outer regions, and the contribution of old SPs vary very
little within our field of view (FoV). We also found no variation of velocity
dispersion or metallicity within our FoV. Lastly, we detected an increase in
the dust reddening towards the center of the galaxies. These results lead us to
conclude that AGN phenomenon is usually related to a recent star formation

evolving GNN predictions and propose an axiomatic attribution method to
uniquely decompose the change in a prediction to paths on computation graphs.
The attribution to many paths involving high-degree nodes is still not
interpretable, while simply selecting the top important paths can be suboptimal
in approximating the change. We formulate a novel convex optimization problem
to optimally select the paths that explain the prediction evolution.
Theoretically, we prove that the existing method based on
Layer-Relevance-Propagation (LRP) is a special case of the proposed algorithm
when an empty graph is compared with. Empirically, on seven graph datasets,
with a novel metric designed for evaluating explanations of prediction change,
we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods,
including LRP, DeepLIFT, and other path selection methods.

downstream direction, can be used to produce low-cost models of flows
containing a slowly varying direction, such as mixing layers, jets, and
boundary layers. The parabolized stability equations (PSE) are popular due to
their extremely low cost but can only capture a single instability mode; all
other modes are damped or distorted by regularization methods required to
stabilize the spatial march, precluding PSE from properly capturing non-modal
behavior, acoustics, and interactions between multiple instability mechanisms.
The one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations properly retain all
downstream-traveling modes at a cost that is a fraction of that of global
methods but still one to two orders of magnitude higher than PSE. In this
paper, we introduce a new variant of OWNS whose cost, both in terms of CPU time
and memory requirements, approaches that of PSE while still properly capturing
the contributions of all downstream-traveling modes. The method is formulated
in terms of a projection operator that eliminates upstream-traveling modes.
Unlike previous OWNS variants, the action of this operator on a vector can be
efficiently approximated using a series of equations that can be solved
recursively, i.e., successively one after the next, rather than as a coupled
set. In addition to highlighting the improved cost scaling of our method, we
derive explicit error expressions and elucidate the relationship with previous
OWNS variants. The properties, efficiency, and accuracy of our method are
demonstrated for both free-shear and wall-bounded flows.

unidirectional models are in general more sensitive to noisy examples in the
training set. It is observed that the final performance of the model depends on
the proportion of training examples processed by data augmentation techniques.
MoChA models generally perform better than RNN-T models. However, we observe
that training of MoChA models seems to be more sensitive to various factors
such as the characteristics of training sets and the incorporation of
additional augmentations techniques. On the other hand, RNN-T models perform
better than MoChA models in terms of latency, inference time, and the stability
of training. Additionally, RNN-T models are generally more robust against noise
and reverberation. All these advantages make RNN-T models a better choice for
streaming on-device speech recognition compared to MoChA models.

Classification of transient noise can offer clues for exploring its origin and

JWST. In this paper we present a new set of stellar models specifically
designed to investigate low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in $\omega$ Centauri --
the largest known globular cluster. The parameters of our models were derived
from iterative fits to HST photometry of the Main Sequence members of the
cluster. Despite the complex distribution of abundances and the presence of
multiple Main Sequences in $\omega$ Centauri, we find that the modal
colour-magnitude distribution can be represented by a single stellar population
with parameters determined in this study. The observed luminosity function is
well-represented by two distinct stellar populations having solar and enhanced
helium mass fractions and a common initial mass function, in agreement with
previous studies. Our analysis confirms that the abundances of individual
chemical elements play a key role in determining the physical properties of
low-mass cluster members. We use our models to draw predictions of brown dwarf
colours and magnitudes in anticipated JWST NIRCam data, confirming that the

interaction on a square lattice and perform a comprehensive study of the phase
diagram in the three-dimensional space spanned by the chemical potential, a
magnetic field, and temperature. The ferromagnetic phase is stabilized below a
dome-shaped transition line with the maximal Tc near van Hove filling. The
transition is second order at high temperatures and becomes first order at low
temperatures. When the interaction strength becomes large, another
ferromagnetic dome is realized near the band edge with a quantum critical point
at the band edge and a first-order transition on the other edge of the dome.
The two ferromagnetic phases merge into one for further larger interaction
strength. By applying a magnetic field, wing structures develop from the
first-order transition lines at zero field. The wing describes a first-order
transition surface, namely a metamagnetic transition. When the system is tuned
close to the band edge in the field, the wing can shrink and vanish, leading to
a quantum critical end point (QCEP) at zero temperature. This QCEP is a
Lifshitz point in the sense that the Fermi surface of either spin band
vanishes. Close to the QCEP, another wing develops at very low temperatures in
a higher field region. For a large interaction strength, however, the QCEP
disappears. Furthermore, a metamagnetic transition occurs also inside the
ferromagnetic phase without a magnetic field. Consequently another wing also
develops from that by applying the field. Our obtained phase diagrams are
discussed as a possible connection to itinerant ferromagnetic systems such as
UGe2, UCoAl, ZrZn2, and others including magnetocaloric effect materials.

formation of this system through stable mass transfer. We find a model which
can well reproduce the observed WD masses and orbital period but not the
effective temperature and hydrogen abundance of the low-mass He WD component.

maximization, where a similar quantification of the sum capacity difference

makes the following enhancements to the existing multi-beam MAC schemes (i) A
windowing mechanism to achieve concurrent communication when the packet arrival
is asynchronous, (ii) A smart packet processing mechanism which reduces the

  Modification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The ability of neural networks (NNs) to learn and remember multiple tasks
sequentially is facing tough challenges in achieving general artificial
intelligence due to their catastrophic forgetting (CF) issues. Fortunately, the
latest OWM Orthogonal Weights Modification) and other several continual
learning (CL) methods suggest some promising ways to overcome the CF issue.
However, none of existing CL methods explores the following three crucial
questions for effectively overcoming the CF issue: that is, what knowledge does
it contribute to the effective weights modification of the NN during its
sequential tasks learning? When the data distribution of a new learning task
changes corresponding to the previous learned tasks, should a uniform/specific
weight modification strategy be adopted or not? what is the upper bound of the
learningable tasks sequentially for a given CL method? ect. To achieve this, in
this paper, we first reveals the fact that of the weight gradient of a new
learning task is determined by both the input space of the new task and the
weight space of the previous learned tasks sequentially. On this observation
and the recursive least square optimal method, we propose a new efficient and
effective continual learning method EOWM via enhanced OWM. And we have
theoretically and definitively given the upper bound of the learningable tasks
sequentially of our EOWM. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmarks
demonstrate that our EOWM is effectiveness and outperform all of the
state-of-the-art CL baselines.

sample of 136 galaxy groups and clusters spanning nearly two orders of
magnitude in mass ($M_{500}\sim 10^{13}-10^{15}M_\odot$) and the redshift range
$0< z < 1$. Our joint analysis is based on the combination of HSC-SSP
weak-lensing mass measurements, XXL X-ray gas mass measurements, and HSC and
SDSS multiband photometry. We carry out a Bayesian analysis of multivariate
mass-scaling relations of gas mass, galaxy stellar mass, stellar mass of
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and soft-band X-ray luminosity, by taking
into account the intrinsic covariance between cluster properties, selection
effect, weak-lensing mass calibration, and observational error covariance
matrix. The mass-dependent slope of the gas mass--total mass ($M_{500}$)
relation is found to be $1.29_{-0.10}^{+0.16}$, which is steeper than the
self-similar prediction of unity, whereas the slope of the stellar mass--total
mass relation is shallower than unity, $0.85_{-0.09}^{+0.12}$. The BCG stellar
mass weakly depends on cluster mass with a slope of $0.49_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$. The
baryon, gas mass, and stellar mass fractions as a function of $M_{500}$ agree
with the results from numerical simulations and previous observations. We
successfully constrain the full intrinsic covariance of the baryonic contents.
The BCG stellar mass shows the larger intrinsic scatter at a given halo total
mass, followed in order by stellar mass and gas mass. We find a significant
positive intrinsic correlation coefficient between total (and satellite)
stellar mass and BCG stellar mass and no evidence for intrinsic correlation
between gas mass and stellar mass.

energy conversion. Electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO)
significantly improves its conductivity. However, the kinetics of this process
depends on the solvent, supporting electrolyte, pH, and numerous other factors.
Most studies report the macroscopic views and ex-situ properties of reduced GO.
To expand the knowledge about GO reduction, in this study, we used cyclic
voltammetry (CV), simultaneous 2 points and 4 points resistance measurement
(s24), conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretical calculations.
Using CV, we demonstrated that the choice of supporting electrolyte (KCl or
LiCl) influences the potential range in which electrochemical GO reduction
occurs. The activation energy of this process was estimated to be below 30 kJ
mol-1 in both electrolytes, being significantly lower than that required for
thermal reduction of GO. Simultaneous in situ s24 resistance measurements
suggest that GO films reach a highly conductive state at deep negative
potentials, with an abrupt, irreversible switch from non-conductive to the
conductive state. However, conductive AFM presents a more exact picture of this
process: the reduction of GO films starts locally while the formed conductive
islands grow during the reduction. This mechanism was confirmed by theoretical
calculations indicating that the reduction starts on isolated oxygen-functional
groups over the GO basal plane, while clustered OH groups are more difficult to
reduce. The presented results can help in tailoring reduced GO for a particular
electrochemical application by precisely controlling the reduction degree and
percentage of the conductive area of the reduced GO films.

likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several
state-of-the-art malware detectors' ability to detect manipulated malware. We
find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided
manipulated samples; (ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using
one detector to evade detection by another detector (i.e., transferability)
depends on the overlap of features with large AMM values between the different
detectors; and (iii) AMM values effectively measure the importance of features
and explain the ability to evade detection. Our findings shed light on the
weaknesses of current malware detectors, as well as how they can be improved.

  Abstract abridged for arXiv submission",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the classic Online Steiner Forest problem where one is
given a (weighted) graph $G$ and an arbitrary set of $k$ terminal pairs
$\{\{s_1,t_1\},\ldots ,\{s_k,t_k\}\}$ that are required to be connected. The
goal is to maintain a minimum-weight sub-graph that satisfies all the
connectivity requirements as the pairs are revealed one by one. It has been
known for a long time that no algorithm (even randomized) can be better than
$\Omega(\log(k))$-competitive for this problem. Interestingly, a simple greedy
algorithm is already very efficient for this problem. This algorithm can be
informally described as follows: Upon arrival of a new pair $\{s_i,t_i\}$,
connect $s_i$ and $t_i$ with the shortest path in the current metric, contract
the metric along the chosen path and wait for the next pair.
  Although simple and intuitive, greedy proved itself challenging to analyze
and its competitive ratio is a long-standing open problem in the area of online
algorithms. The last progress on this question is due to an elegant analysis by
Awerbuch, Azar, and Bartal [SODA~1996], who showed that greedy is
$O(\log^2(k))$-competitive. Our main result is to show that greedy is in fact
$O(\log(k)\log\log(k))$-competitive on a wide class of instances. In
particular, this wide class of instances contains all the instances that were
exhibited in the literature until now.

VFMV images are captured by focusing a scene on distinct depths by varying

images contain more information in focal dimension than multiview images, and
can provide a rich representation for 3D scene by considering both FoV and DoF.
The characteristics of VFMV images are useful for visual tasks to achieve high

large-scale labels with detailed crack location information to learn accurate
predictions. In practice, however, crack locations are very difficult to be
manually annotated due to various visual patterns of pavement crack. In this
paper, we propose a Deep Domain Adaptation-based Crack Detection Network
(DDACDN), which learns domain invariant features by taking advantage of the
source domain knowledge to predict the multi-category crack location
information in the target domain, where only image-level labels are available.
Specifically, DDACDN first extracts crack features from both the source and
target domain by a two-branch weights-shared backbone network. And in an effort
to achieve the cross-domain adaptation, an intermediate domain is constructed
by aggregating the three-scale features from the feature space of each domain
to adapt the crack features from the source domain to the target domain.
Finally, the network involves the knowledge of both domains and is trained to
recognize and localize pavement cracks. To facilitate accurate training and
validation for domain adaptation, we use two challenging pavement crack
datasets CQU-BPDD and RDD2020. Furthermore, we construct a new large-scale
Bituminous Pavement Multi-label Disease Dataset named CQU-BPMDD, which contains
38994 high-resolution pavement disease images to further evaluate the

representation learning in various machine learning tasks. However, most
existing GNNs applying neighborhood aggregation usually perform poorly on the
graph with heterophily where adjacent nodes belong to different classes. In
this paper, we show that in typical heterphilous graphs, the edges may be
directed, and whether to treat the edges as is or simply make them undirected
greatly affects the performance of the GNN models. Furthermore, due to the
limitation of heterophily, it is highly beneficial for the nodes to aggregate
messages from similar nodes beyond local neighborhood.These motivate us to
develop a model that adaptively learns the directionality of the graph, and
exploits the underlying long-distance correlations between nodes. We first
generalize the graph Laplacian to digraph based on the proposed Feature-Aware
PageRank algorithm, which simultaneously considers the graph directionality and
long-distance feature similarity between nodes. Then digraph Laplacian defines
a graph propagation matrix that leads to a model called {\em DiglacianGCN}.
Based on this, we further leverage the node proximity measured by commute times
between nodes, in order to preserve the nodes' long-distance correlation on the
topology level. Extensive experiments on ten datasets with different levels of
homophily demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing solutions

the heterogeneous material distribution. Understanding how the heterogeneous
pattern forms is potentially important for understanding how crater rays form.
Previous studies predicted that the pattern formation is induced by inelastic
collisions of ejecta particles in the early stages of crater formation and is
terminated by the ejecta's expanding motion. In this study, we test this
prediction based on a hyper-velocity impact experiment together with N-body
simulations where the trajectories of inelastically colliding granular
particles are calculated. Our laboratory experiment suggests that pattern
formation is already completed on a timescale comparable to the geometrical
expansion of the ejecta curtain, which is ~ 10 microseconds in our experiment.
Our simulations confirm the previous prediction that the heterogeneous pattern
grows through initial inelastic collisions of particle clusters and subsequent
geometric expansion with no further cluster collisions. Furthermore, to better
understand the two-stage evolution of the mesh pattern, we construct a simple
analytical model that assumes perfect coalescence of particle clusters upon
collision. The model shows that the pattern formation is completed on the
timescale of the system's expansion independently of the initial conditions.
The model also reproduces the final size of the clusters observed in our
simulations as a function of the initial conditions. It is known that particles
in the target are ejected at lower speeds with increased distance to the impact
point. The difference in the ejection speed of the particles may result in the
evolution of the mesh pattern into rays.

completely unaware of each other. LoRaWAN uses ALOHA-style communication where
it is almost impossible to schedule transmission between networks belonging to
different owners properly. The inability to schedule overlapping networks will
cause inter-network interference, which will increase node-to-gateway message
losses and gateway-to-node acknowledgement failures. This problem is likely to
get worse as the number of LoRaWAN networks increase. In response to this
problem, we propose IRONWAN, a wireless overlay network that shares
communication resources without modifications to underlying protocols. It
utilises the broadcast nature of radio communication and enables
gateway-to-gateway communication to facilitate the search for failed messages
and transmit failed acknowledgements already received and cached in overlapping
network's gateways. IRONWAN uses two novel algorithms, a Real-time Message
Inter-arrival Predictor, to highlight when a server has not received an
expected uplink message. The Interference Predictor ensures that extra

50\% node's energy. Finally, we demonstrate that IRONWAN has comparable
performance to an optimal solution (wired, centralised) but with 2-32 times

First, consideration of specific heat temperature dependance in interior

Therefore, building a model to mimic the image beauty assessment becomes an

pairwise evaluation method was used, which is based on the Bradley-Terry model.
We believe that this method is more accurate than other image rating methods

fit for image quality assessment, is used in this work. The first part of this
study is a survey about the image beauty comparison of different images. The
Bradley-Terry model is used for the calculated scores, which are the target of
CNN model. The second part of this work focuses on the results of the image
beauty prediction, including landscape images, architecture images and portrait

later. Then, the CNN model is trained with the surveyed images and
corresponding scores. Furthermore, this work compares the results of four CNN
base networks, i.e., Alex net, VGG net, Squeeze net and LSiM net, as discussed
in literature. In the end, the model is evaluated by the accuracy in pairs,
correlation coefficient and relative error calculated by survey results.
Satisfactory results are achieved by our proposed methods with about 70 percent
accuracy in pairs. Our work sheds more light on the novel image beauty
assessment method. While more studies should be conducted, this method is a
promising step.

pixel-level annotated datasets. In this paper, we present the first
weakly-supervised approach to the SID problem. Although weak supervision has
been considered in general saliency detection, it is mainly based on using
class labels for object localization. However, it is non-trivial to use only
class labels to learn instance-aware saliency information, as salient instances
with high semantic affinities may not be easily separated by the labels. As the
subitizing information provides an instant judgement on the number of salient
items, it is naturally related to detecting salient instances and may help
separate instances of the same class while grouping different parts of the same
instance. Inspired by this observation, we propose to use class and subitizing
labels as weak supervision for the SID problem. We propose a novel
weakly-supervised network with three branches: a Saliency Detection Branch
leveraging class consistency information to locate candidate objects; a
Boundary Detection Branch exploiting class discrepancy information to delineate
object boundaries; and a Centroid Detection Branch using subitizing information
to detect salient instance centroids. This complementary information is then
fused to produce a salient instance map. To facilitate the learning process, we
further propose a progressive training scheme to reduce label noise and the
corresponding noise learned by the model, via reciprocating the model with
progressive salient instance prediction and model refreshing. Our extensive
evaluations show that the proposed method plays favorably against carefully
designed baseline methods adapted from related tasks.

This paper introduces DebateNet2.0, which traces the political discourse on the

2015. The core units of our annotation are political claims (requests for
specific actions to be taken within the policy field) and the actors who make
them (politicians, parties, etc.). The contribution of this paper is twofold.
First, we document and release DebateNet2.0 along with its companion R package,

a Discourse Network Analysis (DNA) to DebateNet2.0, comparing two crucial

formation is regulated by angular momentum transport and mass-loss processes.
Over the past decade, the paradigm of viscosity has been challenged and MHD
disc winds appear as a compelling scenario to account for disc accretion. In
this work, we aim to construct the equivalent of the widely used analytical
description of viscous evolution for the MHD wind case. The transport of
angular momentum and mass induced by the wind is parameterized by an
$\alpha$-like parameter and by the magnetic lever arm parameter $\lambda$.
Extensions of the paradigmatic Lynden-Bell and Pringle similarity solutions to
the wind case are presented. We show that wind-driven accretion leads to a
steeper decrease in the disc mass and accretion rate than in viscous models due
to the absence of disc spreading. If the decline of the magnetic field strength
is slower than that of the gas surface density, the disc is dispersed after a
finite time. The evolution of the disc in the $\dot{M}_*-M_D$ plane is
sensitive to the wind and turbulence parameters. A disc population evolving
under the action of winds can exhibit a correlation between $\dot{M}_*$ and
$M_D$ depending on the initial conditions. The simplified framework proposed in
this work opens to a new avenue to test the effectiveness of wind-driven
accretion from the observed disc demographics and constitutes an important step
to include wind-driven accretion in planet population synthesis models.

The RSU deploys a massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) array and operates
at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The pencil-sharp mMIMO beams and fine
range resolution achieved at mmWave, implicates that the point target
assumption is impractical in such V2I networks, as the volume and shape of the
vehicles become essential for beamforming. Simply pointing a beam to the
vehicle may result in the communication receiver (CR) never lying in the beam,
even when the vehicle's trajectory is accurately tracked. To tackle this
problem, we consider the extended vehicle target with two novel beam tracking
schemes. For the first scheme, the beamwidth is adjusted in real-time to cover
the entire vehicle, followed by an extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm to
predict and track the position of CR according to the resolved high-resolution

transmission, where a wide beam is adopted for both communication and sensing.
Based on the sensed results at the first stage, the second stage is dedicated

an automatic speech recognition system and have been shown to improve
performance of downstream tasks like spoken language understanding and speech
translation, compared to using one-best hypothesis. In this work, we look into
the effectiveness of lattice cues for rescoring n-best lists in second-pass. We
encode lattices with a recurrent network and train an attention encoder-decoder
model for n-best rescoring. The rescoring model with attention to lattices
achieves 4-5% relative word error rate reduction over first-pass and 6-8% with
attention to both lattices and acoustic features. We show that rescoring models
with attention to lattices outperform models with attention to n-best
hypotheses. We also study different ways to incorporate lattice weights in the
lattice encoder and demonstrate their importance for n-best rescoring.

  approach via free boundary Euler equations",,,,,"math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the motion of charged liquid drop in three dimensions where the
equations of motions are given by the Euler equations with free boundary with
an electric field. This is a well-known problem in physics going back to the
famous work by Rayleigh. Due to experiments and numerical simulations one
expects the charged drop to form conical singularities called Taylor cones,
which we interpret as singularities of the flow. In this paper, we study the
well-posedness, regularity and the formation of singularities of the solution.
Our main theorem roughly states that if the flow remains C^{1,\alpha}-regular
in shape and the velocity remains Lipschitz-continuous, then the flow remains
smooth, i.e., C^{\infty} in time and space, assuming that the initial data is
smooth. Due to the appearance of Taylor cones we expect the
C^{1,\alpha}-regularity assumption to be optimal, while the
Lipschitz-regularity assumption on the velocity is standard in the classical
theory of the Euler equations. We also quantify the C^{\infty}-estimate via
high order energy estimates. This result is new also for the Euler equations
with free boundary without the electric field. We point out that we do not
consider the problem of existence in this paper. It will be studied in
forthcoming work.

strong stellar wind creates a bow shock as it interacts with the interstellar
medium. This bow shock has previously been detected in H$\alpha$ and IR, but,
similar to all but one bow shock from a massive runaway star (BD+43$^{\rm
o}$3654), has escaped detection in other wavebands. We report on the discovery
of $1.3$ GHz radio emission from the Vela X-1 bow shock with the MeerKAT
telescope. The MeerKAT observations reveal how the radio emission closely
traces the H$\alpha$ line emission, both in the bow shock and in the
larger-scale diffuse structures known from existing H$\alpha$ surveys. The Vela
X-1 bow shock is the first stellar-wind-driven radio bow shock detected around
an X-ray binary. In the absence of a radio spectral index measurement, we
explore other avenues to constrain the radio emission mechanism. We find that
thermal/free-free emission can account for the radio and H$\alpha$ properties,
for a combination of electron temperature and density consistent with earlier
estimates of ISM density and the shock enhancement. In this explanation, the
presence of a local ISM over-density is essential for the detection of radio
emission. Alternatively, we consider a non-thermal/synchrotron scenario,
evaluating the magnetic field and broad-band spectrum of the shock. However, we
find that exceptionally high fractions ($\gtrsim 13$%) of the kinetic wind
power would need to be injected into the relativistic electron population to
explain the radio emission. Assuming lower fractions implies a hybrid scenario,
dominated by free-free radio emission. Finally, we speculate about the
detectability of radio bow shocks and whether it requires exceptional ISM or
stellar wind properties.

projections for future mortality rates. Throughout the paper we put focus on
the Li & Lee mortality model, which has become a standard for projecting
mortality in Belgium and the Netherlands. We calibrate this mortality model on
annual deaths and exposures at the level of individual ages. This type of
mortality data is typically collected, produced and reported with a significant
delay of -- for some countries -- several years on a platform such as the Human
Mortality Database. To enable a timely evaluation of the impact of a pandemic
data point we have to rely on other data sources (e.g. the Short-Term Mortality
Fluctuations Data series) that swiftly publish weekly mortality data collected
in age buckets. To be compliant with the design and calibration strategy of the
Li & Lee model, we have to transform the weekly mortality data collected in age
buckets to yearly, age-specific observations. Therefore, our paper constructs a
protocol to ungroup the deaths and exposures registered in age buckets to
individual ages. To evaluate the impact of a pandemic shock, like COVID-19 in
the year 2020, we weigh this data point in either the calibration or projection
step. Obviously, the more weight we place on this data point, the more impact
we observe on future estimated mortality rates and life expectancies. Our paper
allows to quantify this impact and provides actuaries and actuarial
associations with a framework to generate scenarios of future mortality under
various assessments of the pandemic data point.

which naturally leads us to inquire whether it is possible to find or determine
close classical analogs of quantum states in phase space -- a common meeting
point to both classical and quantum density statistical descriptors. Here, this
issue is tackled by investigating the behavior of classical analogs arising
upon the removal of all interference traits displayed by the Wigner
distribution functions associated with a given pure quantum state. Accordingly,
the dynamical evolution of the linear and von Neumann entropies is numerically
computed for a continuous-variable bipartite system, and compared with the
corresponding classical counterparts, in the case of two quartic oscillators
nonlinearly coupled under regular and chaos conditions. Three quantum states
for the full system are considered: a Gaussian state, a cat state, and a
Bell-type state. By comparing the quantum and classical entropy values, and
particularly their trends, it is shown that, instead of entanglement
production, such entropies rather provide us with information on the system
(either quantum or classical) delocalization. This gradual loss of information
translates into an increase in both the quantum and the classical realms,
directly connected to the increase in the correlations between both parties'
degrees of freedom which, in the quantum case, is commonly related to the
production of entanglement.

improvements over the basic single-speaker method are proposed that increase
the prosodic control range and coverage. More specifically we employ data
augmentation, F0 normalization, balanced clustering for duration, and
speaker-independent prosodic clustering. These modifications enable
fine-grained phoneme-level prosody control for all speakers contained in the
training set, while maintaining the speaker identity. The model is also
fine-tuned to unseen speakers with limited amounts of data and it is shown to
maintain its prosody control capabilities, verifying that the
speaker-independent prosodic clustering is effective. Experimental results
verify that the model maintains high output speech quality and that the
proposed method allows efficient prosody control within each speaker's range
despite the variability that a multispeaker setting introduces.

observed with the IceCube neutrino telescope at the South Pole are unknown. So
far, only a gamma-ray blazar was compellingly associated with the emission of
high-energy neutrinos. In addition, several studies suggest that the neutrino
emission from the gamma-ray blazar population only accounts for a small
fraction of the total astrophysical neutrino flux. In this work we probe the
production of high-energy neutrinos in the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN), induced by accelerated cosmic rays in the accretion disk region. We
present a likelihood analysis based on eight years of IceCube data, searching
for a cumulative neutrino signal from three AGN samples created for this work.
The neutrino emission is assumed to be proportional to the accretion disk
luminosity estimated from the soft X-ray flux. Next to the observed soft X-ray
flux, the objects for the three samples have been selected based on their radio
emission and infrared color properties. For the largest sample in this search,
an excess of high-energy neutrino events with respect to an isotropic
background of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos is found, corresponding
to a post-trial significance of 2.60$\sigma$. Assuming a power-law spectrum,
the best-fit spectral index is $2.03^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$, consistent with
expectations from particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. If
interpreted as a genuine signal with the assumptions of a proportionality of
X-ray and neutrino fluxes and a model for the sub-threshold flux distribution,
this observation implies that at 100 TeV, 27$\%$ - 100$\%$ of the observed
neutrinos arise from particle acceleration in the core of AGN.

hypersurface is mean convex, we prove that the mean convex solution to the flow

of the most unique features of disordered systems and has been linked to many
anomalous properties of glass materials. The nature and structural origin of
the boson peak remain elusive and have been debated for more than a half
century mainly due to the lack of real-time and real-space experimental
insights of the dynamic phenomenon. In this work we employed femtosecond MeV
ultrafast electron diffraction to characterize the atomic dynamics of metallic
glasses in real time. The experiment reveals collective atomic oscillations,
presented in elastic electron scattering and atomic pair distribution
functions, within the boson peak frequency range of 1.0-1.8 THz in both
reciprocal and real space. It was found that the oscillation frequency has
reciprocal dependence on interatomic pair distances and the corresponding wave
velocity experimentally affirms the transverse acoustic wave nature of the
boson peak. The observed strong correlation between THz acoustic vibrations and
coherent electron scattering provides compelling evidence that the boson peak
originates from the collective transverse vibrational modes of structurally
ordered atoms in the disordered system.

a word-level sequence conditioned only on the phonetic information in order to

classification and segmentation, has found many applications: for example in
human-in-the-loop tasks such as film post-production where it enables sharing
of domain expertise of human artists in an efficient and effective fashion. In
many such applications, we need to protect the training data from being leaked
when gradients are shared in the training process due to IP or privacy
concerns. Recent works have demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct the
training data from gradients for an image-classification model when its
architecture is known. However, there is still an incomplete theoretical
understanding of the efficacy and failure of such attacks. In this paper, we
analyse the source of training-data leakage from gradients. We formulate the
problem of training data reconstruction as solving an optimisation problem
iteratively for each layer. The layer-wise objective function is primarily
defined by weights and gradients from the current layer as well as the output
from the reconstruction of the subsequent layer, but it might also involve a
'pull-back' constraint from the preceding layer. Training data can be
reconstructed when we solve the problem backward from the output of the network
through each layer. Based on this formulation, we are able to attribute the
potential leakage of the training data in a deep network to its architecture.
We also propose a metric to measure the level of security of a deep learning
model against gradient-based attacks on the training data.

decomposition is found impossible for collisionless shocks due to the
dispersive nature of ion acoustic waves. Weakly nonlinear corrections to their
frequency do not solve the problem. Weak collisionless shocks could be
inherently nonlinear, non-amenable to any linear superposition. Or they could
be nonexistent, as hinted by recent works.

hypothesis testing that strikes at the heart of statistical inference. Contrary
to what most current literature suggests, the paradox was central to the
Bayesian testing methodology developed by Sir Harold Jeffreys in the late
1930s. Jeffreys showed that the evidence against a point-null hypothesis
$\mathcal{H}_0$ scales with $\sqrt{n}$ and repeatedly argued that it would
therefore be mistaken to set a threshold for rejecting $\mathcal{H}_0$ at a
constant multiple of the standard error. Here we summarize Jeffreys's early
work on the paradox and clarify his reasons for including the $\sqrt{n}$ term.
The prior distribution is seen to play a crucial role; by implicitly correcting
for selection, small parameter values are identified as relatively surprising
under $\mathcal{H}_1$. We highlight the general nature of the paradox by
presenting both a fully frequentist and a fully Bayesian version. We also
demonstrate that the paradox does not depend on assigning prior mass to a point
hypothesis, as is commonly believed.

multiple clients while keeping the data private on-device. In this work, we
view the server-orchestrated federated learning process as a hierarchical
latent variable model where the server provides the parameters of a prior
distribution over the client-specific model parameters. We show that with
simple Gaussian priors and a hard version of the well known
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, learning in such a model corresponds
to FedAvg, the most popular algorithm for the federated learning setting. This
perspective on FedAvg unifies several recent works in the field and opens up
the possibility for extensions through different choices for the hierarchical
model. Based on this view, we further propose a variant of the hierarchical
model that employs prior distributions to promote sparsity. By similarly using
the hard-EM algorithm for learning, we obtain FedSparse, a procedure that can
learn sparse neural networks in the federated learning setting. FedSparse
reduces communication costs from client to server and vice-versa, as well as
the computational costs for inference with the sparsified network - both of
which are of great practical importance in federated learning.

$\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decays. A data sample corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $6\;fb^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$

coherency detection considering a recursive form of the typicality-based Data
analysis (TDA). It proposes a methodology that encloses the observation of the
variance of the typicality ({\tau} ) to asses the minimal window length
necessary to determine the coherent buses, where the properties of the TDA
approach and the groups of buses are iteratively calculated at every new data
point sampled. Once the variance of each group reaches a certain value, the
minimal window length is determined. Besides, this method preserves the TDA

that can describe the scene in a uniform way, independent of its domain. A
model to describe a traffic scene in a semantic way is described in this paper.
The description model allows to describe a traffic scene independently of the
road geometry and road topology. Here, the traffic participants are projected
onto the road network and represented as nodes in a graph. Depending on the
relative location between two traffic participants with respect to the road
topology, semantically classified edges are created between the corresponding
nodes. For concretization, the edge attributes are extended by relative
distances and velocities between both traffic participants with regard to the
course of the lane. An important aspect of the description is that it can be
converted easily into a machine-readable format. The current description
focuses on dynamic objects of a traffic scene and considers traffic
participants, such as pedestrians or vehicles.

Radiation-hydrodynamics calculations were performed in 1D to optimize both the
remaining boron rho-R and the DT neutron yield. A charged-particle transport
post-processor has been developed to study $\alpha$-induced reactions on the
ablator material. Results indicate a large $^{13}{\rm N}$ production from
$\alpha$-induced reactions on $^{10}{\rm B}$, measurable by the radiochemical
analysis of gaseous samples system at the NIF. The PDXP target N201115-001 was
successfully fielded on the NIF, and nitrogen from the $^{10}{\rm

yield, as well as the DT neutron yield, was, however, lower than expected. Some
of the reduced yields can be explained by the oblate shape, but the ratios of
the various radiochemical signals are not commensurate with expectations based
on a simple reduction of the 1D results. Preliminary 2D radiation-hydrodynamics
computations are consistent with the experimental measurements, and work is
ongoing to extend the radiochemistry analysis into higher dimensions.

source domains to an unseen target domain. The source domains always require
precise annotations, which can be cumbersome or even infeasible to obtain in
practice due to the vast amount of data involved. Web data, however, offers an
opportunity to access large amounts of unlabeled data with rich style
information, which can be leveraged to improve DG. From this perspective, we
introduce a novel paradigm of DG, termed as Semi-Supervised Domain
Generalization (SSDG), to explore how the labeled and unlabeled source domains
can interact, and establish two settings, including the close-set and open-set
SSDG. The close-set SSDG is based on existing public DG datasets, while the
open-set SSDG, built on the newly-collected web-crawled datasets, presents a
novel yet realistic challenge that pushes the limits of current technologies. A
natural approach of SSDG is to transfer knowledge from labeled data to
unlabeled data via pseudo labeling, and train the model on both labeled and
pseudo-labeled data for generalization. Since there are conflicting goals
between domain-oriented pseudo labeling and out-of-domain generalization, we
develop a pseudo labeling phase and a generalization phase independently for
SSDG. Unfortunately, due to the large domain gap, the pseudo labels provided in
the pseudo labeling phase inevitably contain noise, which has negative affect
on the subsequent generalization phase. Therefore, to improve the quality of
pseudo labels and further enhance generalizability, we propose a cyclic
learning framework to encourage a positive feedback between these two phases,
utilizing an evolving intermediate domain that bridges the labeled and
unlabeled domains in a curriculum learning manner...

trajectories cannot escape to infinity at exponential speed. For a discrete
linear system of this type without switching the fastest-growing trajectory
must grow as an exact polynomial function of time, and a significant body of
prior research has focused on investigating how far this intuitive picture can
be extended from systems without switching to cases where switching is present.
In this note we give an example of a family of discrete linear switched systems
in three dimensions, with two switching states, for which this intuition fails
badly: for a generic member of this family the maximal rate of uniform growth
of escaping trajectories can be made arbitrarily slow along one subsequence of
times and yet also faster than any prescribed slower-than-linear function along
a complementary subsequence of times. Using this construction we give new
counterexamples to a conjecture of Chitour, Mason and Sigalotti and obtain a
negative answer to a related question of Jungers, Protasov and Blondel. Our
examples have the additional feature that marginal stability and marginal
instability are densely intermingled in the same parameter space.

optimizing over distribution parameters, rather than over free angles. We show
numerically that this approach can be more competitive than gradient-free
methods, for a comparable amount of resources, both for noiseless and noisy
circuits. Another interesting feature of this approach to variational
compilation is that it does not need a separate register and long-range
interactions to estimate the end-point fidelity, which is an improvement over
methods which rely on the Hilbert-Schmidt test. We expect these techniques to
be relevant for training variational circuits in other contexts.

immediate consequence is that the norm of the iteration matrix cannot be
smaller than unoty as soon as the coarse problem has fewer degrees-of-freedom

which is necessary to obtain meaningful speedups. For diffusive problems, in
the worst-case where the iteration error contracts only as fast as the powers
of the iteration matrix norm, making Parareal as accurate as the fine method
will take about as many iterations as there are processors, making meaningful
speedup impossible. Numerical examples with a non-normal system matrix show
that for diffusive problems good speedup is possible, but that for

tasks which execute in parallel to accelerate job completion rates and reduce
energy consumption. However, a common performance problem in such systems is
dealing with straggler tasks that are slow running instances that increase the
overall response time. Such tasks can significantly impact the system's Quality
of Service (QoS) and the Service Level Agreements (SLA). To combat this issue,
there is a need for automatic straggler detection and mitigation mechanisms
that execute jobs without violating the SLA. Prior work typically builds
reactive models that focus first on detection and then mitigation of straggler
tasks, which leads to delays. Other works use prediction based proactive
mechanisms, but ignore heterogeneous host or volatile task characteristics. In
this paper, we propose a Straggler Prediction and Mitigation Technique (START)
that is able to predict which tasks might be stragglers and dynamically adapt
scheduling to achieve lower response times. Our technique analyzes all tasks
and hosts based on compute and network resource consumption using an Encoder
Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network. The output of this network is then used
to predict and mitigate expected straggler tasks. This reduces the SLA
violation rate and execution time without compromising QoS. Specifically, we
use the CloudSim toolkit to simulate START in a cloud environment and compare
it with state-of-the-art techniques (IGRU-SD, SGC, Dolly, GRASS, NearestFit and
Wrangler) in terms of QoS parameters such as energy consumption, execution
time, resource contention, CPU utilization and SLA violation rate. Experiments
show that START reduces execution time, resource contention, energy and SLA
violations by 13%, 11%, 16% and 19%, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

this work, we elaborate on this perspective (from which the very term

resources features interesting properties, such as infinite families of
incomparable resources. In showing this, we derive new EPR resource monotones.

including wake/rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep)/Non-REM sleep 1

burdensome, and not suitable for daily use. For long-term sleep monitoring,
ubiquitous sensing may be a solution. Most recently, cardiac and movement
sensing has become popular in classifying three-stage sleep, since both
modalities can be easily acquired from research-grade or consumer-grade devices

accuracy remains an open question. In this work, we comprehensively studied
deep learning (DL)-based advanced fusion techniques consisting of three fusion
strategies alongside three fusion methods for three-stage sleep classification
based on two publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
important evidence that three-stage sleep can be reliably classified by fusing
cardiac/movement sensing modalities, which may potentially become a practical
tool to conduct large-scale sleep stage assessment studies or long-term
self-tracking on sleep. To accelerate the progression of sleep research in the

research fields such as smart city, healthcare, computer vision and geoscience,

devoted recently to developing novel segmentation strategies; one of the latest
outstanding achievements is panoptic segmentation. The latter has resulted from
the fusion of semantic and instance segmentation. Explicitly, panoptic
segmentation is currently under study to help gain a more nuanced knowledge of
the image scenes for video surveillance, crowd counting, self-autonomous
driving, medical image analysis, and a deeper understanding of the scenes in
general. To that end, we present in this paper the first comprehensive review
of existing panoptic segmentation methods to the best of the authors'
knowledge. Accordingly, a well-defined taxonomy of existing panoptic techniques
is performed based on the nature of the adopted algorithms, application
scenarios, and primary objectives. Moreover, the use of panoptic segmentation
for annotating new datasets by pseudo-labeling is discussed. Moving on,
ablation studies are carried out to understand the panoptic methods from
different perspectives. Moreover, evaluation metrics suitable for panoptic
segmentation are discussed, and a comparison of the performance of existing
solutions is provided to inform the state-of-the-art and identify their
limitations and strengths. Lastly, the current challenges the subject

The former is provably zero when the wave function can be taken to be real
valued, and the latter, known as the diagonal Born--Oppenheimer correction
(DBOC), is typically small in magnitude. Therefore, unless high accuracy is
sought, the diagonal nonadiabatic term is usually neglected when calculating
molecular properties. In the presence of a magnetic field, the wave function is
generally complex, and the geometric vector potential gives rise to a screening
force that is qualitatively important for molecular dynamics. This screening
force is written in terms of the Berry curvature and is added to the bare
Lorentz force acting on the nuclei in the presence of the field. In this work,
we derive analytic expressions for the Berry curvature and DBOC using both
first and second quantization formalisms for the case of generalized and
restricted Hartree--Fock theories in a uniform magnetic field. The Berry
curvature and DBOC are calculated as a function of the magnetic field strength
and the bond distance for the ground-state singlets of H$_2$, LiH, BH, and
CH$^+$. We also examine the stability and time-reversal symmetry of the
underlying self-consistent field solutions. The character of the DBOC and Berry
curvature is found to depend upon the magnetic field and varies between
molecules. We also identify instances of broken time-reversal symmetry for the
dissociation curves of BH and CH$^+$.

well-known direct-current superconducting quantum interference device. Due to
the phase gradient experimented by the on-site localized functions when the
system is subject to rotation, a phase difference appears on each junction in
order to satisfy the quantization of the velocity field around the torus. We
demonstrate that such a phase can produce a significant change on the relative

within a determined rotation frequency interval, a hopping parameter, usually
disregarded in nonrotating systems, turns out to rule the dynamics. At the
limits of such a frequency interval, bifurcations of the stationary points
occur, which substantially change the phase space portrait that describes the
orbits of the macroscopic canonical conjugate variables. We analyze the
emerging dynamics that combines the $0$ and $\pi$ Josephson modes, and evaluate
the small-oscillation time-periods of such orbits at the frequency range where
each mode survives. All the findings predicted by the model are confirmed by

the identification, or segmentation, of the blood vessels in an image or a set
of images, which is usually a challenging task. Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have been shown to provide excellent results regarding the segmentation
of blood vessels. One important aspect of CNNs is that they can be trained on
large amounts of data and then be made available, for instance, in image
processing software for wide use. The pre-trained CNNs can then be easily
applied in downstream blood vessel characterization tasks such as the
calculation of the length, tortuosity, or caliber of the blood vessels. Yet, it
is still unclear if pre-trained CNNs can provide robust, unbiased, results on
downstream tasks when applied to datasets that they were not trained on. Here,
we focus on measuring the tortuosity of blood vessels and investigate to which

obtained by a CNN trained from scratch on a dataset may not agree with those
obtained by a fine-tuned network that was pre-trained on a dataset having
different tortuosity statistics. In addition, we show that the improvement in
segmentation performance when fine-tuning the network does not necessarily lead
to a respective improvement on the estimation of the tortuosity. To mitigate
the aforementioned issues, we propose the application of specific data
augmentation techniques even in situations where they do not improve
segmentation performance.

power density. Experimental growths provide model validation with
characterisation using Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
This work demonstrates that shallow holders result in non-uniform diamond
films, with a radial variation akin to the electron density and temperature
distribution at the wafer surface. For the same process conditions, greater
homogeneity is observed for taller holders, however, if the height is too
extreme, the diamond quality reduces. From a modelling perspective, EM
solutions are limited but useful for examining electric field focusing at the

introduce a new mathematical model for the description of the so-called
modulated light curves, as found in periodic variable stars that exhibit
smoothly time-varying parameters such as amplitude, frequency, and/or phase.
Our model accounts for a smoothly time-varying trend, and a harmonic sum with
smoothly time-varying weights. In this sense, our approach is flexible because
it avoids restrictive assumptions (parametric or piecewise-constant) about the
functional form of trend and amplitudes. We apply our methodology to the light
curve of a pulsating RR Lyrae star characterised by the Blazhko effect. To
estimate the time-varying parameters of our model, we develop a semi-parametric
method for unequally spaced time series. The estimation of our time-varying
curves translates into the estimation of time-invariant parameters that can be
performed by ordinary least-squares, with the following two advantages:
modeling and forecasting can be implemented in a parametric fashion, and we are
able to cope with missing observations. To detect serial correlation in the
residuals of our fitted model, we derive the mathematical definition of the
spectral density for unequally spaced time series. The proposed method is

communication efficiency and its ability to deal with the problem of non-IID
data. FL training can be accelerated by a wireless communication method called
Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) which harnesses the interference of
simultaneous uplink transmissions to efficiently aggregate model updates.
However, since AirComp utilizes analog communication, it introduces inevitable
estimation errors. In this paper, we study the impact of such estimation errors
on the convergence of FL and propose retransmissions as a method to improve FL
convergence over resource-constrained wireless networks. First, we derive the
optimal AirComp power control scheme with retransmissions over static channels.
Then, we investigate the performance of Over-the-Air FL with retransmissions
and find two upper bounds on the FL loss function. Finally, we propose a
heuristic for selecting the optimal number of retransmissions, which can be
calculated before training the ML model. Numerical results demonstrate that the
introduction of retransmissions can lead to improved ML performance, without
incurring extra costs in terms of communication or computation. Additionally,
we provide simulation results on our heuristic which indicate that it can
correctly identify the optimal number of retransmissions for different wireless

demonstrated to be very successful in explaining and predicting human decisions
in multiple decision making contexts. However, as IBLT has evolved, the initial
description of the theory has become less precise, and it is unclear how its
demonstration can be expanded to more complex, dynamic, and multi-agent

components of IBLT in a comprehensive and precise form. It also provides an

computational issue in past implementations of IBL models, the curse of
exponential growth, that emerges from memory-based tabular computations. When
more observations accumulate over time, there is an exponential growth of the

computational time. Thus, SpeedyIBL leverages parallel computation with
vectorization to speed up the execution time of IBL models. We evaluate the
robustness of SpeedyIBL over an existing implementation of IBLT in decision
games of increased complexity. The results not only demonstrate the
applicability of IBLT through a wide range of decision making tasks, but also
highlight the improvement of SpeedyIBL over its prior implementation as the
complexity of decision features and number of agents increase. The library is

thought to be a short-lived event of thermal-timescale mass transfer which
strips the donor star of nearly its entire H-rich envelope, producing a hot
helium star. This long-standing picture is based on stellar models with
Hertzprung gap (HG) donors. Motivated by a finding that in low-metallicity
binaries, post-MS mass transfer may instead be initiated by core-helium burning
(CHeB) donors, we use the MESA code to compute grids of detailed massive binary
models at three metallicities: Solar and that of the Large and the Small
Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC). We find that metallicity strongly influences the
course and outcome of mass transfer. We identify two novel types of post-MS
mass transfer: (a) mass exchange on the long nuclear timescale that continues
until the end of the CHeB phase, and (b) rapid mass transfer leading to
detached binaries with mass-losers that are only partially stripped of their
envelopes. In neither (a) or (b) does the donor become a fully stripped helium
star by the end of CHeB. Boundaries between the different types of post-MS mass
transfer are associated with the degree of rapid post-MS expansion and, for a
given metallicity, are sensitive to the assumptions about internal mixing. At
low metallicity, we predict fewer hot fully stripped stars formed through
binary interactions and higher compactness of pre-supernova cores.
Nuclear-timescale post-MS mass transfer suggests a strong preference for
metal-poor host galaxies of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with black-hole (BH)
accretors and massive donors, some of which might be the immediate progenitors
of binary BH mergers. It also implies a population of interacting binaries with
blue and yellow supergiant donors. Partially-stripped stars could potentially
explain the puzzling nitrogen-enriched slowly-rotating (super)giants in the
LMC.

  against adversarial attacks","12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Traditional deep learning networks (DNN) exhibit intriguing vulnerabilities
that allow an attacker to force them to fail at their task. Notorious attacks
such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the more powerful Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) generate adversarial samples by adding a magnitude of
perturbation $\epsilon$ to the input's computed gradient, resulting in a
deterioration of the effectiveness of the model's classification. This work
introduces a model that is resilient to adversarial attacks. Our model
leverages an established mechanism of defense which utilizes randomness and a
population of DNNs. More precisely, our model consists of a population of $n$
diverse submodels, each one of them trained to individually obtain a high
accuracy for the task at hand, while forced to maintain meaningful differences
in their weights. Each time our model receives a classification query, it
selects a submodel from its population at random to answer the query. To
counter the attack transferability, diversity is introduced and maintained in
the population of submodels. Thus introducing the concept of counter linking
weights. A Counter-Linked Model (CLM) consists of a population of DNNs of the
same architecture where a periodic random similarity examination is conducted
during the simultaneous training to guarantee diversity while maintaining
accuracy. Though the randomization technique proved to be resilient against
adversarial attacks, we show that by retraining the DNNs ensemble or training
them from the start with counter linking would enhance the robustness by around
20\% when tested on the MNIST dataset and at least 15\% when tested on the
CIFAR-10 dataset. When CLM is coupled with adversarial training, this defense
mechanism achieves state-of-the-art robustness.

of a Nortek Signature1000 acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) regarding
fine-scale turbulence measurements. Current profilers offer the advantage of
gaining more coherent measurement data than available with point acoustic
measurements, and it is desirable to exploit this property in laboratory and
field applications. The ADCP was tested in a towing tank, where turbulence was
generated from a grid towed under controlled conditions. Grid-induced
turbulence is a well-studied phenomenon and a good approximation for isotropic
turbulence. Several previous experiments are available for comparison and there
are developed theories within the topic. In the present experiments, an
acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV), which is an established instrument for
turbulence measurements, was applied to validate the ADCP. It was found that
the mean flow measured with the ADCP was accurate within 4% of the ADV. The
turbulent variance was reasonably well resolved by the ADCP when large grid
bars were towed at a high speed, but largely overestimated for lower towing
speed and smaller grid bars. The effective cutoff frequency and turbulent eddy
size were characterized experimentally, which provides detailed guidelines for
when the ADCP data can be trusted and will allow future experimentalists to
decide a priori if the Nortek Signature can be used in their setup. We conclude
that the ADCP is not suitable for resolving turbulent spectra in a small-scale
grid-induced flow due to the intrinsic Doppler noise and the low spatial and
temporal sample resolution relative to the turbulent scales.

these more involved methods are required will depend on whether the model is
really misspecified, and there is a lack of generally applicable methods to
answer this question. In this paper, we propose one such method. More
precisely, we propose kernel-based hypothesis tests for the challenging
composite testing problem, where we are interested in whether the data comes
from any distribution in some parametric family. Our tests make use of minimum
distance estimators based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the kernel Stein
discrepancy. They are widely applicable, including whenever the density of the
parametric model is known up to normalisation constant, or if the model takes
the form of a simulator. As our main result, we show that we are able to
estimate the parameter and conduct our test on the same data (without data

on a range of problems, including testing for goodness-of-fit of an
unnormalised non-parametric density model, and an intractable generative model

elementary planes is closed. This is achieved by obtaining a complete list of
elementary planes in $M_A$, indexed by their intersection with the convex core
boundary. The key idea is to recover information on a closed geodesic plane in
$M_A$ from its boundary data; requiring the plane to be elementary in turn puts
restrictions on these data.

velocity. It enables us to, for example, compute wavelengths, wave potentials,
and determine the energy of resonant particles. The phase velocity of a wave,
observed by a single spacecraft equipped with electric field probes, can be
determined using interferometry techniques. While several methods have been
developed to do this, they have not been documented in detail. In this study,
we use an analytical model to analyze and compare three interferometry methods
applied on the probe geometry of the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. One
method relies on measured probe potentials, whereas the other two use different
E-field measurements: one by reconstructing the E-field between two probes and
the spacecraft, the other by constructing four pairwise parallel E-field
components in the spacecraft spin-plane. We find that the potential method is
sensitive both to how planar the wave is, and to spacecraft potential changes
due to the wave. The E-field methods are less affected by the spacecraft
potential, and while the reconstructed E-field method is applicable in some
cases, the second E-field method is almost always preferable. We conclude that
the potential based interferometry method is useful when spacecraft potential
effects are negligible and the signals of the different probes are very well
correlated. The method using two pairs of parallel E-fields is practically
always preferable to the reconstructed E-field method and produces the correct
velocity in the spin-plane, but it requires knowledge of the propagation
direction to provide the full velocity.

video reconstruction, producing good-quality depth estimation is challenging.
Neural networks can be easily fooled by photometric distractions or fail to

that result in broken meshes. Aiming to fundamentally improve the depth
estimation quality for colonoscopy 3D reconstruction, in this work we have
designed a set of training losses to deal with the special challenges of

objectives was developed, using both depth and surface normal information.
Also, the classic photometric loss was extended with feature matching to
compensate for illumination noise. With the training losses powerful enough,
our self-supervised framework named ColDE is able to produce better depth maps
of colonoscopy data as compared to the previous work utilizing prior depth
knowledge. Used in reconstruction, our network is able to reconstruct
good-quality colon meshes in real-time without any post-processing, making it

covering them with shell-strips. As an illustration, we provide optimized

product quality is an important property that informs whether the products of
the process are within the specifications. In particular, the delays caused by
sample processing (collection, laboratory measurements, results analysis,

deal with this problem is soft sensors. Soft sensors are a collection of models
that can be used to predict and forecast some infrequently measured properties
(such as laboratory measurements of petroleum products) based on more frequent
measurements of quantities like temperature, pressure and flow rate provided by
physical sensors. Soft sensors short-cut the pathway to obtain relevant
information about the product quality, often providing measurements as
frequently as every minute. One of the applications of soft sensors is for the
real-time optimization of a chemical process by a targeted adaptation of
operating parameters. Models used for soft sensors can have various forms,
however, among the most common are those based on artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While soft sensors can deal with some of the issues in the refinery
processes, their development and deployment can pose other challenges that are
addressed in this paper. Firstly, it is important to enhance the quality of
both sets of data (laboratory measurements and physical sensors) in a data
pre-processing stage (as described in Methodology section). Secondly, once the
data sets are pre-processed, different models need to be tested against

with relatively low cost by using non-expert workers. Inferring correct labels
from multiple noisy answers on data, however, has been a challenging problem,
since the quality of the answers varies widely across tasks and workers. Many
existing works have assumed that there is a fixed ordering of workers in terms
of their skill levels, and focused on estimating worker skills to aggregate the
answers from workers with different weights. In practice, however, the worker
skill changes widely across tasks, especially when the tasks are heterogeneous.
In this paper, we consider a new model, called $d$-type specialization model,
in which each task and worker has its own (unknown) type and the reliability of
each worker can vary in the type of a given task and that of a worker. We allow
that the number $d$ of types can scale in the number of tasks. In this model,
we characterize the optimal sample complexity to correctly infer the labels
within any given accuracy, and propose label inference algorithms achieving the

trading systems represented by reinforcement learning have emerged in the stock
trading market. The authors combined the deep Q network in reinforcement
learning with the sentiment quantitative indicator ARBR to build a
high-frequency stock trading model for the share market. To improve the
performance of the model, the PCA algorithm is used to reduce the
dimensionality feature vector while incorporating the influence of market
sentiment on the long-short power into the spatial state of the trading model
and uses the LSTM layer to replace the fully connected layer to solve the
traditional DQN model due to limited empirical data storage. Through the use of
cumulative income, Sharpe ratio to evaluate the performance of the model and
the use of double moving averages and other strategies for comparison. The
results show that the improved model proposed by authors is far superior to the
comparison model in terms of income, achieving a maximum annualized rate of
return of 54.5%, which is proven to be able to increase reinforcement learning
performance significantly in stock trading.

researchers try to quantify these effects to predict the future net value by
establishing different models. The current prediction models usually can only
reflect the linear variation law, poorly handled or selectively ignore their
nonlinear characteristics, so the prediction results are usually less accurate.
This paper uses a fund prediction method based on the ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model.
After preprocessing the historical data, the first filter out the linear data
characteristics with the ARIMA model, then pass the data to the LSTM model to
extract the nonlinear characteristic by residual, and finally superposition the
respective prediction values of the two models to obtain the prediction results
of the hybrid model. Empirically shows that the methods in the paper are more
accurate and applicable than traditional fund prediction methods.

quantitative trading is considered to be profitable. Based on this, this paper
proposes an improved deep recurrent DRQN-ARBR model because the existing
quantitative trading model ignores the impact of irrational investor behavior
on the market, making the application effect poor in an environment where the
stock market in China is non-efficiency. By changing the fully connected layer
in the original model to the LSTM layer and using the emotion indicator ARBR to
construct a trading strategy, this model solves the problems of the traditional
DQN model with limited memory for empirical data storage and the impact of
observable Markov properties on performance. At the same time, this paper also
improved the shortcomings of the original model with fewer stock states and
chose more technical indicators as the input values of the model. The
experimental results show that the DRQN-ARBR algorithm proposed in this paper
can significantly improve the performance of reinforcement learning in stock
trading.

wind and photovoltaic power plants is very promising in the context of a rapid
reduction of the emission of CO2, which can lead to a swift mitigation climate
change if this growth behavior is maintained in the future. In this review we
identify a set of ten limiting factors that can restrain, or halt back, an
exponential growth of these variable renewable power plants (VREs) in the
future. If the exponential growth slows down to a linear growth, such a case
would extent considerably the time to reduce the CO2 emissions and the related
mitigation of climate change. A scenario that would result to a much higher
risk of a future continuation of the economic grow and thrive of the global
economy and human society. We argue that if these limiting factors are
adequately addressed to an exponential expansion VRE power plants is feasible
and can result in the nearly complete avoidance of CO2 emissions as related to
energy generation and consumption in 2030.

flows from the option. At each time step, one needs to compare the immediate
exercise value with the continuation value and decide to exercise as soon as
the exercise value is strictly greater than the continuation value. We can
formulate this problem as a dynamic programming equation, where the main
difficulty comes from the computation of the conditional expectations
representing the continuation values at each time step. In (Longstaff and
Schwartz, 2001), these conditional expectations were estimated using
regressions on a finite-dimensional vector space (typically a polynomial
basis). In this paper, we follow the same algorithm; only the conditional
expectations are estimated using Regression trees or Random forests. We discuss
the convergence of the LS algorithm when the standard least squares regression
is replaced with regression trees. Finally, we expose some numerical results
with regression trees and random forests. The random forest algorithm gives
excellent results in high dimensions.
