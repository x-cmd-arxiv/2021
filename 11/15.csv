  Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2022 (CCS '22)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Secure aggregation is a cryptographic protocol that securely computes the
aggregation of its inputs. It is pivotal in keeping model updates private in
federated learning. Indeed, the use of secure aggregation prevents the server
from learning the value and the source of the individual model updates provided
by the users, hampering inference and data attribution attacks. In this work,
we show that a malicious server can easily elude secure aggregation as if the
latter were not in place. We devise two different attacks capable of inferring
information on individual private training datasets, independently of the
number of users participating in the secure aggregation. This makes them
concrete threats in large-scale, real-world federated learning applications.
The attacks are generic and equally effective regardless of the secure
aggregation protocol used. They exploit a vulnerability of the federated
learning protocol caused by incorrect usage of secure aggregation and lack of
parameter validation. Our work demonstrates that current implementations of
federated learning with secure aggregation offer only a ""false sense of

convolution has recently demonstrated its advantages for 3D semantic analysis.
The advantages are, however, brought by expensive computations on dense,
volumetric data, which prevent its practical use for efficient processing of 3D
data that are inherently sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel design of
Sparse Steerable Convolution (SS-Conv) to address the shortcoming; SS-Conv
greatly accelerates steerable convolution with sparse tensors, while strictly
preserving the property of SE(3)-equivariance. Based on SS-Conv, we propose a
general pipeline for precise estimation of object poses, wherein a key design
is a Feature-Steering module that takes the full advantage of
SE(3)-equivariance and is able to conduct an efficient pose refinement. To
verify our designs, we conduct thorough experiments on three tasks of 3D object
semantic analysis, including instance-level 6D pose estimation, category-level
6D pose and size estimation, and category-level 6D pose tracking. Our proposed
pipeline based on SS-Conv outperforms existing methods on almost all the
metrics evaluated by the three tasks. Ablation studies also show the
superiority of our SS-Conv over alternative convolutions in terms of both
accuracy and efficiency. Our code is released publicly at

Specially designed narrowband filters were used to observe the central engine

independently perform the extraction of the continuum light curves. The
inter-band time lags are measured with several methods, including the
interpolated cross-correlation function, the z-transformed discrete correlation

PG 2130+099 displays correlated variability across the optical range, and we
successfully detect significant time lags of up to 3 days between the multiband

AGN's host-galaxy-subtracted rest-frame 5100{\AA} luminosity at the time of our

scenario invoking hadronuclear interactions of primary protons on the BLR

PCR-LE achieves minimax rates of convergence for random design regression over
Sobolev spaces. Under sufficient smoothness conditions on the design density
$p$, PCR-LE achieves the optimal rates for both estimation (where the optimal
rate in squared $L^2$ norm is known to be $n^{-2s/(2s + d)}$) and
goodness-of-fit testing ($n^{-4s/(4s + d)}$). We also show that PCR-LE is
\emph{manifold adaptive}: that is, we consider the situation where the design
is supported on a manifold of small intrinsic dimension $m$, and give upper
bounds establishing that PCR-LE achieves the faster minimax estimation
($n^{-2s/(2s + m)}$) and testing ($n^{-4s/(4s + m)}$) rates of convergence.
Interestingly, these rates are almost always much faster than the known rates
of convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to their population-level
limits; in other words, for this problem regression with estimated features
appears to be much easier, statistically speaking, than estimating the features
itself. We support these theoretical results with empirical evidence.

decision processes (CMDPs) can provide long-term safety constraints; however,
the agent may violate the constraints in an effort to explore its environment.
This paper proposes a model-based RL algorithm called Explicit Explore,
Exploit, or Escape ($E^{4}$), which extends the Explicit Explore or Exploit
($E^{3}$) algorithm to a robust CMDP setting. $E^4$ explicitly separates
exploitation, exploration, and escape CMDPs, allowing targeted policies for
policy improvement across known states, discovery of unknown states, as well as
safe return to known states. $E^4$ robustly optimises these policies on the
worst-case CMDP from a set of CMDP models consistent with the empirical
observations of the deployment environment. Theoretical results show that $E^4$
finds a near-optimal constraint-satisfying policy in polynomial time whilst
satisfying safety constraints throughout the learning process. We then discuss
$E^4$ as a practical algorithmic framework, including robust-constrained
offline optimisation algorithms, the design of uncertainty sets for the
transition dynamics of unknown states, and how to further leverage empirical
observations and prior knowledge to relax some of the worst-case assumptions

waveforms in future terahertz (THz)-band communication systems remain
unresolved. On the one hand, the limited multi-path components at high
frequencies result in frequency-flat channels that favor low-complexity
wideband SC systems. On the other hand, frequency-dependent molecular
absorption and transceiver characteristics and the existence of multi-path
components in indoor sub-THz systems can still result in frequency-selective
channels, favoring off-the-shelf MC schemes such as orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Variations of SC/MC designs result in
different THz spectrum utilization, but spectral efficiency is not the primary
concern with substantial available bandwidths; baseband complexity, power
efficiency, and hardware impairment constraints are predominant. This paper
presents a comprehensive study of SC/MC modulations for THz communications,
utilizing an accurate wideband THz channel model and highlighting the various
performance and complexity trade-offs of the candidate schemes. Simulations
demonstrate that discrete-Fourier-transform spread orthogonal time-frequency
space (DFT-s-OTFS) achieves a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than
OFDM and OTFS and enhances immunity to THz impairments and Doppler spreads, but
at an increased complexity cost. Moreover, DFT-s-OFDM is a promising candidate
that increases robustness to THz impairments and phase noise (PHN) at a low
PAPR and overall complexity.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) is critical for inferring nucleosynthesis and
interpreting a detected neutrino signal. The role of direction-changing
collisions in shaping the neutrino flavor field in these environments is
important and poorly understood; it has not been treated self-consistently.
There has been progress, via numerical integration, to include the effects of
collisions in the dynamics of the neutrino flavor field. While this has led to
important insights, integration is limited by its requirement that full initial
conditions must be assumed known. On the contrary, feedback from collisions to
the neutrino field is a boundary value problem. Numerical integration
techniques are poorly equipped to handle that formulation. This paper
demonstrates that an inference formulation of the problem can solve a simple
collision-only model representing a CCSN core -- without full knowledge of
initial conditions. Rather, the procedure solves a two-point boundary value
problem with partial information at the bounds. The model is sufficiently
simple that physical reasoning may be used as a confidence check on the
inference-based solution, and the procedure recovers the expected model
dynamics. This result demonstrates that inference can solve a problem that is
artificially hidden from integration techniques -- a problem that is an
important feature of flavor evolution in dense environments. Thus, it is
worthwhile to explore means of augmenting the existing powerful integration
tools with inference-based approaches.

of variable-order fractional integration was introduced for the Bernoulli

algorithm for the PCW problem in directed graphs that returns a rooted tree
whose prize-collecting cost is at most the optimum value of the
prize-collecting walks problem.
  We utilize our algorithm to develop combinatorial approximation algorithms
for two fundamental vehicle-routing problems (VRPs): (1) orienteering; and (2)
$k$-minimum-latency problem ($k$-MLP), wherein we seek to cover all nodes using
$k$ paths starting at a prescribed root node, so as to minimize the sum of the

Consequently, we obtain combinatorial implementations of these algorithms with
substantially improved running times compared with the current-best

enabling the storage of more than one bit per cell in the Flash device, i.e.,
having more than two charge levels per cell. Constrained coding is used in
Flash devices to increase reliability via mitigating inter-cell interference
that stems from charge propagation among cells. Recently, capacity-achieving
constrained codes were introduced to serve that purpose in modern Flash
devices, which have more than two levels per cell. While these codes result in
minimal redundancy via exploiting the underlying physics, they result in
non-negligible complexity increase and access speed limitation since pages
cannot be read separately. In this paper, we suggest new constrained coding
schemes that have low-complexity and preserve the desirable high access speed
in modern Flash devices. The idea is to eliminate error-prone patterns by
coding data only on the left-most page while leaving data on all the remaining
pages uncoded. Our coding schemes work for any number of levels per cell, offer
systematic encoding and decoding, and are capacity-approaching. Since the
proposed schemes enable the separation of pages, we refer to them as
read-and-run (RR) constrained coding schemes as opposed to schemes adopting
read-and-wait for other pages. We analyze the new RR coding schemes and discuss
their impact on the probability of occurrence of different charge levels. We
also demonstrate the performance improvement achieved via RR coding on a

and are unique probes of intergalactic electron density fluctuations. By using
the recently released First CHIME/FRB Catalog, we reexamined the structure
function (SF) of DM fluctuations. It shows a large DM fluctuation similar to
that previously reported in Xu & Zhang (2020), but no clear correlation hinting
towards large scale turbulence is reproduced with this larger sample. To
suppress the distortion effect from FRB distances and their host DMs, we focus
on a subset of CHIME catalog with DM $<500$ pc cm$^{-3}$. A trend of
non-constant SF and non-zero correlation function (CF) at angular separations
$\theta$ less than $10^\circ$ is seen, but with large statistical
uncertainties. The difference found between SF and that derived from CF at
$\theta \lesssim 10^\circ$ can be ascribed to the large statistical
uncertainties or the density inhomogeneities on scales on the order of $100$
Mpc. The possible correlation of electron density fluctuations and
inhomogeneities of density distribution should be tested when several thousands
of FRBs are available.

adaptive view aggregation to balance the different stereo baselines between the

stable (that is, expected queue sizes are uniformly bounded over time) but can
also become delay unstable because of resource-sharing with other queues that

  Within this context, and for any given ""tail exponents"" of the input traffic,
we develop a necessary and sufficient condition under which a queue is robustly
delay stable, in terms of $jumping$ $fluid$ models - an extension of
traditional fluid models that allows for jumps along coordinates associated
with heavy-tailed flows. Our result elucidates the precise mechanism that leads
to delay instability, through a coordination of multiple abnormally large

(SMBH) in AGNs of the local Universe ($z<0.15$) based on near-infrared and hard
X-ray surveys (2MASS and Swift/BAT). Using sufficiently accurate black hole
mass estimates, we reliably estimated the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{Edd}$, for
approximately half of the objects in the AGN sample; for the remaining ones we
used a rougher estimate based on the correlation of $M_{BH}$ with the galaxy
stellar mass $M_\ast$. We found that for a wide range of galaxy masses,
$9.28<\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)<12.28$, including the most massive galaxies in the
local Universe, the distribution $f(\lambda_{Edd})$ above
$\log{\lambda_{Edd}}=-3$ can be described by a power law with
$M_\ast$-independent parameters, declining with a characteristic slope $\approx
0.7$ up to the Eddington limit ($\log{\lambda_{Edd}}\sim 0$), where there is
evidence for a break. In addition, there is evidence that at
$\log{\lambda_{Edd}}<-3$ the dependence $f(\lambda_{Edd})$ has a lower slope or
flattens out. The mean characteristic growth time of SMBHs at the present epoch
turns out to depend weakly on the galaxy stellar mass and to exceed the
lifetime of the Universe but by no more than one order of magnitude. The mean
duty cycle of SMBHs (the fraction of objects with $\lambda_{Edd}>0.01$) in the
local Universe also depends weakly on $M_\ast$ and is 0.2-1%. These results
confirm the trends found in previous studies for the earlier Universe and
refine the parameters of the dependence $f(\lambda_{Edd}|M_\ast)$ at $z<0.15$.
The revealed universal (weakly dependent on the galaxy stellar mass) pattern of
the dependence $f(\lambda_{Edd})$ probably stems from the fact that, at
present, the episodes of mass accretion onto SMBHs are associated mainly with
stochastic processes in galactic nuclei rather than with global galaxy
evolution processes.

Random- or center-cropping may leave out the video's subject altogether. To
address this, we propose an unsupervised video cropping approach by shaping
this as a retargeting and video-to-video synthesis problem. The synthesized
video maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio, is smaller in size and is targeted at
video-subject(s) throughout the entire duration. First, action localization is
performed on each frame by identifying patches with homogeneous motion
patterns. Thus, a single salient patch is pinpointed per frame. But to avoid
viewpoint jitters and flickering, any inter-frame scale or position changes
among the patches should be performed gradually over time. This issue is
addressed with a polyBezier fitting in 3D space that passes through some chosen
pivot timestamps and whose shape is influenced by the in-between control
timestamps. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
evaluate the video classification task by comparing our dynamic cropping
technique with random cropping on three benchmark datasets, viz. UCF-101,
HMDB-51 and ActivityNet v1.3. The clip and top-1 accuracy for video
classification after our cropping, outperform 3D CNN performances for

developed for models of diverse scale, from box models up to global models. At
the core of this novel framework is an ""abstracted aerosol representation"" that
allows a given chemical mechanism to be solved in atmospheric models with
different aerosol representations (e.g., sectional, modal, or
particle-resolved). This is accomplished by treating aerosols as a collection
of condensed phases that are implemented according to the aerosol
representation of the host model. The framework also allows multiple chemical
processes (e.g., gas- and aerosol-phase chemical reactions, emissions,
deposition, photolysis, and mass-transfer) to be solved simultaneously as a
single system. The flexibility of the model is achieved by (1) using an
object-oriented design that facilitates extensibility to new types of chemical
processes and to new ways of representing aerosol systems; (2) runtime model
configuration using JSON input files that permits making changes to any part of
the chemical mechanism without recompiling the model; this widely used,
human-readable format allows entire gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms
to be described with as much complexity as necessary; and (3) automated
comprehensive testing that ensures stability of the code as new functionality
is introduced. Together, these design choices enable users to build a
customized multiphase mechanism, without having to handle pre-processors,
solvers or compilers. This new treatment compiles as a stand-alone library and
has been deployed in the particle-resolved PartMC model and in the MONARCH
chemical weather prediction system for use at regional and global scales.
Results from the initial deployment will be discussed, along with future

hole (PBH) seeds in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation with numerical simulations.
We consider the non-linearity of the system by consistently taking into account
the noise dependence on the inflaton perturbations, while evolving the
perturbations on the coarse-grained background affected by the noise. We
capture in this way the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics, and demonstrate
that non-Markovian effects are subleading. Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we
find the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the comoving curvature
perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We consider inflationary potentials that fit the
CMB and lead to PBH dark matter with $i)$ asteroid, $ii)$ solar, or $iii)$
Planck mass, as well as $iv)$ PBHs that form the seeds of supermassive black
holes. We find that stochastic effects enhance the PBH abundance by a factor of
$\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, depending on the PBH mass. We also show
that the usual approximation, where stochastic kicks depend only on the Hubble
rate, either underestimates or overestimates the abundance by orders of
magnitude, depending on the potential. We evaluate the gauge dependence of the
results, discuss the quantum-to-classical transition, and highlight open issues
of the application of the stochastic formalism to USR inflation.

by the requirement of large amounts of training data. In order to cope with
limited training data for a target task, transfer learning for SAR modeling has
been recently adopted to leverage information from data of related tasks. In
this work, in contrast to the popular parameter-based transfer learning such as
pretraining, we develop novel deep transfer learning methods TAc and TAc-fc to
leverage source domain data and transfer useful information to the target
domain. TAc learns to generate effective molecular features that can generalize
well from one domain to another, and increase the classification performance in
the target domain. Additionally, TAc-fc extends TAc by incorporating novel
components to selectively learn feature-wise and compound-wise transferability.
We used the bioassay screening data from PubChem, and identified 120 pairs of
bioassays such that the active compounds in each pair are more similar to each
other compared to its inactive compounds. Our experiments clearly demonstrate
that TAc achieves significant improvement over all baselines across a large
number of target tasks. Furthermore, although TAc-fc achieves slightly worse
ROC-AUC on average compared to TAc, TAc-fc still achieves the best performance
on more tasks in terms of PR-AUC and F1 compared to other methods. In summary,
TAc-fc is also found to be a strong model with competitive or even better
performance than TAc on a notable number of target tasks.

that the gas becomes thermally unstable. Cloud formation, the expected outcome
of thermal instability (TI), will be suppressed in a dynamic flow, however, due
to the stretching of fluid elements that accompanies acceleration. It is
therefore unlikely that cloud formation occurs during the launching phase of a
supersonic outflow. In this paper, we show that the most favorable conditions
for dynamical TI in highly supersonic outflows are found at radii beyond the
acceleration zone, where the growth rate of entropy modes is set by the linear
theory rate for a static plasma. This finding implies that even mildly
relativistic outflows can become clumpy, and we explicitly demonstrate this
using hydrodynamical simulations of ultrafast outflows. We describe how the
continuity and heat equations can be used to appreciate another impediment
(beside mode disruption due to the stretching) to making an outflow clumpy:
background flow conditions may not allow the plasma to enter a TI zone in the
first place. The continuity equation reveals that both impediments are in fact
tightly coupled, yet one is easy to overcome. Namely, time variability in the
radiation field is found to be a robust means of placing gas in a TI zone. We
further show how the ratio of the dynamical and thermal timescales enters
linear theory; the heat equation reveals how this ratio depends on the two
processes that tend to remove gas from a TI zone -- adiabatic cooling and heat
advection.

practical multi-robot applications. In such multi-robot applications, the
user-defined objectives of the mission can be cast as a general optimization
problem, without explicit guidelines of the subtasks per different robot. Owing
to the unknown environment, unknown robot dynamics, sensor nonlinearities,
etc., the analytic form of the optimization cost function is not available a
priori. Therefore, standard gradient-descent-like algorithms are not applicable
to these problems. To tackle this, we introduce a new algorithm that carefully
designs each robot's subcost function, the optimization of which can accomplish
the overall team objective. Upon this transformation, we propose a distributed
methodology based on the cognitive-based adaptive optimization (CAO) algorithm,
that is able to approximate the evolution of each robot's cost function and to
adequately optimize its decision variables (robot actions). The latter can be
achieved by online learning only the problem-specific characteristics that
affect the accomplishment of mission objectives. The overall, low-complexity
algorithm can straightforwardly incorporate any kind of operational constraint,
is fault-tolerant, and can appropriately tackle time-varying cost functions. A
cornerstone of this approach is that it shares the same convergence
characteristics as those of block coordinate descent algorithms. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated in three heterogeneous simulation set-ups under multiple

makes this particular system of great interest to investigate stellar winds and

detected at various radio bands, and in addition the wind-collision region was
resolved by means of very-long baseline interferometric observations. We use a
non-thermal emission model for colliding-wind binaries to derive physical
properties of this system. The observed morphology in the resolved maps allows
us to estimate the system projection angle on the sky to be $\psi \approx
85^\circ$. The observed radio flux densities also allow us to characterise both
the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum of the source and its modifications due to
free--free absorption in the stellar winds at low frequencies; from this we
derive mass-loss rates of the stars of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WN} \approx
4\times10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WC} \approx
2.9\times10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, the broadband spectral
energy distribution is calculated for different combinations of the remaining
free parameters, namely the intensity of the magnetic field and the injected
power in non-thermal particles. We show that the degeneracy of these two

likely in the hard X-rays but also possibly in $\gamma$-rays under favourable

time-varying dynamics is not required to be continuous but allowed to have

there is nonlinear time-varying perturbation which may be persistent. We first
propose several mild regularity assumptions, under which the total variations
of the system matrix and its abscissa are well-defined over arbitrary time
interval. We then state our main result of the work, which requires the
combined assessment of the total variation of the system matrix, the measure
when the system is not sufficiently ""stable"" and the estimate of the
perturbation to be upper bounded by a function affine in time. When this
condition is met, we prove that the neighborhood of the origin, whose size
depends on the magnitude of the perturbation, is uniformly globally
exponentially stable for the system. We make several remarks, connecting our
results with the known stability theory from continuous linear time-varying
systems and switched systems. Finally, a numerical example is included to

public health informatics studies, biases present in the classifiers could
produce inadvertently misleading results.
  Objective: This study assesses the impact of bias on COVID-19 topics, and
demonstrates an automatic algorithm for reducing bias when applied to COVID-19
social media texts. This could help public health informatics studies produce
more timely results during crises, with a reduced risk of misleading results.
  Methods: Emotion and sentiment classifiers were applied to COVID-19 data
before and after debiasing the classifiers using unsupervised contrastive
clustering. Contrastive clustering approximates the degree to which tokens
exhibit a causal versus correlational relationship with emotion or sentiment,
by contrasting the tokens' relative salience to topics versus emotions or
sentiments.
  Results: Contrastive clustering distinguishes correlation from causation for
tokens with an F1 score of 0.753. Masking bias prone tokens from the classifier
input decreases the classifier's overall F1 score by 0.02 (anger) and 0.033
(negative sentiment), but improves the F1 score for sentences annotated as bias
prone by 0.155 (anger) and 0.103 (negative sentiment). Averaging across topics,
debiasing reduces anger estimates by 14.4% and negative sentiment estimates by
8.0%.
  Conclusions: Contrastive clustering reduces algorithmic bias in emotion and
sentiment classification for social media text pertaining to the COVID-19
pandemic. Public health informatics studies should account for bias, due to its
prevalence across a range of topics. Further research is needed to improve bias
reduction techniques and to explore the adverse impact of bias on public health
informatics analyses.

density anomaly in silica glasses - the negative thermal expansion coefficient
- is still poorly understood. Simulations based on molecular dynamics (MD)
produce atomically resolved structures, but quantifying the role of disorder in
the density anomaly is challenging. Here, we propose to use a a
graph-theoretical approach to assess topological differences between disordered
structural arrangements from MD trajectories of silica glasses. A graph
similarity metric quantifies the similarity between the covalent networks and
can characterize the nature of the disordered solid, by comparing to reference
crystalline solids, or with glasses in different thermodynamic states . This
approach involves casting all-atom glass configurations as networks, and
subsequently applying a graph-similarity metric (D-measure). Calculated
D-measure values are then taken as the topological distances between two
configurations. By measuring the topological distances of silica glass
configurations across a range of temperatures, distinct structural features
could be observed at temperatures higher than the fictive temperature. In
addition, we compared topological distances between local atomic environments
in the glass and crystalline silica phases. This approach suggests that more
coesite-like and quartz-like local structures emerge in silica glasses when the
density is at a minimum during the heating process.

Specifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the

Various studies have demonstrated that ML is highly suitable for optimizing
edge computing systems as rapid mobility and application-induced changes occur
at the edge. For ML to provide the best solutions, it is important to
continually train the ML models to include the changing scenarios. The sudden
changes in data distributions caused by changing scenarios (e.g., 5G base
station failures) is referred to as concept drift and is a major challenge to
continual learning. The ML models can present high error rates while the drifts
take place and the errors decrease only after the model learns the
distributions. This problem is more pronounced in a distributed setting where
multiple ML models are being used for different heterogeneous datasets and the
final model needs to capture all concept drifts. In this paper, we show that
using Attention in Federated Learning (FL) is an efficient way of handling
concept drifts. We use a 5G network traffic dataset to simulate concept drift
and test various scenarios. The results indicate that Attention can
significantly improve the concept drift handling capability of FL.

mean is only partially identifiable. This paper proposes two algorithms, a
gap-based algorithm and one based on the successive elimination, for best arm
identification in sub-Gaussian bandits. These algorithms involve mean estimates
that achieve the optimal error guarantee on the deviation of the true mean from
the estimate asymptotically. Furthermore, these algorithms asymptotically
achieve the optimal sample complexity. Specifically, for the gap-based

factors, while for the successive elimination-based algorithm, it is optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to

this is expected to strongly affect electronic correlation. In order to analyse

shown that a proposition and its negation cannot both be safe in protocol
states that have executions to some common state. This is in fact true for any
inconsistent propositions and the proof requires only intuitionistic reasoning.
This opens the door for work on consensus protocols in the internal language of
a topos. As a first pass on such a program, the main contribution of this paper
is the formulation of estimate safety in abstract correct-by-construction
protocols as a forcing statement in the internal logic of a given topos. This
is illustrated first in the setting of copresheaf toposes. It is also seen
there that safety can be viewed as a modal statement. For these
interpretations, some extensions and adaptations of results in the literature
on modal operators in toposes are presented. The final reformulation of
estimate safety is a completely elementary version in the language of an
arbitrary topos where it is seen that estimate safety is equivalent to a
certain forcing statement.

limited number of RF-chains to reduce power consumption, and the analog
combiner is designed only using the large-scale statistics of the channel to
reduce the system's complexity. We provide closed-form expressions for the

the minimum SINR of the users for uplink scenario. Through several simulations,

trade-off between the 95% outage data rate and the number of RF-chains, and the
impact of power optimization. We observe that the derived approximations
accurately follow the exact simulations and that in uplink scenario while using

the models learn the required transformations from data instead of relying on

fundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It
is well known that both of these can be solved making $\mathrm{poly}(N)$
queries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for
matroid intersection), where $N$ denotes the universe size. However, all known
polynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least $N$ rounds
of querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently
solved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with $\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries
using only poly-logarithmic rounds of adaptivity.
  An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient
parallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed
that any SFM algorithm making $\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries necessarily requires
$\Omega(\log N/\log \log N)$ rounds. This left open the possibility of
efficient SFM algorithms in poly-logarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection,
even the possibility of a constant round, $\mathrm{poly}(N)$ query algorithm
was not hitherto ruled out.
  In this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for
submodular function minimization or matroid intersection making
$\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(N^{1/3}\right)$ rounds
of adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of
rounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most $2^{N^{1-\delta}}$
queries, for any constant $\delta> 0$. Therefore, even though SFM and matroid
intersection are efficiently solvable, they are not highly parallelizable in
the oracle model.

astronomy and cosmology. However, the origin of FRBs is still unknown to date.
The studies on the intrinsic FRB distributions might help us to reveal the
possible origins of FRBs, and improve the simulations for FRB cosmology.
Recently, the first CHIME/FRB catalog of 536 events was released. Such a large
uniform sample of FRBs detected by a single telescope is very valuable to test
the FRB distributions. Later, it has been claimed that the FRB distribution
model tracking the cosmic star formation history (SFH) was rejected by the
first CHIME/FRB catalog. In the present work, we consider some empirical FRB
distribution models, and find that many of them can be fully consistent with
the CHIME/FRB observational data for some suitable model parameters. Notice
that a suppressed evolution with respect to SFH is commonly found for FRBs. In
particular, we independently confirm that the FRB distribution model tracking
SFH can be rejected at very high confidence. On the other hand, all the
``successful'' models effectively require a certain degree of ``delay'' with
respect to SFH. These results might shed light on the origin of FRBs and FRB
cosmology.

  For depth-$d$ Frege proofs of the Tseitin principle on the $n \times n$ grid

$\exp(n/2^{\Omega(d\sqrt{\log s})})$ many lines are necessary. This yields new
lower bounds on line complexity that are not implied by H{\aa}stad's recent

all $d = o(\sqrt{\log n})$, whereas H{\aa}stad's lower bound is
$\exp(n^{o(1)})$ once $d = \omega_n(1)$.

its unique advantages in high spectral resolution, fast detection, and so on.
Although the dual-comb technique is relatively mature in the infrared
wavelengths, it is, currently, not commercially capable of practical
applications in the terahertz regime due to the lack of high performance
broadband terahertz dual-comb sources. In the terahertz frequency range, the
electrically pumped quantum cascade laser (QCL) is a suitable candidate for the
dual-comb operation. However, free running terahertz QCL dual-comb sources
normally show limited optical bandwidths ($\sim$100-200 GHz). Although the
resonant microwave injection locking has been widely used to broaden the
emission spectra of terahertz QCLs by modulating the laser drive current at the
cavity round-trip frequency, it is hard to be employed to broaden the dual-comb
bandwidths due to the large phase noise induced by the resonant injection and
non-ideal microwave circuits. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain broadband
terahertz dual-comb sources that can fully exploits the laser gain bandwidth.
Here, we employ an off-resonant microwave injection to significantly broaden
the dual-comb bandwidth of a terahertz QCL dual-comb source emitting around 4.2
THz. The measured optical dual-comb bandwidth is broadened from 147 GHz in free
running to $>$450 GHz under the off-resonant injection. The broadened dual-comb
bandwidth is experimentally proved by the transmission measurements of a filter
and a GaAs etalon. By performing a simple numerical analysis based on a rate
equation model, we explain that the broadband dual-comb operation under the
off-resonant microwave injection could be resulted from a wider lasing
bandwidth and a higher degree of phase matching.

statistical correlation or dependence between voxels. Due to the large number
of voxels, rather than consider the voxel-to-voxel correlations between all
voxels, a small set of seed voxels are chosen. Consequently, the network
identification may depend on the selected seeds. As an alternative, we propose
to fit first-order linear models with sparse priors on the coefficients to
model activity across the entire set of cortical grey matter voxels as a linear
combination of a smaller subset of voxels. We propose a two-stage algorithm for
voxel subset selection that uses different sparsity-inducing regularization
approaches to identify subject-specific causally predictive voxels. To reveal
the functional networks among these voxels, we then apply independent component
analysis (ICA) to model these voxels' signals as a mixture of latent sources
each defining a functional network. Based on the inter-subject similarity of
the sources' spatial patterns we identify independent sources that are
well-matched across subjects but fail to match the independent sources from a
group-based ICA. These are resting state networks, common across subjects that
group ICA does not reveal. These complementary networks could help to better
identify neurodegeneration, a task left for future work.

network analysis, but the case of weighted networks remains a challenge. This
paper proposes a general Distribution-Free Model (DFM) for weighted networks in
which nodes are partitioned into different communities. DFM can be seen as a
generalization of the famous stochastic blockmodels from unweighted networks to
weighted networks. DFM does not require prior knowledge of a specific
distribution for elements of the adjacency matrix but only the expected value.
In particular, signed networks with latent community structures can be modeled
by DFM. We build a theoretical guarantee to show that a simple spectral
clustering algorithm stably yields consistent community detection under DFM. We
also propose a four-step data generation process to generate adjacency matrices
with missing edges by combining DFM, noise matrix, and a model for unweighted
networks. Using experiments with simulated and real datasets, we show that some
benchmark algorithms can successfully recover community membership for weighted
networks generated by the proposed data generation process.

control strategy to the flow past a cylinder confined between two walls in
order to suppress vortex shedding. The control action is blowing and suction of
two synthetic jets on the cylinder. The theme of this study is to investigate
how to use and embed physical information of the flow in the RL-based control.
First, global linear stability and sensitivity analyses based on the time-mean
flow and the steady flow (which is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations)
are conducted in a range of blockage ratios and Reynolds numbers. It is found
that the most sensitive region in the wake extends itself when either parameter
increases in the parameter range we investigated here. Then, we utilise these
physical results to help design RL-based control policies. We find that the
controlled wake converges to the unstable steady base flow, where the vortex
shedding can be successfully suppressed. A persistent oscillating control seems
necessary to maintain this unstable state. The RL algorithm is able to
outperform a gradient-based optimisation method (optimised in a certain period
of time) in the long run. Furthermore, when the flow stability information is
embedded in the reward function to penalise the instability, the controlled
flow may become more stable. Finally, according to the sensitivity analyses,
the control is most efficient when the probes are placed in the most sensitive
region. The control can be successful even when few probes are properly placed
in this manner.

major sub-modules: (i) The latent feature sub-space clustering/grouping
obtained through variational auto-encoders enabling rapid identification of the
correspondence and discrepancy between noisy and clean image patches. (ii) The
adaptive learned transformation is controlled by a soft actor-critic agent that
progressively filters and enhances the noisy patches using its closest feature
distance neighbors of clean patches. Artificial artifacts that may be
introduced in a patch-based ISP, are also removed through a reward-based

bivirus networks with generic system parameters, then convergence to an

to construct an infinite family of network structures for the other virus that
results in an infinite number of equilibria in which both viruses coexist.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the local
stability/instability of boundary equilibria, in which one virus is present and
the other is extinct. A sufficient condition for a boundary equilibrium to be
almost globally stable is presented. Then, we show how to use monotone systems
theory to generate conclusions on the ordering of stable and unstable

catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a
divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence

a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The
conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on
position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory
distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays
trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic
forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed
trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities.
A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five
tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks.
Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning

For this purpose, we apply the conjectured upper bound proposal related to the
equilibration scales ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) to the
Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) is defined
as the collision point between the diffusive hydrodynamic mode and the first
non-hydrodynamic mode, giving rise to the upper bound of the diffusion constant
$D$ at low temperature $T$ as $D = \omega_{\text{eq}}/k_{\text{eq}}^2$. We show
that the upper bound proposal also works for the charge diffusion and
($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$), at low $T$, is determined by $D$ and the
scaling dimension $\Delta(0)$ of an infra-red operator as $(\omega_{\text{eq}},
\, k_{\text{eq}}^2) \,=\, (2 \pi T \Delta(0) \,, \omega_{\text{eq}}/D)$, as for
other diffusion constants. However, for the charge diffusion, we find that the
collision occurs at real $k_{\text{eq}}$, while it is complex for other
diffusions. In order to examine the universality of the conjectured upper
bound, we also introduce a higher derivative coupling to the
Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. This coupling is particularly interesting since
it leads to the violation of the \textit{lower} bound of the charge diffusion
constant so the correction may also have effects on the \textit{upper} bound of
the charge diffusion. We find that the higher derivative coupling does not
affect the upper bound so that the conjectured upper bound would not be easily
violated.

coincidence of the inequality indices noted here is very similar to the ones
seen before for self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The observations here,

powerful tool for controlling COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Testing
an entire population, however, requires significant resources. Group testing
can enable large-scale screening, but dilution degrades its sensitivity,
reducing its effectiveness as an infection control measure. Analysis of this
tradeoff typically assumes pooled samples are independent. Building on recent
empirical results in the literature, we argue that this assumption
significantly underestimates group testing's true benefits. Indeed, placing
samples from a social group into the same pool correlates a pool's samples.
Hence, a positive pool likely contains multiple positive samples, increasing a
pooled test's sensitivity and also tending to reduce the number of pools
requiring follow-up testing. We prove that under a general correlation
structure, pooling correlated samples together (called correlated pooling)
achieves higher sensitivity and requires fewer tests per positive identified
compared to independently pooling the samples (called naive pooling) using the
same pool size within the classic two-stage Dorfman procedure. To the best of
our knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically characterize
correlation's effect on sensitivity and test usage under models of general
correlation structure and realistic test errors. Under a 1% starting
prevalence, simulation results estimate that correlated pooling requires 12.9%
fewer tests than naive pooling to achieve infection control. Thus, we argue
that correlation is an important consideration for policy-makers designing
infection control interventions: it makes screening more attractive for
infection control and it suggests that sample collection should maximize
correlation.

notably relative to expected frequency distribution of transport requests, and
expectations about time between request and arrival at hub. In such a context,
we introduce rigorous generic protocols that can be applied at each hub so as

discovered, although new observations from the TESS mission are improving this.
Stars with radiative envelopes have little mixing at their surface, and thus
their surface abundances provide a sensitive test case for a variety of
processes including potentially star-planet interactions. Atomic diffusion is
particularly important in these envelopes, producing chemically peculiar
objects such as Am and HgMn stars. Aims: An exoplanet candidate around the B6
star HD 235349 was identified by TESS. Here we determine the nature of this
transiting object and identify possible chemical peculiarities in the star.
Methods: HD 235349 was observed using the long-slit spectrograph at Tartu
Observatory, as well as photometrically by the TESS mission. The spectra were
modeled to determine stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The
photometric light curve was then analyzed in the context of the stellar
parameters to determine properties of the transiting object. Results: We find
the transiting object is a low-mass stellar companion, not a planet. However,
the primary of this eclipsing binary is a rare type of chemically peculiar
star. A strong overabundance of P is found with overabundances of Ne and Nd,
and mild overabundances of Ti and Mn, while He is mildly underabundant. There
is also clear evidence for vertical stratification of P in the atmosphere of
the star. The lack of Hg and weak Mn overabundance suggests that this is not a
typical HgMn star. It may be in the class of helium-weak phosphorus-gallium
(He-weak PGa) stars, or an intermediate between these two classes. Conclusions:
We show that HD 235349 is a rare type of chemically peculiar star (He-weak PGa)
in an eclipsing binary system with a low-mass stellar companion. This appears
to be the first He-weak PGa star discovered in an eclipsing binary.

torques in a Mn$_2$Au/heavy-metal bilayer, where the heavy metal (HM) is W or
Pt. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the bulk of Mn$_2$Au generates strong
fieldlike torquance, which is parallel on the two sublattices and scales
linearly with the conductivity, and a weaker dampinglike torquance that is
antiparallel on the two sublattices. Interfaces with W or Pt generate parallel
dampinglike torques of opposite signs that are similar in magnitude to those in
ferromagnetic bilayers and similarly insensitive to disorder. The dampinglike
torque efficiency depends strongly on the termination of the interface and on
the presence of spin-orbit coupling in Mn$_2$Au, suggesting that the
dampinglike torque is not due solely to the spin-Hall effect in the HM layer.
Interfaces also induce antiparallel fieldlike and dampinglike torques that can
penetrate deep into Mn$_2$Au.

ASPR with the existing technologies. The major difficulties lie in imperfect

subregions in an image to make a prediction. The majority of hard attention

initially but instead sensed gradually through a series of partial
observations. In this paper, we design an efficient hard attention model for
classifying such sequentially observed scenes. The presented model never
observes an image completely. To select informative regions under partial
observability, the model uses Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design. First, it
synthesizes the features of the unobserved regions based on the already
observed regions. Then, it uses the predicted features to estimate the expected
information gain (EIG) attained, should various regions be attended. Finally,
the model attends to the actual content on the location where the EIG mentioned
above is maximum. The model uses a) a recurrent feature aggregator to maintain
a recurrent state, b) a linear classifier to predict the class label, c) a
Partial variational autoencoder to predict the features of unobserved regions.
We use normalizing flows in Partial VAE to handle multi-modality in the
feature-synthesis problem. We train our model using a differentiable objective

Landau-Lifshitz equation with large damping parameters. This equation describes
the dynamics of magnetization, with a non-convexity constraint of unit length
of the magnetization. The numerical method is based on the second-order
backward differentiation formula in time, combined with an implicit treatment
of the linear diffusion term and explicit extrapolation for the nonlinear
terms. Afterward, a projection step is applied to normalize the numerical
solution at a point-wise level. This numerical scheme has shown extensive
advantages in the practical computations for the physical model with large
damping parameters, which comes from the fact that only a linear system with
constant coefficients (independent of both time and the updated magnetization)
needs to be solved at each time step, and has greatly improved the numerical
efficiency. Meanwhile, a theoretical analysis for this linear numerical scheme
has not been available. In this paper, we provide a rigorous error estimate of
the numerical scheme, in the discrete $\ell^{\infty}(0,T; \ell^2) \cap
\ell^2(0,T; H_h^1)$ norm, under suitable regularity assumptions and reasonable
ratio between the time step-size and the spatial mesh-size. In particular, the
projection operation is nonlinear, and a stability estimate for the projection
step turns out to be highly challenging. Such a stability estimate is derived
in details, which will play an essential role in the convergence analysis for
the numerical scheme, if the damping parameter is greater than 3.

decisions affecting our lives, ensuring that automated decision-making is fair
and ethical has become a top priority. Intuitively, we feel that akin to human
decisions, judgments of artificial agents should necessarily be grounded in
some moral principles. Yet a decision-maker (whether human or artificial) can
only make truly ethical (based on any ethical theory) and fair (according to
any notion of fairness) decisions if full information on all the relevant
factors on which the decision is based are available at the time of
decision-making. This raises two problems: (1) In settings, where we rely on AI
systems that are using classifiers obtained with supervised learning, some
induction/generalization is present and some relevant attributes may not be
present even during learning. (2) Modeling such decisions as games reveals that
any -- however ethical -- pure strategy is inevitably susceptible to
exploitation.
  Moreover, in many games, a Nash Equilibrium can only be obtained by using
mixed strategies, i.e., to achieve mathematically optimal outcomes, decisions
must be randomized. In this paper, we argue that in supervised learning
settings, there exist random classifiers that perform at least as well as
deterministic classifiers, and may hence be the optimal choice in many
circumstances. We support our theoretical results with an empirical study
indicating a positive societal attitude towards randomized artificial
decision-makers, and discuss some policy and implementation issues related to
the use of random classifiers that relate to and are relevant for current AI

improved fusion strategy is adopted by UHP-SOT++ for more robust tracking
performance against large-scale tracking datasets. Our second contribution lies

tracking accuracy. Since UHP-SOT++ has extremely small model size, high
tracking performance, and low computational complexity (operating at a rate of
20 FPS on an i5 CPU even without code optimization), it is an ideal solution in
real-time object tracking on resource-limited platforms. Based on the

the classical counterpart of the Husimi representation in a close analogy to
the Koopman-von Neumann theory, one can largely unify the formulations of
classical and quantum dynamics. We prove that the motions of elementary parcels
of both classical and quantum Husimi fluid obey the Hamilton variational

the differences between classical and quantum pure states. The Husimi action
functionals are not unique and defined up to the Skodje flux gauge fixing [R.

triggered an unprecedented global concern for potential social and ethical

the large homogeneity and presumed consensualism around these principles. While
it is true that some ethical doctrines, such as the famous Kantian deontology,
aspire to universalism, they are however not universal in practice. In fact,
ethical pluralism is more about differences in which relevant questions to ask
rather than different answers to a common question. When people abide by
different moral doctrines, they tend to disagree on the very approach to an
issue. Even when people from different cultures happen to agree on a set of
common principles, it does not necessarily mean that they share the same
understanding of these concepts and what they entail. In order to better
understand the philosophical roots and cultural context underlying ethical
principles in AI, we propose to analyse and compare the ethical principles
endorsed by the Chinese National New Generation Artificial Intelligence

European High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEGAI). China and the EU have very
different political systems and diverge in their cultural heritages. In our

describing the density of tissue, $\hat{u}(\hat{\mathbf{x}},\hat{t})$, that is
coupled to the concentration of an immobile extracellular substrate,
$\hat{s}(\hat{\mathbf{x}},\hat{t})$. Cell migration is modelled with a
nonlinear diffusion term, where the diffusive flux is proportional to
$\hat{s}$, while a logistic growth term models cell proliferation. The
extracellular substrate $\hat{s}$ is produced by cells, and undergoes linear
decay. Preliminary numerical simulations show that this mathematical model,
which we call the \textit{substrate model}, is able to recapitulate key
features of recent tissue growth experiments, including the formation of sharp
fronts. To provide a deeper understanding of the model we then analyse
travelling wave solutions of the substrate model, showing that the model
supports both sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions that move with a minimum
wave speed, $c = c_{\rm{min}}$, as well as smooth-fronted travelling wave
solutions that move with a faster travelling wave speed, $c > c_{\rm{min}}$. We
provide a geometric interpretation that explains the difference between smooth-

reduction of the desingularised three-dimensional phase space. In addition to
exploring the nature of the smooth- and sharp-fronted travelling waves, we also
develop and test a series of useful approximations that describe the shape of

second order quantum phase transition with a gap that closes polynomially in
the number of spins. We concentrate on the total and partial success

evanescent decay of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waves, which corresponds to
a high cut-off phenomenon and is typically utilized for identifying SPPs. At
terahertz (THz) frequencies, a metal line with periodic metallic grooves can
mimic the conventional optical SPPs, which is referred to as designer SPPs.
Theoretically, the plasma frequency of THz SPPs decreases as the groove depth
increases. Here, by replacing the metallic grooves with graphene sheets,
dynamically sweeping SPP plasma frequency is demonstrated for the first time.
The metal-graphene hybrid structure comprises a metal line with periodic
graphene grooves, a thin-layer ion gel for gating graphene, and metallic tips
for uniforming gate field. As the chemical potential changes, the average
conductivity of graphene is modulated so that the effective depth of the
graphene grooves changes, which sweeps the plasma frequency of THz SPPs
consequently. Both simulated and experimental data demonstrate a red shift of
plasma frequency from 195 to 180 GHz at a low bias from -0.5 to 0.5 V. The
proposed structure reveals a novel approach to control the on/off status of SPP

have been much harder to come by. In a significant improvement to the state of
art for this problem, Umans \cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \& Umans
\cite{Kedlaya11} gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field
of small characteristic and over all finite fields respectively, provided that
the number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ where the degree of the input
polynomial in every variable is less than $d$. They also stated the question of
designing fast algorithms for the large variable case (i.e. $n \notin
d^{o(1)}$) as an open problem. In this work, we show that there is a
deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over a field
$\F_{q}$ of characteristic $p$ which evaluates an $n$-variate polynomial of
degree less than $d$ in each variable on $N$ inputs in time $$\left((N +
d^n)^{1 + o(1)}\text{poly}(\log q, d, p, n)\right)$$ provided that $p$ is at
most $d^{o(1)}$, and $q$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$,
where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed. When the number of
variables is large (e.g. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$), this is the first {nearly
linear} time algorithm for this problem over any (large enough) field.Our
algorithm is based on elementary algebraic ideas and this algebraic structure
naturally leads to the applications to data structure upper bounds for
polynomial evaluation and to an upper bound on the rigidity of Vandermonde
matrices.

protoplanetary disks. Recent studies show gaps and rings in the dust
distribution of disks younger than 1 Myr, suggesting that planet formation may
start already at the Class I stage. To understand what chemistry planets will
inherit, it is crucial to characterize the chemistry of Class I sources and to
investigate how chemical complexity evolves from Class 0 protostars to
protoplanetary disks. The goal is twofold: to obtain a census of the molecular
complexity in a sample of four Class I protostars, and to compare it with the
chemical compositions of earlier and later phases of the Sun-like star
formation process. We performed IRAM-30m observations towards Class I objects
(L1489-IRS, B5-IRS1, L1455-IRS1, and L1551-IRS5). The column densities of the
detected species are derived assuming LTE or LVG. We detected 27 species:
C-chains, N-bearing, S-bearing, Si-bearing species, deuterated molecules, and
iCOMs. Different spectral profiles are observed: narrow lines towards all the
sources, broader lines towards L1551-IRS5, and line wings due to outflows.
Narrow c-C3H2 emission originates from the envelope. The iCOMs in L1551-IRS5
reveal the occurrence of hot corino chemistry, with CH3OH and CH3CN lines
originating from a compact and warm region. Finally, OCS and H2S seem to probe
the circumbinary disks in the L1455-IRS1 and L1551-IRS5 binary systems. The
deuteration in terms of elemental D/H in the molecular envelopes and hot corino
are derived. In addition, B5 IRS1, L1455-IRS1 and L1551-IRS5 show a low
excitation methanol line, suggesting an origin from an extended structure,
plausibly UV illuminated. The abundance ratios of iCOMs with respect CH3OH
measured towards the L1551-IRS5 hot corino and the deuteration in our sample
are comparable to that estimated at earlier stages, as well as to that found in
comets.

improves upon the conventional optimization formulations by utilizing the

be highly suitable for time-critical dense coexistence networks through two
optimization objectives, viz., network capacity and signal strength. NeFRO is
validated against four recent works on network optimization. NeFRO is
successfully able to reduce optimization convergence time by as much as 24%

collaboration that goes on behind the scenes in the professional pop
songwriting process. In this paper, we present a collaborative line-level lyric
generation system that utilizes transfer-learning via the T5 transformer model,
which, till date, has not been used to generate pop lyrics. By working and
communicating directly with professional songwriters, we develop a model that
is able to learn lyrical and stylistic tasks like rhyming, matching line beat
requirements, and ending lines with specific target words. Our approach
compares favorably to existing methods for multiple datasets and yields
positive results from our online studies and interviews with industry
songwriters.

distributed DNN training, if the underlying gradient distribution is available,
classical lossless compression approaches can be used to reduce the number of

suggested that gradient updates can be considered as independent random
variables, while Laplace approximation can be used to argue that gradient has a

this paper we argue that, for some networks of practical interest, the gradient

GenNorm modelling provides a more accurate prediction of the DNN gradient tail

enlarge the physiological variations caused by the change of facial blood

Multi-Scale Eulerian Magnified Spatial-Temporal map (MEMSTmap), which can

scalable dynamic graphs with assured efficiency. The architecture is assembled
with a few simple effective computational blocks that constitute randomized

decade, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to various

on discriminative models, represented by classifiers. Meanwhile, little
attention has been paid to the security and privacy risks of generative models,
such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we propose the
first set of training dataset property inference attacks against GANs.
Concretely, the adversary aims to infer the macro-level training dataset
property, i.e., the proportion of samples used to train a target GAN with
respect to a certain attribute. A successful property inference attack can
allow the adversary to gain extra knowledge of the target GAN's training
dataset, thereby directly violating the intellectual property of the target
model owner. Also, it can be used as a fairness auditor to check whether the
target GAN is trained with a biased dataset. Besides, property inference can
serve as a building block for other advanced attacks, such as membership
inference. We propose a general attack pipeline that can be tailored to two
attack scenarios, including the full black-box setting and partial black-box
setting. For the latter, we introduce a novel optimization framework to
increase the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments over four representative
GAN models on five property inference tasks show that our attacks achieve
strong performance. In addition, we show that our attacks can be used to
enhance the performance of membership inference against GANs.

ray transforms (MRT) for symmetric tensor fields, which we introduce for the
first time to study Calder\'on-type inverse problems. We construct suitable
complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions for the polyharmonic operators that
reduces the inverse problem to uniqueness results for a generalized MRT. The
uniqueness result and the inversion formula we prove for generalized MRT could
be of independent interest and we expect it to be applicable to other inverse
problems for higher order operators involving tensor perturbations.

(AFRSs) are vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is thus important to propose
effective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the
safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit
poor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a
novel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by
handling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The
proposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the
importance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and ""noise""
channels. Then, the propagation of ""noise"" channels is suppressed in the
feature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is
designed to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution
of live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more
disperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that
the proposed CFD-PAD can achieve a 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and
a 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0%
(TDR@FDR=1%). Also, the proposed method markedly outperforms the best
single-model-based methods in terms of ACE (2.53% vs. 4.56%) and
TDR@FDR=1%(93.83% vs. 73.32%), which demonstrates its effectiveness. Although
we have achieved a comparable result with the state-of-the-art
multiple-model-based methods, there still is an increase in TDR@FDR=1% from
91.19% to 93.83%. In addition, the proposed model is simpler, lighter and more
efficient and has achieved a 74.76% reduction in computation time compared with
the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based method. The source code is available

close to the critical temperature $T_c$ using our recently developed functional
renormalization group approach to quantum spin systems. In $d=3$ dimensions we
find that for small momenta $\boldsymbol{k}$ and frequencies $\omega$ the
dynamic structure factor assumes the scaling form $S(\boldsymbol{k},\omega) =
(\tau T G (\boldsymbol{k})/\pi)\Phi (k\xi, \omega\tau)$, where $ G
(\boldsymbol{k})$ is the static spin-spin correlation function, $\xi$ is the
correlation length, and the characteristic time-scale $\tau$ is proportional to
$\xi^{5/2}$. We explicitly calculate the dynamic scaling function $\Phi (x,y)$
and find satisfactory agreement with neutron scattering experiments probing the
critical spin dynamics in EuO and EuS. Precisely at the critical point where
$\xi = \infty$ our result for the dynamic structure factor can be written as $S
(\boldsymbol{k},\omega) = (\pi\omega_k)^{-1} T_c G (\boldsymbol{k}) \Psi_c
(\omega/\omega_k)$, where $\omega_k \propto k^{5/2}$. We find that
$\Psi_c(\nu)$ vanishes as $\nu^{-13/5}$ for large $\nu$, and as $\nu^{3/5}$ for
small $\nu$. While the large-frequency behavior of $\Psi_c (\nu)$ is consistent
with calculations based on mode-coupling theory and with perturbative
renormalization group calculations to second order in $\epsilon = 6-d$, our
result for small frequencies disagrees with previous calculations. We argue
that up until now neither experiments nor numerical simulations are
sufficiently accurate to determine the low-frequency behavior of $\Psi_c
(\nu)$. We also calculate the low-temperature behavior of $S (
\boldsymbol{k},\omega)$ in one- and two dimensional ferromagnets and find that
it satisfies dynamic scaling with exponent $z=2$ and exhibits a pseudogap for
small frequencies.

To study the role that shearing loads have in the aetiology of heel pressure
ulcers, an MR-compatible device for the application of shearing and normal

monitor deformations of soft tissues after loading in a non-invasive way.
Measuring applied forces in an MR-environment is challenging due to the
impossibility to use magnetic materials. In our device, forces are applied
through the compression of springs made in polylactide. Shearing and normal

indenting plate while acquiring MR images. The device materials did not
introduce any imaging artifact and allowed for high quality MR measurements
permitting to identify the deformation of the internal components of the heel.
The obtained subject-specific results are an original data set that can be used
in validations for Finite Element analysis and therefore contribute to a better

limited set of predefined caching profiles. Then, during the delivery phase, we
aim at achieving a combined caching and spatial multiplexing gain, comparable

resulting scheme imposes small subpacketization and beamforming overheads, is
robust under dynamic network conditions, and incurs small finite-SNR

the previous result significantly when $\varepsilon $ is small. Furthermore, we
show that this distance is tight in general, thus providing a complete
characterization of the distance of general expander codes.
  Next, we provide several efficient decoding algorithms, which vastly improve
previous results in terms of the fraction of errors corrected, whenever
$\varepsilon < \frac{1}{4}$. Finally, we also give a bound on the list-decoding
radius of general expander codes, which beats the classical Johnson bound in
certain situations (e.g., when the graph is almost regular and the code has a
high rate).
  Our techniques exploit novel combinatorial properties of bipartite expander
graphs. In particular, we establish a new size-expansion tradeoff, which may be
of independent interests.

$\mathbb{S}^2$, Bernand-Mantel, Muratov and Simon
\cite{bernand2021quantitative} recently establish a uniformly quantitative
stability estimate. Namely, for any map $u:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$ with
degree $\pm 1$, the discrepancy of its Dirichlet energy and $4\pi$ can linearly
control the $\dot H^1$-difference of $u$ from the set of degree $\pm 1$
harmonic maps. Whether a similar estimate holds for harmonic maps with higher
degree is unknown. In this paper, we prove that a similar quantitative
stability result for higher degree is true only in local sense. Namely, given a
harmonic map, a similar estimate holds if $u$ is already sufficiently near to
it (modulo M\""{o}bius transform) and the bound in general depends on the given
harmonic map. More importantly, we investigate an example of degree 2 case
thoroughly, which shows that it fails to have a uniformly quantitative estimate
like the degree $\pm 1$ case. This phenomenon show the striking difference of
degree $\pm1$ ones and higher degree ones. Finally, we also conjecture a new
uniformly quantitative stability estimate based on our computation.

method to obtain low-dimensional evolution equations amenable to analysis. The
variables in the evolution equations are mean counts of subgraph states and are
referred to as moments. Due to interaction between neighbours, each moment
equation is a function of higher-order moments, such that an infinite hierarchy
of equations arises. Hence, the derivation requires truncation at a given
order, and, an approximation of the highest-order moments in terms of
lower-order ones,known as a closure formula. Recent systematic approximations
have either restricted focus to closed moment equations for SIR epidemic
spreading or to unclosed moment equations for arbitrary dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a general procedure that automates both derivation and
closure of arbitrary order moment equations for dynamics with nearest-neighbour
interactions on undirected networks. Automation of the closure step was made
possible by our generalised closure scheme,which systematically decomposes the
largest subgraphs into their smaller components.We show that this decomposition
is exact if these components form a tree, there is independence at distances
beyond their graph diameter, and there is spatial homogeneity. Testing our
method for SIS epidemic spreading on lattices and random networks confirms that
biases are larger for networks with many short cycles in regimes with
long-range dependence. A Mathematica package that automates the moment closure
is available for download.

strongly differs from that in the bulk. In particular, within porous materials,
the presence of boundaries with complex shapes entangles the longitudinal and
transverse degrees of freedom inducing a coupling between the transport of the
suspension and the density inhomogeneities induced by the walls.
  Colloidal suspension confined within model porous media are characterized by
means of active microrheology where a net force is applied on a single colloid
(tracer particle) whose transport properties are then studied. The trajectories
provided by active microrheology are exploited to determine the local transport
coefficients. In order to asses the role of the colloid-colloid interactions we
compare the case of a tracer embedded in a colloidal suspension to the case of
a tracer suspended in an ideal bath.
  Our results show that the friction coefficient increases and the passage time
distribution widens upon increasing the corrugation of the channel. These
features are obtained for a tracer suspended in a (thermalized) colloidal bath

relevance of the confinement on the transport and show a mild dependence on the
colloidal/thermal bath. Finally, we rationalize our numerical results with

quantitatively reliable for mild external forces, hence providing a reliable

partially inconsistent information. Regarding normal forms, advances in
possibilistic reasoning are mostly focused on clausal form. Yet, the encoding
of real-world problems usually results in a non-clausal (NC) formula and
NC-to-clausal translators produce severe drawbacks that heavily limit the
practical performance of clausal reasoning. Thus, by computing formulas in its
original NC form, we propose several contributions showing that notable
advances are also possible in possibilistic non-clausal reasoning.
  {\em Firstly,} we define the class of {\em Possibilistic Horn Non-Clausal
Knowledge Bases,} or $\mathcal{\overline{H}}_\Sigma$, which subsumes the
classes: possibilistic Horn and propositional Horn-NC.
$\mathcal{\overline{H}}_\Sigma $ is shown to be a kind of NC analogous of the
standard Horn class.
  {\em Secondly}, we define {\em Possibilistic Non-Clausal Unit-Resolution,} or
$ \mathcal{UR}_\Sigma $, and prove that $ \mathcal{UR}_\Sigma $ correctly
computes the inconsistency degree of $\mathcal{\overline{H}}_\Sigma $members.
$\mathcal{UR}_\Sigma $ had not been proposed before and is formulated in a
clausal-like manner, which eases its understanding, formal proofs and future
extension towards non-clausal resolution.
  {\em Thirdly}, we prove that computing the inconsistency degree of
$\mathcal{\overline{H}}_\Sigma $ members takes polynomial time. Although there
already exist tractable classes in possibilistic logic, all of them are
clausal, and thus, $\mathcal{\overline{H}}_\Sigma $ turns out to be the first
characterized polynomial non-clausal class within possibilistic reasoning.

it could either be a remnant from the earlier Class II phase or of secondary
origin, driven by the destruction of icy planetesimals. The aim of this paper
was to elucidate the origin of the gas content in the debris discs via various
simple molecules that are often detected in the less-evolved Class II discs. We
present millimetre molecular line observations of nine circumstellar discs
around A-type stars: four CO-rich debris discs (HD 21997, HD 121617, HD 131488,
HD 131835) and five old Herbig Ae protoplanetary discs (HD 139614, HD 141569,
HD 142666, HD 145718, HD 100453). The sources were observed with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 5 and 6 with 1-2''
resolution. The Herbig Ae discs are detected in the CO isotopologues, CN, HCN,
HCO$^+$, C2H, and CS lines. In contrast, only CO isotopologues are detected in
the debris discs, showing a similar amount of CO to that found in the Herbig Ae
protoplanetary discs. Using chemical and radiative transfer modelling, we show
that the abundances of molecules other than CO in debris discs are expected to
be very low. We consider multiple sets of initial elemental abundances with
various degrees of H2 depletion. We find that the HCO+ lines should be the
second brightest after the CO lines and that their intensities strongly depend
on the overall CO/H$_2$ ratio of the gas. However, even in the ISM-like
scenario, the simulated HCO+ emission remains weak as required by our
non-detections.

mathematically sound theory for Adaptive Virtual Element Methods (AVEMs). Among
the realm of polygonal meshes, we restrict our analysis to triangular meshes
with hanging nodes in 2d -- the simplest meshes with a systematic refinement
procedure that preserves shape regularity and optimal complexity. A major
challenge in the a posteriori error analysis of AVEMs is the presence of the
stabilization term, which is of the same order as the residual-type error
estimator but prevents the equivalence of the latter with the energy error.
Under the assumption that any chain of recursively created hanging nodes has
uniformly bounded length, we show that the stabilization term can be made
arbitrarily small relative to the error estimator provided the stabilization
parameter of the scheme is sufficiently large. This quantitative estimate leads
to stabilization-free upper and lower a posteriori bounds for the energy error.
This novel and crucial property of VEMs hinges on the largest subspace of
continuous piecewise linear functions and the delicate interplay between its
coarser scales and the finer ones of the VEM space. An important consequence
for piecewise constant data is a contraction property between consecutive loops
of AVEMs, which we also prove. Our results apply to $H^1$-conforming (lowest
order) VEMs of any kind, including the classical and enhanced VEMs.

leading to a catastrophic runaway greenhouse transition. While some studies
have shown that the onset of the runaway greenhouse may be delayed due to an
overshoot of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) -- compared to the
Simpson-Nakajima threshold -- by radiatively inactive gases, there is still no
consensus on whether this is occurring and why. Here, we used a suite of 1D
radiative-convective models to study the runaway greenhouse transition, with
particular emphasis on taking into account the radical change in the amount of
water vapour (from trace gas to dominant gas). The aim of this work is twofold:
first, to determine the most important physical processes and parametrisations
affecting the OLR; and second, to propose reference OLR curves for N$_2$+H$_2$O
atmospheres. Through multiple sensitivity tests, we list and select the main
important physical processes and parametrisations that need to be accounted for
in 1D radiative-convective models to compute an accurate estimate of the OLR
for N$_2$+H$_2$O atmospheres. The reference OLR curve is computed with a 1D
model built according to the sensitivity tests. These tests also allow us to
interpret the diversity of results already published in the literature.
Moreover, we provide a correlated-k table able to reproduce line-by-line
calculations with high accuracy. We find that the transition between an
N$_2$-dominated atmosphere and an H$_2$O-dominated atmosphere induces an
overshoot of the OLR compared to the (pure H$_2$O) Simpson-Nakajima asymptotic
limit. This overshoot is first due to a transition between foreign and
self-broadening of the water absorption lines, and second to a transition
between dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates.

lead to essential enhancement of acousto-optic (AO) figure of merit for this

approaches unity near the optic axis and so additional elasto-optic (EO) tensor
components with relatively large values become involved into the effective EO
coefficient. We demonstrate on the example of lead germanate crystals,
Pb$_5$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$, that the increase in the efficiency of AO diffraction
manifests itself for all the types of isotropic and anisotropic interactions,
whenever the incident optical wave propagates close to the optic axis. We find
that, in the particular case of diffraction in the interaction plane XZ of
Pb$_5$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$ crystals, the maximal enhancement of the AO figure of
merit takes place under conditions of the types V and VI of isotropic
diffraction, with the AO figure of merit increasing from zero up to
13.3x10$^{-15}$ s$^3$/kg, and the type IX of anisotropic diffraction when the
AO figure of merit increases more than twice (from 12.5x10$^{-15}$ up to
26.5x10$^{-15}$ s$^3$/kg). The maximal AO efficiency in the XZ interaction
plane is reached at the types I and II of isotropic AO interactions. In these
cases the AO figure of merit increases from 6.8x10$^{-15}$ up to
37.9x10$^{-15}$ s$^3$/kg and from 31.1x10$^{-15}$ to 37.9x10$^{-15}$ s$^3$/kg,

fermions in a $p$-band diamond lattice at unit filling is first studied to
elucidate the essential role of orbital multipolar orderings in the evolution
of multifold degenerate band nodes. The free band structure around the
Brillouin zone center is described by two quadratic band nodes each with a
threefold degeneracy, which are spanned by the bonding and anti-bonding
$p$-orbital multiplets, respectively. Upon switching on interactions, the
triply degenerate band node is split into a pair of Weyl fermions with opposite
chirality due to the onset of orbital multipolar orderings. Further raising
interactions ultimately drives the system into an insulating phase with the
orbital quadrupolar ordering. Our study is then generalized to spin-$1/2$
fermions, which has direct relevance with solid-state materials. The system
develops full spin polarization through a ferromagnetic transition at tiny
interactions, leaving the remaining orbital sector activated. The ensuing
transitions take place in the orbital sector as a natural consequence,
qualitatively recovering the phase diagram of spinless fermions. Our findings
shed new light on the realization of emergent novel fermions with a prospect

used as a plug-in module with arbitrary deep feature extractors such as ResNet
and vision transformer for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. In

tractable distribution and obtains the likelihood to recognize anomalies in
inference phase. Extensive experimental results on the MVTec AD dataset show

accelerating the computation of graph applications (e.g., Social Networks,
Knowledge Graphs) on traditional computing architectures (CPU, GPU, or TPU).
But the exploration of large-scale sparse graph computing on
processing-in-memory (PIM) platforms (typically with memristive crossbars) is
still in its infancy. To implement the computation or storage of large-scale or
batch graphs on memristive crossbars, a natural assumption is that a
large-scale crossbar is demanded, but with low utilization. Some recent works
question this assumption, to avoid the waste of storage and computational
resource, the fixed-size or progressively scheduled ''block partition'' schemes
are proposed. However, these methods are coarse-grained or static, and are not
effectively sparsity-aware. This work proposes the dynamic sparsity-aware
mapping scheme generating method that models the problem with a sequential
decision-making model, and optimizes it by reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm (REINFORCE). Our generating model (LSTM, combined with the
dynamic-fill scheme) generates remarkable mapping performance on a small-scale
graph/matrix data (complete mapping costs 43% area of the original matrix) and
two large-scale matrix data (costing 22.5% area on qh882 and 17.1% area on
qh1484). Our method may be extended to sparse graph computing on other PIM
architectures, not limited to the memristive device-based platforms.

UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly
the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played

Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects
the football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone
network data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records are
enriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices.
Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activity
records, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phones
are omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobile
phone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, and
correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found.
We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and the
subscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, these
do not seem to affect the interest in football.

it satisfies a functional equation of step $1$ and the Euler-Maclaurin

establish a new CTV-to-PTV expansion which considers the closest and most
critical organ at risk (OAR). The second goal was to investigate the impact of
the planning target volume (PTV) margin size on the tumor control probability
(TCP) dependent on the geometrical setup uncertainties. The aim was to achieve
a smaller margin expansion close to the OAR while allowing a moderately larger
expansion in less critical areas further away from the OAR and most importantly
while maintaining the TCP. Methods and Materials: Imaging data of radiation
therapy (RT) plans from pet dogs which had undergone RT for brain tumor were
used to estimate the clinic specific rotational setup uncertainties. A
Monte-Carlo methodology used to quantify the implications of those
uncertainties on the TCP. A computational CTV-to-PTV expansion method based on
probability density was established. All required software modules were
developed and integrated into a software package which directly interacts with
the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. Results: The rotational setup
uncertainties were obtained from 44 dog patients. Their frequency distributions
were analysed, and the mean values and standard deviations were determined. To
investigate the impact on the TCP, several uniform and non-isotropic PTV
targets were created. Standardized RT plans with equal optimization constraints
were defined and automatically applied and calculated on these targets. The
resulting TCPs were then evaluated and compared. Conclusion: The non-isotropic
margins were found to result in larger TCPs with smaller margin excess volume.
Further we have presented an additional application of the newly established
CTV-to-PTV expansion method for radiation therapy of the spinal axis of human

well measured by different model functions with broad Balmer lines being
described by Gaussian or Lorentz functions, in the SDSS spectrum in 2007 and in
the KPNO spectrum in 1990. After considering variations of broad emission
lines, different model functions lead to different fluxes of narrow emission
lines, but the different narrow emission line flux ratios lead the SDSS
J1451+2709 to be classified as a HII galaxy in the BPT diagram. In order to
explain the unique properties of the mis-classified quasar SDSS J1451+2709 in
the BPT diagram, two methods are proposed, the starforming contributions and
compressed NLRs with high electron densities near to critical densities of
forbidden emission lines. Unfortunately, the two methods cannot be preferred in
the SDSS J1451+2709, further efforts are necessary to find the physical origin
of the unique properties of the mis-classified quasar SDSS J1451+2709 in the

of SDSS J1451+2709 from the normal quasars. The mis-classified quasar SDSS
J1451+2709, an extremely unique case or a special case among the normal
quasars, could provide further clues on the applications of BPT diagrams to the
normal broad line AGN and to narrow emission line objects, indicating part of
narrow emission line HII galaxies actually harbouring central AGN activities.

non-zero x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) signal, despite that the
total spin moment amounts to zero. This is explained by a hitherto unnoticed
rule for the rotational symmetry invariance of the XMCD signal. A necessary
condition is the existence of an anisotropic XMCD signal for the local magnetic
atom, which can arise from a spin anisotropy either in the ground state or the
final state. The angular dependence of the XMCD as a function of the beam
direction has an unusual behavior. The maximum dichroism is not aligned along
the spin direction, but depends on the relative orientation of the spin with
respect to the atomic orientation. Therefore, different geometries can result
in the same angular dependence, and the spin direction can only be determined
if the atomic orientation is known. The consequences for the x-ray
magneto-optical sum rules are given. The integrated XMCD signals are
proportional to the anisotropy in the orbital moment and the magnetic dipole
term, where the isotropic spin moment drops out.

parent finite element model. Contact is modeled using set-valued laws and time
stepping is carried out with a semi-explicit scheme. We assess the method's
computational performance by a series of benchmarks, including both
frictionless and frictional contact. The results indicate that the proposed
method achieves excellent energy conservation properties and superior
convergence behavior. It reduces the spurious oscillations and decreases the
computational effort by about 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current

of few-layer silicene nanosheets, namely bilayers and trilayers, functionalized
with group-III or group-V atoms of the periodic table. We considered the
Si$_2$X$_2$ bilayers and the Si$_2$X$_4$ trilayers, X = B, N, Al, P. We
computed the structural, energetic, dynamic, elastic, and electronic properties
of those systems in several stacking configurations, labeled as AA$'$, AB,
AA$'$A$''$, and ABC. The results revealed that AA$'$-Si$_2$N$_2$,
AB-Si$_2$N$_2$, AA$'$-Si$_2$P$_2$, AB-Si$_2$P$_2$, ABC-Si$_4$B$_2$,
ABC-Si$_4$Al$_2$, AA$'$A$''$-Si$_4$P$_2$, and ABC-Si$_4$P$_2$ nanosheets are
all dynamically stable, according to their respective phonon dispersion
spectra. Additionally, by comparing the standard enthalpies of formation of
doped few-layer silicene systems with the ones of the pristine silicene
monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer nanosheets, we found that those structures
could be experimentally accessed. Exploring the electronic properties of those
stable systems, we discovered that the silicene bilayers and trilayers
functionalized with N or P atoms change from a metallic to a semiconducting
behavior. However, the metallic behavior is kept when the nanosheets are
functionalized with B or Al atoms. Finally, by placing our results within the

using reinforcement learning (RL), where the safety certificate can provide
provable safety guarantee. A valid safety certificate is an energy function
indicating that safe states are with low energy, and there exists a
corresponding safe control policy that allows the energy function to always
dissipate. The safety certificate and the safe control policy are closely
related to each other and both challenging to synthesize. Therefore, existing
learning-based studies treat either of them as prior knowledge to learn the
other, which limits their applicability with general unknown dynamics. This
paper proposes a novel approach that simultaneously synthesizes the
energy-function-based safety certificate and learns the safe control policy
with CRL. We do not rely on prior knowledge about either an available
model-based controller or a perfect safety certificate. In particular, we
formulate a loss function to optimize the safety certificate parameters by
minimizing the occurrence of energy increases. By adding this optimization
procedure as an outer loop to the Lagrangian-based constrained reinforcement
learning (CRL), we jointly update the policy and safety certificate parameters
and prove that they will converge to their respective local optima, the optimal
safe policy and a valid safety certificate. We evaluate our algorithms on
multiple safety-critical benchmark environments. The results show that the
proposed algorithm learns provably safe policies with no constraint violation.
The validity or feasibility of synthesized safety certificate is also verified
numerically.

Translation service providers (TSPs) have to deliver large volumes of

While automatic machine translation evaluation (MTE) metrics and quality

counterparts. Finally, by using the T-duality rules proposed by Kaloper and
Meissner (KM) we calculate the Abelian T-duals of BTZ black hole up to two-loop
by dualizing on the coordinates $ \varphi$ and $ t $. When the dualizing is
implemented by the shift of direction $\varphi$, we show that the horizons and
singularity of the dual spacetime are the same as in charged black string
derived by Horne and Horowitz without $\alpha'$-corrections, whereas in
dualizing on the coordinate $t$ we find a new three-dimensional black string
whose structure and asymptotic nature are clearly determined. For this case, we
show that the T-duality transformation changes the asymptotic behavior from
$AdS_3$ to flat.

believed to be a powerful tool to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation.
However, for singlet-triplet qubits in semiconductor quantum dot, the low Rabi
frequency of the microwave control leads to overly long gating time, and thus
the constructing geometric gate suffers more from the decoherence effect. Here
we investigate the key issue of whether the fast geometric gate can be realized
for singlet-triplet qubits without introducing an extra microwave-driven pulse,
while maintaining the high-fidelity gate operation at the same time. We
surprisingly find that both the single- and two-qubit geometric gates can be
implemented via only modulating the time-dependent exchange interaction of the
Hamiltonian, which can typically be on the order of $\sim$GHz, and thus the
corresponding gate time is of several nanoseconds. Furthermore, the obtained
geometric gates are superior to their counterparts, i.e., the conventional
dynamical gates for singlet-triplet qubits, with a relatively high fidelity
surpassing $99\%$. Therefore our scheme is particularly applied to
singlet-triplet qubits to obtain fast and high-fidelity geometric gates. Our
scheme can also be extended to other systems without a microwave drive.

lower the EM losses, resulting in lower EM temperatures. Finally, our results

and its evolution from room temperature (RT) to 1073 K is considered. Five
samples were exposed to 20 MeV self-ions at RT to achieve damage levels ranging
from 3.2 x 10-4 to 3.2 displacements per atom (dpa). Transient grating
spectroscopy with insitu heating was then used to study thermal diffusivity
evolution as a function of temperature. Using a kinetic theory model, an
equivalent point defect density is estimated from the measured thermal
diffusivity. The results showed a prominent recovery of thermal diffusivity
between 450 K and 650 K, which coincides with the onset of mono-vacancy
mobility. After 1073 K annealing samples with initial damage of 3.2 x 10-3 dpa
or less recover close to the pristine value of thermal diffusivity. For doses
of 3.2 x 10-2 dpa or higher, on the other hand, a residual reduction in thermal
diffusivity remains even after 1073 K annealing. Transmission electron
microscopy reveals that this is associated with extended, irradiation-induced
dislocation structures that are retained after annealing. A sensitivity
analysis shows that thermal diffusivity provides an efficient tool for
assessing total defect content in tungsten up to 1000 K.

suitable stopping criteria for CHMP to be integrated into Frank-Wolfe type and
Projected Gradient, specializing these methods to the membership decision

  Architecture Search","12 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Different from other deep scalable architecture-based NAS approaches, Broad
Neural Architecture Search (BNAS) proposes a broad scalable architecture which
consists of convolution and enhancement blocks, dubbed Broad Convolutional
Neural Network (BCNN), as the search space for amazing efficiency improvement.
BCNN reuses the topologies of cells in the convolution block so that BNAS can
employ few cells for efficient search. Moreover, multi-scale feature fusion and
knowledge embedding are proposed to improve the performance of BCNN with
shallow topology. However, BNAS suffers some drawbacks: 1) insufficient
representation diversity for feature fusion and enhancement and 2) time
consumption of knowledge embedding design by human experts. This paper proposes
Stacked BNAS, whose search space is a developed broad scalable architecture
named Stacked BCNN, with better performance than BNAS. On the one hand, Stacked
BCNN treats mini BCNN as a basic block to preserve comprehensive representation
and deliver powerful feature extraction ability. For multi-scale feature
enhancement, each mini BCNN feeds the outputs of deep and broad cells to the
enhancement cell. For multi-scale feature fusion, each mini BCNN feeds the
outputs of deep, broad and enhancement cells to the output node. On the other
hand, Knowledge Embedding Search (KES) is proposed to learn appropriate
knowledge embeddings in a differentiable way. Moreover, the basic unit of KES
is an over-parameterized knowledge embedding module that consists of all
possible candidate knowledge embeddings. Experimental results show that 1)
Stacked BNAS obtains better performance than BNAS-v2 on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet, 2) the proposed KES algorithm contributes to reducing the parameters
of the learned architecture with satisfactory performance, and 3) Stacked BNAS
delivers a state-of-the-art efficiency of 0.02 GPU days.

challenging, perplexing and surprising researchers for over half a century. In
the theoretically predicted topological Kondo insulator SmB6, the nature of the
bulk electronic structure is not characterised unambiguously by quantum
oscillations due to contrary interpretations. One simple definition of an
electrical insulator is a material that lacks a Fermi surface and here we
report the results of our investigation into its existence in SmB6 by Compton
scattering. Compton scattering measures occupied electron momentum states, is
bulk sensitive due to the high energy of the incoming photons and is also an
ultra-fast probe of the correlated many-body electron wavefunction. Remarkably,
direct evidence for a three-dimensional remnant Fermi surface is observed.
However, a further dichotomy is raised in that the full occupancy expected of a
conventional metal is not reproduced. Our observation of a remnant Fermi
surface using a momentum-resolved probe provides significant new evidence that
the paradigm of a bulk insulator is not robust for SmB6.

vector is aligned with both the inner accretion axis and the projected
direction of the kpc-scale relativistic jet, the position of the ESE hotspot is
inconsistent with the axisymmetric accretion flow. Recent polarimetric EHT
images of M87* show that the ESE hotspot is essentially unpolarized, which
strongly supports its distinct origin. If the hotspot emission is due to the
synchrotron radiation, its depolarization requires either isotropically tangled
magnetic fields or an additional Faraday dispersion measure. The 6-day EHT
observing campaign in April 2017 allowed in principle to detect orbital motions
advancing by up to ~60 deg. The apparent rotation rate of the major axis of the

Faraday-corrected polarization angle measured by the ALMA. However, the
counterclockwise (CCW) sense of these rotations is opposite to the clockwise

of modeling sequences of related tasks. Learning and then composing modules to
solve different tasks provides an abstraction to address the principal
challenges of CL including catastrophic forgetting, backward and forward
transfer across tasks, and sub-linear model growth. We introduce local module
composition (LMC), an approach to modular CL where each module is provided a
local structural component that estimates a module's relevance to the input.
Dynamic module composition is performed layer-wise based on local relevance
scores. We demonstrate that agnosticity to task identities (IDs) arises from
(local) structural learning that is module-specific as opposed to the task-
and/or model-specific as in previous works, making LMC applicable to more CL
settings compared to previous works. In addition, LMC also tracks statistics
about the input distribution and adds new modules when outlier samples are
detected. In the first set of experiments, LMC performs favorably compared to
existing methods on the recent Continual Transfer-learning Benchmark without
requiring task identities. In another study, we show that the locality of
structural learning allows LMC to interpolate to related but unseen tasks
(OOD), as well as to compose modular networks trained independently on
different task sequences into a third modular network without any fine-tuning.
Finally, in search for limitations of LMC we study it on more challenging
sequences of 30 and 100 tasks, demonstrating that local module selection
becomes much more challenging in presence of a large number of candidate
modules. In this setting best performing LMC spawns much fewer modules compared
to an oracle based baseline, however, it reaches a lower overall accuracy. The

due to their ability to leverage all data to learn a posterior and
simultaneously certify its risk with a tight numerical certificate. In this
paper, we assess the progress towards self-certification in probabilistic
neural networks learnt by PAC-Bayes inspired objectives. We empirically compare
(on 4 classification datasets) classical test set bounds for deterministic
predictors and a PAC-Bayes bound for randomised self-certified predictors. We
first show that both of these generalisation bounds are not too far from
out-of-sample test set errors. We then show that in data starvation regimes,
holding out data for the test set bounds adversely affects generalisation
performance, while self-certified strategies based on PAC-Bayes bounds do not
suffer from this drawback, proving that they might be a suitable choice for the
small data regime. We also find that probabilistic neural networks learnt by

  Elements",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software Fault Localization refers to the activity of finding code elements
(e.g., statements) that are related to a software failure. The state-of-the-art
fault localization techniques, however, produce coarse-grained results that can
deter manual debugging or mislead automated repair tools. In this work, we
focus specifically on the fine-grained identification of code elements (i.e.,
tokens) that must be changed to fix a buggy program: we refer to it as fix
localization. This paper introduces a neural network architecture (named Beep)
that builds on AST paths to predict the buggy code element as well as the
change action that must be applied to repair a program. Leveraging massive data
of bugs and patches within the CoCoNut dataset, we trained a model that was (1)
effective in localizing the buggy tokens with the Mean First Rank significantly
higher than a statistics based baseline and a machine learning-based baseline,
and (2) effective in predicting the repair operators (with the associated buggy
code elements) with a Recall@1= 30-45% and the Mean First Rank=7-12 (evaluated
by CoCoNut, ManySStuBs4J, and Defects4J datasets). To showcase how fine-grained
fix localization can help program repair, we employ it in two repair pipelines
where we use either a code completion engine to predict the correct token or a
set of heuristics to search for the suitable donor code. A key strength of
accurate fix localization for program repair is that it reduces the chance of
patch overfitting, a challenge in generate-and-validate automated program
repair: both two repair pipelines achieve a correctness ratio of 100%, i.e.,
all generated patches are found to be correct. Moreover, accurate fix
localization helps enhance the efficiency of program repair.

for the quest for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) primordial $B$-modes.
The incomplete modelling of its potentially complex spectral properties could
lead to biases in the CMB polarization analyses and to a spurious detection of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. It is crucial for future surveys like the
$LiteBIRD$ satellite, which aims at constraining the primordial signal leftover
by Inflation with an accuracy on $r$ of the order 1e-3. Variations of the dust
properties along and between lines of sight lead to distortions of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) that can not be easily anticipated by standard
component separation methods. This issue can be tackled with a moment expansion
of the dust SED, an innovative parametrization method imposing minimal
assumptions on the sky complexity. In this paper, we apply this formalism to
the $B$-mode cross-angular power spectra computed from simulated $LiteBIRD$
polarization data at frequencies between 100 and 402 GHz, containing CMB, dust
and instrumental noise. The spatial variation of the dust spectral parameters
(spectral index $\beta$ and temperature $T$) in our simulations, lead to
significant biases on $r$ if not properly taken into account. Performing the
moment expansion in $\beta$, reduces the bias but do not lead to reliable
enough estimates of $r$. We introduce for the first time the expansion of the
cross-angular power spectra SED in $\beta$ and $T$, showing that, at the
$LiteBIRD$ sensitivity, it is required to take into account the SED complexity
due to temperature variations to prevent analysis biases on $r$. Thanks to this
expansion and despite the existing correlations between some of the dust
moments and the CMB signal, responsible for a rise of the error on $r$, we can
measure an unbiased value of $r$ with an uncertainty of $\sigma(r)$=8.8e-4.

shale (smectite/illite transformation here) as a function of depth is described
by a 5th-order kinetic equation, based on an Arrhenius reaction rate. On the

the volume of precipitated quartz cement and the resulting porosity loss from
the temperature history, using an equation relating the precipitation rate to
temperature. Effective pressure effects (additional compaction) are accounted
for by using Athy equation and the Hertz-Mindlin model. The petro-elastic

introduce methods for answering nearest neighbor and range queries regarding

build on the filter-verification paradigm, where lower and upper bounds are
used to reduce the number of exact computations of the graph edit distance.
Highly effective bounds for this involve solving a linear assignment problem
for each graph in the database, which is prohibitive in massive datasets.
Index-based approaches typically provide only weak bounds leading to high
computational costs verification. In this work, we derive novel lower bounds
for efficient filtering from restricted assignment problems, where the cost
function is a tree metric. This special case allows embedding the costs of
optimal assignments isometrically into $\ell_1$ space, rendering efficient
indexing possible. We propose several lower bounds of the graph edit distance
obtained from tree metrics reflecting the edit costs, which are combined for
effective filtering. Our method termed EmbAssi can be integrated into existing
filter-verification pipelines as a fast and effective pre-filtering step.
Empirically we show that for many real-world graphs our lower bounds are
already close to the exact graph edit distance, while our index construction

pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus cause millions of infections each year
with a substantial health burden. Control of multi-strain pathogens can be
complicated by the high strain diversity often observed in endemic settings. It
is not well understood how high strain diversity is maintained in populations,
given that they compete with each other both directly (within an individual
host) and indirectly (via host immunity). Previous modelling studies have
investigated how indirect competition affects the prevalence and diversity of
strains. However, these studies often make simplifying assumptions about the
direct competition that occurs within hosts. Currently, little data is
available to validate these assumptions, hence there is a need to clarify how
sensitive model outputs are to these assumptions. In this study, we compare the
dynamics of multi-strain pathogens under different assumptions about direct
competition between strains using an agent-based model. We find that the
assumptions made about direct competition can affect the epidemiological
dynamics, particularly when there is no long-term immunity following infections
and a low rate of importation of non-circulating strains. Our results suggest
that while direct and indirect competition can each decrease strain diversity
when they act in isolation, they may increase strain diversity when they act
together. This finding highlights the importance of examining sensitivity to
assumptions about strain competition. In particular, omitting consideration of
direct competition can lead to inaccurate estimates of the likely effectiveness
of control strategies as changes in strain diversity shift the level of direct
strain competition.

the microscopic structure of two-dimensional (2D) anti-de Sitter (AdS$_2$)
dilatonic black holes. We first extend previous results on the QNMs spectrum,
found for external massless scalar perturbations, to the case of massive scalar
perturbations. We find that the quasi-normal frequencies are purely imaginary
and scale linearly with the overtone number. Motivated by this and extending
previous results regarding Schwarzschild black holes, we propose a microscopic
description of the 2D black hole in terms of a coherent state of $N$ massless
particles quantized on a circle, with occupation numbers sharply peaked on the
characteristic QNMs frequency $\hat \omega$. We further model the black hole as
a statistical ensemble of $N$ decoupled quantum oscillators of frequency
$\hat\omega$. This allows us to recover the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy $S$
of the hole as the leading contribution to the Gibbs entropy for the set of
oscillators, in the high-temperature regime, and to show that $S=N$.
Additionally, we find sub-leading logarithmic corrections to the BH entropy. We
further corroborate this microscopic description by outlining a holographic
correspondence between QNMs in the AdS$_2$ bulk and the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan
conformally invariant quantum mechanics. Our results strongly suggest that
modelling a black hole as a coherent state of particles and as a statistical
ensemble of decoupled harmonic oscillators is always a good approximation in
the large black-hole mass, large overtone number limit.

arbitrary nodes, which is one of the most important functions in quantum
networks. The existing routing mechanisms mainly improve the robustness and
throughput facing the failure of entanglement generations, which, however,
rarely include the considerations on the most important metric to evaluate the
quality of connection, entanglement fidelity. To solve this problem, we propose
purification-enabled entanglement routing designs to provide fidelity guarantee
for multiple Source-Destination (SD) pairs in quantum networks. In our
proposal, we first consider the single S-D pair scenario and design an
iterative routing algorithm, Q-PATH, to find the optimal purification decisions
along the routing path with minimum entangled pair cost. Further, a
low-complexity routing algorithm using an extended Dijkstra algorithm, Q-LEAP,
is designed to reduce the computational complexity by using a simple but
effective purification decision method. Then we consider the common scenario
with multiple S-D pairs and design a greedy-based algorithm considering
resource allocation and rerouting process for multiple routing requests. To
verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms, extensive
simulations are conducted, and the simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms not only can provide fidelity-guarantee routing solutions, but also
has superior performance in terms of throughput, fidelity of end-to-end
entanglement connection, and resource utilization ratio, compared with the
existing routing scheme.

This gives reason to believe that 3D extensions of such convolutions should

However, this aspect has not yet been explored thoroughly in existing

a novel type of convolution which draws inspiration from dilated and deformable

attention recently in reinforcement learning. A wide range of methods have been
proposed to enable efficient learning, leading to sample complexities similar
to those in the full state setting. However, moving beyond carefully curated
pixel data sets (centered crop, appropriate lighting, clear background, etc.)
remains challenging. In this paper, we adopt a more difficult setting,
incorporating background distractors, as a first step towards addressing this
challenge. We present a simple baseline approach that can learn meaningful
representations with no metric-based learning, no data augmentations, no
world-model learning, and no contrastive learning. We then analyze when and why
previously proposed methods are likely to fail or reduce to the same
performance as the baseline in this harder setting and why we should think
carefully about extending such methods beyond the well curated environments.
Our results show that finer categorization of benchmarks on the basis of
characteristics like density of reward, planning horizon of the problem,
presence of task-irrelevant components, etc., is crucial in evaluating
algorithms. Based on these observations, we propose different metrics to
consider when evaluating an algorithm on benchmark tasks. We hope such a

When success is measured as payoff in a game played against another learner,
mutual selfishness typically fails to produce the optimal outcome for a pair of
individuals. However, learners often operate in populations, and each learner
may have a limited duration of interaction with any other individual. Here, we
compare selfish learning in stable pairs to selfish learning with stochastic
encounters in a population. We study gradient-based optimization in repeated
games like the prisoner's dilemma, which feature multiple Nash equilibria, many
of which are suboptimal. We find that myopic, selfish learning, when
distributed in a population via ephemeral encounters, can reverse the dynamics
that occur in stable pairs. In particular, when there is flexibility in partner
choice, selfish learning in large populations can produce optimal payoffs in
repeated social dilemmas. This result holds for the entire population, not just
for a small subset of individuals. Furthermore, as the population size grows,
the timescale to reach the optimal population payoff remains finite in the
number of learning steps per individual. While it is not universally true that
interacting with many partners in a population improves outcomes, this form of
collective learning achieves optimality for several important classes of social
dilemmas. We conclude that na\""{i}ve learning can be surprisingly effective in
populations of individuals navigating conflicts of interest.

second-order electrical response for zero magnetic field, which creates a
dc-current that can be either longitudinal or transverse to electric field.
Consequently, the continuity equation for the chiral current is not conserved
at order $\tau^{-1}$, where $\tau$ is the quasiparticle relaxation time. We can
identify the anomaly as a mixed axial-gravitational one, and predict a material

that quasiparticles necessarily move in an emergent curved spacetime, even in a
homogeneous and defectless lattice. We underscore these concepts using recent
results on the second order electrical conductivity, elucidating the associated

\emph{seller-offering} mechanism, in which the seller offers the buyer a
take-it-or-leave-it price that maximizes the expected profit of the seller, and
with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ run the \emph{buyer-offering} mechanism. Very

mechanism, which is known to be at least half of the gains-from-trade of the
second-best mechanism, is also at least half of the gains-from-trade of the

transportation planning and engineering must innovate to expand the street
network strategically in order to ensure efficiency but also to deter sprawl.
Here, we conducted a study of over 200 cities around the world to understand
the impact that the patterns of deceleration points in streets due to traffic
signs has in trajectories done from motorized vehicles. We demonstrate that
there is a ubiquitous nonlinear relationship between time and distance in the
optimal trajectories within each city. More precisely, given a specific period
of time $\tau$, without any traffic, one can move on average up to the distance
$\left \langle D \right \rangle \sim\tau^\beta$. We found a super-linear
relationship for almost all cities in which $\beta>1.0$. This points to an
efficiency of scale when traveling large distances, meaning the average speed
will be higher for longer trips when compared to shorter trips. We demonstrate
that this efficiency is a consequence of the spatial distribution of large
segments of streets without deceleration points, favoring access to routes in
which a vehicle can cross large distances without stops. These findings show
that cities must consider how their street morphology can affect travel speed.

are expected to deliver a new transportation experience, increasing the safety
and efficiency of road networks. The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies
guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth (> 1GHz) and a high data rate (>
10Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is
impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily
blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being
investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional
relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instantaneous information,
which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks,
such as vehicular scenarios. In this context, we propose a novel proactive
relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment
information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links'
evolution in time. The proactive relaying schemes exploit the dynamic LoS-map
to maximize the network connectivity. A novel framework integrating realistic
mobility patterns and geometric channel propagation models is proposed to
analyze the performance in different scenarios. Numerical simulations suggest
that the proactive relaying schemes mitigate beam blockage and maximize the

decreasing density of states or a minimum coupling requirement, though they
might still be consistent with the results described. We do so by defining an
appropriate Helmholtz free energy which when extremized relative to a key

the Hubble radius (an exponent 'r' used in the text). We deduce that the CKN

considered to make the final predictions. On the second place, some unique

characteristic of our model is that it extracts fashion attributes and
integrates them with the image vision information for effective representation.
Furthermore, it exploits the mutual relationship between the fashion attributes

criterion in the context of gravitational path integrals, in simple
minisuperspace models, specifically considering de Sitter (dS), no-boundary and
Anti-de Sitter (AdS) examples. These simple examples allow us to gain some
understanding of the off-shell structure of gravitational path integrals. In
all cases, we find that the saddle points of the integral lie right at the edge
of the allowable domain of metrics, even when the saddle points are complex or
Euclidean. Moreover the Lefschetz thimbles, in particular the steepest descent
contours for the lapse integral, are cut off as they intrude into the domain of
non-allowable metrics. In the AdS case, the implied restriction on the
integration contour is found to have a simple physical interpretation. In the
dS case, the lapse integral is forced to become asymptotically Euclidean. We
also point out that the K-S criterion provides a reason, in the context of the
no-boundary proposal, for why scalar fields would start their evolution at
local extrema of their potential.

insights in network analysis. Symmetries identify clusters of robust
synchronization in the network which improves the understanding of the
functionality of complex biological systems. Network symmetries can be
determined by finding a {\it balanced coloring} of the graph, which is a node
partition in which each cluster of nodes receives the same information (color)
from the rest of the graph. In recent work we saw that biological networks such
as gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks and neural networks in
organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and humans are rich in fibration
symmetries related to the graph balanced coloring. Networks based on real
systems, however, are built on experimental data which are inherently
incomplete, due to missing links, collection errors, and natural variations
within specimens of the same biological species. Therefore, it is fair to
assume that some of the existing symmetries were not detected in our analysis.
For that reason, a method to find pseudosymmetries and repair networks based on
those symmetries is important when analyzing real world networks. In this paper
we introduce the {\it pseudobalanced coloring} \eqref{eq:mainip} problem, and
provide an integer programming formulation which (a) calculates a
pseudobalanced coloring of the graph taking into account the missing data, and
(b) optimally repairs the graph with the minimal number of added/removed edges
to maximize the symmetry of the graph. We apply our formulation to the {\it C.
elegans} connectome to find pseudocoloring and the optimal graph repair. Our
solution compares well with a manually curated ground-truth {\it C. elegans}
graph as well as solutions generated by other methods of missing link
prediction.

trend for all substrates, with a N/Cr ratio increasing from approximately 0.7
to 1.06-1.10 by increasing percentage of N2 in the gas flow ratio. As a result
of the change in stoichiometry, the lattice parameter and the Seebeck
coefficient increase together with the increase of N in CrN1+d; in particular,
the Seebeck value coefficient transitions from -50 uV.K-1 for CrN0.97 to +75

vacancies can account for the change in Seebeck coefficient, since they push
the Fermi level down in the valence band, whereas N interstitial defects in the

Calculations including both types of defects, which have a strong tendency to

simultaneous formation of holes in the valence band. To explain the

strength $ B_0 $ and a sufficiently large collisional factor $ \nu $ help
suppress the formation of a finite-dimensional singularity in a solution
(breaking of oscillations). Nevertheless, the suppression mechanism is
different: an external magnetic field increases the oscillation frequency, and
collisions tend to stabilize the medium and suppress oscillations. In terms of
the initial data and the coefficients $ B_0 $ and $ \nu $, we establish a
criterion for maintaining the global smoothness of the solution. Namely, for
fixed $ B_0 $ and $ \nu \ge 0 $ one can precisely divide the initial data into
two classes: one leads to stabilization to the equilibrium and the other leads
to the destruction of the solution in a finite time. Next, we examine the
nature of the stabilization. We show that for small $ B_0 $ an increase in the
intensity factor first leads to a change in the oscillatory behavior of the
solution to monotonic damping, which is then again replaced by oscillatory
damping. At large values of $ B_0 $, the solution is characterized by
oscillatory damping regardless of the value of the intensity factor $ \nu $.

Euler calculus. Lebesgue integration gives access to well-studied kernels and
to regularity results, while Euler calculus conveys topological information and
allows for compatibility with operations on constructible functions. We conduct
a systematic study of such transforms and introduce two new ones: the
Euler-Fourier and Euler-Laplace transforms. We show that the first has a left
inverse and that the second provides a satisfactory generalization of Govc and
Hepworth's persistent magnitude to constructible sheaves, in particular to
multi-parameter persistent modules. Finally, we prove index-theoretic formulae
expressing a wide class of hybrid transforms as generalized Euler integral
transforms. This yields expectation formulae for transforms of constructible
functions associated to (sub)level-sets persistence of random Gaussian
filtrations.

Halpha spectra from the Dunn Solar Telescope, full-disk Dopplergrams of He I

with the HAZEL code exhibit coherent patches of 5 Mm extent that indicate
counter-streaming and/or buoyant behavior. During the eruption, individual,
aligned threads appear in the He I velocity maps. The distribution of
velocities evolves from Gaussian to strongly asymmetric. The maximal optical
depth of He I 10830 A decreased from tau = 1.75 to 0.25, the temperature
increased by 13 kK, and the average speed and width of the filament increased
from 0 to 25 km s-1 and 10 to 20 Mm, respectively. All data sources agree that
the filament rose with an exponential acceleration reaching 7.4 m s-2 that
increased to a final velocity of 430 km s-1 at 22:24 UT; a CME was associated
with this filament eruption. The properties during the eruption favor a
kink/torus instability, which requires the existence of a flux rope. We
conclude that full-disk chromospheric Dopplergrams can be used to trace the
initial phase of on-disk filament eruptions in real-time, which might
potentially be useful for modelling the source of any subsequent CMEs.

in the oscillation frequency as the inter-chain coupling is increased. Local
quenches lead to a light-cone-like propagation of excitations. In this case,
the inter-chain coupling drives a transfer of energy between the chains that

associated with macro-states are computed from differential manifolds whose
metric components are constructed from the Lie group symmetries that generate
$\{|\bar{\Gamma}^{\rho}\rangle\}$. We call these manifolds surfaces of

like information entropies, we compare them to the von Neumann and linear
entropies for states whose symmetries are given by $SO(3)$, $SU(2)$, and
$SO(N)$. We also show that our procedure reproduces features of Boltzmann's

synthesized multiple views, we can generate aesthetically realistic image

our method, the smaller the distance between a testing sample and normal

Specifically, we propose to use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to map samples
whose similarity exceeds a certain threshold into the same bucket in advance.
In this manner, the complexity of near neighbor search is cut down
significantly. To make the samples that are semantically similar get closer and
samples not similar get further apart, we propose a novel learnable version of
LSH that embeds LSH into a neural network and optimizes the hash functions with
contrastive learning strategy. The proposed method is robust to data imbalance
and can handle the large intra-class variations in normal data flexibly.
Besides, it has a good ability of scalability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method, which achieves new state-of-the-art
results on VAD benchmarks.

particular interest in many applications, such as ecological studies, and an
unexplored area has been how to incorporate networks' cycles within the
inferential framework in an explicit way. The recently developed Spherical
Network Family of models (SNF) offers a flexible formulation for modelling
multiple network data that permits any type of metric. This has opened up the
possibility to formulate network models that focus on network properties
hitherto not possible or practical to consider. In this article we propose a
novel network distance metric that measures similarities between networks with
respect to their cycles, and incorporate this within the SNF model to allow
inferences that explicitly capture information on cycles. These network motifs
are of particular interest in ecological studies. We further propose a novel
computational framework to allow posterior inferences from the intractable SNF
model for moderate sized networks. Lastly, we apply the resulting methodology
to a set of ecological network data studying aggressive interactions between
species of fish. We show our model is able to make cogent inferences concerning
the cycle behaviour amongst the species, and beyond those possible from a model

predictions using cross-task information. The CT-GNN architecture extends the
traditional disjointed task-heads decoder, by utilizing a cross-task graph and
unique class node embeddings. The cross-task graph can either be determined a

determined dynamically using self-attention. CT-GNN can be added to any
backbone and trained end-to-end at a small increase in the parameter count. We
achieve state-of-the-art performance on all four classification tasks in the
Sewer-ML dataset, improving defect classification and water level

that require ultra-low latency. This is only possible if computing resources,
traditionally centralized at the core of communication networks, are moved
closer to the user, to the network edge. However, the realization of Edge
Computing (EC) in the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks requires
efficient resource allocation mechanisms for the placement of the Virtual
Network Functions (VNFs). Machine learning (ML) methods, and more specifically,
Reinforcement Learning (RL), are a promising approach to solve this problem.
The main contributions of this work are twofold: first, we obtain the
theoretical performance bound for VNF placement in EC-enabled6G networks by
formulating the problem mathematically as a finite Markov Decision Process
(MDP) and solving it using a dynamic programming method called Policy Iteration
(PI). Second, we develop a practical solution to the problem using RL, where
the problem is treated with Q-Learning that considers both computational and
communication resources when placing VNFs in the network. The simulation
results under different settings of the system parameters show that the
performance of the Q-Learning approach is close to the optimal PI algorithm
(without having its restrictive assumptions on service statistics). This is
particularly interesting when the EC resources are scarce and efficient
management of these resources is required.

alleviate this bias by analyzing fifteen disks targeted with VLT/SPHERE that
look faint in scattered light. Sources were selected based on a low far-IR
excess from the spectral energy distribution. The comparison with the ALMA
images available for a few sources shows that the scattered light surveyed by
these datasets is only detected from a small portion of the disk extent. The
mild anti-correlation between the disk brightness and the near-IR excess
demonstrates that these disks are self-shadowed: the inner disk rim intercepts
much starlight and leaves the outer disk in penumbra. Based on the uniform
distribution of the disk brightness in scattered light across all spectral
types, self-shadowing would act similarly for inner rims at a different

vital significance for the drug development and the clinical practice.
Computational methods that rely on molecular dynamics simulations, Rosetta
protocols, as well as machine learning methods have been proven to be capable
of predicting ligand affinity changes upon protein mutation. However, the
severely limited sample size and heavy noise induced overfitting and
generalization issues have impeded wide adoption of machine learning for

specific scheme that starts with easy-to-learn samples and gradually
incorporates harder and diverse samples into the training, and then iterates
between sample weight recalculations and model updates. In addition, we
calculate additional physics-based structural features to provide the machine
learning model with the valuable domain knowledge on proteins for this
data-limited predictive tasks. The experiments substantiate the capability of
the proposed method for predicting kinase inhibitor resistance under three

These devices continuously convert physical signals into electrical currents

even when no event is taking place. Solving this problem requires the ability
to passively distinguish relevant from irrelevant events (e.g. tell a wake-up
phrase from a regular conversation). Here, we experimentally demonstrate an
elastic metastructure, consisting of a network of coupled silicon resonators,
that passively discriminates between pairs of spoken words -- solving the
wake-up problem for scenarios where only two classes of events are possible.
This passive speech recognition is demonstrated on a dataset from speakers with
significant gender and accent diversity. The geometry of the metastructure is
determined during the design process, in which the network of resonators
('mechanical neurones') learns to selectively respond to spoken words. Training
is facilitated by a machine learning model that reduces the number of

embedding event detection in the structural dynamics, mechanical neural
networks thus enable novel classes of always-on smart devices with no standby

mathematical model that describes brain tissue via a handful of

To address this issue, we propose a new forward model, specifically a new
system of equations, requiring a few relatively sparse b-shells. We then apply
modern tools from Bayesian analysis known as likelihood-free inference (LFI) to
invert our proposed model. As opposed to other approaches from the literature,
our algorithm yields not only an estimation of the parameter vector $\theta$
that best describes a given observed data point $x_0$, but also a full
posterior distribution $p(\theta|x_0)$ over the parameter space. This enables a
richer description of the model inversion, providing indicators such as
credible intervals for the estimated parameters and a complete characterization
of the parameter regions where the model may present indeterminacies. We
approximate the posterior distribution using deep neural density estimators,
known as normalizing flows, and fit them using a set of repeated simulations
from the forward model. We validate our approach on simulations using dmipy and
then apply the whole pipeline on two publicly available datasets.

so-called parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), i.e., PDEs with
different physical parameters, boundary conditions, shapes of computation
domains, etc. Recently, building learning-based numerical solvers for
parametric PDEs has become an emerging new field. One category of methods such
as the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
aim to approximate the solution of the PDEs. They are typically unsupervised
and mesh-free, but require going through the time-consuming network training
process from scratch for each set of parameters of the PDE. Another category of
methods such as Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Deep Operator Network
(DeepONet) try to approximate the solution mapping directly. Being fast with
only one forward inference for each PDE parameter without retraining, they
often require a large corpus of paired input-output observations drawn from
numerical simulations, and most of them need a predefined mesh as well. In this
paper, we propose Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD), a mesh-free and unsupervised deep
learning method that enables the pre-trained model to be quickly adapted to
equation instances by implicitly encoding (possibly heterogenous) PDE
parameters as latent vectors. The proposed method MAD can be interpreted by
manifold learning in infinite-dimensional spaces, granting it a geometric
insight. Extensive numerical experiments show that the MAD method exhibits
faster convergence speed without losing accuracy than other deep learning-based
methods. The project page with code is available:

Finite Element (FE) simulations requires heavy computational loads and
data-driven approaches suffer from the complexity of highdimensional mapping.
This paper proposes a Residual Fourier Neural Operator (ResFNO) to establish
the direct high-dimensional mapping from any given cure cycle to the
corresponding temperature histories. By integrating domain knowledge into a
time-resolution independent parameterized neural network, the mapping between
cure cycles to temperature histories can be learned using limited number of

mode decomposition to accelerate the training and boost the performance
significantly. Several cases are carried out to evaluate the superior
performance and generalizability of the proposed method comprehensively.

resistive-nanoindentation tests performed on gold samples (bulk and thin film).
First, the relevant contributions to electrical contact resistance are
discussed and analytically described. A brief comparison of tests performed on
gold and on natively oxidized metals highlights the high reproducibility and
the voltage-independence of experiments on gold(thanks to its oxide-free
surface). Then, the evolution of contact resistance during nanoindentation is
fully explained in terms of electronic transport regimes: starting from
tunneling, electronic transport is then driven by ballistic conduction before
ending with pure diffusive conduction. The corresponding analytical
expressions, as well as their validity domains, are determined and compared
with experimental data,showing excellent agreement. From there, focus is made
on the diffusive regime. Resistive-nanoindentation outputs are fully described
by analytical and finite-element modeling. The developed numerical framework
allows a better understanding of the main parameters: it first assesses the
technique capabilities (validity domains, sensitivity to tip defect,
sensitivity to rheology, effect of an oxide layer, and so on), butit also
validates the different assumptions made on current line distribution. Finally,
it is shown that a simple calibration procedure allows a well-resolved
monitoring of the contact area during resistive-nanoindentation performed on
samples with complex rheologies (ductile thin film on an elastic substrate).
Comparison to analytical and numerical approaches highlights the strength of
resistive-nanoindentation for continuous area monitoring.

exchanges based on patterns identification has long attracted researchers.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Natural Language Processing have gained
notoriety in these single-asset trading tasks, but only a few works have
explored their combination. Moreover, some issues are still not addressed, such
as extracting market sentiment momentum through the explicit capture of
sentiment features that reflect the market condition over time and assessing
the consistency and stability of RL results in different situations. Filling
this gap, we propose the Sentiment-Aware RL (SentARL) intelligent trading
system that improves profit stability by leveraging market mood through an
adaptive amount of past sentiment features drawn from textual news. We
evaluated SentARL across twenty assets, two transaction costs, and five
different periods and initializations to show its consistent effectiveness
against baselines. Subsequently, this thorough assessment allowed us to
identify the boundary between news coverage and market sentiment regarding the
correlation of price-time series above which SentARL's effectiveness is
outstanding.

  Robots","CS Thesis. Lecture Notes in Computer Science",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Autonomous robots are currently one of the most popular Artificial
Intelligence problems, having experienced significant advances in the last
decade, from Self-driving cars and humanoids to delivery robots and drones.
Part of the problem is to get a robot to emulate the perception of human
beings, our sense of sight, replacing the eyes with cameras and the brain with
mathematical models such as Neural Networks. Developing an AI able to drive a
car without human intervention and a small robot to deliver packages in the
city may seem like different problems, nevertheless from the point of view of
perception and vision, both problems have several similarities. The main
solutions we currently find focus on the environment perception through visual
information using Computer Vision techniques, Machine Learning, and various
algorithms to make the robot understand the environment or scene, move, adapt
its trajectory and perform its tasks (maintenance, exploration, etc.) without
the need for human intervention. In this work, we develop a small-scale
autonomous vehicle from scratch, capable of understanding the scene using only
visual information, navigating through industrial environments, detecting
people and obstacles, or performing simple maintenance tasks. We review the
state-of-the-art of fundamental problems and demonstrate that many methods
employed at small-scale are similar to the ones employed in real Self-driving
cars from companies like Tesla or Lyft. Finally, we discuss the current state
of Robotics and autonomous driving and the technological and ethical
limitations that we can find in this field.

  Discovery","Accepted at DATE 2022",,,,"quant-ph cs.ET cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The de novo design of drug molecules is recognized as a time-consuming and
costly process, and computational approaches have been applied in each stage of
the drug discovery pipeline. Variational autoencoder is one of the
computer-aided design methods which explores the chemical space based on
existing molecular dataset. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an atypical
learning method that may speed up some classical learning tasks because of its
strong expressive power. However, near-term quantum computers suffer from
limited number of qubits which hinders the representation learning in high
dimensional spaces. We present a scalable quantum generative autoencoder
(SQ-VAE) for simultaneously reconstructing and sampling drug molecules, and a
corresponding vanilla variant (SQ-AE) for better reconstruction. The
architectural strategies in hybrid quantum classical networks such as,
adjustable quantum layer depth, heterogeneous learning rates, and patched
quantum circuits are proposed to learn high dimensional dataset such as,
ligand-targeted drugs. Extensive experimental results are reported for
different dimensions including 8x8 and 32x32 after choosing suitable
architectural strategies. The performance of quantum generative autoencoder is
compared with the corresponding classical counterpart throughout all
experiments. The results show that quantum computing advantages can be achieved
for normalized low-dimension molecules, and that high-dimension molecules
generated from quantum generative autoencoders have better drug properties
within the same learning period.

unlock a variety of analysis techniques -- model checking temporal properties,
computing differences between models of two implementations of the same
protocol, or improving testing via model-based test generation. Prognosis is
modular and easily adaptable to different protocols (e.g., TCP and QUIC) and
their implementations. We use Prognosis to learn models of (parts of) three
QUIC implementations -- Quiche (Cloudflare), Google QUIC, and Facebook mvfst --
and use these models to analyze the differences between the various

for reliable and low-latency wireless communication for applications such as
vehicle-to-vehicle communication and industrial automation. The environment
that these applications operate in is often highly dynamic, and, as a result,
the wireless network technology used needs to be able to adapt to changing
conditions, which makes mesh networking a good fit. Hence, in this work, we
consider Thread and Bluetooth Mesh, two prominent mesh networking technologies.
We measure one-way point-to-point latency using these technologies and show the
cumulative probability distribution of the latency for varying payload size. We
carry out the measurements under static conditions in an open-air environment.
Our results show that Thread achieves lower latency than Bluetooth Mesh,
especially for larger payloads. Furthermore, we show that Thread meets some of
the latency targets set out for 5G. However, since Thread networks are slow to
adapt to network changes, Thread may still not be suitable for application
requiring low latency. Bluetooth mesh, on the other hand, does not meet any of
the latency targets, although it is close when the payload is small (less than
11 bytes). Overall, there needs to be further optimization before these
technologies can be used for reliable and low-latency communication in dynamic
environments.
