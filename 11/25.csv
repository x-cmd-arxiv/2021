  Estimation","Accepted to CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning to estimate object pose often requires ground-truth (GT) labels,
such as CAD model and absolute-scale object pose, which is expensive and
laborious to obtain in the real world. To tackle this problem, we propose an
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for category-level object pose estimation,
called UDA-COPE. Inspired by recent multi-modal UDA techniques, the proposed
method exploits a teacher-student self-supervised learning scheme to train a
pose estimation network without using target domain pose labels. We also
introduce a bidirectional filtering method between the predicted normalized
object coordinate space (NOCS) map and observed point cloud, to not only make
our teacher network more robust to the target domain but also to provide more
reliable pseudo labels for the student network training. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, without leveraging target-domain GT
labels, our proposed method achieved comparable or sometimes superior
performance to existing methods that depend on the GT labels.

microscopy and commonly abbreviated SHeM or NAM (neutral atom microscopy), is a
novel imaging technique that uses a beam of neutral helium atoms as an imaging
probe. The technique offers a number of advantages such as the very low energy
of the incident probing atoms (less than 0.1 eV), unsurpassed surface
sensitivity (no penetration into the sample bulk), a charge neutral, inert
probe and a high depth of field. This opens up for a range of interesting
applications such as: imaging of fragile and/or non-conducting samples without
damage, inspection of 2D materials and nano-coatings, with the possibility to
test properties such as grain boundaries or roughness on the Angstr\""om scale
(the wavelength of the incident helium atoms) and imaging of samples with high
aspect ratios, with the potential to obtain true to scale height information of
3D surface topography with nanometer resolution: nano stereo microscopy.
However, for a full exploitation of the technique, a range of experimental and
theoretical issues still needs to be resolved. In this paper we review the
research in the field. We do this by following the trajectory of the helium
atoms step by step through the microscope: from the initial acceleration in the
supersonic expansion used to generate the probing beam over the atom optical
elements used to shape the beam, followed by interaction of the helium atoms
with the sample (contrast properties) to the final detection and
post-processing. We also review recent advances in scanning helium microscope
design including a discussion of imaging with other atoms and molecules than
helium.

melodies, and sequentially, in the form of repetition and variation. Music from
different cultures establish different aesthetics by having different style
conventions on these two aspects. We propose a framework that could be used to
quantitatively compare music from different cultures by looking at these two
aspects.
  The framework is based on an Music Information Dynamics model, a Variable
Markov Oracle (VMO), and is extended with a variational representation learning
of audio. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained to map audio fragments
into a latent representation. The latent representation is fed into a VMO. The
VMO then learns a clustering of the latent representation via a threshold that
maximizes the information rate of the quantized latent representation sequence.
This threshold effectively controls the sensibility of the predictive step to
acoustic changes, which determines the framework's ability to track repetitions
on longer time scales. This approach allows characterization of the overall
information contents of a musical signal at each level of acoustic sensibility.
  Our findings under this framework show that sensibility to subtle acoustic
changes is higher for East-Asian musical traditions, while the Western works
exhibit longer motivic structures at higher thresholds of differences in the
latent space. This suggests that a profile of information contents, analyzed as
a function of the level of acoustic detail can serve as a possible cultural
characteristic.

present a compact radial distribution with a median filament width of
$\sim$0.04 pc narrower than the previously proposed `quasi-universal' 0.1~pc
filament width. The higher spatial resolution observations and higher-density
gas tracer tend to identify even narrower and lower mass filaments. The
filament widths are roughly twice the size of embedded cores. The gas filaments
are largely supported by thermal motions. The nonthermal motions are
predominantly subsonic and transonic in both identified gas filaments and
embedded cores, which may imply that stars are likely born in environments of
low turbulence. A fraction of embedded objects show a narrower velocity
dispersion compared with their corresponding natal filaments, which may
indicate that the turbulent dissipation is taking place in these embedded
cores. The physical properties (mass, mass per unit length, gas kinematics, and
width) of gas filaments are analogous to those of narrow filaments found in
low- to high-mass star-forming regions. The more evolved sources are found to
be farther away from the filaments, a situation that may have resulted from the
relative motions between the YSOs and their natal filaments.

that models with object-centric inductive biases can learn to segment and
represent meaningful objects from the statistical structure of the data alone
without the need for any supervision. However, such fully-unsupervised methods
still fail to scale to diverse realistic data, despite the use of increasingly
complex inductive biases such as priors for the size of objects or the 3D

approach and focus on how 1) using the temporal dynamics of video data in the
form of optical flow and 2) conditioning the model on simple object location
cues can be used to enable segmenting and tracking objects in significantly
more realistic synthetic data. We introduce a sequential extension to Slot
Attention which we train to predict optical flow for realistic looking
synthetic scenes and show that conditioning the initial state of this model on
a small set of hints, such as center of mass of objects in the first frame, is
sufficient to significantly improve instance segmentation. These benefits
generalize beyond the training distribution to novel objects, novel
backgrounds, and to longer video sequences. We also find that such
initial-state-conditioning can be used during inference as a flexible interface
to query the model for specific objects or parts of objects, which could pave
the way for a range of weakly-supervised approaches and allow more effective
interaction with trained models.

state-space filtering and smoothing methods. The resulting state-space DGP
(SS-DGP) models generate a rich class of priors compatible with modelling a
number of irregular signals/functions. Moreover, due to their Markovian
structure, SS-DGPs regression problems can be solved efficiently by using
Bayesian filtering and smoothing methods. The second contribution of this
thesis is that we solve continuous-discrete Gaussian filtering and smoothing
problems by using the Taylor moment expansion (TME) method. This induces a
class of filters and smoothers that can be asymptotically exact in predicting
the mean and covariance of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) solutions.
Moreover, the TME method and TME filters and smoothers are compatible with
simulating SS-DGPs and solving their regression problems. Lastly, this thesis
features a number of applications of state-space (deep) GPs. These applications

search space is usually considerably huge (e.g., $13^{21}$). In order to
enhance the supernet's evaluation ability, one greedy strategy is to sample
good paths, and let the supernet lean towards the good ones and ease its
evaluation burden as a result. However, in practice the search can be still
quite inefficient since the identification of good paths is not accurate enough
and sampled paths still scatter around the whole search space. In this paper,
we leverage an explicit path filter to capture the characteristics of paths and
directly filter those weak ones, so that the search can be thus implemented on
the shrunk space more greedily and efficiently. Concretely, based on the fact
that good paths are much less than the weak ones in the space, we argue that
the label of ""weak paths"" will be more confident and reliable than that of
""good paths"" in multi-path sampling. In this way, we thus cast the training of
path filter in the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning paradigm, and also
encourage a \textit{path embedding} as better path/operation representation to
enhance the identification capacity of the learned filter. By dint of this
embedding, we can further shrink the search space by aggregating similar
operations with similar embeddings, and the search can be more efficient and
accurate. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method GreedyNASv2. For example, our obtained GreedyNASv2-L achieves $81.1\%$

asymptotic convergence estimates for (i) the approximate periodic solution in
terms of the number of approximated harmonics and (ii) the inexact Newton
method used to compute the approximate Fourier coefficients. The convergence
estimates are deter-mined by the rate of convergence of the Fourier series of

overparameterized models on massive amounts of data. As this trend continues,
model training has become prohibitively costly, requiring access to powerful
computing systems to train state-of-the-art networks. A large body of research
has been devoted to addressing the cost per iteration of training through
various model compression techniques like pruning and quantization. Less effort
has been spent targeting the number of iterations. Previous work, such as
forget scores and GraNd/EL2N scores, address this problem by identifying
important samples within a full dataset and pruning the remaining samples,
thereby reducing the iterations per epoch. Though these methods decrease the
training time, they use expensive static scoring algorithms prior to training.
When accounting for the scoring mechanism, the total run time is often
increased. In this work, we address this shortcoming with dynamic data pruning
algorithms. Surprisingly, we find that uniform random dynamic pruning can
outperform the prior work at aggressive pruning rates. We attribute this to the
existence of ""sometimes"" samples -- points that are important to the learned
decision boundary only some of the training time. To better exploit the
subtlety of sometimes samples, we propose two algorithms, based on
reinforcement learning techniques, to dynamically prune samples and achieve
even higher accuracy than the random dynamic method. We test all our methods
against a full-dataset baseline and the prior work on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
and we can reduce the training time by up to 2x without significant performance
loss. Our results suggest that data pruning should be understood as a dynamic
process that is closely tied to a model's training trajectory, instead of a
static step based solely on the dataset alone.

called fruiting bodies when starved. These structures form initially through
the active dewetting of cells into surface-bound droplets, where substantial
flows of the material are needed as the fruiting bodies grow and become round.
These dynamics are followed by a primitive developmental process in which the
fluid-like droplets of motile cells mature into mechanically-resilient mounds
of non-motile spores that can resist significant mechanical perturbation from
the external environment. To date, the mechanical properties of fruiting bodies
and the changes in cellular behavior that lead to maturation have not been
studied. We use atomic force microscopy to probe the rheology of droplets
throughout their development and find that relaxation occurs on two time
scales, $\sim$1~s and $\sim$100~s. We use a two-element Maxwell-Wiechert model
to quantify the viscoelastic relaxation and find that at early developmental
times, cellular motility is responsible for the flow of the material but that
this flow ceases when cells stop moving and become nonmotile spores. Later in
development there is a dramatic increase in the modulus of the droplet as cells
sporulate and the fruiting body matures, resulting in a mostly elastic
structure that can protect spores from harsh environmental insult.

outperformed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various vision tasks.
However, such powerful transformers bring a huge computation burden, because of
the exhausting token-to-token comparison. The previous works focus on dropping
insignificant tokens to reduce the computational cost of ViTs. But when the
dropping ratio increases, this hard manner will inevitably discard the vital
tokens, which limits its efficiency. To solve the issue, we propose a generic
self-slimmed learning approach for vanilla ViTs, namely SiT. Specifically, we
first design a novel Token Slimming Module (TSM), which can boost the inference
efficiency of ViTs by dynamic token aggregation. As a general method of token
hard dropping, our TSM softly integrates redundant tokens into fewer
informative ones. It can dynamically zoom visual attention without cutting off
discriminative token relations in the images, even with a high slimming ratio.
Furthermore, we introduce a concise Feature Recalibration Distillation (FRD)
framework, wherein we design a reverse version of TSM (RTSM) to recalibrate the
unstructured token in a flexible auto-encoder manner. Due to the similar
structure between teacher and student, our FRD can effectively leverage
structure knowledge for better convergence. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate our SiT. It demonstrates that our method can speed up
ViTs by 1.7x with negligible accuracy drop, and even speed up ViTs by 3.6x
while maintaining 97% of their performance. Surprisingly, by simply arming
LV-ViT with our SiT, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet.

the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth. A major challenge facing
large ground-based radio telescopes is achieving sufficient pointing accuracy
for observing at high frequencies, up to 116 GHz in the case of the GBT.
Accurate pointing requires the ability to blindly acquire source locations and
perform ad hoc corrections determined by observing nearby calibrator sources in
order to obtain a starting position accurate to within a small margin of error
of the target's location. The required pointing accuracy is dependent upon the
half-power beamwidth, and for the higher-frequency end of GBT observing, this
means that pointing must be accurate to within a few arcseconds RMS. The GBT's
off-axis design is advantageous in that it eliminates blockage of the dish and
reduces sidelobe interference, and there is no evidence that the resulting
asymmetric structure adversely affects pointing accuracy. However, factors such
as gravitational flexure, thermal deformation, azimuth track tilt and
irregularity, and small misalignments and offset errors within the telescope's
structure cause pointing inaccuracies. A pointing model was developed for the
GBT to correct for these effects. The model utilizes standard geometrical
corrections along with metrology data from the GBT's structural temperature
sensors and data from measurements of the track levels. In this paper we
provide a summary of the GBT's pointing model and associated corrections, as
well as a discussion of relevant metrology systems and an analysis of its

spacecraft, we identify complexity changes which manifest as fundamental
alterations or significant re-orientations of the ICME. Plasma and suprathermal
electron data at 1 au, and simulations of the solar wind enable us to
reconstruct the propagation scenario for each event, and to identify critical
factors controlling their evolution. Results show that ~65% of ICMEs change
their complexity between Mercury and 1 au and that interaction with multiple
large-scale solar wind structures is the driver of these changes. Furthermore,
71% of ICMEs observed at large radial (>0.4 au) but small longitudinal (<15
degrees) separations exhibit complexity changes, indicating that propagation
over large distances strongly affects ICMEs. Results also suggest ICMEs may be
magnetically coherent over angular scales of at least 15 degrees, supporting
earlier theoretical and observational estimates. This work presents statistical
evidence that magnetic complexity changes are consequences of ICME interactions
with large-scale solar wind structures, rather than intrinsic to ICME
evolution, and that such changes are only partly identifiable from in situ

and sampled-data settings. Fundamental performance limitations of causal
differentiators, in terms of the smallest achievable worst-case differentiation
error, are shown. A robust exact differentiator is then constructed via the
adaptation of a single parameter of a linear differentiator. It is demonstrated
that the resulting differentiator exhibits a combination of properties that
outperforms existing continuous-time differentiators: it is robust with respect
to noise, it instantaneously converges to the exact derivative in the absence
of noise, and it attains the smallest possible -- hence optimal -- upper bound
on its differentiation error under noisy measurements. For sample-based
differentiators, the concept of quasi-exactness is introduced to classify
differentiators that achieve the lowest possible worst-case error based on
sampled measurements in the absence of noise. A straightforward sample-based
implementation of the proposed linear adaptive continuous-time differentiator
is shown to achieve quasi-exactness after a single sampling step as well as a
theoretically optimal differentiation error bound that, in addition, converges
to the continuous-time optimal one as the sampling period becomes arbitrarily
small. A numerical simulation illustrates the presented formal results.

Such a scenario is highly restrictive and predictive: in addition to three
right-handed neutrino masses, there are only five real parameters; all the
lepton flavor mixing parameters except for $\theta^{}_{13}$ will be predicted.
The relations between the model parameters and the measurable neutrino
parameters will be derived. The implications of this scenario for leptogenesis
will be explored in detail. A further reduction of this scenario to the more

understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in
any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted
into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard
approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic
transformations. Very few results have been presented on the intermediate
regime between probabilistic and approximate transformations. Here, we
investigate this intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity
and the probability of state transitions. We derive limitations on the
transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing
bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation
probability. We also show that the deterministic version of this bound can be
applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which
goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. As an
application, we show that the fidelity between Popescu-Rohrlich box and an
isotropic box cannot increase via any locality preserving superchannel.
Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state
transformations via local operations and classical communications in the case
of pure bipartite entangled state transformations of arbitrary dimensions and
two-qubit entanglement for arbitrary final states, when starting from a pure
bipartite state.

critical nuclei are too close to their periodic images. A rigorous
determination of what constitutes too close is, however, a major challenge.
Recently, we devised rigorous heuristics for detecting such artifacts based on
our investigation of how system size impacts the rate of heterogeneous ice
nucleation (Hussain, Haji-Akbari, \emph{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{154}, 014108,
\textbf{2021}). We identified the prevalence of critical nuclei spanning across
the periodic boundary, and the thermodynamic and structural properties of the
liquid occupying the inter-image region as indicators of finite size artifacts.
Here, we further probe the performance of such heuristics by examining the
dependence of homogeneous crystal nucleation rates in the Lennard-Jones liquid
on system size. The rates depend non-monotonically on system size and vary by
almost six orders of magnitude for the range of system sizes considered here.
We confirm that the prevalence of spanning critical nuclei is the primary
indicator of finite size artifacts and almost fully explains the observed
variations in rate. Proximity, or structuring of the inter-image liquid,
however, is not as strong of an indicator due to the fragmented nature of
crystalline nuclei. As a result, the dependence of rate on system size is
subtle for the systems with a minuscule fraction of spanning critical nuclei.
These observations indicate that our heuristics are universally applicable to
different modes of nucleation (homogeneous and heterogeneous) in different
systems even if they might be overly stringent for homogeneous
nucleation,~e.g.,~in the LJ system.

fixed point with imaginary cubic couplings where the symmetry is enhanced to
the supergroup OSp$(1|2)$. This theory may be viewed as a ""UV completion"" in
$2<d<6$ of the non-linear sigma model with hyperbolic target space H$^{0|2}$
described by a pair of intrinsic anticommuting coordinates. It also describes
the $q\rightarrow 0$ limit of the critical $q$-state Potts model, which is
equivalent to the statistical mechanics of spanning forests on a graph. In this
letter we generalize these results to a class of OSp$(1|2M)$ symmetric field
theories whose upper critical dimensions are $d_c(M) = 2 \frac{2M+1}{2M-1}$.

manipulating the logical quantum states, it is imperative that errors caused by
imperfect operations do not spread uncontrollably through the quantum register.
This requires that all operations on the quantum register obey a fault-tolerant
circuit design which, in general, increases the complexity of the
implementation. Here, we demonstrate a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on
two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we make
use of the recently introduced paradigm of flag fault tolerance, where the
absence or presence of dangerous errors is heralded by usage of few ancillary
'flag' qubits. We perform a logical two-qubit CNOT-gate between two instances
of the seven qubit color code, and we also fault-tolerantly prepare a logical
magic state. We then realize a fault-tolerant logical T-gate by injecting the
magic state via teleportation from one logical qubit onto the other. We observe
the hallmark feature of fault tolerance, a superior performance compared to a
non-fault-tolerant implementation. In combination with recently demonstrated
repeated quantum error correction cycles these results open the door to
error-corrected universal quantum computation.

technologies. While several schemes are available for the production of
entangled photons, they typically require the assistance of cumbersome optical
elements to couple them to other components involved in logic operations. Here,
we introduce a scheme by which entangled photon pairs are directly generated as
guided mode states in optical waveguides. The scheme relies on the intrinsic
nonlinearity of the waveguide material, circumventing the use of bulky optical
components. Specifically, we consider an optical fiber under normal
illumination, so that photon down-conversion can take place to waveguide states
emitted with opposite momentum into a spectral region populated by only two
accessible modes. By additionally configuring the external illumination to
interfere different incident directions, we can produce maximally entangled
photon-pair states, directly generated as waveguide modes with conversion
efficiencies that are competitive with respect to existing macroscopic schemes.
These results should find application in the design of more efficient and
compact quantum optics devices.

algorithm driven by Markovian noise and general consensus-type interaction, in

interconnection structure among the agents is described by a time-varying

For any uniformly strongly connected graph sequences whose associated

the mean-square error, defined as the deviation of the output of the algorithm
from the unique equilibrium point of the associated ordinary differential
equation. For the case of interconnection matrices being stochastic, the
equilibrium point can be any unspecified convex combination of the local

$\sim$10 au-wide gap, and it is flanked by a mm-bright outer ring (Ring24) with
a sharp inner edge at 24 au. Between 25 and $\sim$35 au the brightness of
Ring24 is relatively flat and then breaks into a steep tail that reaches out to
$\sim$60 au. In addition, central emission is detected close to the star which
we interpret as a tight circumbinary ring made of dust grains with a lower size
limit of 0.8 mm at 1.1 au. In order to reproduce the SED, the model also
requires an inner ring at $\sim$5 au (Ring5) composed mainly of small dust
grains, hiding under the IRDIS coronagraph, and surrounding the inner
circumbinary disc. The surprisingly thin Ring13 is nonetheless roughly 10 times
wider than its expected vertical extent. The strong near-far disc asymmetry at

change in the concentration of the RhB dye in water, ethanol and propanol using
absorption and laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy. The dimer and monomer
fluorescence emissions were observed simultaneously in all the solvents. The
monomer to dimer fluorescence intensity ratio has been calculated and found
that at a certain concentration of RhB the magnitude of the ratio is different
in different solvents. The ratio becomes equivalent to one for 1.5 gm per l, 3
gm per l and 4.2 gm per l, concentration of RhB in water, ethanol and propanol
respectively. This concentration of RhB at which the monomer to dimer ratio
becomes unity is proposed as critical concentration. Above this critical
concentration, the dimeric fluorescence dominates and below which the monomeric
fluorescence dominates. Moreover, in the solvent for which the magnitude of
critical concentration is less the fluorophore molecule aggregates more easily
and vice versa. So, water is found to be the most suitable solvent for RhB
molecules for self-aggregation than ethanol and propanol but with less dimeric
quantum yield. It is also observed that the critical concentration varies
inversely with the dielectric constant of the solvents. Altogether, it can be
said that the proposed ratio and critical concentration quantify the
aggregation process of the fluorophore in the solvent. Hence, the critical
concentration value of the fluorophore could be assumed as the characteristic
parameter to study the aggregation behaviour of the fluorophore in solvents.
The described method has the merit of use in the study of lasing ability and
the wavelength tunability of the dye laser gain media as well as in the heavy
metal sensing technology in water. This method may also be extended for other
fluorophores and solvents.

sensor saturation bottleneck in conventional digital acquisition systems. At
its core, the USF allows for high-dynamic-range (HDR) signal reconstruction by
converting a continuous-time signal into folded, low-dynamic-range (LDR),
modulo samples. HDR reconstruction is then carried out by algorithmic unfolding
of the folded samples. In hardware, however, implementing an ideal modulo
folding requires careful calibration, analog design and high precision. At the
interface of theory and practice, this paper explores a computational sampling
strategy that relaxes strict hardware requirements by compensating them via a
novel, mathematically guaranteed recovery method. Our starting point is a
generalized model for USF. The generalization relies on two new parameters
modeling hysteresis and folding transients} in addition to the modulo
threshold. Hysteresis accounts for the mismatch between the reset threshold and
the amplitude displacement at the folding time and we refer to a continuous
transition period in the implementation of a reset as folding transient. Both
these effects are motivated by our hardware experiments and also occur in
previous, domain-specific applications. We show that the effect of hysteresis
is beneficial for the USF and we leverage it to derive the first recovery
guarantees in the context of our generalized USF model. Additionally, we show
how the proposed recovery can be directly generalized for the case of lower
sampling rates. Our theoretical work is corroborated by hardware experiments
that are based on a hysteresis enabled, modulo ADC testbed comprising
off-the-shelf electronic components. Thus, by capitalizing on a collaboration

HDR sampling allowing more flexible hardware implementations.

objectives from a theoretical perspective. We formalize the problem under the
probably approximately correct learning in Markov decision processes (PAC-MDP)
framework, a standard framework for measuring sample complexity in
reinforcement learning. In this formalization, we prove that the optimal policy
for any LTL formula is PAC-MDP-learnable if and only if the formula is in the
most limited class in the LTL hierarchy, consisting of formulas that are
decidable within a finite horizon. Practically, our result implies that it is
impossible for a reinforcement-learning algorithm to obtain a PAC-MDP guarantee
on the performance of its learned policy after finitely many interactions with
an unconstrained environment for LTL objectives that are not decidable within a

prior works tend to ""imagify"" video inputs, i.e., a handful of sparsely sampled

promising results, such simple approaches may lose temporal information that is

unlike previous studies that found pre-training tasks on video inputs (e.g.,
masked frame modeling) not very effective, we design a new pre-training task,
Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM), for better video modeling. Specifically,
the original video frame patches are ""tokenized"" into discrete visual tokens,
and the goal is to recover the original visual tokens based on the masked

effect, we apply feedback-based quantum optimal control. We first show how a
direct search can improve the initialization/readout process. In a second step,
we optimize microwave pulses for pulsed Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance

focus on robustness against errors in the control field amplitude. This feature
not only protects the protocols' sensitivity from drifts but also enlarges the
sensing volume. The resulting ODMR measurements produce sensitivities below
1$\mu$T\,Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ for an 83\% decrease in control power, increasing
the robustness by approximately one third. The optimized Ramsey measurements
produce sensitivities below 100\,nT\,Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ giving a two-fold

avatars from such egocentric images come with unique challenges due to the
top-down view and large distortions. We tackle these challenges by decomposing
the rendering process into several steps, including texture synthesis, pose
construction, and neural image translation. For texture synthesis, we propose
Ego-DPNet, a neural network that infers dense correspondences between the input
fisheye images and an underlying parametric body model, and to extract textures
from egocentric inputs. In addition, to encode dynamic appearances, our
approach also learns an implicit texture stack that captures detailed
appearance variation across poses and viewpoints. For correct pose generation,
we first estimate body pose from the egocentric view using a parametric model.
We then synthesize an external free-viewpoint pose image by projecting the
parametric model to the user-specified target viewpoint. We next combine the
target pose image and the textures into a combined feature image, which is
transformed into the output color image using a neural image translation
network. Experimental evaluations show that EgoRenderer is capable of
generating realistic free-viewpoint avatars of a person wearing an egocentric

Galileons cannot be part of the effective action of a single flat maximally

are being disintegrated by their host stars, spewing dust and debris pulled
from their surface into tails that trail and precede the exoplanet in its

attempted to peer through the dust cloud to put a constraint on the maximum
radii of these exoplanets. While previous studies have done this in the past by
selecting shallow transit events, we attempt a new statistical approach to
model the intrinsic astrophysical and photon noise distributions
simultaneously. We assume that the lightcurve flux distribution is distributed
as a convolution of a Gaussian photon noise component and a Raleigh
astrophysical component. The Raleigh curve has a finite flux maximum, which we
fit with a Hamiltonian Markov Chain. With these methods, a more accurate flux
maximum may be estimated, producing a more accurate and better final value for
the size of these exoplanets. To determine statistical significance, we used
the python package PyMC3 to find the posterior distribution for our data with
Gaussian, Rayleigh, and joint function curves and plotting it against our
collected flux.
  After completing this analysis, we were unable to constrain the radii of the
exoplanets, as the forward scattering by dust dominates over dust extinction.
However, this does mean that we were able better able to constrain the
astrophysical variability and its maximum with our analysis.

This paper makes initial attempts to apply this viewpoint to homogeneous

observe that many homogeneous metrics on low-dimensional Lie groups have
markedly different short-distance properties, but nearly identical distance
functions at longer distances. Using Nielsen's framework of complexity
geometry, we argue for the existence of a large universality class of
definitions of quantum complexity, each linearly related to the other, a much
finer-grained equivalence than typically considered in complexity theory. We
conjecture that at larger complexities, a new effective metric emerges that
describes a broad class of complexity geometries, insensitive to various

Vector-Quantized image models have overcome this limitation of image resolution

element-wise autoregressive sampling from the prior. By contrast, in this paper
we propose a novel discrete diffusion probabilistic model prior which enables
parallel prediction of Vector-Quantized tokens by using an unconstrained
Transformer architecture as the backbone. During training, tokens are randomly
masked in an order-agnostic manner and the Transformer learns to predict the
original tokens. This parallelism of Vector-Quantized token prediction in turn
facilitates unconditional generation of globally consistent high-resolution and
diverse imagery at a fraction of the computational expense. In this manner, we
can generate image resolutions exceeding that of the original training set
samples whilst additionally provisioning per-image likelihood estimates (in a
departure from generative adversarial approaches). Our approach achieves

  Completion","Accepted to NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) are two broadly
adopted metrics for measuring the similarity between two point sets. However,
CD is usually insensitive to mismatched local density, and EMD is usually
dominated by global distribution while overlooks the fidelity of detailed
structures. Besides, their unbounded value range induces a heavy influence from
the outliers. These defects prevent them from providing a consistent
evaluation. To tackle these problems, we propose a new similarity measure named
Density-aware Chamfer Distance (DCD). It is derived from CD and benefits from
several desirable properties: 1) it can detect disparity of density
distributions and is thus a more intensive measure of similarity compared to
CD; 2) it is stricter with detailed structures and significantly more
computationally efficient than EMD; 3) the bounded value range encourages a
more stable and reasonable evaluation over the whole test set. We adopt DCD to
evaluate the point cloud completion task, where experimental results show that
DCD pays attention to both the overall structure and local geometric details
and provides a more reliable evaluation even when CD and EMD contradict each
other. We can also use DCD as the training loss, which outperforms the same
model trained with CD loss on all three metrics. In addition, we propose a
novel point discriminator module that estimates the priority for another guided
down-sampling step, and it achieves noticeable improvements under DCD together
with competitive results for both CD and EMD. We hope our work could pave the
way for a more comprehensive and practical point cloud similarity evaluation.

super-resolution (VSR) pose non-trivial challenges in inference and training.
First, while long-term propagation leads to improved performance in cases of
mild degradations, severe in-the-wild degradations could be exaggerated through
propagation, impairing output quality. To balance the tradeoff between detail
synthesis and artifact suppression, we found an image pre-cleaning stage
indispensable to reduce noises and artifacts prior to propagation. Equipped
with a carefully designed cleaning module, our RealBasicVSR outperforms
existing methods in both quality and efficiency. Second, real-world VSR models
are often trained with diverse degradations to improve generalizability,
requiring increased batch size to produce a stable gradient. Inevitably, the
increased computational burden results in various problems, including 1)
speed-performance tradeoff and 2) batch-length tradeoff. To alleviate the first
tradeoff, we propose a stochastic degradation scheme that reduces up to 40\% of
training time without sacrificing performance. We then analyze different
training settings and suggest that employing longer sequences rather than
larger batches during training allows more effective uses of temporal
information, leading to more stable performance during inference. To facilitate
fair comparisons, we propose the new VideoLQ dataset, which contains a large
variety of real-world low-quality video sequences containing rich textures and

issues by exploiting spatial and temporal relationships. However, those works
ignore the fact that it is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions
(i.e., hypotheses) exist. To relieve this limitation, we propose a
Multi-Hypothesis Transformer (MHFormer) that learns spatio-temporal
representations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. In order to effectively
model multi-hypothesis dependencies and build strong relationships across
hypothesis features, the task is decomposed into three stages: (i) Generate
multiple initial hypothesis representations; (ii) Model self-hypothesis
communication, merge multiple hypotheses into a single converged representation
and then partition it into several diverged hypotheses; (iii) Learn
cross-hypothesis communication and aggregate the multi-hypothesis features to
synthesize the final 3D pose. Through the above processes, the final
representation is enhanced and the synthesized pose is much more accurate.
Extensive experiments show that MHFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on
two challenging datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Without bells and

initially farther-out birth locations. Current migration models, i.e
disc-migration (gas-dissipation driven) and eccentric-migration (tidal
evolution driven), fail to produce the occurrence rate and orbital properties
of HJs&WJs. Here we study the role of the thermal evolution and its coupling to
tidal evolution. We use the AMUSE, numerical environment, and MESA, planetary
evolution modeling, to model in detail the coupled internal and orbital
evolution of gas-giants during their eccentric-migration. In a companion paper,
we use a simple semi-analytic model, validated by our numerical model, and run
a population-synthesis study. We consider the initially inflated radii of
gas-giants (expected following their formation), as well study the effects of
the potential slowed contraction and even re-inflation of gas-giants (due to
tidal and radiative heating) on the eccentric-migration. Tidal forces that
drive eccentric-migration are highly sensitive to the planetary structure and
radius. Consequently, we find that this form of inflated eccentric-migration
operates on significantly (up to an order of magnitude) shorter timescales than
previously studied eccentric-migration models. Thereby, inflated
eccentric-migration gives rise to more rapid formation of HJs&WJs, higher
occurrence rates of WJs, and higher rates of tidal disruptions, compared with
previous eccentric migration models which consider constant ~Jupiter radii for
HJ&WJ progenitors. Coupled thermal-dynamical evolution of eccentric gas-giants
can therefore play a key-role in their evolution.

However, it is challenging to verify such interactions experimentally. Here we
describe two methods to characterize the $n$-local coupling of $n$ spins.
First, we analyze the variation of the transition energy of the static system
as a function of local spin fields. Standard measurement techniques are
employed to distinguish $n$-local interactions between up to five spins from
lower-order contributions in the presence of noise and spurious fields and
couplings. Second, we show a detection technique that relies on time dependent
driving of the coupling term. Generalizations to larger system sizes are
analyzed for both static and dynamic detection methods, and we find that the
dynamic method is asymptotically optimal when increasing the system size. The
proposed methods enable robust exploration of multi-spin interactions across a
broad range of both coupling strengths and qubit modalities.

their host stars at very short orbital periods ($P_{HJ}<10$ days;
$10<P_{WJ}<200$ days). HJs and a significant fraction of WJs are thought to
have migrated from an initially farther-out birth locations. While such
migration processes have been extensively studied, the thermal evolution of
gas-giants and its coupling to the the migration processes are usually
overlooked. In particular, gas-giants end their core-accretion phase with large
radii and then contract slowly to their final radii. Moreover, intensive
heating can slow the contraction at various evolutionary stages. The initial
inflated large radii lead to faster tidal migration due to the strong
dependence of tides on the radius. Here we explore this accelerated migration
channel, which we term inflated eccentric migration, using a semi-analytical
self-consistent modeling of the thermal-dynamical evolution of the migrating
gas-giants, later validated by our numerical model (see a companion paper,
paper II). We demonstrate our model for specific examples and carry a
population synthesis study. Our results provide a general picture of the
properties of the formed HJs\&WJs via inflated migration, and the dependence on
the initial parameters/distributions. We show that tidal migration of
gas-giants could occur far more rapidly then previously thought and lead to
accelerated destruction and formation of HJs and enhanced formation rate of
WJs. Accounting for the coupled thermal-dynamical evolution is therefore
critical to the understanding of HJs/WJs formation, evolution and final
properties of the population and play a key role in their migration process.

likelihood (Bayesian evidence) and solve its problematic large variance. The
marginal likelihood is a key component of Bayesian model selection since it is
required to evaluate model posterior probabilities; however, its computation is
challenging. The original harmonic mean estimator, first proposed in 1994 by
Newton and Raftery, involves computing the harmonic mean of the likelihood
given samples from the posterior. It was immediately realised that the original
estimator can fail catastrophically since its variance can become very large
and may not be finite. A number of variants of the harmonic mean estimator have
been proposed to address this issue although none have proven fully
satisfactory. We present the learnt harmonic mean estimator, a variant of the
original estimator that solves its large variance problem. This is achieved by
interpreting the harmonic mean estimator as importance sampling and introducing
a new target distribution. The new target distribution is learned to
approximate the optimal but inaccessible target, while minimising the variance
of the resulting estimator. Since the estimator requires samples of the
posterior only it is agnostic to the strategy used to generate posterior
samples. We validate the estimator on a variety of numerical experiments,
including a number of pathological examples where the original harmonic mean
estimator fails catastrophically. In all cases our learnt harmonic mean
estimator is shown to be highly accurate. The estimator is computationally
scalable and can be applied to problems of dimension $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ and
beyond. Code implementing the learnt harmonic mean estimator is made publicly

abundance analysis of 12 new giant stars with UVES spectra and 150 giants with

atmospheric parameters and iron abundances for all stars. When combined to
previous data, we obtain a grand total of 185 stars homogeneously analysed in
NGC 6388 from high-resolution spectroscopy. The average radial velocity of the
185 stars is 81.2+/-0.7, rms = 9.4 km/s. We obtain an average metallicity

through different phases. Once they reach the zero-age main sequence, their
global rotation rate decreases during the main sequence until at least the
solar age, approximately following the empirical Skumanich's law and enabling
gyrochronology. Older solar-type stars might then reach a point of transition
when they stop braking, according to recent results of asteroseismology.
Additionally, recent 3D numerical simulations of solar-type stars show that
different regimes of differential rotation can be characterized with the Rossby
number. In particular, anti-solar differential rotation (fast poles, slow
equator) may exist for high Rossby number (slow rotators). If this regime
occurs during the main sequence and, in general, for slow rotators, we may
consider how magnetic generation through the dynamo process might be impacted.
In particular, we consider whether slowly rotating stars are indeed subject to
magnetic cycles.
  We find that kinematic $\alpha$ $\Omega$ dynamos allow for the presence of
magnetic cycles and global polarity reversals for both rotation regimes, but
only if the $\alpha$-effect is saddled on the tachocline. If it is distributed
in the convection zone, solar-type cases still possess a cycle and anti-solar
cases do not. Conversely, we have not found any possibility for sustaining a
magnetic cycle with the traditional Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamos in
the anti-solar differential rotation regime due to flux addition. Graphic
interpretations are proposed in order to illustrate these cases. However, we
find that hybrid models containing both prescriptions can still sustain local
polarity reversals at some latitudes.
  We conclude that stars in the anti-solar differential rotation regime can
sustain magnetic cycles only for very specific dynamo processes.

constrain key properties of neutrinos, such as their mass. However, these
inferences are typically dependent on assumptions about the cosmological model,
and in particular upon the distribution function of neutrinos in the early
Universe. In this paper, we aim to assess the full extent to which CMB
experiments are sensitive to the shape of the neutrino distribution. We
demonstrate that Planck and CMB-S4-like experiments have no prospects for
detecting particular features in the distribution function. Consequently, we
take a general approach and marginalise completely over the form of the
neutrino distribution to derive constraints on the relativistic and
non-relativistic neutrino energy densities, characterised by $N_\mathrm{eff} =
3.0 \pm 0.4$ and $\rho_{\nu,0}^{\rm NR} < 14 \, \mathrm{eV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
at 95% CL, respectively. The fact that these are the only neutrino properties
that CMB data can constrain has important implications for neutrino mass limits
from cosmology. Specifically, in contrast to the $\Lambda$CDM case where CMB
and BAO data tightly constrain the sum of neutrinos masses to be $\sum m_\nu <
0.12 \, \mathrm{eV}$, we explicitly show that neutrino masses as large as $\sum
m_\nu \sim 3 \, \mathrm{eV}$ are perfectly consistent with this data.
Importantly, for this to be the case, the neutrino number density should be
suitably small such that the bound on $\rho_{\nu,0}^\mathrm{NR} = \sum m_\nu
n_{\nu,0}$ is still satisfied. We conclude by giving an outlook on the
opportunities that may arise from other complementary experimental probes, such
as galaxy surveys, neutrino mass experiments and facilities designed to
directly detect the cosmic neutrino background.

accretion. However, these effects have not previously been included together in
the context of clouds falling through the Milky Way's gravitational potential.
We explore this by simulating an initially stationary cloud falling through the
hot hydrostatic corona towards the disc. This represents a HVC that has
condensed out of the corona. We include the magnetic field in the corona to
examine its effect on accretion of the HVC and its associated cold gas.
Remnants of the original cloud survive in all cases, although a strong magnetic
field causes it to split into several fragments. We find that mixing of cold
and hot gas leads to cooling of coronal gas and an overall growth with time in
cold gas mass, despite the low metallicity of the cloud and corona. The role of
the magnetic field is to (moderately to severely) suppress the mixing and
subsequent cooling, which in turn leads to less accretion compared to when the
field is absent. A stronger field leads to less suppression of condensation
because it enhances Rayleigh-Taylor instability. However, magnetic tension in a
stronger field substantially decelerates condensed cloudlets. These have
velocities typically a factor 3-8 below the velocity of the main cloud remnants
by the end of the simulation. Some of these cloudlets likely disperse before
reaching the disc.

the close encounter of a star with a supermassive black hole is the principal
factor in determining the rate of return of debris to the black hole, and thus
in determining the properties of the resulting lightcurves from such events. We
present simulations of tidal disruption events for a range of $\beta\equiv
r_{\rm t}/r_{\rm p}$ where $r_{\rm p}$ is the pericentre distance and $r_{\rm
t}$ the tidal radius. We perform these simulations at different spatial
resolutions to determine the numerical convergence of our models. We compare
simulations in which the heating due to shocks is included or excluded from the
dynamics. For $\beta \lesssim 8$ the simulation results are well-converged at
sufficiently moderate-to-high spatial resolution, while for $\beta \gtrsim 8$
the breadth of the energy distribution can be grossly exaggerated by
insufficient spatial resolution. We find that shock heating plays a
non-negligible role only for $\beta \gtrsim 4$, and that typically the effect
of shock heating is mild. We show that self-gravity can modify the energy
distribution over time after the debris has receded to large distances for all
$\beta$. Primarily, our results show that across a range of impact parameters,

the energy spread imparted to the bulk of the debris is closely matched to the

are weak (with Mach numbers $\sim 1$) for all $\beta$, and that they reach the
center of the star prior to the time of maximum adiabatic compression for
$\beta \gtrsim 10$. The maximum density and temperature reached during the TDE
follow much shallower relations with $\beta$ than the previously predicted
$\rho_{\rm max} \propto \beta^3$ and $T_{\rm max} \propto \beta^2$ scalings.
Below $\beta \simeq 10$, this shallower dependence occurs because the pressure
gradient is dynamically significant before the pressure is comparable to the
ram pressure of the freefalling gas, while above $\beta \simeq 10$ we find that
shocks prematurely halt the compression and yield the scalings $\rho_{\rm max}

demonstrate that, in the Newtonian limit, the compression experienced by the
star is completely independent of the mass of the black hole. We discuss our
results in the context of existing (affine) models, polytropic

important when the pericenter of the star nears the direct capture radius, at

halo properties are better reproduced when assuming a gradual stripping model
for the removal of cold gas and stars from satellites, compared to an
instantaneous stripping model. The slope of the stellar mass -- metallicity
relation for MWA stellar haloes is in good agreement with that observed in the
local Universe. This extends the good agreement between L-Galaxies 2020 and
metallicity observations from the gas and stars inside galaxies to those
outside. Halo stars contribute on average only $\sim{}0.1$ per cent of the
total circumgalactic medium (CGM) enrichment by $z=0$ in MWAs, ejecting
predominantly carbon produced by AGB stars. Around a quarter of MWAs have a
single `significant progenitor' with a mean mass of
$\sim{}2.3\times{}10^{9}M_{\odot}$, similar to that measured for Gaia
Enceladus. For galaxy clusters, L-Galaxies 2020 shows good correspondence with
observations of stellar halo mass fractions, but slightly over-predicts stellar
masses. Assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the stellar halo mass
distribution provides the best agreement. On average, the intracluster stellar
component (ICS) is responsible for 5.4 per cent of the total intracluster
medium (ICM) iron enrichment, exceeding the contribution from the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) by $z=0$. We find that considering gradual stripping of

  Applications of generative (quantum) models are multifaceted. The trained

generative quantum machine learning can be applied to efficient, approximate

  The aim of this doctoral thesis is to develop new generative quantum machine

the central half parsec. The recent discovery of a hypervelocity star S5-HVS1,
ejected by Sgr A* five Myr ago with a velocity vector consistent with the disc,
suggests that this event also produced binary star disruptions. The initial
stellar disc has to be rather eccentric for this to occur. Such eccentric disks
can form from the tidal disruptions of molecular clouds. Here we perform
simulations of such disruptions, focusing on gas clouds on rather radial
initial orbits. As a result, stars formed in our simulations are on very
eccentric orbits ($\bar{e}\sim 0.6$) with a lopsided configuration. For some
clouds counter-rotating stars are formed. As in previous work, we find that
such discs undergo a secular gravitational instability that leads to a moderate
number of particles obtaining eccentricities of 0.99 or greater, sufficient for
stellar binary disruption. We also reproduce the mean eccentricity of the young
disk in the Galactic centre, though not the observed surface density profile.

of this system is well known. However, nature is usually not deterministic. All
ecosystems experience some type of random environmental fluctuations. We
incorporate these into a natural framework as follows. Suppose the environment
has two possible states. In each of the two environmental states the dynamics
is governed by a system of Lotka-Volterra ODE. The randomness comes from
spending an exponential amount of time in each environmental state and then
switching to the other one. We show how this random switching can create very
interesting phenomena. In some cases the randomness can facilitate the
coexistence of the three species even though coexistence is impossible in each
of the two environmental states. In other cases, even though there is
coexistence in each of the two environmental states, switching can lead to the
loss of one or more species. We look into how predators and environmental
fluctuations can mediate coexistence among competing species.

synchronization we introduce the interlayer order parameter, and determine the
interlayer order parameter first in the static case as a function of the number
of interlayer links observing a monotonically smooth transition to the fully
synchronized state in the case that all nodes in layer 1 are connected to their
corresponding nodes in layer 2. In the second step, we analyze the
synchronization behavior of the multiplex network for a time-varying interlayer

state of high synchrony for a significantly lower number of interlayer
connections. These abrupt transitions, even if not to full synchrony, appear
only because of the periodic change of the interlayer topology, fostering the
transition to occur for a significantly lower number of interlayer connections.
We interpret this phenomenon as the shrinking, and ultimately, the nearly
disappearance of the basin of attraction of a desynchronized network state. A
comprehensive statistical analysis of this phenomenon is needed to interpret
the results properly.

In particular, we understand that this is due to a feature, still uncovered at

found to be fully Lorentz covariant. The result we obtain extends naturally to
the whole $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra of transformations, showing the close

transport. For the case of two-dimensional (2D) electrons in the magnetic

094124, (2021)], we systematically study the mechanism of polariton relaxation
for liquid CO2 under a weak external pumping. Classical cavity molecular
dynamics (CavMD) simulations show that polariton relaxation results from the
combined effects of (i) cavity loss through the photonic component and (ii)
dephasing of the bright-mode component to vibrational dark modes as mediated by
intermolecular interactions. The latter polaritonic dephasing rate is
proportional to the product of the weight of the bright mode in the polariton
wave function and the spectral overlap between the polariton and dark modes.
Both these factors are sensitive to parameters such as the Rabi splitting and
cavity mode detuning. Compared to a Fermi's golden rule calculation based on a
tight-binding harmonic model, CavMD yields a similar parameter dependence for
the upper polariton relaxation lifetime but sometimes a modest disagreement for
the lower polariton. We suggest that this disagreement results from
polariton-enhanced molecular nonlinear absorption due to molecular
anharmonicity, which is not included in our analytical model. We also summarize
recent progress on probing nonreactive VSC dynamics with CavMD.

determine an inclusive rate in the $1+1$ dimensional O(3) non-linear

{hadrons}$. The Euclidean two-point correlation function of the conserved
current $j$ is computed using Monte Carlo lattice field theory simulations for
a variety of spacetime volumes and lattice spacings. The spectral density of
this correlator is related to the inclusive rate for $j \rightarrow {\rm X}$ in
which all final states produced by the external current are summed. The
ill-posed inverse problem of determining the spectral density from the
correlation function is made tractable through the determination of smeared
spectral densities in which the desired density is convolved with a set of
known smearing kernels of finite width $\epsilon$. The smooth energy dependence
of the underlying spectral density enables a controlled $\epsilon \to 0$
extrapolation in the inelastic region, yielding the real-time inclusive rate
without reference to individual finite-volume energies or matrix elements.
Systematic uncertainties due cutoff effects and residual finite-volume effects
are estimated and taken into account in the final error budget. After taking
the continuum limit, the results are consistent with the known analytic rate to
within the combined statistical and systematic errors. Above energies where
20-particle states contribute, the overall precision is sufficient to discern
the four-particle contribution to the spectral density.

mathematical modeling requires the application of discrete and continuous
fractional calculus. Most of these systems are nonlinear and demonstrate
regular and chaotic behavior, different from the behavior of memoryless
systems. Finding periodic solutions is essential for understanding the regular
and chaotic behavior of nonlinear systems. Fractional systems do not have
periodic solutions except fixed points. Instead, they have asymptotically
periodic solutions which, in the case of stable regular behavior, converge to
the periodic sinks (similar to regular dissipative systems) and, in the case of
unstable/chaotic behavior, act as repellers. In one of his recent papers, the
first author derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically
periodic points for a wide class of discrete maps with memory. All fractional
and fractional difference maps of the orders 0 < \alpha < 1 belong to this
class. In this paper, we derive the equations that allow calculations of the
coordinates of the asymptotically periodic points for a wider class of maps
which include fractional and fractional difference maps of the arbitrary
positive orders \alpha > 0. The maps are defined as convolutions of a
generating function -G_K(x), which may be the same as in a corresponding
regular map x_{n+1} = -G_K(x_n)+x_n, with a kernel U_{\alpha}(k), which defines
the type of a map. In the case of fractional maps, it is U{\alpha}(k) =
k^{\alpha}, and it is U{\alpha}(k) = k^{(\alpha)}, the falling factorial
function, in the case of fractional difference maps. In this paper, we define
the space of kernel functions that allow calculations of the periodic points of
the corresponding maps with memory. We also prove that in fractional maps of

Josephson junction (JJ) based rf sources benefit from small device sizes, low
power dissipation, intrinsic calibration, superior reproducibility, and
insensitivity to ambient fluctuations. Previous experiments to co-locate qubits
and JJ-based control electronics resulted in quasiparticle poisoning of the
qubit; degrading the qubit's coherence and lifetime. In this paper, we
digitally control a 0.01~K transmon qubit with pulses from a Josephson pulse
generator (JPG) located at the 3~K stage of a dilution refrigerator. We
directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$, and thermal
occupation $P_{th}$ when the qubit is controlled by the JPG circuit versus the
TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations on $\pm
0.5~\mu$s and $\pm 2~\mu$s for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, respectively, and agreement
to within the 1\% error for $P_{th}$. Additionally, we perform randomized
benchmarking to measure an average JPG gate error of $2.1 \times 10^{-2}$. In
combination with a small device size ($<25$~mm$^2$) and low on-chip power
dissipation ($\ll 100~\mu$W), these results are an important step towards
demonstrating the viability of using JJ-based control electronics located at

a pre-trained source model can be easily adapted to. In this work, we propose
Gaussian Bhattacharyya Coefficient (GBC), a novel method for quantifying

embed all target images in the feature space defined by the source model, and
represent them with per-class Gaussians. Then, we estimate their pairwise class
separability using the Bhattacharyya coefficient, yielding a simple and
effective measure of how well the source model transfers to the target task. We
evaluate GBC on image classification tasks in the context of dataset and

complex semantic segmentation transferability estimation task. We demonstrate
that GBC outperforms state-of-the-art transferability metrics on most

performance of top methods for dataset transferability in image classification,
and performs best on architecture selection problems for image classification.

with the TITAN multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer provide a
more than threefold improvement over the current literature mass uncertainty of

precision of the $^{61}$Ga mass has important implications for the
astrophysical rp process, as it constrains essential reaction Q-values near the
$^{60}$Zn waiting point. Based on calculations with a one-zone model, we
demonstrate the impact of the improved mass data on prediction uncertainties of
X-ray burst models. The first-time measurement of the $^{60}$Ga ground-state
mass establishes the proton-bound nature of this nuclide; thus, constraining
the location of the proton drip line along this isotopic chain. Including the
measured mass of $^{60}$Ga further enables us to extend the evaluated $T=1$

  Learning","15 pages, 4 tables, 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class-imbalance is a common problem in machine learning practice. Typical
Imbalanced Learning (IL) methods balance the data via intuitive class-wise
resampling or reweighting. However, previous studies suggest that beyond
class-imbalance, intrinsic data difficulty factors like overlapping, noise, and
small disjuncts also play critical roles. To handle them, many solutions have
been proposed (e.g., noise removal, borderline sampling, hard example mining)
but are still confined to a specific factor and cannot generalize to broader
scenarios, which raises an interesting question: how to handle both
class-agnostic difficulties and the class-imbalance in a unified way? To answer
this, we consider both class-imbalance and its orthogonal: intra-class
imbalance, i.e., the imbalanced distribution over easy and hard samples. Such
distribution naturally reflects the complex influence of class-agnostic
intrinsic data difficulties thus providing a new unified view for identifying
and handling these factors during learning. From this perspective, we discuss
the pros and cons of existing IL solutions and further propose new balancing
techniques for more robust and efficient IL. Finally, we wrap up all solutions
into a generic ensemble IL framework, namely DuBE (Duple-Balanced Ensemble). It
features explicit and efficient inter-\&intra-class balancing as well as easy
extension with standardized APIs. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of DuBE. Code, examples, and documentation are available at

likely to make unreliable results depending on the density or diversity of the

referred to as out-of-category detection, which aims to distinguish the
documents according to their semantic relevance to the inlier (or target)
categories by using the category names as weak supervision. In practice, this
task can be widely applicable in that it can flexibly designate the scope of
target categories according to users' interests while requiring only the
target-category names as minimum guidance. In this paper, we present an
out-of-category detection framework, which effectively measures how confidently
each document belongs to one of the target categories based on its

(i) it first generates the pseudo-category label of all unlabeled documents by
exploiting the word-document similarity encoded in a text embedding space, then
(ii) it trains a neural classifier by using the pseudo-labels in order to
compute the confidence from its target-category prediction. The experiments on

reducing model overconfidence on OOD data. Our method is motivated by novel

distinctive signature patterns for OOD distributions. Our method can generalize
effectively to different network architectures and different OOD detection

tax code featuring two key elements: tax depreciation policy and the
distinction between c-corporations and pass-through businesses. In the model,
the stimulative effect of a tax rate cut on c-corporations is smaller when tax
depreciation policy is accelerated, and is further diluted in the aggregate by
the presence of pass-through entities. Because of a highly accelerated tax
depreciation policy and a large share of pass-through activity in 2017, the
model predicts small stimulus, large payouts to shareholders, and a dramatic
loss of corporate tax revenues following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA-17).
These predictions are consistent with novel micro- and macro-level evidence
from professional forecasters and sectoral tax returns. At the same time,
because of less-accelerated tax depreciation and a lower pass-through share in
the early 1960s, the model predicts sizable stimulus in response to the
Kennedy's corporate tax cuts - also supported by the data. The model-implied
corporate tax multipliers for Trump's TCJA-17 and Kennedy's tax cuts are +0.6

models can be trained to automatically detect and classify animals within

train these models is reliant upon having enough high-quality training data.
What happens when the animal is rare or the data sets are non-existent? This
research proposes an approach of using images of rare animals in captivity
(focusing on the Scottish wildcat) to generate the training dataset. We explore
the challenges associated with generalising a model trained on captivity data
when applied to data collected in the wild. The research is contextualised by
the needs of ecologists in planning/engineering. Following precedents from
other research, this project establishes an ensemble for object detection,
image segmentation and image classification models which are then tested using
different image manipulation and class structuring techniques to encourage
model generalisation. The research concludes, in the context of Scottish
wildcat, that models trained on captivity imagery cannot be generalised to wild
camera trap imagery using existing techniques. However, final model
performances based on a two-class model Wildcat vs Not Wildcat achieved an
overall accuracy score of 81.6% and Wildcat accuracy score of 54.8% on a test
set in which only 1% of images contained a wildcat. This suggests using
captivity images is feasible with further research. This is the first research
which attempts to generate a training set based on captivity data and the first
to explore the development of such models in the context of ecologists in

unvaccinated by, e.g. targeted NPIs, causes a steeper decrease in the effective
reproduction number $\mathcal{R}$ than decreasing the transmissibility of
vaccinated individuals, potentially leading to temporary epidemic control.
Furthermore, reducing contacts between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals
serves to decrease $\mathcal R$ in a similar manner as increasing vaccine
uptake. Taken together, our results contribute to the public discourse
regarding policy changes in pandemic response and highlight the importance of
combined measures, such as vaccination campaigns and contact reduction, to
achieve epidemic control and preventing an overload of public health systems.

pacts of modern technology-driven democracies. Unfortunately, it is under
continuous attack by overreaching or outright oppressive governments, including
some of the world's oldest democracies. Increasingly-intrusive anti-encryption
laws severely limit the ability of standard encryption to protect privacy. New
defense mechanisms are needed.
  Plausible deniability (PD) is a powerful property, enabling users to hide the
existence of sensitive information in a system under direct inspection by
adversaries. Popular encrypted storage systems such as TrueCrypt and other
research efforts have attempted to also provide plausible deniability.
Unfortunately, these efforts have often operated under less well-defined
assumptions and adversarial models. Careful analyses often uncover not only
high overheads but also outright security compromise. Further, our
understanding of adversaries, the underlying storage technologies, as well as
the available plausible deniable solutions have evolved dramatically in the
past two decades. The main goal of this work is to systematize this knowledge.
It aims to:
  - identify key PD properties, requirements, and approaches;
  - present a direly-needed unified framework for evaluating security and
performance;
  - explore the challenges arising from the critical interplay between PD and
modern system layered stacks;
  - propose a new ""trace-oriented"" PD paradigm, able to decouple security
guarantees from the underlying systems and thus ensure a higher level of
flexibility and security independent of the technology stack.
  This work is meant also as a trusted guide for system and security
practitioners around the major challenges in understanding, designing, and

We identify this subgroup to be the Iwahori subgroup in the supersingular case,

application, we relate the action of parahoric subgroups to the action of the
inertia group of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_p)$, and we
prove that if an irreducible Banach space representation $\Pi$ of

Dospinescu. We make the simplifying assumption that $p > 3$ and that all our

exhibit a strong, broad PL peak centered around ~920 nm (1.35 eV), suggesting
their semiconducting behavior. Such nanoribbons revealed a strong TERS response
under 785-nm laser excitation, allowing for their nanoscale spectroscopic
imaging. Nanoribbons with a smaller selenium deficiency of ~0.15 (Se/Ta=2.85)
did not show any PL or TERS response. The confocal Raman spectra of these
samples agree with the previously-reported spectra of metallic TaSe3. The
differences in the optical response of the nanoribbons examined in this study
suggest that even small variations in Se content can induce changes in
electronic structure, causing samples to exhibit either metallic or
semiconducting character. The temperature-dependent electrical measurements of
devices fabricated with both types of materials corroborate these observations.
The density-functional-theory calculations revealed that incorporation of an
oxygen atom in a Se vacancy can result in band gap opening and thus enable the
transition from a metal to a semiconductor. However, the predicted bandgap is
substantially smaller than that derived from PL data. These results indicate
that the properties of van der Waals materials can vary significantly depending
on stoichiometry, defect types and concentration, and possibly environmental
and substrate effects. In view of this finding, local probing of nanoribbon
properties with TERS becomes essential to understanding such low-dimensional

thermoelectric applications, to explore the effects of compositions, interface

conductivity, and improvement of efficiency. Most studies assumed that their
electronic properties remain unaffected compared to their bulk counterparts.
However, recent studies demonstrated that electronic properties of silicon
(Si)/germanium (Ge) superlattices show significant variations depending on
compositions and growth substrates. These studies used a constant relaxation
time approximation, and ignored the effects of electron scattering processes.
Here, we consider electron scattering with phonons and ionized impurities, and
report first-principles calculations of electronic transport properties
including the scattering rates. We investigate two classes of Si/Ge
superlattices: superlattices with varied compositions grown on identical
substrates and with identical compositions but grown on different substrates.
We illustrate the relationship between the energy bands of the superlattices
and the electron-phonon relaxation times. We model the electron-ionized
impurity interaction potentials by accounting for the in-plane and the
cross-plane structural anisotropy. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of
electron-phonon and electron-impurity scattering processes can lead to
~1.56-fold improved peak power-factors, compared to that of bulk Si. We observe
that superlattices can also display dramatically reduced power-factors for
specific lattice strain environments. Such reduction could cancel out
thermoelectric efficiency improvements due to reduced thermal conductivities.
Our study provides insight to predict variation of electronic properties due to
changes in lattice strain environments, essential for designing superlattices

of only a single spectral broadening stage which neither requires vacuum parts

multi-plate continuum and the multi-pass cell spectral broadening techniques.
Their combination leads to significantly higher spectral broadening factors in
bulk material than what has been reported from either method alone. Moreover,
our approach efficiently suppresses adverse features of single-pass bulk
spectral broadening. We use a burst mode Yb:YAG laser emitting pulses with 80
MW peak power that are enhanced to more than 1 GW after post-compression. With
only 0.19 % rms pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations, the technique exhibits
excellent stability. Furthermore, we have measured state-of-the-art
spectral-spatial homogeneity and good beam quality of M$^2 = 1.2$ up to a
spectral broadening factor of 30. Due to the method's simplicity, compactness

show that the complex of differential forms and integral forms are
quasi-isomorphic and their cohomology computes the de Rham cohomology of the

introduced and put to the good use to prove the superanalog of Stokes' theorem

from $\approx$ 3.5 to 8. We study the detectability of the PS in a line
intensity mapping (LIM) survey with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope
(FYST).
  We created mock [CII] tomographic scans in redshift bins at $z\approx$ 3.7,
4.3, 5.8, and 7.4 using the Illustris TNG300-1 $\Lambda$CDM simulation and
adopting a relation between the star formation activity and the [CII]
luminosity ($L_{[CII]}$) of galaxies. A star formation rate (SFR) was assigned
to a dark matter halo in the Illustris simulation in two ways: (i) we adopted
the SFR computed in the Illustris simulation and, (ii) we matched the abundance
of the halos with the SFR traced by the observed dust-corrected ultraviolet
luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies. The $L_{[CII]}$ is related to
the SFR from a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, from a hydrodynamical
simulation of a high-redshift galaxy, or from a high-redshift [CII] galaxy
survey. The [CII] intensity PS was computed from mock tomographic scans to
assess its detectability with the anticipated observational capability of the
FYST.
  The amplitude of the predicted [CII] intensity power spectrum varies by more
than a factor of 10, depending on the choice of the halo-to-galaxy SFR and the
SFR-to-$L_{[CII]}$ relations. In the planned $4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}$ FYST
LIM survey, we expect a detection of the [CII] PS up to $z \approx$ 5.8, and
potentially even up to $z \approx $ 7.4. The design of the envisioned FYST LIM
survey enables a PS measurement not only in small (<10 Mpc) shot
noise-dominated scales, but also in large (>50 Mpc) clustering-dominated scales
making it the first LIM experiment that will place constraints on the
SFR-to-$L_{[CII]}$ and the halo-to-galaxy SFR relations simultaneously.

  packings",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In amorphous solids subject to shear or thermal excitation, so-called
structural indicators have been developed that predict locations of future
plasticity or particle rearrangements. An open question is whether similar
tools can be used in dense active materials, but a challenge is that under most
circumstances, active systems do not possess well-defined solid reference
configurations. We develop a computational model for a dense active crowd
attracted to a point of interest, which does permit a mechanically stable
reference state in the limit of infinitely persistent motion. Previous work on
a similar system suggested that the collective motion of crowds could be
predicted by inverting a matrix of time-averaged two-particle correlation
functions. Seeking a first-principles understanding of this result, we
demonstrate that this active matter system maps directly onto a granular
packing in the presence of an external potential, and extend an existing
structural indicator based on linear response to predict plasticity in the
presence of noisy dynamics. We find that the strong pressure gradient
necessitated by the directed activity, as well as a self-generated free
boundary, strongly impact the linear response of the system. In low-pressure
regions the linear-response-based indicator is predictive, but it does not work
well in the high-pressure interior of our active packings. Our findings
motivate and inform future work that could better formulate structure-dynamics
predictions in systems with strong pressure gradients.

with parking spaces $1,2,\ldots,n$ that appear in order. Each car $C_i$ has a
parking preference $\alpha_i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The cars appear in order,
if their preferred parking spot is not taken, they take it, if the parking spot
is taken, they move forward until they find an empty spot. If they do not find
an empty spot, they do not park. An $n$-tuple $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots,
\alpha_n)$ is said to be a parking function, if this list of preferences allows
every car to park under this algorithm. For an integer $k$, we say that an
$n$-tuple is a $k$-Naples parking function if the cars can park with the
modified algorithm, where park $C_i$ backs up $k$-spaces (one by one) if their
spot is taken before trying to find a parking spot in front of them. We
introduce randomness to this problem in two ways: 1) For the original parking
function definition, for each car $C_i$ that has their preference taken, we
decide with probability $p$ whether $C_i$ moves forwards or backwards when
their preferred spot is taken; 2) For the $k$-Naples definition, for each car

$C_i$ backs up $k$ spaces or not before moving forward. In each of these
models, for an $n$-tuple $\alpha\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}^n$, there is now a
probability that the model ends in all cars parking or not. For each of these
random models, we find a formula for the expected value. Furthermore, for the
second random model, in the case $k =1$, $p=1/2$, we prove that for any $1\le

global wireless connectivity. Traditionally, satellite networks are modeled by
placing satellites on a grid of multiple circular orbit geometries. Such a
network model, however, requires intricate system-level simulations to evaluate
coverage performance, and analytical understanding of the satellite network is
limited. Continuing the success of stochastic geometry in a tractable analysis
for terrestrial networks, in this paper, we develop novel models that are
tractable for the coverage analysis of satellite networks using stochastic
geometry. By modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point
processes on the surfaces of concentric spheres, we characterize analytical
expressions for the coverage probability of a typical downlink user as a
function of relevant parameters, including path-loss exponent, satellite
height, density, and Nakagami fading parameter. Then, we also derive a tight
lower bound of the coverage probability in tractable expression while keeping
full generality. Leveraging the derived expression, we identify the optimal
density of satellites in terms of the height and the path-loss exponent. Our
key finding is that the optimal average number of satellites decreases
logarithmically with the satellite height to maximize the coverage performance.
Simulation results verify the exactness of the derived expressions.

first-principles methods to simulate the cold pressure properties of
strongly-correlated materials. However, the applicability of DFT+$U$ at
ultra-high pressure is not sufficiently studied, especially in the widely-used
augmented schemes [such as projector augmented wave (PAW) and linearized
augmented plane wave (LAPW)]. This work has systematically investigated the
performance of DFT+$U$ in PAW and LAPW at the pressure up to several hundred
GPa for the lanthanide metals, which is a typical strongly-correlated series.
We found DFT+$U$ simulation in PAW exhibits an unphysical underestimating of
force at high pressure. By delicate analysis and comparison with
local-orbital-independent hybrid functional results, we have demonstrated that
this unphysical behavior is related to a normalization problem on the local
density matrix caused by the overlap of local orbitals in PAW under high
pressure. Additionally, we observed a slight softening of force in DFT+$U$ in
heavy lanthanides (Tm, Yb and Lu) at high pressure comparing with the DFT
results without the influence of local orbital overlap, and it might be related
to the enhancement of bonding effect in correlation correction methods at high
pressure. Our work reveals the underestimating of high pressure in DFT+$U$
simulation, analyses two sources of this unusual behavior and proposes their

the filamentary cloud L1495 in Taurus show that the large-scale magnetic field
is approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the cloud. We use the HAWC+
polarimeter on SOFIA to probe the complex magnetic field in the B211 part of
the cloud. Our results reveal a dispersion of polarization angles of
$36^\circ$, about five times that measured on a larger scale by Planck.
Applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method with velocity information
obtained from IRAM 30m C$^{18}$O(1-0) observations, we find two distinct
sub-regions with magnetic field strengths differing by more than a factor 3.
The quieter sub-region is magnetically critical and sub-Alfv\'enic; the field
is comparable to the average field measured in molecular clumps based on Zeeman
observations. The more chaotic, super-Alfv\'enic sub-region shows at least
three velocity components, indicating interaction among multiple substructures.
Its field is much less than the average Zeeman field in molecular clumps,
suggesting that the DCF value of the field there may be an underestimate.
Numerical simulation of filamentary cloud formation shows that filamentary
substructures can strongly perturb the magnetic field. DCF and true field
values in the simulation are compared. Pre-stellar cores are observed in B211
and are seen in our simulation. The appendices give a derivation of the
standard DCF method that allows for a dispersion in polarization angles that is
not small, present an alternate derivation of the structure function version of
the DCF method, and treat fragmentation of filaments.

the evolution of size-dependent grain porosity and grain size distribution over
the entire history of galaxy evolution. We include stellar dust production,
supernova dust destruction, shattering, coagulation, and accretion. Coagulation
is {assumed to be} the source of grain porosity. We use a one-zone model with a
constant dense gas fraction ($\eta_\mathrm{dense}$), which regulates the
balance between shattering and coagulation. We find that porosity develops
after small grains are sufficiently created by the interplay between shattering
and accretion (at age $t\sim 1$ Gyr for star formation time-scale
$\tau_\mathrm{SF}=5$ Gyr) and are coagulated. The filling factor drops down to
0.3 at grain radii $\sim 0.03~\mu$m for $\eta_\mathrm{dense}=0.5$. The grains
are more porous for smaller $\eta_\mathrm{dense}$ because small grains, from
which porous coagulated grains form, are more abundant. We also calculate the
extinction curves based on the above results. The porosity steepens the
extinction curve significantly for silicate, but not much for amorphous carbon.
The porosity also increases the collisional cross-sections and produces
slightly more large grains through the enhanced coagulation; however, the
extinction curve does not necessarily become flatter because of the steepening
effect by porosity. We also discuss the implication of our results for the
Milky Way extinction curve.

orthonormalized basis splines (B-splines) in independent input random

subspaces, each spanned by a reduced set of such orthonormal splines, results
in SDD. Exploiting the modulus of smoothness, the SDD approximation is shown to
converge in mean-square to the correct limit. The computational complexity of
the SDD method is polynomial, as opposed to exponential, thus alleviating the

of those transformations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for example,
are equivariant to image translation, a transformation that can be easily
modelled (by shifting the pixels vertically or horizontally). Other
transformations, such as out-of-plane rotations, do not admit a simple analytic
model. We propose an auto-encoder architecture whose embedding obeys an
arbitrary set of equivariance relations simultaneously, such as translation,
rotation, colour changes, and many others. This means that it can take an input
image, and produce versions transformed by a given amount that were not
observed before (e.g. a different point of view of the same object, or a colour
variation). Despite extending to many (even non-geometric) transformations, our
model reduces exactly to a CNN in the special case of translation-equivariance.
Equivariances are important for the interpretability and robustness of deep
networks, and we demonstrate results of successful re-rendering of transformed
versions of input images on several synthetic and real datasets, as well as
results on object pose estimation.

the individual slip systems is represented by vector fields with a unique
dislocation line direction at each point in space. The evolution of these
density fields is governed by a set of transport equations coupled with crystal
mechanics. Such a detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale
plasticity simulations based on dislocation properties. Here, a computational
approach based on streamline construction is proposed to obtain the
characteristics of dislocation substructures generated by CDD. Streamlines are
obtained by travelling along the tangent of the vector density and velocity
fields of the dislocation system, and can be used to construct the dislocation
lines and their paths in the deformed crystal in 3D. As explained in the text,
the streamlines are computed by solving a set of partial differential
equations. Here we use this approach to extract microstructure parameters from
the CDD simulations that are relevant to substructure-sensitive crystal
plasticity models. These parameters include the average mean free path and
mobile dislocation segment length, as well as the dislocation wall volume
fraction, and the corresponding distributions. The results show that both the
mobile dislocation segment length and dislocation mean free path decrease with
the applied strain, which is consistent with the models used in the literature,

near such a fixed point, by identifying an appropriate linear space to evaluate
the action of the transfer operator, we show that there is a strictly positive

following the Dirac-von Neumann formalism of quantum mechanics. In this
formalism, the state postulate is the same as in the Dirac-von Neumann
formalism, but the observable postulate should be changed to include
para-Hermitian operators (spectral operators of scalar type with real spectrum)
representing observable, as such both the measurement postulate and the
evolution postulate must be modified accordingly. This is based on a Stone type
theorem as proved here that the dynamics of non-Hermitian quantum systems is
governed by para-unitary time evolution. The Born formula on the expectation of
an observable at a certain state is given in the non-Hermitian setting, which
is proved to be equal to the usual Born rule for every Hermitian observable,
but for a non-Hermitian one it may depend on measurement via the choice of a
metric operator associated with the non-Hermitian observable under measurement.
Our formalism is nether Hamiltonian-dependent nor basis-dependent, but can
recover both PT-symmetric and biorthogonal quantum mechanics, and it reduces to
the Dirac-von Neumann formalism of quantum mechanics in the Hermitian setting.
As application, we study observable-geometric phases for non-Hermitian quantum
systems.

furnace combustion reaction, diagnosing energy loss due to incomplete
combustion and ensuring safe production. The accuracy of time of flight (TOF)
estimation of an acoustic pyrometry directly affects the authenticity of
furnace temperature measurement. In this paper presented is a novel TOF (i.e.
time delay) estimation algorithm based on digital lock-in filtering (DLF)
algorithm. In this research, the time-frequency relationship between the first
harmonic of the acoustic signal and the moment of characteristic frequency
applied is established through the digital lock-in and low-pass filtering
techniques. The accurate estimation of TOF is obtained by extracting and
comparing the temporal relationship of the characteristic frequency occurrence
between received and source acoustic signals. The computational error analysis
indicates that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is better than that of
the classical generalized cross-correlation (GCC) algorithm, and the
computational effort is significantly reduced to half of that the GCC can
offer. It can be confirmed that with this method, the temperature measurement
in furnaces can be improved in terms of computational effort and accuracy,
which are vital parameters in furnace combustion control. It provides a new
idea of time delay estimation with the utilization of acoustic pyrometry for
furnace.

delineate the subtle lesions via MR image transformations between the source

models, they need to detect keypoints and learn associative information between
keypoints. We argue that these problems can be entirely solved by Transformer.
Specifically, the self-attention in Transformer measures dependencies between
any pair of locations, which can provide association information for keypoints
grouping. However, the naive attention patterns are still not subjectively
controlled, so there is no guarantee that the keypoints will always attend to
the instances to which they belong. To address it we propose a novel approach
of supervising self-attention for multi-person keypoint detection and instance
association. By using instance masks to supervise self-attention to be
instance-aware, we can assign the detected keypoints to their corresponding
instances based on the pairwise attention scores, without using pre-defined
offset vector fields or embedding like CNN-based bottom-up models. An
additional benefit of our method is that the instance segmentation results of
any number of people can be directly obtained from the supervised attention
matrix, thereby simplifying the pixel assignment pipeline. The experiments on
the COCO multi-person keypoint detection challenge and person instance
segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed
method and show a promising way to control self-attention behavior for specific
purposes.

peculiar white dwarfs. We compute the equilibrium structures of DM-admixed
rotating white dwarfs using a self-consistent, two-fluid method, with the DM
component being a non-rotating degenerate fermi gas. We find that the admixture
of DM in rotating white dwarfs could: (1) account for some peculiar white
dwarfs that do not follow their usual mass-radius relation, (2) allow the
existence of stable, rapid-rotating white dwarfs that are free from
thermonuclear runaway, which could explain some anomalous x-ray pulsars/soft
gamma-ray repeaters, and (3) produce universal $I$ (moment of inertia)-Love
(tidal Love number)-$Q$ (quadrupole moment) relations that span bands above
those without DM admixture, thus providing an indirect way to search for DM in
white dwarfs through gravitational-wave detection. DM-admixed rotating white

learning due to the lack of label information. In this work, we propose a novel
and powerful framework, dubbed as SLA$^2$P, for unsupervised anomaly detection.
After extracting representative embeddings from raw data, we apply random
projections to the features and regard features transformed by different
projections as belonging to distinct pseudo classes. We then train a classifier
network on these transformed features to perform self-supervised learning. Next
we add adversarial perturbation to the transformed features to decrease their
softmax scores of the predicted labels and design anomaly scores based on the
predictive uncertainties of the classifier on these perturbed features. Our
motivation is that because of the relatively small number and the decentralized
modes of anomalies, 1) the pseudo label classifier's training concentrates more
on learning the semantic information of normal data rather than anomalous data;
2) the transformed features of the normal data are more robust to the
perturbations than those of the anomalies. Consequently, the perturbed
transformed features of anomalies fail to be classified well and accordingly
have lower anomaly scores than those of the normal samples. Extensive
experiments on image, text and inherently tabular benchmark datasets back up
our findings and indicate that SLA$^2$P achieves state-of-the-art results on
unsupervised anomaly detection tasks consistently.

whether a matroid is uniform or Eulerian, by giving a uniform lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}})$ on the query complexity for all

asymptotically optimal quantum algorithm is proposed which achieves the lower

surface elastic deformation characteristics of soft 2D monatomic sheets of
graphene and graphite in contrast to NbSe2 which is associated with their local

controlled strain on the material surface atomically and it offers a new way
for strain engineering. Topographic deformation of formed graphitic Moire

with desired properties. Most existing models generate molecules by
sequentially adding atoms. This often renders generated molecules with less

fragments such as functional groups are more closely related to molecular
properties and synthetic accessibility than atoms. Here, we propose a
fragment-based molecular generative model which designs new molecules with
target properties by sequentially adding molecular fragments to any given
starting molecule. A key feature of our model is a high generalization ability
in terms of property control and fragment types. The former becomes possible by
learning the contribution of individual fragments to the target properties in
an auto-regressive manner. For the latter, we used a deep neural network that
predicts the bonding probability of two molecules from the embedding vectors of
the two molecules as input. The high synthetic accessibility of the generated
molecules is implicitly considered while preparing the fragment library with
the BRICS decomposition method. We show that the model can generate molecules
with the simultaneous control of multiple target properties at a high success
rate. It also works equally well with unseen fragments even in the property
range where the training data is rare, verifying the high generalization

grid. It also conducts a preliminary study on using energy storage and load
rationing to mitigate rotating blackout's adverse impact on the grid. It is
estimated that utility-scale battery storage systems with a total installed
capacity of 920 GWh would be required to fully offset the load shedding during
the Texas power outage if energy storage were the only technical option. Our
simulation result suggests that implementing 20 percent load rationing on the
system could potentially reduce this estimated energy storage capacity by 85
percent. This estimate is obtained using the predicted capacity and demand
profile from February 15 to February 18, 2021. Recognizing the fact that it

approaches to provide more granular demand reduction are studied as a means of
leveraging the energy storage to maximize the survivability of consumers.

planets having a large amount of surface water. Land planets have a higher
runaway greenhouse threshold than aqua planets, which extends the inner edge of
the habitable zone inward. Land planets also have the advantage of avoiding
global freezing due to drier tropics, leading to a lower planetary albedo. In
this study, we systematically investigate the complete freezing limit for
various surface water distribution using a three-dimensional dynamic
atmospheric model. As in a previous study, we found that a land planet climate
has dry tropics that result in less snow and fewer clouds. The complete
freezing limit decreases from that for aqua planets (92% S0, where S0 is
Earth's present insolation) to that for land planets (77% S0) with an
increasing dry area. Values for the complete freezing limit for zonally uniform
surface water distributions are consistently lower than those for meridionally
uniform surface water distribution. This is because the surface water
distribution in the tropics in the meridionally uniform cases causes ice-albedo
feedback until a planet lapses into the complete freezing state. For a surface
water distribution using the topographies of the terrestrial planets, the
complete freezing limit has values near those for the meridionally uniform
cases. Our results indicate that the water distribution is important for the
onset of a global ice-covered state for Earth-like exoplanets.

penetrating the progenitor star. We consider three representative jet models
with a stripped massive star, a standard jet, a weak jet, and a jet choked by
an extended circumstellar medium, to clarify the differences in the dynamical

jet successfully penetrates the progenitor star and creates a quasi-spherical
ejecta component (cocoon). The jet-induced mixing significantly contaminates
the cocoon with heavy elements that have been otherwise embedded in the inner

important experimental observation is that incredibly large spin polarization

spin-orbit coupling (SOC), although SOC is the only interaction that can
manipulate the electrons' spins in the setups. Therefore, the mechanism of the
CISS needs to be constructed in a way insensitive to or enhancing the magnitude

this molecule, electronic translational and rotational degrees of freedom for
an injected electron are coupled to one another via the nuclear vibrational
mode with a pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. By properly taking the molecular
symmetry as well as the time-reversal symmetry into account and classifying the
molecular ground states by their angular- and spin-momentum quantum numbers, we
show that the chiral molecule can act as an efficient spin filter. The
efficiency of this spin filtering can be nearly independent of the SOC strength
in this model, while it well exceeds the spin polarization relying solely on
the SOC. The nuclear vibrations turned out to have the role of not only
mediating the translation-rotation coupling, but also enhancing the

the unresolved faint point sources and one for the uniform flat-field emission,
can well represent the observed PSD in three different energy bands (0.2-0.5
keV, 0.5-2 keV, and 2-10 keV); only an upper limit is obtained for the latter
component in 2-10 keV. X-ray counting rates corresponding to the best-fit PSD
model functions and diffuse emission fractions were estimated, and we confirmed
that the sum of the counting rates of two model components is consistent with
those actually observed with the detector for all energy bands. The ratio of
the flat-field counting rate to the total in 0.5-2 keV, however, is
significantly larger than the diffuse emission fraction estimated from the
model fits of energy spectra. We discussed that this discrepancy can be
reconciled by systematic effects in the PSD and energy spectrum analyses. The
present study demonstrates that the spatial power spectrum is powerful in
constraining the origins of the X-ray emission.

  Preserving the Original Energy Dissipation Laws",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this letter, we revisit the IEQ method and provide a new perspective on
its ability to preserve the original energy dissipation laws. The invariant
energy quadratization (IEQ) method has been widely used to design energy stable
numerical schemes for phase-field or gradient flow models. Although there are
many merits of the IEQ method, one major disadvantage is that the IEQ method
usually respects a modified energy law, where the modified energy is expressed
in the auxiliary variables. Still, the dissipation laws in terms of the
original energy are not guaranteed. Using the widely-used Cahn-Hilliard
equation as an example, we demonstrate that the Runge-Kutta IEQ method indeed
can preserve the original energy dissipation laws for certain situations up to
arbitrary high-order accuracy. Interested readers are highly encouraged to
apply our idea to other phase-field equations or gradient flow models.

two-stage procedure to first estimate the centrality and then infer the network
effect using the estimated centrality. Despite its prevalent adoption, this
two-stage procedure lacks theoretical backing and can fail in both estimation

the shortcomings of the two-stage in centrality estimation and the undesirable
consequences in the regression. We then propose a novel supervised network
centrality estimation (SuperCENT) methodology that simultaneously yields
superior estimations of the centrality and the network effect and provides
valid and narrower confidence intervals than those from the two-stage. We
showcase the superiority of SuperCENT in predicting the currency risk premium

of adversarial examples. So far, existing works show that robust models not
only obtain robustness against various adversarial attacks but also boost the
performance in some downstream tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of
adversarial robustness is still not clear. In this paper, we interpret
adversarial robustness from the perspective of linear components, and find that
there exist some statistical properties for comprehensively robust models.
Specifically, robust models show obvious hierarchical clustering effect on
their linearized sub-networks, when removing or replacing all non-linear
components (e.g., batch normalization, maximum pooling, or activation layers).
Based on these observations, we propose a novel understanding of adversarial
robustness and apply it on more tasks including domain adaption and robustness
boosting. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the rationality and superiority

may damage the performance of computer vision applications. The rainy scenarios
can be categorized into two classes: moderate rain and heavy rain scenes.
Moderate rain scene mainly consists of rain streaks while heavy rain scene
contains both rain streaks and the veiling effect (similar to haze). Although
existing methods have achieved excellent performance on these two cases
individually, it still lacks a general architecture to address both heavy rain
and moderate rain scenarios effectively. In this paper, we construct a
hierarchical multi-direction representation network by using the contourlet
transform (CT) to address both moderate rain and heavy rain scenarios. The CT
divides the image into the multi-direction subbands (MS) and the semantic
subband (SS). First, the rain streak information is retrieved to the MS based
on the multi-orientation property of the CT. Second, a hierarchical
architecture is proposed to reconstruct the background information including
damaged semantic information and the veiling effect in the SS. Last, the
multi-level subband discriminator with the feedback error map is proposed. By
this module, all subbands can be well optimized. This is the first architecture
that can address both of the two scenarios effectively. The code is available

contemporaneous MAGIC observations do not show significant very-high-energy
(VHE, >= 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission. The lack of enhancement in radio emission
measured by OVRO indicates the multi-zone nature of the emission from this
object. We constrain the VHE duty cycle of the source to be < 16 2014-like
flares per year (95% confidence). For the first time for this source, a
broadband low-state SED is constructed with a deep exposure up to the VHE
range. A flux upper limit on the low-state VHE gamma-ray emission of an order
of magnitude below that of the 2014 flare is determined. The X-ray data are
used to fit the column density of (8.10 +- 0.93 stat ) x 10^21 cm^-2 of the
dust in the lensing galaxy. VLBI observations show a clear radio core and jet
components in both lensed images, yet no significant movement of the components
is seen. The radio measurements are used to model the source-lens-observer
geometry and determine the magnifications and time delays for both components.
The quiescent emission is modeled with the high-energy bump explained as a
combination of synchrotron-self-Compton and external Compton emission from a
region located outside of the broad line region. The bulk of the low-energy
emission is explained as originating from a tens-of-parsecs scale jet.

lives. To provide personalized high quality recommendation results,
conventional systems usually train pointwise rankers to predict the absolute
value of objectives and leverage a distinct shallow tower to estimate and
alleviate the impact of position bias. However, with such a training paradigm,
the optimization target differs a lot from the ranking metrics valuing the
relative order of top ranked items rather than the prediction precision of each
item. Moreover, as the existing system tends to recommend more relevant items
at higher positions, it is difficult for the shallow tower based methods to
precisely attribute the user feedback to the impact of position or relevance.
Therefore, there exists an exciting opportunity for us to get enhanced
performance if we manage to solve the aforementioned issues. Unbiased learning
to rank algorithms, which are verified to model the relative relevance
accurately based on noisy feedback, are appealing candidates and have already
been applied in many applications with single categorical labels, such as user
click signals. Nevertheless, the existing unbiased LTR methods cannot properly
handle multiple feedback incorporating both categorical and continuous labels.
Accordingly, we design a novel unbiased LTR algorithm to tackle the challenges,
which innovatively models position bias in the pairwise fashion and introduces
the pairwise trust bias to separate the position bias, trust bias, and user
relevance explicitly. Experiment results on public benchmark datasets and
internal live traffic show the superior results of the proposed method for both
categorical and continuous labels.

to adapt different practical optical fiber conditions for CV-QKD systems with
unified hardware. Thus, how to improve the performance of practical CV-QKD
systems in the field without modification of the hardware is very important.
Here, a systematic optimization method, combining the modulation variance and
error correction matrix optimization, is proposed to improve the performance of
a practical CV-QKD system with a restricted capacity of postprocessing. The
effect of restricted postprocessing capacity on the SKR is modeled as a

offers significant effects on neutrino oscillations and CP-sensitivity, which
may be probed in various neutrino experiments. The idea of neutrinos coupling
with a scalar has evolved recently and looks promising. The effects of scalar
NSI may appear as a perturbation to the neutrino mass matrix in the neutrino
Hamiltonian. It modifies the neutrino mass matrix and may provide a direct
possibility of probing neutrino mass models. As the scalar NSI affects the
neutrino mass matrix in the Hamiltonian, its effect is energy independent.
Moreover, the matter effects due to scalar NSI scales linearly with the matter
density.

time reversal symmetry is a classic example, which is expected to show large
contributions to Berry curvature around the topological nodes and hence to the
AHE. Here, we report a kagome metallic ferromagnet Nd$_3$Al, with a large
unconventional positive magnetoresistance (~ 80 %) and colossal anomalous Hall
conductivity of 1.8x10^5 S/cm (largest ever reported to the best of our
knowledge). We also show that the magnetic state of this compound is quite
different from its analogues in many respects. While the compound is
predominantly an itinerant ferromagnet, its low temperature phase exhibits
topological band structure, enhanced skew scattering as well as topological
spin texture arising in the spin frustrated kagome lattice. Various
experimental findings such as topological Hall effect, non-saturating positive

calculations broadly confirm the experimental findings by revealing the
presence of flat bands and Weyl points originating from the itinerant Nd
moments. The non-trivial band structure, enhanced skew scattering and the spin
texture in a clean polycrystalline sample are found be responsible for the
colossal Hall conductivity and topological Hall effect.

well as within-class similarity in the embedded space. Tasks such as anomaly

it is not sufficient to merely discriminate between known classes. Our
intuition is to represent the known classes in compact and separated embedded
regions in order to decrease the possibility of known and unseen classes
overlapping in the embedded space. We derive a loss from Information Bottleneck
principle, which reflects the inter-class distances as well as the compactness
within classes, thus will extend the existing deep data description models. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed model improves the segmentation of
normal classes in the deep feature space, and subsequently contributes to
identifying out-of-distribution samples.

proxy evaluation to automatically select a pool of promising GNN models. Then
it builds a hierarchical ensemble framework: 1) We propose graph self-ensemble
(GSE), which can reduce the variance of weight initialization and efficiently
exploit the information of local and global neighborhoods; 2) Based on GSE, a
weighted ensemble of different types of GNN models is used to effectively learn
more discriminative node representations. To efficiently search the

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the trial-and-error mechanism of reinforcement learning (RL), a notorious
contradiction arises when we expect to learn a safe policy: how to learn a safe
policy without enough data and prior model about the dangerous region? Existing
methods mostly use the posterior penalty for dangerous actions, which means
that the agent is not penalized until experiencing danger. This fact causes
that the agent cannot learn a zero-violation policy even after convergence.
Otherwise, it would not receive any penalty and lose the knowledge about
danger. In this paper, we propose the safe set actor-critic (SSAC) algorithm,
which confines the policy update using safety-oriented energy functions, or the
safety indexes. The safety index is designed to increase rapidly for
potentially dangerous actions, which allows us to locate the safe set on the
action space, or the control safe set. Therefore, we can identify the dangerous
actions prior to taking them, and further obtain a zero constraint-violation
policy after convergence.We claim that we can learn the energy function in a
model-free manner similar to learning a value function. By using the energy
function transition as the constraint objective, we formulate a constrained RL
problem. We prove that our Lagrangian-based solutions make sure that the
learned policy will converge to the constrained optimum under some assumptions.
The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both the complex simulation environments
and a hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment with a real controller from the
autonomous vehicle. Experimental results suggest that the converged policy in
all environments achieves zero constraint violation and comparable performance
with model-based baselines.

Relativistic atomic many-body calculations are performed for s and p_1/2 states
of several systems of interest for studies of atomic parity violation and
time-reversal-violating electric dipole moments -- Rb, Cs, Fr, Ba+, Ra+, and
Tl. For s states, electron screening effects are small, and the relative BW
correction for hydrogenlike ions and neutral atoms is approximately the same.
We relate the ground-state BW effect in H-like ions, which may be cleanly
extracted from experiments, to the BW effect in s and p_1/2 states of neutral
and near neutral atoms through an electronic screening factor. This allows the
BW effect extracted from measurements with H-like ions to be used, with
screening factors, in atomic calculations without recourse to modelled nuclear
structure input. It opens the way for unprecedented accuracy in accounting for
the BW effect in heavy atoms. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated
using available experimental data for H-like and neutral Tl-203 and Tl-205.

are subject to unrepresentativeness, missingness, or selection bias. An
inevitable challenge with the use of IPW is that the IPW estimator can be
remarkably unstable if some probabilities are very close to zero. To overcome
this problem, at least three remedies have been developed in the literature:
stabilizing, thresholding, and trimming. However the final estimators are still
IPW type estimators, and inevitably inherit certain weaknesses of the naive IPW
estimator: they may still be unstable or biased. We propose a biased-sample
empirical likelihood weighting (ELW) method to serve the same general purpose
as IPW, while completely overcoming the instability of IPW-type estimators by
circumventing the use of inverse probabilities. The ELW weights are always well
defined and easy to implement. We show theoretically that the ELW estimator is
asymptotically normal and more efficient than the IPW estimator and its
stabilized version for missing data problems and unequal probability sampling
without replacement. Its asymptotic normality is also established under unequal
probability sampling with replacement. Our simulation results and a real data
analysis indicate that the ELW estimator is shift-equivariant, nearly unbiased,

topological character of phase transitions in insulators. This method relies on
subjecting the target system to a set of external fields, each of which
consists of two parts, i.e., a weak spatiotemporally slowly-varying component
on top of a constant offset. The fields are chosen in such a way, so that they
respectively induce slow variations in the wave vector describing the bulk band
structure, as well as a parameter which allows tuning the bulk gap. Such a
process maps the Berry singularities of the base space to a synthetic space
spanned by the parameters related to the external fields. By measuring the
response of the system to the weak part of the perturbations, when these are
additionally chosen to form spacetime textures, one can construct a quantity
that is here-termed Berry singularity marker (BSM). The BSM enables the Berry
singularity detection as it becomes nonzero only in the close vicinity of a
Berry singularity and is equal to its charge. The calculation of the BSM
requires the measurement of the susceptibility tensor for the applied external
fields. Near the Berry singularities, the BSM is dominated by a universal
value, which is determined by the quantum metric tensor of the system. While in
this work I restrict to 1D AIII insulators, the proposed approach is general.
Notably, a key feature of the present method is that it can be implemented in a
lock-in fashion, that is, one can ""filter out"" from the BSM any possible
contribution from disorder by performing more measurements. Hence, the present
construction paves the way for a disorder resilient diagnosis of topological
phase transitions, that appears particularly relevant for disordered
topological insulator and hybrid Majorana platforms, while it can be readily
implemented using topo-electric circuits.

weak practicality of existing deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithms and
the insufficiency of real-world attack demonstrations. To fill the blank, in
this work, we study the realistic threat of deployment-stage backdoor attacks
on DNNs. We base our study on a commonly used deployment-stage attack paradigm
-- adversarial weight attack, where adversaries selectively modify model
weights to embed backdoor into deployed DNNs. To approach realistic
practicality, we propose the first gray-box and physically realizable weights
attack algorithm for backdoor injection, namely subnet replacement attack
(SRA), which only requires architecture information of the victim model and can
support physical triggers in the real world. Extensive experimental simulations
and system-level real-world attack demonstrations are conducted. Our results
not only suggest the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed attack
algorithm, but also reveal the practical risk of a novel type of computer virus

phase diagram of TiO$_2$ in the range $0<P<70$~GPa and $100<T<1500$~K. We then
simulate dynamic phase transition processes, by compressing anatase at
different temperatures. At 300~K, we observe predominantly
anatase-to-baddeleyite transformation at about 20~GPa, via a martensitic
two-step mechanism with highly ordered and collective atomic motion. At 2000~K,
anatase can transform into cotunnite around 45-55~GPa in a thermally-activated
and probabilistic manner, accompanied by diffusive movement of oxygen atoms.
The pressures computed for these transitions show good agreement with
experiments. Our results shed light on how to synthesize and stabilize
high-pressure TiO$_2$ phases, and our method is generally applicable to other
functional materials with multiple polymorphs.

comparable in terms of their morphological and structural perfection and
exhibit essentially identical quantum well widths and Al content. Regardless of
the crystal orientation, the exciton decay in the MQWs at 10 K is dominantly
radiative and the photoluminescence (PL) energy follows the quantum confined
Stark effect (QCSE) for different quantum well widths. A prominent
free-to-bound transition involving interface shallow donors is, however,
visible for the N-polar MQWs. At room-temperature, in contrast, the exciton
decay in all samples is dominated by nonradiative recombination taking place at
point defects, presumably Ca or V N located at the bottom QW interface.
Remarkably, the N-polar MQWs exhibit a higher PL intensity and longer decay
times than the Ga-polar MQWs at room-temperature. This improved internal
quantum efficiency is attributed to the beneficial orientation of the internal
electric field that effectively reduces the capture rate of minority carriers
by interface trap states.

  Network","11 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bokeh effect is a natural shallow depth-of-field phenomenon that blurs the
out-of-focus part in photography. In recent years, a series of works have
proposed automatic and realistic bokeh rendering methods for artistic and
aesthetic purposes. They usually employ cutting-edge data-driven deep
generative networks with complex training strategies and network architectures.
However, these works neglect that the bokeh effect, as a real phenomenon, can
inevitably affect the subsequent visual intelligent tasks like recognition, and
their data-driven nature prevents them from studying the influence of
bokeh-related physical parameters (i.e., depth-of-the-field) on the intelligent
tasks. To fill this gap, we study a totally new problem, i.e., natural &
adversarial bokeh rendering, which consists of two objectives: rendering
realistic and natural bokeh and fooling the visual perception models (i.e.,
bokeh-based adversarial attack). To this end, beyond the pure data-driven
solution, we propose a hybrid alternative by taking the respective advantages
of data-driven and physical-aware methods. Specifically, we propose the
circle-of-confusion predictive network (CoCNet) by taking the all-in-focus
image and depth image as inputs to estimate circle-of-confusion parameters for
each pixel, which are employed to render the final image through a well-known
physical model of bokeh. With the hybrid solution, our method could achieve
more realistic rendering results with the naive training strategy and a much
lighter network. Moreover, we propose the adversarial bokeh attack by fixing
the CoCNet while optimizing the depth map w.r.t the visual perception tasks.
Then, we are able to study the vulnerability of deep neural networks according
to the depth variations in the real world.

low-energy protons near the geomagnetic equator. The obtained instrumental
background at 0.5-10 keV, which is mainly induced by cosmic ray protons and
cosmic photon background, corresponds to a level of $\sim$3.1$\times$10$^{-2}$
counts s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ in the imaging area of the focal plane detector

(that satisfy the risk-constraint with high probability) and a certain number
of independent and identically distributed samples of the uncertainty governing
the risk constraint are available. These states and samples are accumulated in
previous iterations. The safe states are used as terminal constraint in the MPC
scheme and samples are used to construct a set of distributions, termed
ambiguity set, such that it contains the underlying distribution of the
uncertainty with high probability. The risk-constraint in each iteration is
required to hold for all distributions in the ambiguity set. We establish that
the trajectories generated by our iterative procedure are feasible, safe, and
converge asymptotically to the equilibrium. Simulation example illustrates our
results for the case of finding a risk-constrained path for a mobile robot in
the presence of an uncertain obstacle.

For this, we investigate formal frameworks for modeling the interaction of

idea that the notion of an intervention can be used as a formal expression of a
(real or hypothetical) experiment. In a first step we extend the well-known
causal models with a simple Hintikka-style representation of the epistemic
state of an agent. In the resulting setting, one can talk not only about the
knowledge of an agent about the values of variables and how interventions
affect them, but also about knowledge update. The resulting logic can model
reasoning about thought experiments. However, it is unable to account for
learning from experiments, which is clearly brought out by the fact that it
validates the no learning principle for interventions. Therefore, in a second
step, we implement a more complex notion of knowledge that allows an agent to
observe (measure) certain variables when an experiment is carried out. This
extended system does allow for learning from experiments. For all the proposed
logical systems, we provide a sound and complete axiomatization.

this paper, we demonstrate imaging of stresses in the top layer of diamond with
deposited structures of Cr$_2$O$_3$ at temperatures 19$^{\circ}$C and
37$^{\circ}$C by using stress-sensitive optically detected magnetic resonances
(ODMR) in NV centers. We also calculated stresses in the diamond-film interface
by using finite-element analysis and correlated them to measured ODMR frequency
shifts. As predicted by the simulation, the measured high-contrast
frequency-shift patterns are only due to thermal stresses, whose spin-stress
coupling constant along the NV axis is 21$\pm$1 MHz/GPa, that is in agreement
with constants previously obtained from single NV centers in diamond
cantilever. We demonstrate that NV microscopy is a convenient platform for
optically detecting and quantifying spatial distributions of stresses in
diamond-based photonic devices with micrometer precision and propose thin films
as a means for local application of temperature-controlled stresses. Our
results also show that thin film structures produce significant stresses in

increasing Eddington ratio implies that the jet should be coupled with the
accretion process. To further explore the relationship between the jet and
accretion, it is necessary to extend our knowledge of the jet to an extreme end
of the Eddington ratio distribution of AGN. Using Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA), we report the detection of the parsec-scale radio structure in Mrk 335,
a radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with an Eddington ratio close

comparing Mrk 335 with other highly accreting systems, e.g. Galactic black
holes and tidal disruption events, and recall the discovery of collimated

  Our main technique is a new approach to use the powerful Sum of Squares
method (SoS) to design differentially private algorithms. SoS proofs to
algorithms is a key theme in numerous recent works in high-dimensional
algorithmic statistics -- estimators which apparently require exponential
running time but whose analysis can be captured by low-degree Sum of Squares
proofs can be automatically turned into polynomial-time algorithms with the
same provable guarantees. We demonstrate a similar proofs to private algorithms
phenomenon: instances of the workhorse exponential mechanism which apparently
require exponential time but which can be analyzed with low-degree SoS proofs
can be automatically turned into polynomial-time differentially private
algorithms. We prove a meta-theorem capturing this phenomenon, which we expect
to be of broad use in private algorithm design.
  Our techniques also draw new connections between differentially private and
robust statistics in high dimensions. In particular, viewed through our
proofs-to-private-algorithms lens, several well-studied SoS proofs from recent
works in algorithmic robust statistics directly yield key components of our
differentially private mean estimation algorithm.

in the study of disordered systems, in particular artificial neural networks,
we quantitatively explore how well a quantity known as the local entropy
describes the native state of model proteins. In lattice models and all-atom
representations of proteins, we are able to efficiently sample high local
entropy states and to provide a proof of concept of enhanced stability and
folding rate. Our methods are based on simple and general
statistical--mechanics arguments, and thus we expect that they are of very

connectionist and classicist, wherein the latter continually advocates an
algebraic treatment in cognitive architectures. In this work, we follow the
classicist's call and propose a hybrid approach to improve systematic
generalization in reasoning. Specifically, we showcase a prototype with
algebraic representation for the abstract spatial-temporal reasoning task of
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and present the ALgebra-Aware
Neuro-Semi-Symbolic (ALANS) learner. The ALANS learner is motivated by abstract
algebra and the representation theory. It consists of a neural visual
perception frontend and an algebraic abstract reasoning backend: the frontend
summarizes the visual information from object-based representation, while the
backend transforms it into an algebraic structure and induces the hidden
operator on the fly. The induced operator is later executed to predict the
answer's representation, and the choice most similar to the prediction is
selected as the solution. Extensive experiments show that by incorporating an
algebraic treatment, the ALANS learner outperforms various pure connectionist
models in domains requiring systematic generalization. We further show the
generative nature of the learned algebraic representation; it can be decoded by
isomorphism to generate an answer.

identify low-dimensional quadratic embeddings for high-fidelity dynamical
systems. Precisely, we identify the embedding of data using an autoencoder to

to avoid the time-derivative computations, which is often a challenge. We
illustrate the ability of the approach by a couple of examples, arising in

electrocardiograms (ECG), as many downstream diagnosis tasks are dependent on
ECG-based measurements. Those measurements, however, are costly to produce,
especially in recordings that change throughout long periods of time. However,
existing annotated databases for ECG delineation are small, being insufficient
in size and in the array of pathological conditions they represent. This
article delves has two main contributions. First, a pseudo-synthetic data
generation algorithm was developed, based in probabilistically composing ECG
traces given ""pools"" of fundamental segments, as cropped from the original
databases, and a set of rules for their arrangement into coherent synthetic
traces. The generation of conditions is controlled by imposing expert knowledge
on the generated trace, which increases the input variability for training the
model. Second, two novel segmentation-based loss functions have been developed,
which attempt at enforcing the prediction of an exact number of independent
structures and at producing closer segmentation boundaries by focusing on a
reduced number of samples. The best performing model obtained an $F_1$-score of
99.38\% and a delineation error of $2.19 \pm 17.73$ ms and $4.45 \pm 18.32$ ms
for all wave's fiducials (onsets and offsets, respectively), as averaged across
the P, QRS and T waves for three distinct freely available databases. The
excellent results were obtained despite the heterogeneous characteristics of
the tested databases, in terms of lead configurations (Holter, 12-lead),
sampling frequencies ($250$, $500$ and $2,000$ Hz) and represented
pathophysiologies (e.g., different types of arrhythmias, sinus rhythm with
structural heart disease), hinting at its generalization capabilities, while
outperforming current state-of-the-art delineation approaches.

mathematical approaches to address properly a statistical mechanical picture of
the phenomenon of {\em replica symmetry breaking} (RSB) in these networks, then
-- deepening results stemmed via these routes -- we aim to inspect the {\em
glassiness} that they hide. In particular, regarding the methodology, we
provide two techniques: the former is an adaptation of the transport PDE to the
case, while the latter is an extension of Guerra's interpolation breakthrough.
Beyond coherence among the results, either in replica symmetric and in the
one-step replica symmetry breaking level of description, we prove the Gardner's
picture and we identify the maximal storage capacity by a ground-state analysis
in the Baldi-Venkatesh high-storage regime.
  In the second part of the paper we investigate the glassy structure of these
networks: in contrast with the replica symmetric scenario (RS), RSB actually
stabilizes the spin-glass phase. We report huge differences w.r.t. the standard
pairwise Hopfield limit: in particular, it is known that it is possible to
express the free energy of the Hopfield neural network as a linear combination
of the free energies of an hard spin glass (i.e. the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model) and a soft spin glass (the Gaussian or ""spherical"" model). This is no
longer true when interactions are more than pairwise (whatever the level of
description, RS or RSB): for dense networks solely the free energy of the hard
spin glass survives, proving a huge diversity in the underlying glassiness of
associative neural networks.

stress in a capillary can be qualitatively reproduced from the curve obtained
in rotational geometry at imposed stress but instead of a sharp decrease of the
volume flow rate observed at a critical stress, this transposition predicts a
progressive decrease in flow rate. The Wyart-Cates theory is used to reproduce
the stress-shear rate curve obtained in rotational geometry and then applied to
predict the volume flow rate at imposed pressure. The theoretical curve
predicts a total stop of the flow at high stress, whereas experimentally it
remains constant. We propose a modification of the theory which, by taking into
account the relaxation of the frictional contacts in the absence of shear rate,
well predicts the high stress behavior. We also hypothesized that the DST
transition propagates immediately inside the capillary, once the wall shear
stress has reached its critical value: $\tau_R=\tau_c$, even if the internal

in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. LTSs are populated via a field cycling protocol with the
static magnetic field applied parallel to the $\langle{100}\rangle$ crystalline
direction of plate and cuboid-shaped bulk crystals. By analyzing
temperature-dependent broadband spectroscopy data, clear evidence of
low-temperature skyrmion excitations with clockwise (CW), counterclockwise
(CCW), and breathing mode (BR) character at temperatures below $T$ = 40 K are
shown. We find that the mode intensities can be tuned with the number of
field-cycles below the saturation field. By tracking the resonance frequencies,
we are able to map out the field-cycle-generated LTS phase diagram, from which
we conclude that the LTS phase is distinctly separated from the
high-temperature counterpart. We also study the mode hybridization between the
dark CW and the BR modes as a function of temperature. By using two

Neutrinos influence the merger dynamics and shape the properties of the ejecta,

this work, we analyze neutrino emission from a large sample of merger radiation
hydrodynamics simulations in Numerical Relativity, covering a broad range of
initial masses, nuclear equation of state and viscosity treatments. We extract
neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and compute quantities of interest
such as the peak values, peak broadnesses, time averages and decrease time
scales. We provide a systematic description of such quantities, including their
dependence on the initial parameters of the system. We find that for equal-mass
systems the total neutrino luminosity (several $10^{53}{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$)
decreases for increasing reduced tidal deformability, as a consequence of the
less violent merger dynamics. Similarly, tidal disruption in asymmetric mergers
leads to systematically smaller luminosities. Peak luminosities can be twice as
large as the average ones. Electron antineutrino luminosities dominate
(initially by a factor of 2-3) over electron neutrino ones, while electron
neutrinos and heavy flavour neutrinos have similar luminosities. Mean energies
are nearly constant in time and independent on the binary parameters. Their
values reflect the different decoupling temperature inside the merger remnant.

bounded random perturbations of autonomous semilinear problems. First, we study
existence and permanence of unstable sets of hyperbolic solutions. Then, we use
this to establish lower semicontinuity of nonautonomous random attractors and
to show that the gradient structure persists under nonautonomous random
perturbations. Finally, we apply the abstract results in a stochastic

Requiring expectation values of manifestly positive semi-definite operators to
be non-negative results in a lower bound on the ground-state energy of any
quantum mechanical system, which can be made arbitrarily tight for systems
described by finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Such bounds can be obtained
directly in the infinite-volume limit. The process of optimizing these lower

discover attribute-specific control units, which consist of multiple channels
of feature maps and modulation styles. Specifically, we collaboratively
manipulate the modulation style channels and feature maps in control units
rather than individual ones to obtain the semantic and spatial disentangled
controls. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect the
attribute-specific control units. We move the modulation style along a specific
sparse direction vector and replace the filter-wise styles used to compute the
feature maps to manipulate these control units. We evaluate our proposed method

layer terminating SiC changes to graphene by Ca-termination of SiC (monolayer
graphene becomes bilayer) with inducing more carriers than a free-standing

superconductivity with the updated critical temperature ($T_{C}$) of up to 5.7

modelling methodology to model and analyse the complex dynamics arising from a
sequence of bifurcations for a two-dimensional incompressible flow of the
unforced fluidic pinball. The hierarchy is guided by a triple decomposition
separating a slowly varying base flow, dominant shedding and secondary flow
structures. All these flow components are kinematically resolved by a hierarchy
of clusters, starting with the base flow in the first layer, resolving the
vortex shedding in the second layer and distilling the secondary flow
structures in the third layer. The transition dynamics between these clusters
is described by a directed network, called the cluster-based hierarchical
network model (HiCNM) in the sequel. Three consecutive Reynolds number regimes
for different dynamics are considered: (i) periodic shedding at $Re=80$, (ii)
quasi-periodic shedding at $Re=105$, and (iii) chaotic shedding at $Re=130$,
involving three unstable fixed points, three limit cycles, two quasi-periodic
attractors and a chaotic attractor. The HiCNM enables identifying the transient
and post-transient dynamics between multiple invariant sets in a
self-supervised manner. Both the global trends and the local structures during
the transition are well resolved by a moderate number of hierarchical clusters.
The proposed reduced-order modelling provides a visual representation of
transient and post-transient, multi-frequency, multi-attractor behaviour and
may automate the identification and analysis of complex dynamics with multiple
scales and multiple invariant sets.

propose to address this problem by directly approximating the vector field of

is challenging. Functional array programming languages with patterns like map
and reduce have been successfully combined with term rewriting to define and
explore optimization spaces. However, deciding what sequence of rewrites to
apply is hard and has a huge impact on the performance of the rewritten
program. Equality saturation avoids the issue by exploring many possible ways
to apply rewrites, efficiently representing many equivalent programs in an
e-graph data structure.
  Equality saturation has some limitations when rewriting functional language
terms, as currently naive encodings of the lambda calculus are used. We present
new techniques for encoding polymorphically typed lambda calculi, and show that
the efficient encoding reduces the runtime and memory consumption of equality
saturation by orders of magnitude.
  Moreover, equality saturation does not yet scale to complex compiler
optimizations. These emerge from long rewrite sequences of thousands of rewrite
steps, and may use pathological combinations of rewrite rules that cause the
e-graph to quickly grow too large. This paper introduces \emph{sketch-guided
equality saturation}, a semi-automatic technique that allows programmers to
provide program sketches to guide rewriting. Sketch-guided equality saturation
is evaluated for seven complex matrix multiplication optimizations, including
loop blocking, vectorization, and multi-threading. Even with efficient lambda
calculus encoding, unguided equality saturation can locate only the two
simplest of these optimizations, the remaining five are undiscovered even with
an hour of compilation time and 60GB of RAM. By specifying three or fewer
sketch guides all seven optimizations are found in seconds of compilation time,
using under 1GB of RAM, and generating high performance code.

normative questions - they really ask what ought to have happened, and how the
humans involved ought to have behaved. To answer the normative questions, law
and regulation seeks a narrative explanation, a story. At present, we seek
these kinds of narrative explanation from AI technology, because as humans we
seek to understand technology's working through constructing a story to explain

narratives about future AI technologies like intelligent robots, have told us
that they act in ways explainable by the narrative logic which we use to
explain human actions and so they can also be explained to us in those terms.

generated by entropy waves passing through sudden area expansions. The
numerical approach is based on a triple decomposition of the flow variables

part. The mean flow is obtained as the solution of the Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The equations governing the coherent
perturbations are linearised and solved in the frequency domain. To account for
the effect of turbulence on the coherent perturbations, a frozen eddy viscosity
model is employed. When entropy fluctuations pass through the area expansion,
the generated entropy noise behaves as a low-pass filter. The numerical
predictions of the noise at low frequencies are compared to the predictions of
compact, quasi-one-dimensional, and isentropic theory and large discrepancies
are observed. An alternative model for the generated entropy noise tailored for
area expansions is then proposed. Such model is based on the conservation of
mass, momentum, and energy written in integral form. The model assumes zero
frequency and the one-dimensionality of the flow variables far upstream and
downstream of the expansion. The predictions of this model agree well with the
numerical simulations across a range of finite subsonic Mach numbers including

(-43\%)/+39\% ((-17\%/+20\%), while for for $\sin^2\theta_{23} = 0.50$ and 0.58
it is noticeably smaller: (-37)\%/+30\% and (-30\%)/+24\% ((-13\%)/+16\% and

for some time, as the advantages of one delivery method offset the
disadvantages of the other. This paper focuses on the vehicle routing problem
with drones and drone speed selection (VRPD-DSS), which considers
speed-dependent energy consumption and drone-charging in detail. For this
purpose, we formulate a comprehensive mixed-integer problem that aims to
minimize the operational costs consisting of fuel consumption costs of the
trucks, labor costs for the drivers, and energy costs of the drones. The speed
at which a drone performs a flight must be selected from a discrete set. We
introduce preprocessing steps to eliminate dominated speeds for a flight to
reduce the problem size and use valid inequalities to accelerate the solution
process. The consideration of speed-dependent energy consumption leads to the
fact that it is advisable to perform different flights at different speeds and
not to consistently operate a drone at maximum speed. Instead, drone speed
should be selected to balance drone range and speed of delivery. Our extensive
computational study of a rural real-world setting shows that, by modeling
energy consumption realistically, the savings in operational costs compared to
truck-only delivery are significant but smaller than those identified in
previously published work. Our analysis further reveals that the greatest
savings stem from the fact that overall delivery time decreases compared to
truck-only delivery, allowing costly truck-driver time to be reduced. The
additional energy costs of the drone, however, are largely negligible.

some time T? Which entities are standing out as the biggest movers?
  To answer this question we define the concept of momentum. Two parameters -
absolute gain and relative gain over time T play the key role in defining
momentum. Neither alone is sufficient since they are each biased towards a
subset of entities. Absolute gain favors large entities, while relative gain
favors small ones. To accommodate both absolute and relative gain in an
unbiased way, we define Pareto ordering between entities. For entity E to
dominate another entity F in Pareto ordering, E's absolute and relative gains
over time T must be higher than F's absolute and relative gains respectively.
Momentum leaders are defined as maximal elements of this partial order - the
Pareto frontier. We show how to compute momentum leaders and propose linear
ordering among them to help rank entities with the most momentum on the top.
Additionally, we show that when vectors follow power-law, the cardinality of
the set of Momentum leaders (Pareto frontier) is of the order of square root of
the logarithm of the number of entities, thus it is very small.

neural models are brittle and often make mistakes when tested with modified

question: how robust are retrieval pipelines with respect to different
variations in queries that do not change the queries' semantics? In order to
obtain queries that are representative of users' querying variability, we first
created a taxonomy based on the manual annotation of transformations occurring
in a dataset (UQV100) of user-created query variations. For each
syntax-changing category of our taxonomy, we employed different automatic
methods that when applied to a query generate a query variation. Our
experimental results across two datasets for two IR tasks reveal that retrieval
pipelines are not robust to these query variations, with effectiveness drops of
$\approx20\%$ on average. The code and datasets are available at

Acyclic Graphs of data analysis tasks. Shared-nothing (SN) parallelism is the
de-facto standard to scale stream processing applications. Given an
application, SN parallelism instantiates several copies of each analysis task,
making each instance responsible for a dedicated portion of the overall
analysis, and relies on dedicated queues to exchange data among connected
instances. On the one hand, SN parallelism can scale the execution of
applications both up and out since threads can run task instances within and
across processes/nodes. On the other hand, its lack of sharing can cause
unnecessary overheads and hinder the scaling up when threads operate on data
that could be jointly accessed in shared memory. This trade-off motivated us in
studying a way for stream processing applications to leverage shared memory and
boost the scale up (before the scale out) while adhering to the widely-adopted
and SN-based APIs for stream processing applications.
  We introduce STRETCH, a framework that maximizes the scale up and offers
instantaneous elastic reconfigurations (without state transfer) for stream
processing applications. We propose the concept of Virtual Shared-Nothing (VSN)
parallelism and elasticity and provide formal definitions and correctness
proofs for the semantics of the analysis tasks supported by STRETCH, showing
they extend the ones found in common Stream Processing Engines. We also provide
a fully implemented prototype and show that STRETCH's performance exceeds that
of state-of-the-art frameworks such as Apache Flink and offers, to the best of
our knowledge, unprecedented ultra-fast reconfigurations, taking less than 40
ms even when provisioning tens of new task instances.

artificial molecules composed of fused core/shell semiconductor nanocrystals.
The electronic coupling and wavefunction hybridization is enabled by the
formation of an epitaxial connection with a coherent lattice between the shells
of the two neighboring quantum dots where the shell material and its dimensions
dictate the quantum barrier characteristics for the charge carriers. Herein we
introduce a colloidal approach to control the neck formation at the interface
between the two CQDs in such artificial molecular constructs. This allows the
tailoring of the neck barrier in pre-linked homodimers formed via fusion of
multifaceted wurtzite CdSe/CdS CQDs. The effects of reaction time, temperature
and excess ligands is studied. The neck filling process follows an
intraparticle ripening mechanism at relatively mild reaction conditions while
avoiding inter-particle ripening. The degree of surface ligand passivation
plays a key role in activating the surface atom diffusion to the neck region.
The degree of neck filling strongly depends also on the initial relative
orientation of the two CQDs, where homonymous plane attachment allows for
facile neck growth, unlike the case of heteronymous plane attachment. Upon
neck-filling, the observed red-shift of the absorption and fluorescence
measured both for ensemble and single dimers, is assigned to enhanced
hybridization of the confined wavefunction in CQD dimer molecules, as supported
by quantum calculations. The fine tuning of the particle interface introduced
herein provides therefore a powerful tool to further control the extent of
hybridization and coupling in CQD molecules.

from changes of acquisition characteristics as data and targets may become

recognizes shifts in image acquisition characteristics - new domains -, selects
optimal examples for labelling and adapts training accordingly. Labelling is
subject to a limited budget, resembling typical real world scenarios. To

surface deformation in cases of both constant and non-constant viscoelastic

diagnostic method which utilizes the natural ability of plasmas to resonate on

particular design of APRS that has a high degree of geometric and electric
symmetry. The principle of the MRP can be described on the basis of an
idealized geometry that is particularly suited for theoretical investigations.
In a pressure regime of a few Pa or lower, kinetic effects become important,
which can not be predicted by the Drude model. Therefore, in this paper a
dynamic model of the interaction of the idealized MRP with a plasma is
established. The proposed scheme reveals the kinetic behavior of the plasma
that is able to explain the influence of kinetic effects on the resonance
structure. Similar to particle-in-cell, the spectral kinetic method iteratively
determines the electric field at each particle position, however, without
employing any numerical grids. The optimized analytical model ensures the high
efficiency of the simulation. Eventually, the presented work is expected to
cover the limitation of the Drude model, especially for the determination of
the pure collisionless damping caused by kinetic effects. A formula to
determine the electron temperature from the half-width is proposed.

texture synthesis due to the lack of supervision of clean images. To overcome
this problem, we are the first to have a close look at the under-explored
direction for RealSR, i.e., few-shot real-world image super-resolution, which
aims to tackle the challenging RealSR problem with few-shot distorted/clean
image pairs. Under this brand-new scenario, we propose Distortion Relation
guided Transfer Learning (DRTL) for the few-shot RealSR by transferring the
rich restoration knowledge from auxiliary distortions (i.e., synthetic
distortions) to the target RealSR under the guidance of distortion relation.
Concretely, DRTL builds a knowledge graph to capture the distortion relation
between auxiliary distortions and target distortion (i.e., real distortions in
RealSR). Based on the distortion relation, DRTL adopts a gradient reweighting
strategy to guide the knowledge transfer process between auxiliary distortions
and target distortions. In this way, DRTL could quickly learn the most relevant
knowledge from the synthetic distortions for the target distortion. We
instantiate DRTL with two commonly-used transfer learning paradigms, including
pre-training and meta-learning pipelines, to realize a distortion
relation-aware Few-shot RealSR. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks

from a reference window on an input feature map. The BoxeR computes attention
weights on these boxes by considering its grid structure. Notably, BoxeR-2D
naturally reasons about box information within its attention module, making it
suitable for end-to-end instance detection and segmentation tasks. By learning
invariance to rotation in the box-attention module, BoxeR-3D is capable of
generating discriminative information from a bird's-eye view plane for 3D
end-to-end object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
BoxeR-2D achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO detection and instance

detection baseline and already obtains a compelling performance for the vehicle

tracing algorithms, which iteratively optimizes and samples from what we refer
to as spatio-directional Gaussian mixture models (SDMMs). In particular, we
approximate incident radiance as an online-trained $5$D mixture that is
accelerated by a $k$D-tree. Using the same framework, we approximate BSDFs as
pre-trained $n$D mixtures, where $n$ is the number of BSDF parameters. Such an
approach addresses two major challenges in path-guiding models. First, the $5$D
radiance representation naturally captures correlation between the spatial and
directional dimensions. Such correlations are present in e.g. parallax and
caustics. Second, by using a tangent-space parameterization of Gaussians, our
spatio-directional mixtures can perform approximate product sampling with
arbitrarily oriented BSDFs. Existing models are only able to do this by either
foregoing anisotropy of the mixture components or by representing the radiance
field in local (normal aligned) coordinates, which both make the radiance field
more difficult to learn. An additional benefit of the tangent-space
parameterization is that each individual Gaussian is mapped to the solid sphere
with low distortion near its center of mass. Our method performs especially
well on scenes with small, localized luminaires that induce high
spatio-directional correlation in the incident radiance.

that the average quartet distance between two assignments of taxa to the leaves

Bandelt and Dress asserts that $(\frac 23 +o(1))\binom{n}{4}$ is also the {\em
maximum} quartet distance between two assignments. While Alon, Naves, and
Sudakov have shown this indeed holds for caterpillar trees, the general case of
the conjecture is still unresolved. A natural extension is when partial
information is given: the two assignments are known to coincide on a given
subset of taxa. The partial information setting is biologically relevant as the
location of some taxa (species) in the phylogenetic tree may be known, and for
other taxa it might not be known. What can we then say about the average and
maximum quartet distance in this more general setting? Surprisingly, even
determining the {\em average} quartet distance becomes a nontrivial task in the
partial information setting and determining the maximum quartet distance is
even more challenging, as these turn out to be dependent of the structure of
$T$. In this paper we prove nontrivial asymptotic bounds that are sometimes
tight for the average quartet distance in the partial information setting. We
also show that the Bandelt and Dress conjecture does not generally hold under
the partial information setting. Specifically, we prove that there are cases

a role which has been extensively studied in the context of domestic violence.
To victims of abuse, social networks often provide initial emotional and
practical help as well useful information ahead of formal institutions.
Recently, however, attention has been paid to the negative responses of social
networks. In this article, we advance the theoretical debate on social networks
as a source of social support by moving beyond the distinction between positive
and negative ties. We do so by proposing the concepts of relational ambivalence
and consistency, which describe the interactive processes by which people,
intentionally or inadvertently, disregard or align with each other role
relational expectations, therefore undermining or reinforcing individual
choices of action. We analyse the qualitative accounts of nineteen female
victims of domestic violence in Sweden, who described the responses of their
personal networks during and after the abuse. We observe how the relationships
embedded in these networks were described in ambivalent and consistent terms,
and how they played a role in supporting or undermining women in reframing
their loving relationships as abusive; in accounting or dismissing perpetrators
responsibilities for the abuse; in relieving women from role expectations and
obligations or in burdening them with further responsibilities; and in
supporting or challenging their pathways out of domestic abuse. Our analysis
suggests that social isolation cannot be considered a simple result of a lack
of support but of the complex dynamics in which support is offered and accepted
or withdrawn and refused.

"2111.13105","Fei Yang","Fei Yang, Yaxing Wang, Luis Herranz, Yongmei Cheng, Mikhail Mozerov","A Novel Framework for Image-to-image Translation and Image Compression","14 pages, 15 figures, accepted by Neurocomputing",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-driven paradigms using machine learning are becoming ubiquitous in image
processing and communications. In particular, image-to-image (I2I) translation
is a generic and widely used approach to image processing problems, such as
image synthesis, style transfer, and image restoration. At the same time,
neural image compression has emerged as a data-driven alternative to
traditional coding approaches in visual communications. In this paper, we study
the combination of these two paradigms into a joint I2I compression and
translation framework, focusing on multi-domain image synthesis. We first
propose distributed I2I translation by integrating quantization and entropy
coding into an I2I translation framework (i.e. I2Icodec). In practice, the
image compression functionality (i.e. autoencoding) is also desirable,
requiring to deploy alongside I2Icodec a regular image codec. Thus, we further
propose a unified framework that allows both translation and autoencoding
capabilities in a single codec. Adaptive residual blocks conditioned on the
translation/compression mode provide flexible adaptation to the desired
functionality. The experiments show promising results in both I2I translation
and image compression using a single model.

236 pulsars using data from the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3)
combined with data from the second observing run (O2). Searches were for
emission from the $l=m=2$ mass quadrupole mode with a frequency at only twice
the pulsar rotation frequency (single harmonic) and the $l=2, m=1,2$ modes with
a frequency of both once and twice the rotation frequency (dual harmonic). No
evidence of GWs was found so we present 95\% credible upper limits on the
strain amplitudes $h_0$ for the single harmonic search along with limits on the
pulsars' mass quadrupole moments $Q_{22}$ and ellipticities $\varepsilon$. Of
the pulsars studied, 23 have strain amplitudes that are lower than the limits
calculated from their electromagnetically measured spin-down rates. These
pulsars include the millisecond pulsars J0437\textminus4715 and
J0711\textminus6830 which have spin-down ratios of 0.87 and 0.57 respectively.
For nine pulsars, their spin-down limits have been surpassed for the first
time. For the Crab and Vela pulsars our limits are factors of $\sim 100$ and
$\sim 20$ more constraining than their spin-down limits, respectively. For the
dual harmonic searches, new limits are placed on the strain amplitudes $C_{21}$
and $C_{22}$. For 23 pulsars we also present limits on the emission amplitude
assuming dipole radiation as predicted by Brans-Dicke theory.

robustness and generalization. The identify-emphasize paradigm shows a
promising effect in dealing with unknown biases. However, we find that it is
still plagued by two challenges: A, the quality of the identified
bias-conflicting samples is far from satisfactory; B, the emphasizing
strategies just yield suboptimal performance. In this work, for challenge A, we
propose an effective bias-conflicting scoring method to boost the
identification accuracy with two practical strategies -- peer-picking and
epoch-ensemble. For challenge B, we point out that the gradient contribution
statistics can be a reliable indicator to inspect whether the optimization is
dominated by bias-aligned samples. Then, we propose gradient alignment, which
employs gradient statistics to balance the contributions of the mined
bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples dynamically throughout the learning
process, forcing models to leverage intrinsic features to make fair decisions.
Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets in various settings,
demonstrating that the proposed solution can alleviate the impact of unknown
biases and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

reconstruction. Given its simplicity and high quality rendering, many NeRF
applications are being developed. However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow
speed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference,
including intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated
data structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this
work, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic
techniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF),
integrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only
requiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull,
which can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field
separation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We
provide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF
codebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular
visual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the
highly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering
quality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF
training from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of
a classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can
empower and accelerate new NeRF extensions and applications, with its
simplicity, portability, and reliable performance gains. Codes are available at

comparison method based on network embedding, i.e., \textit{DeepWalk}, which
considers the global structural information. In detail, we calculate the
distance between nodes through the vector extracted by \textit{DeepWalk} and
quantify the network dissimilarity by spectral entropy based Jensen-Shannon
divergences of the distribution of the node distances. Experiments on both
synthetic and empirical data show that our method outperforms the baseline
methods and can distinguish networks perfectly by only using the global

``$\cal{F}$-free'' if $G$ does not contain any graph in $\cal{F}$ as a

of $H$ have the same color. Given an integer $s$ and a finite family of graphs
$\cal{F}$, let $\ell(s,\cal{F})$ denote the smallest integer such that any
properly vertex-colored $\cal{F}$-free graph $G$ having $\chi(G)\geq
\ell(s,\cal{F})$ contains an induced rainbow path on $s$ vertices. Scott and
Seymour showed that $\ell(s,K)$ exists for every complete graph $K$. A
conjecture of N.~R.~Aravind states that $\ell(s,C_3)=s$. The upper bound on
$\ell(s,C_3)$ that can be obtained using the methods of Scott and Seymour
setting $K=C_3$ are, however, super-exponential. Gy\'arf\'as and S\'ark\""ozy
showed that $\ell(s,\{C_3,C_4\})=\cal{O}\big((2s)^{2s}\big)$. For $r\geq 2$, we
show that $\ell(s,K_{2,r})\leq (r-1)(s-1)s/2+s$ and therefore,
$\ell(s,C_4)\leq\frac{s^2+s}{2}$. This significantly improves Gy\'arf\'as and
S\'ark\""ozy's bound and also covers a bigger class of graphs. We adapt our
proof to achieve much stronger upper bounds for graphs of higher girth: we
prove that $\ell(s,\{C_3,C_4,\ldots,C_{g-1}\})\leq s^{1+\frac{4}{g-4}}$, where
$g\geq 5$. Moreover, in each case, our results imply the existence of at least
$s!/2$ distinct induced rainbow paths on $s$ vertices. Along the way, we obtain
some new results on an oriented variant of the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture.
For $r\geq 2$, let $\cal{B}_r$ denote the orientations of $K_{2,r}$ in which
one vertex has out-degree $r$. We show that every $\cal{B}_r$-free oriented

least $2s^{1+\frac{4}{g-4}}$ contains every oriented tree on at most $s$

assumes isolated environments and no prior knowledge or experience. However, in
the real world, agents learn in many environments and always come with prior
experiences as they explore new ones. Exploration is a lifelong process. In
this paper, we propose a paradigm change in the formulation and evaluation of
task-agnostic exploration. In this setup, the agent first learns to explore
across many environments without any extrinsic goal in a task-agnostic manner.
Later on, the agent effectively transfers the learned exploration policy to
better explore new environments when solving tasks. In this context, we
evaluate several baseline exploration strategies and present a simple yet
effective approach to learning task-agnostic exploration policies. Our key idea
is that there are two components of exploration: (1) an agent-centric component
encouraging exploration of unseen parts of the environment based on an agent's
belief; (2) an environment-centric component encouraging exploration of
inherently interesting objects. We show that our formulation is effective and
provides the most consistent exploration across several training-testing
environment pairs. We also introduce benchmarks and metrics for evaluating
task-agnostic exploration strategies. The source code is available at

service aimed at providing the scientific community with a search service for
all potential detections of SSOs among the ESA astronomy archival imaging data.
We illustrate its functionalities using the case of asteroid (16) Psyche, for
which no information in the far-IR (70-500 {\mu}m) has previously been
reported, to derive its thermal properties in preparation for the upcoming NASA
Psyche mission. This service performs a geometrical cross-match of the orbital
path of each object with respect to the public high-level imaging footprints
stored in the ESA archives. For this first release, three missions were chosen:
XMM-Newton, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Herschel Observatory. We
present a catalog listing all potential detections of asteroids within
estimated limiting magnitude or flux limit in Herschel, XMM-Newton, and HST
archival imaging data, including 909 serendipitous detections in Herschel
images, 985 in XMM-Newton Optical Monitor camera images, and over 32,000
potential serendipitous detections in HST images. We also present a case study:
the analysis of the thermal properties of Psyche from four serendipitous
Herschel detections, combined with previously published thermal IR
measurements. We see strong evidence for an unusual drop in (hemispherical
spectral) emissivity, from 0.9 at 100 {\mu}m down to about 0.6 at 350 {\mu}m,
followed by a possible but not well-constrained increase towards 500 {\mu}m,
comparable to what was found for Vesta. The combined thermal data set puts a
strong constraint on Psyche's thermal inertia (between 20 to 80$J m^{-2}
s^{-1/2} K^{-1}$) and favours an intermediate to low level surface roughness
(below 0.4 for the rms of surface slopes).

Alongside traditional metrics such as throughput and jitter, one must ensure
the generated entanglement is of sufficiently high quality. Meeting such
performance requirements demands a careful orchestration of many devices in the
network, giving rise to a fundamentally new scheduling problem. Furthermore,
technological limitations of near-term quantum devices impose significant

this work, we propose the first end-to-end design of a centralized quantum

which meets quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of applications. We achieve
this by using a centrally constructed schedule that manages usage of devices

resource-constrained project scheduling techniques, including a novel

In this work, we show that the anisotropy of the excitonic shell permittivity
can drastically affect the optical spectra of such hybrid nanostructures. This
fact is confirmed by directly comparing our theory with some available
experimental data, which cannot be treated using conventional isotropic shell
models. We have analyzed the influence of the shell anisotropy on the optical
spectra and proposed a type of hybrid nanostructure that seems most convenient
for experimental observation of the effects associated with the anisotropy of
the excitonic shell. A strong dependence of the anisotropic properties of the
J-aggregate shell on the material of the intermediate spacer layer is
demonstrated. This allows proposing a new way to effectively control the
optical properties of metal-organic nanostructures by selecting the spacer

every known eukaryotic cell. These structures play a pivotal role in specific
cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by allowing cells to explore their
environment, generate mechanical forces, perform chemical signaling, or convey
signals via intercellular tunneling nano-bridges. The dynamics of filopodia
appear quite complex as they exhibit a rich behavior of buckling, pulling,
length and shape changes. Here, we show that filopodia additionally explore
their 3D extracellular space by combining growth and shrinking with axial
twisting and buckling of their actin rich core. Importantly, the actin core
inside filopodia performs a twisting or spinning motion which is observed for a
range of highly distinct and cognate cell types spanning from earliest
development to highly differentiated tissue cells. Non-equilibrium physical
modeling of actin and myosin confirm that twist, and hence rotation, is an
emergent phenomenon of active filaments confined in a narrow channel which
points to a generic mechanism present in all cells. Our measurements confirm
that filopodia exert traction forces and form helical buckles in a range of
different cell types that can be ascribed to accumulation of sufficient twist.
These results lead us to conclude that activity induced twisting of the actin
shaft is a general mechanism underlying fundamental functions of filopodia.

measure of interest over different studies and present a meaningful summary.
They must address between study heterogeneity in several dimensions and
eliminate spurious sources of variation. Forest plots of the usual (adjusted)

the magnitude and interpretation of these hazard ratios depend on factors
ancillary to the true study-specific exposure effect. These factors generally
include the study duration, the censoring patterns within studies, the
covariates adjusted for and their distribution over exposure groups. Ignoring
these mentioned features and accepting implausible hidden assumptions may
critically affect interpretation of the pooled effect measure.
  Risk differences or restricted mean effects over a common follow-up interval
and balanced distribution of a covariate set are natural candidates for
exposure evaluation and possible treatment choice. In this paper, we propose
differently standardized survival curves over a fitting time horizon, targeting
various estimands with their own transportability. With each type of
standardization comes a given interpretation within studies and overall, under
stated assumptions. These curves can in turn be summarized by standardized
study-specific contrasts, including hazard ratios with more consistent meaning.

currently challenge the cold dark matter (CDM) model, as warm particles
suppress structure formation due to free-streaming effects. Observing
small-scale matter distribution provides a valuable way to distinguish between
CDM and WDM. In this work, we use observations from the Dark Energy Survey and
PanSTARRS1, which observe 270 Milky-Way satellites after completeness
corrections. We test WDM models by comparing the number of satellites in the
Milky Way with predictions derived from the Semi-Analytical SubHalo Inference
ModelIng (SASHIMI) code, which we develop based on the extended Press-Schechter
formalism and subhalos' tidal evolution prescription. We robustly rule out WDM
with masses lighter than 4.4 keV at 95% confidence level for the Milky-Way halo
mass of $10^{12} M_\odot$. The limits are a weak function of the (yet
uncertain) Milky-Way halo mass, and vary as $m_{\rm WDM}>3.6$-$5.1$ keV for
$(0.6$-$2.0) \times 10^{12} M_\odot$. For the sterile neutrinos that form a
subclass of WDM, we obtain the constraints of $m_{\nu_s}>11.6$ keV for the
Milky-Way halo mass of $10^{12} M_{\odot}$. These results based on SASHIMI do
not rely on any assumptions of galaxy formation physics or are not limited by
numerical resolution. The models, therefore, offer a robust and fast way to
constrain the WDM models. By applying a satellite forming condition, however,
we can rule out the WDM mass lighter than 9.0 keV for the Milky-Way halo mass
of $10^{12} M_\odot$.

onto relatively cool and hot white dwarfs of different abundances of carbon and
oxygen. The simulation code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics

properties like surface gravity (g), helium luminosity ($L_{He}$), and
effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) during the accretion phase of the white
dwarfs. We also calculate the ignition density (${\rho}_{He}$) and ignition
temperature ($T_{He}$) of helium burning. As expected, the size of WD decreases
and g increases during the accretion. However, a red-giant-like expansion is
observed after the rapid ignition towards the end. The dependence of helium
accreting WD evolution on its composition has also been explored in this study.
We find that white dwarfs of the lower abundance of carbon accrete slightly
longer before the onset of helium ignition.

problems by training extremely deep networks via back-propagation. A direct
application of back-propagation to spiking neural networks contains
biologically implausible components, like the weight transport problem or
separate inference and learning phases. Various methods address different
components individually, but a complete solution remains intangible. Here, we
take an alternate approach that avoids back-propagation and its associated
issues entirely. Recent work in deep learning proposed independently training
each layer of a network via the information bottleneck (IB). Subsequent studies
noted that this layer-wise approach circumvents error propagation across
layers, leading to a biologically plausible paradigm. Unfortunately, the IB is
computed using a batch of samples. The prior work addresses this with a weight
update that only uses two samples (the current and previous sample). Our work
takes a different approach by decomposing the weight update into a local and
global component. The local component is Hebbian and only depends on the
current sample. The global component computes a layer-wise modulatory signal
that depends on a batch of samples. We show that this modulatory signal can be
learned by an auxiliary circuit with working memory (WM) like a reservoir.
Thus, we can use batch sizes greater than two, and the batch size determines
the required capacity of the WM. To the best of our knowledge, our rule is the
first biologically plausible mechanism to directly couple synaptic updates with
a WM of the task. We evaluate our rule on synthetic datasets and image
classification datasets like MNIST, and we explore the effect of the WM
capacity on learning performance. We hope our work is a first-step towards
understanding the mechanistic role of memory in learning.

these revised stellar parameters to provide new planetary parameters and
simulate the orbital evolution of the system under the effects of tides and
atmospheric evaporation. Our fundamental parameters for Kepler-93: mean density

assumption of their covariance relative to arbitrary transformations of

Nevertheless, no actual verification of the necessity of this assumption has
been made to date. The paper proposes a theory of gravity with a constraint,
the degenerate variants of which are general relativity (GR) and the unimodular
theory of gravity. This constraint is interpreted from a physical point of view
as a sufficient condition for the adiabaticity of the process of the evolution
of the space-time metric. The original equations of the theory of gravity with
the constraint are formulated. On this basis, a unified model of the evolution
of the modern, early, and very early Universe is constructed that is consistent
with the observational astronomical data but does not require the hypotheses of
the existence of dark energy, dark matter or inflatons. It is claimed that:
physical time is anisotropic, the gravitational field is the main source of
energy of the Universe, the maximum global energy density in the Universe was
64 orders of magnitude smaller the Planckian one, and the entropy density is 18
orders of magnitude higher the value predicted by GR. The value of the relative
density of neutrinos at the present time and the maximum temperature of matter
in the early Universe are calculated. The wave equation of the gravitational
field is formulated, its solution is found, and the nonstationary wave function
of the very early Universe is constructed. It is shown that the birth of the
Universe was random.

annual season tickets, day tickets and hourly tickets (by up to 29%, 6% and
20%, respectively), demand increases by, on average, over five years, about
10.6%. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show how the synthetic
control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller,
2010) can be used to assess such (for policy-makers) important price reduction
effects in urban public transport. Furthermore, we propose an aggregate metric
that inherits changes in public transport supply (e.g., frequency increases) to
assess these demand effects, namely passenger trips per vehicle kilometre. This
metric helps us to isolate the impact of price reductions by ensuring that
companies' frequency increases do not affect estimators of interest. In
addition, we show how to investigate the robustness of results in similar
settings. Using a recent statistical method and a different study design, i.e.,
not blocking off supply changes as an alternate explanation of the effect,
leads us to a lower bound of the effect, amounting to an increase of 3.7%.
Finally, as far as we know, it is the first causal estimate of price reduction
on urban public transport initiated by direct democracy.

Minkowski core, we can consider two copies of the space-time connected through
a short-throat wormhole whose radius of mouth is equal to or larger than an
extremal regular black hole with asymptotically Minkowski core's event horizon
radius. If the wormhole is traversable and smooth, fluxes in these two
space-times will interact with and flow into each other. On the cosmological
scale, gravity is a candidate for the flux. As the gravitational field changes
in one space-time, the behaviours of stars around the wormhole will be affected
by the other space-time since we assume there exists enough exotic matter to
keep the wormhole open. The changes in a gravitational field can be quantized
through the gauge invariant perturbations. The variances in orbits of stars can
be reflected by changes in the kinematic shifts of photon frequencies. Then, we
use this to distinguish between the black hole and wormhole generated by the
same space-time line element, since black hole can not connect two space-times

classifiers is mostly end-to-end learning, and the loss function is the
constraint on the final output (posterior probability) of the network, so the
existence of Softmax is essential. In the case of end-to-end learning, there is
usually no effective loss function that completely relies on the features of
the middle layer to restrict learning, resulting in the distribution of sample
latent features is not optimal, so there is still room for improvement in
classification accuracy. Based on the concept of Predefined Evenly-Distributed
Class Centroids (PEDCC), this article proposes a Softmax-free loss function
based on predefined optimal-distribution of latent features-POD Loss. The loss
function only restricts the latent features of the samples, including the
norm-adaptive Cosine distance between the latent feature vector of the sample
and the center of the predefined evenly-distributed class, and the correlation
between the latent features of the samples. Finally, Cosine distance is used
for classification. Compared with the commonly used Softmax Loss, some typical
Softmax related loss functions and PEDCC-Loss, experiments on several commonly
used datasets on several typical deep learning classification networks show
that the classification performance of POD Loss is always significant better
and easier to converge. Code is available in

forum (OEF) where students and instructor discuss open-ended questions for
gaining better understanding of the subject. However, empirical studies have
repeatedly shown that the dropout rates in these online courses are very high
partly due to the lack of motivation among the enrolled students. We undertake
an empirical comparison of student behavior in OEFs associated with a
graduate-level course during two terms. We identify key parameters dictating
the dynamics of OEFs like effective incentive design, student heterogeneity,
and super-posters phenomenon. Motivated by empirical observations, we propose
an analytical model based on continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to capture
instructor-student interactions in an OEF. Using concepts from lumpability of
CTMCs, we compute steady state and transient probabilities along with expected
net-rewards for the instructor and the students. We formulate a mixed-integer
linear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers
Stackelberg game. Through simulations, we observe that students exhibit varied
degree of non-monotonicity in their participation (with increasing instructor
involvement). We also study the effect of instructor bias and budget on the
student participation levels. Our model exhibits the empirically observed
super-poster phenomenon under certain parameter configurations and recommends
an optimal plan to the instructor for maximizing student participation in OEFs.

systems designed to perform tasks autonomously? Such systems are increasingly
ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral
responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any
particular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been
proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing
conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans;
however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet
inexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under
meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between
philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an
iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for
AI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of
two applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a
system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly
defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to
operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate
and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a
human should be commensurate with that human's ability and authority to control
the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the
AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We
argue that these four properties will support practically-minded professionals
to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that
facilitate meaningful human control.

the expensive computation of DNNs and save a lot of energy consumption.
However, high training and inference latency is a limitation of the development
of deeper SNNs. SNNs usually need tens or even hundreds of time steps during
the training and inference process which causes not only the increase of
latency but also the waste of energy consumption. To overcome this problem, we
proposed a novel training method based on backpropagation (BP) for ultra-low
latency(1-2 time steps) SNN with multi-threshold. In order to increase the
information capacity of each spike, we introduce the multi-threshold Leaky
Integrate and Fired (LIF) model. In our proposed training method, we proposed
three approximated derivative for spike activity to solve the problem of the
non-differentiable issue which cause difficulties for direct training SNNs
based on BP. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an
average accuracy of 99.56%, 93.08%, and 87.90% on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and
CIFAR10, respectively with only 2 time steps. For the CIFAR10 dataset, our
proposed method achieve 1.12% accuracy improvement over the previously reported
direct trained SNNs with fewer time steps.

power profiles over the spectral and spatial domains in the fiber span. The
proposed framework adjusts the Raman pump power values to obtain the desired
two-dimensional (2D) profiles using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
followed by the differential evolution (DE) technique. The CNN learns the
mapping between the 2D profiles and their corresponding pump power values using
a data-set generated by exciting the amplification setup. Nonetheless, its
performance is not accurate for designing 2D profiles of practical interest,
such as a 2D flat or a 2D symmetric (with respect to the middle point in
distance). To adjust the pump power values more accurately, the DE fine-tunes
the power values initialized by the CNN to design the proposed 2D profile with
a lower cost value. In the fine-tuning process, the DE employs the direct
amplification model which consists of 8 bidirectional propagating pumps,
including 2 second-order and 6 first order, in an 80 km fiber span. We evaluate
the framework to design broadband 2D flat and symmetric power profiles, as two
goals for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system performing over the
whole C-band. Results indicate the framework's ability to achieve maximum power
excursion of 2.81 dB for a 2D flat, and maximum asymmetry of 14% for a 2D
symmetric profile.

posits that the concept of reward maximisation is sufficient to underpin all
intelligence, both natural and artificial. We contest the underlying assumption
of Silver et al. that such reward can be scalar-valued. In this paper we
explain why scalar rewards are insufficient to account for some aspects of both
biological and computational intelligence, and argue in favour of explicitly
multi-objective models of reward maximisation. Furthermore, we contend that
even if scalar reward functions can trigger intelligent behaviour in specific
cases, it is still undesirable to use this approach for the development of
artificial general intelligence due to unacceptable risks of unsafe or
unethical behaviour.
