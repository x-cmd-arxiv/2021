the same property. In the next section the characterization of conformal Ricci
solitons on warped product manifolds in terms of Killing and conformal vector

metric dimension of a unicyclic graph G always take values from just two
explicitly given consecutive integers that are derived from the structure of
the graph. A natural problem that arises is to determine under what conditions
these dimensions take each of the two possible values. In this paper for each
of these two metric dimensions we characterize three graph configurations and
prove that it takes the greater of the two possible values if and only if the
graph contains at least one of these configurations. One of these
configurations is the same for both dimensions, while the other two are
specific for each of them. This enables us to establish the exact value of the
metric dimensions for a unicyclic graph and also to characterize when each of
these two dimensions is greater than the other one.

and loop valence bond observables introduced by Lin and Sandvik as well as the
valence bond entropy and the second Renyi entropy. For the bisecting of the
Bethe cluster, in disagreement with our previous results and in agreement with

entropy scale as the logarithm of the number of sites in the cluster. For
bisecting the L X L - L X L clusters, the valence bond entropy scales as L,
however, the loop entropy and the entanglement entropy scale as ln(L). For the

interest, many fundamental questions related to the mechanisms controlling the
appearance and stability of ferroelectric topological structures remain open.
In this context, ferroelectric nanoparticles provide a flexible playground for
such investigations. Here, we present a theoretical study of ferroelectric
polar textures in a cylindrical core-shell nanoparticle. The calculations
reveal a chiral polarization structure containing two oppositely oriented
diffuse axial domains located near the cylinder ends, separated by a region
with a zero-axial polarization. We name this polarization configuration
""flexon"" to underline the flexoelectric nature of its axial polarization.
Analytical calculations and numerical simulation results show that the flexon's
chirality can be switched by reversing the sign of the flexoelectric
coefficient. Furthermore, the anisotropy of the flexoelectric coupling is found
to critically influence the polarization texture and domain morphology. The
flexon rounded shape, combined with its distinct chiral properties and the
localization nature near the surface, are reminiscent of Chiral Bobber
structures in magnetism. In the azimuthal plane, the flexon displays the
polarization state of a vortex with an axially polarized core region, i.e., a
meron. The flexoelectric effect, which couples the electric polarization and
elastic strain gradients, plays a determining role in the stabilization of
these chiral states. We discuss similarities between this interaction and the

computed using a variety of standard techniques, which suffer from physical and
computational limitations. Here, we present an efficient and accurate method
that overcomes the drawbacks of previously used approaches. In particular,
finite-size effects are avoided as each phase is calculated separately; the
plasma electrons and volume changes are explicitly taken into account; and
arbitrary analytic fits to simulation data are avoided. Furthermore, no
simulations at uninteresting state conditions, i.e., away from the phase
coexistence curves, are required, which improves the efficiency of the
technique. The method consists of an adaptation of the so-called Gibbs-Duhem
integration approach to electron-ion plasmas, where the coexistence curve is
determined by direct numerical integration of its underlying Clapeyron
equation. The thermodynamics properties of the coexisting phases are evaluated
separately using Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric semi-grand canonical
ensemble. We describe this Monte Carlo-based Clapeyron integration method,
including its basic principles, our extension to electron-ion plasmas, and our
numerical implementation. We illustrate its applicability and benefits with the
calculation of the melting curve of dense C/O plasmas under conditions relevant
for white dwarf cores and provide analytic fits to implement this new melting
curve in white dwarf models. While this work focuses on the liquid-solid phase
boundary of dense two-component plasmas, a wider range of physical systems and
phase boundaries are within the scope of the Clapeyron integration method,
which had until now only been applied to simple model systems of neutral
particles.

hole density of states can be computed using classical Euclidean gravity. In
this work we argue for another entry in the dictionary between Euclidean
gravity and black hole physics, namely that Euclidean wormholes describe a
coarse-grained approximation to the energy level statistics of black hole
microstates. To do so we use the method of constrained instantons to obtain an
integral representation of wormhole amplitudes in Einstein gravity and in
full-fledged AdS/CFT. These amplitudes are non-perturbative corrections to the
two-boundary problem in AdS quantum gravity. The full amplitude is likely UV
sensitive, dominated by small wormholes, but we show it admits an integral
transformation with a macroscopic, weakly curved saddle-point approximation.
The saddle is the ""double cone"" geometry of Saad, Shenker, and Stanford, with
fixed moduli. In the boundary description this saddle appears to dominate a
smeared version of the connected two-point function of the black hole density
of states, and suggests level repulsion in the microstate spectrum. Using these
methods we further study Euclidean wormholes in pure Einstein gravity and in
IIB supergravity on Euclidean AdS$_5\times\mathbb{S}^5$. We address the
perturbative stability of these backgrounds and study brane nucleation
instabilities in 10d supergravity. In particular, brane nucleation
instabilities of the Euclidean wormholes are lifted by the analytic
continuation required to obtain the Lorentzian spectral form factor from
gravity. Our results indicate a factorization paradox in AdS/CFT.

correcting errors, numerous techniques have been proposed for achieving

Suppression by Derangements (ESD) and Virtual Distillation (VD) techniques. The
approach exponentially suppresses errors and ultimately allows one to measure
expectation values in the pure state as the dominant eigenvector of the noisy
quantum state. Interestingly this dominant eigenvector is, however, different
than the ideal computational state and it is the aim of the present work to
comprehensively explore the following fundamental question: how significantly
different are these two pure states? The motivation for this work is two-fold.
First, comprehensively understanding the effect of this coherent mismatch is of
fundamental importance for the successful exploitation of noisy quantum
devices. As such, the present work rigorously establishes that in practically
relevant scenarios the coherent mismatch is exponentially less severe than the
incoherent decay of the fidelity -- where the latter can be suppressed
exponentially via the ESD/VD technique. Second, the above question is closely
related to central problems in mathematics, such as bounding eigenvalues of a
sum of two matrices (Weyl inequalities) -- solving of which was a major
breakthrough. The present work can be viewed as a first step towards extending
the Weyl inequalities to eigenvectors of a sum of two matrices -- and
completely resolves this problem for the special case of the considered density
matrices.

an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with half the strength of the original potential

annotated datasets, but collecting mask annotations at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We address the partially supervised instance segmentation problem in
which one can train on (significantly cheaper) bounding boxes for all
categories but use masks only for a subset of categories. In this work, we
focus on a popular family of models which apply differentiable cropping to a
feature map and predict a mask based on the resulting crop. Under this family,
we study Mask R-CNN and discover that instead of its default strategy of
training the mask-head with a combination of proposals and groundtruth boxes,
training the mask-head with only groundtruth boxes dramatically improves its
performance on novel classes. This training strategy also allows us to take
advantage of alternative mask-head architectures, which we exploit by replacing
the typical mask-head of 2-4 layers with significantly deeper off-the-shelf
architectures (e.g. ResNet, Hourglass models). While many of these
architectures perform similarly when trained in fully supervised mode, our main
finding is that they can generalize to novel classes in dramatically different
ways. We call this ability of mask-heads to generalize to unseen classes the
strong mask generalization effect and show that without any specialty modules
or losses, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in the partially supervised
COCO instance segmentation benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate that our effect
is general, holding across underlying detection methodologies (including

unseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation,
we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-D

  Message Passing","43 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Functional principal components analysis is a popular tool for inference on
functional data. Standard approaches rely on an eigendecomposition of a
smoothed covariance surface in order to extract the orthonormal functions
representing the major modes of variation. This approach can be a
computationally intensive procedure, especially in the presence of large
datasets with irregular observations. In this article, we develop a Bayesian
approach, which aims to determine the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition directly
without the need to smooth and estimate a covariance surface. More
specifically, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm via message passing
over a factor graph, which is more commonly referred to as variational message
passing. Message passing algorithms are a powerful tool for compartmentalizing
the algebra and coding required for inference in hierarchical statistical
models. Recently, there has been much focus on formulating variational
inference algorithms in the message passing framework because it removes the
need for rederiving approximate posterior density functions if there is a
change to the model. Instead, model changes are handled by changing specific
computational units, known as fragments, within the factor graph. We extend the
notion of variational message passing to functional principal components
analysis. Indeed, this is the first article to address a functional data model
via variational message passing. Our approach introduces two new fragments that
are necessary for Bayesian functional principal components analysis. We present
the computational details, a set of simulations for assessing accuracy and
speed and an application to United States temperature data.

arise in low-density two-dimensional electron systems, with signatures observed

Here we show that gate-tuned van Hove singularities in rhombohedral trilayer
graphene drive the spontaneous ferromagnetic polarization of the electron
system into one or more spin- and valley flavors. Using capacitance
measurements on graphite-gated van der Waals heterostructures, we find a
cascade of density- and electronic displacement field tuned phase transitions
marked by negative electronic compressibility. The transitions define the
boundaries between phases where quantum oscillations have either four-fold,
two-fold, or one-fold degeneracy, associated with a spin and valley degenerate
normal metal, spin-polarized `half-metal', and spin and valley polarized
`quarter metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient features are
well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model with a valley-anisotropic
Hund's coupling, likely arising from interactions at the lattice scale. For
hole filling, we observe a richer phase diagram featuring a delicate interplay
of broken symmetries and transitions in the Fermi surface topology. Finally, by
rotational alignment of a hexagonal boron nitride substrate to induce a moir\'e
superlattice, we find that the superlattice perturbs the preexisting isospin
order only weakly, leaving the basic phase diagram intact while catalyzing the
formation of topologically nontrivial gapped states whenever itinerant half- or
quarter metal states occur at half- or quarter superlattice band filling. Our
results show that rhombohedral trilayer graphene is an ideal platform for
well-controlled tests of many-body theory and reveal magnetism in moir\'e
materials to be fundamentally itinerant in nature.

algebraic connectivity of a graph is particularly important because it provides
the convergence rates of consensus algorithms that underlie many multi-agent

connectivity can inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the topology

present a method to release a graph's algebraic connectivity under a

Edge differential privacy obfuscates differences among graphs' edge sets and
thus conceals the absence or presence of sensitive connections therein. We
provide privacy with bounded Laplace noise, which improves accuracy relative to
conventional unbounded noise. The private algebraic connectivity values are
analytically shown to provide accurate estimates of consensus convergence
rates, as well as accurate bounds on the diameter of a graph and the mean
distance between its nodes. Simulation results confirm the utility of private

routinely been used in mesoscopic physics to understand nanowire experiments

(MW). We use proper motions (PMs) from the $Gaia$ Early Data Release 3 (EDR3)
and line-of-sight velocities ($v_{\mathrm{los}}$) available in the literature
to derive the systemic 3D motion of these systems. For six of them, namely the
Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSph), we study the internal kinematics projecting the stellar PMs
into radial, $V_R$ (expansion/contraction), and tangential, $V_T$ (rotation),
velocity components with respect to the centre of mass. We find significant
rotation in the Carina ($|V_T| = 9.6 \pm 4.5 \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1}}}\>$), Fornax
($|V_T| = 2.8 \pm 1.3 \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1}}}\>$), and Sculptor ($|V_T| = 3.0 \pm
1.0 \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1}}}\>$) dSphs. Besides the Sagittarius dSph, these are the
first measurements of internal rotation in the plane of the sky in the MW's
classical dSphs. All galaxies except Carina show $|V_T| / \sigma_v < 1$. We
find that slower rotators tend to show, on average, larger sky-projected
ellipticity (as expected for a sample with random viewing angles) and are
located at smaller Galactocentric distances (as expected for tidal stirring
scenarios in which rotation is transformed into random motions as satellites
sink into the parent halo). However, these trends are small and not
statistically significant, indicating that rotation has not played a dominant
role in shaping the 3D structure of these galaxies. Either tidal stirring had a
weak impact on the evolution of these systems or it perturbed them with similar
efficiency regardless of their current Galactocentric distance.

maximize the near-field enhancement (NF-type) and far-field outcoupling

shown that in case of moderate concentration the nanorod has more advantages:
smaller lasing threshold, larger slope efficiency and achieved intensities in
the near-field, in addition in FF-type system smaller gain and outflow
threshold, earlier flipping and larger far-field out-coupling efficiency.
However, the near-field (far-field) bandwidth is smaller in for NF-type
(FF-type) core-shell nanoresonators. In case of larger concentration although
the slope efficiency and near-field intensity remain larger and the far-field
redistribution is more efficient in case of the nanorod, the core-shell
nanoresonator is more advantageous, taking into account the smaller lasing,
outflow, absorption and extinction cross-section thresholds, as well as the
larger internal and external quantum efficiencies. In addition to this the
bandwidth of core-shell nanoresonator is also smaller. It was also shown that
the strong-coupling of time-competing plasmonic modes accompanies the
transition from lasing to spasing.

Our first model of the SPVP comprises $N_{P}$ spin-polarized modes (subprobes),
each of which is locally tunnel-coupled to the HES, while the SPVP, as a whole,
is subjected to a self-consistency condition ensuring zero average current on
the probe. We carry out a numerical analysis which shows that the optimal
situation for reading off spin-resolved voltage from the HES depends on the
interplay of the probe-edge tunnel-coupling and the number of modes in the
probe ($N_P$). We further investigate the stability of our findings by
introducing Gaussian fluctuations in {\it{(i)}} the tunnel-coupling between the
subprobes and the HES about a chosen average value and {\it{(ii)}}
spin-polarization of the subprobes about a chosen direction of the net
polarization of SPVP. We also perform a numerical analysis corresponding to the
situation where four such SPVPs are implemented in a self-consistent fashion
across a ferromagnetic barrier on the HES and demonstrate that this model
facilitates the measurements of spin-resolved four-probe voltage drops across
the ferromagnetic barrier. As a second model, we employ the edge state of a
quantum anomalous Hall state (QAHS) as the SPVP which is tunnel-coupled over an
extended region with the HES. A two-dimensional lattice simulation for the
quantum transport of the proposed device setup comprising a junction of QSHS

can capture properties such as multi-view consistency and view-dependent
lighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing of
single objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity of
realistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representational
capacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to larger
and more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learned
prior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantly
different from observed viewpoints. When compared to existing models, GSN
produces quantitatively higher-quality scene renderings across several
different scene datasets.

better protect ML systems against adversarial attacks, several questions are
raised: what are the sufficient conditions for adversarial transferability and
how to bound it? Is there a way to reduce the adversarial transferability in
order to improve the robustness of an ensemble ML model? To answer these
questions, in this work we first theoretically analyze and outline sufficient
conditions for adversarial transferability between models; then propose a
practical algorithm to reduce the transferability between base models within an
ensemble to improve its robustness. Our theoretical analysis shows that only
promoting the orthogonality between gradients of base models is not enough to
ensure low transferability; in the meantime, the model smoothness is an
important factor to control the transferability. We also provide the lower and
upper bounds of adversarial transferability under certain conditions. Inspired
by our theoretical analysis, we propose an effective Transferability Reduced
Smooth(TRS) ensemble training strategy to train a robust ensemble with low
transferability by enforcing both gradient orthogonality and model smoothness

its behavior is complex and not fully understood. Ideally, one would like to
think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at
hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the
linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average
prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the
same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular
estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and
Mallow's Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error
derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level.
Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are
correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual
estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation
scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and we show empirically that
this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in

missing pixels in a way coherent with the neighboring pixels -- outpainting can
be achieved in more diverse ways since the problem is less constrained by the
surrounding pixels. Existing image outpainting methods pose the problem as a
conditional image-to-image translation task, often generating repetitive
structures and textures by replicating the content available in the input
image. In this work, we formulate the problem from the perspective of inverting
generative adversarial networks. Our generator renders micro-patches
conditioned on their joint latent code as well as their individual positions in
the image. To outpaint an image, we seek for multiple latent codes not only
recovering available patches but also synthesizing diverse outpainting by
patch-based generation. This leads to richer structure and content in the
outpainted regions. Furthermore, our formulation allows for outpainting
conditioned on the categorical input, thereby enabling flexible user controls.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs
favorably against existing in- and outpainting methods, featuring higher visual

guide the network to fuse features from previous fragments. This design allows
the network to capture local smoothness prior and global shape prior of 3D

Project page: https://www.ye-yuan.com/simpoe/",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate estimation of 3D human motion from monocular video requires modeling
both kinematics (body motion without physical forces) and dynamics (motion with
physical forces). To demonstrate this, we present SimPoE, a Simulation-based
approach for 3D human Pose Estimation, which integrates image-based kinematic
inference and physics-based dynamics modeling. SimPoE learns a policy that
takes as input the current-frame pose estimate and the next image frame to
control a physically-simulated character to output the next-frame pose
estimate. The policy contains a learnable kinematic pose refinement unit that
uses 2D keypoints to iteratively refine its kinematic pose estimate of the next
frame. Based on this refined kinematic pose, the policy learns to compute
dynamics-based control (e.g., joint torques) of the character to advance the
current-frame pose estimate to the pose estimate of the next frame. This design
couples the kinematic pose refinement unit with the dynamics-based control
generation unit, which are learned jointly with reinforcement learning to
achieve accurate and physically-plausible pose estimation. Furthermore, we
propose a meta-control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the character's
dynamics parameters based on the character state to attain more accurate pose
estimates. Experiments on large-scale motion datasets demonstrate that our
approach establishes the new state of the art in pose accuracy while ensuring
physical plausibility.

distribution. In turn, the latter induces a separation of chiralities along the

between the chiral effects on the one hand, and presence of magnetic field of

analysis is based on $N$-body simulations in which the NSC forms by accretion
of massive stellar clusters around a supermassive black hole. We attach stellar
populations to our $N$-body particles and follow the evolution of their stars,
and the rate of collisions and close encounters. The most common encounters are
collisions between pairs of main-sequence stars, which lead to mergers:
destructive collisions between main-sequence stars and compact objects are
rare. We find that the effects of collisions on the stellar populations are
small for three reasons. First, our models possess a core which limits the
maximum stellar density. Secondly, the velocity dispersion in the NSC is
similar to the surface escape velocities of the stars, which minimises the
collision rate. Finally, whilst collisions between main-sequence stars destroy
bright giants by accelerating their evolution, they also create them by
accelerating the evolution of lower-mass stars. These two effects approximately
cancel out. We also investigate whether the G2 cloud could be a fuzzball: a
compact stellar core which has accreted a tenuous envelope in a close encounter
with a red giant. We conclude that fuzzballs with cores below $2\,M_\odot$ have
thermal times-scales too short to reproduce G2. A fuzzball with a black-hole

graphics and vision, such as modeling human bodies, faces, and hands. However,
the construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requires
heavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity and
details such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural Parametric
Models (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D
models, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. In
particular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space
representations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recent
developments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neural
parametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces
to fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric
model, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate
and detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs
improve notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in
reconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans and
hands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape/pose transfer experiments
further demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available at

potential energy surfaces (PESs) with a minimum number of electronic structure
calculations. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that superior
strategies can be obtained by sampling molecular structures corresponding to
large uncertainties in their predictions while at the same time not deviating
much from the true distribution of the data. To model PESs in an AL framework
we propose to use a regression version of stochastic query by forest, a hybrid
method that samples points corresponding to large uncertainties while avoiding
collecting too many points from sparse regions of space. The algorithm is
implemented with decision trees that come with relatively small computational
costs. We empirically show that this algorithm requires around half the data to
converge to the same accuracy in comparison to the uncertainty-based
query-by-committee algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm is fully automatic and
does not require any prior knowledge of the PES. Simulations on a 6D PES of
\pyrrolew show that $\mathord{<}15\,000$ configurations are enough to build a
PES with a generalization error of 16~\invcm, whereas the final model with
around 50\,000 configurations has a generalization error of 11~\invcm.

and detect pure spin currents. In graphene-based spin valves this is usually
achieved by injection of spin-polarized electrons from ferromagnetic contacts
via a tunnel barrier, with Al2O3 and MgO used most widely as barrier materials.
However, the requirement to make these barriers sufficiently thin often leads
to pinholes and low contact resistances which in turn results in low spin
injection efficiencies, typically 5% at room temperature, due to the so-called
resistance mismatch problem. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to
fabricate ultra-thin tunnel barrier contacts to graphene. We show that
laser-assisted chemical functionalization of graphene with sp3-bonded phenyl
groups effectively provides a seed layer for growth of ultrathin Al2O3 films,
ensuring smooth, high quality tunnel barriers and an enhanced spin injection
efficiency. Importantly, the effect of functionalization on spin transport in
the graphene channel itself is relatively weak, so that the enhanced spin
injection dominates and leads to an order of magnitude increase in spin
signals. Furthermore, spatial control of functionalization using a focused
laser beam and lithographic techniques can in principle be used to limit
functionalization to contact areas only, further reducing the effect on the
graphene channel. Our results open a new route towards circumventing the
resistance mismatch problem in graphene-based spintronic devices based on the
easily available and highly stable Al2O3, and facilitate a step forward in the
development of their practical applications.

closed topological vertex geometry, and some threefolds with compact

earlier in the unrefined case, implies that refined open BPS states are made of
a finite number of elementary BPS states, and asserts that all refined open BPS
invariants associated to a given brane are non-negative integers in consequence
of their relation to (integer and non-negative) motivic Donaldson-Thomas

dynamic and stochastic systems have been proposed but there is not a unified
consistent definition of causality in this context. We evaluate the performance
of ten prominent bivariate causality indices for time series data, across four
simulated model systems that have different coupling schemes and
characteristics. In further experiments, we show that these methods may not
always be invariant to real-world relevant transformations (data availability,
standardisation and scaling, rounding error, missing data and noisy data). We
recommend transfer entropy and nonlinear Granger causality as likely to be
particularly robust indices for estimating bivariate causal relationships in
real-world applications. Finally, we provide flexible open-access Python code
for computation of these methods and for the model simulations.

results show that GNRs junctions tend to open an energy gap when U-shaped
structures were formed due to the formation of quasi-bound states at zigzag
edges. The size of U shaped structures has enormous influences on the electron
transport of the system. We also considered the effect of corner form of the
U-shaped GNRs junctions on energy gap opening. It was found that as some carbon
atoms are add to the inner corner, the energy gap in U shaped GNRs
significantly changed. For patterned nanopores structured graphene, the

breath-hold -- the first without preparation, 6 images with saturation recovery
preparation, and 2 images with both saturation recovery and T2-preparation. T1
and T2 values were calculated using a 3-parameter model. mSASHA was validated

joint T1-T2 technique with a 4-parameter model. mSASHA values were compared to

  Results: mSASHA had high accuracy compared to reference spin-echo

mSASHA coefficient of variation (CoV) in phantoms for T1 was lower than MOLLI

had higher precision than 4-parameter joint T1-T2 fitting for both T1 and T2.
In-vivo myocardial mSASHA T1 was similar to conventional SASHA (1523+/-18 ms vs
1520+/-18 ms, p>0.05) with similar CoV to both MOLLI and SASHA (3.3+/-0.6% vs
3.1+/-0.6% and 3.3+/-0.5% respectively, p>0.05 for both). Myocardial mSASHA T2
values were 37.1+/-1.1 ms with similar precision to T2p-bSSFP (6.7+/-1.7% vs
6.0+/-1.6%, p>0.05).
  Conclusion: mSASHA provides high accuracy cardiac T1 and T2 quantification in
a single breath-hold, with similar precision to reference MOLLI and linear

vehicles (EVs). The emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2)
charging technology, which allows an EV with the extra battery to charge the
other EV on the move, offers a promising solution. Even though the physical
feasibility of this new technology has been confirmed, we still face many
operation problems. For example, how can we efficiently pair and route an
electricity provider (EP) to a demand (ED) without introducing an extra detour?
Motivated by this view, this study develops a Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS)
platform, which seeks to dispatches the commercial EPs to serve the EDs, for
cultivating this emerging charging service towards the low EV penetration
environment. Mathematically, the CaaS platform is modeled as a vehicle routing
problem (i.e., mE2-VRP), which optimally dispatches the EPs to approach and
serve the EDs on the move while minimizing the EP fleet size and fulfilling all
service requests. To adapt the CaaS platform to the online application in
practice, we develop the Clustering-aided Clarke and Wright Savings (CCWS)
algorithm to efficiently decompose and then solve the large-scale mE2-VRP by
parallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon citywide (Chicago) and
statewide (Florida) found that the CCWS algorithm outperforms existing
commercial solvers, and it enables us to investigate the performance of the
CaaS platform under a realistic large-scale setup in a city or state. The CaaS
performs better in low EV penetration markets while traffic congestion is mild
and EDs require energy earlier. We can improve the performance by developing
proper pricing strategies according to the EDs' energy requests and trip
lengths.

support globally connected Internet of things (IoT) networks. However,
relatively long distances of densely deployed satellite networks around the
Earth cause a high path loss. In addition, since high complexity operations
such as beamforming, tracking and equalization have to be performed in IoT
devices partially, both the hardware complexity and the need for high-capacity
batteries of IoT devices increase. The reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) have the potential to increase the energy-efficiency and to perform
complex signal processing over the transmission environment instead of IoT
devices. But, RISs need the information of the cascaded channel in order to
change the phase of the incident signal. This study evaluates the pilot signal
as a graph and incorporates this information into the graph attention networks
(GATs) to track the phase relation through pilot signaling. The proposed
GAT-based channel estimation method examines the performance of the DtS IoT
networks for different RIS configurations to solve the challenging channel
estimation problem. It is shown that the proposed GAT both demonstrates a
higher performance with increased robustness under changing conditions and has
lower computational complexity compared to conventional deep learning methods.
Moreover, bit error rate performance is investigated for RIS designs with
discrete and non-uniform phase shifts under channel estimation based on the
proposed method. One of the findings in this study is that the channel models
of the operating environment and the performance of the channel estimation
method must be considered during RIS design to exploit performance improvement

do so, we introduce the notion of subfield decomposition in which a $D+1$

that the ability to approximate a higher-dimensional scenario by a $1+1$

in the higher-dimensional space. The approximation is justified whenever this
change of shape is ""small enough"". In this light, we identify the dynamically
relevant norm by which the magnitude of these changes in probe shape ought to
be judged. Finally, we explore this approximation in particular setups

then track emitters with fast SEI retraining. Once delay loops separate the
data classes, traditionally complex, power-hungry classification models are no
longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even with simple classifiers such
as Ridge Regression (RR), the complexity grows at least quadratically with the
input size. DLR with a RR classifier exceeds the SoA accuracy, while further
reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of parallel (split)

yielding constraints on the value of the $\sigma_8$ parameter. On the other
hand, the abundance of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) clusters detected by Planck, with
masses inferred using a hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, leads to a
significantly lower value of the same parameter. This discrepancy is often
dubbed the $\sigma_8$ tension in the literature and is sometimes regarded as a
possible sign of new physics. Here, we examine a direct determination of
$\sigma_8$ at the present epoch in $\Lambda$CDM, and thereby the cluster mass
calibrations using cosmological data at low redshift, namely the measurements
of $f\sigma_8$ from the analysis of the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey

constraints, X-ray, and SZ cluster counts within the $\Lambda$CDM framework,
but leaving the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations as an independent
parameter (i.e. no extrapolation is made from high-redshift CMB constraints).
The calibration of X-ray and SZ masses are left as free parameters throughout
the whole analysis. Our study yields tight constraints on the aforementioned
calibrations, with values entirely consistent with results obtained from the
full combination of CMB and cluster data only. Such an agreement suggests an
absence of tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model between CMB-based estimates of
$\sigma_8$ and constraints from low-redshift on $f\sigma_8$; however, it also
indicates tension with the standard calibration of clusters masses.

ambitious formal-methods projects. Many verification, synthesis, programming,
and debugging tools rely on formal semantics of instruction sets, but different
tools can use semantics in rather different ways. As a result, a central
challenge for that community is how semantics should be written and what
techniques should be used to connect them to new use cases. The best-known work
applying single semantics across quite-different tools relies on
domain-specific languages like Sail, where the language and its translation
tools are specialized to the realm of instruction sets. We decided to explore a
different approach, with semantics written in a carefully chosen subset of
Haskell. This style does not depend on any new language translators, relying
instead on parameterization of semantics over type-class instances. As a
result, a semantics can be a first-class object within a logic, and application
of a semantics for a new kind of tool can be a first-class operation in the
logic, allowing sharing of theorems across applications. Our case study is for
the open RISC-V instruction-set family, and we have used a single core
semantics to support testing, interactive proof, and model checking of both
software and hardware. We especially highlight an application of a first-class
semantics within Coq that can be instantiated in different ways within one
proof: simulation between variants where multiplication is implemented in

  Performance","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph math.DS q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A key question concerning collective decisions is whether a social system can
settle on the best available option when some members learn from others instead
of evaluating the options on their own. This question is challenging to study,
and previous research has reached mixed conclusions, because collective
decision outcomes depend on the insufficiently understood complex system of
cognitive strategies, task properties, and social influence processes. This
study integrates these complex interactions together in one general yet
partially analytically tractable mathematical framework using a dynamical
system model. In particular, it investigates how the interplay of the
proportion of social learners, the relative merit of options, and the type of
conformity response affect collective decision outcomes in a binary choice. The
model predicts that when the proportion of social learners exceeds a critical
threshold, a bi-stable state appears in which the majority can end up favoring
either the higher- or lower-merit option, depending on fluctuations and initial
conditions. Below this threshold, the high-merit option is chosen by the
majority. The critical threshold is determined by the conformity response
function and the relative merits of the two options. The study helps reconcile
disagreements about the effect of social learners on collective performance and
proposes a mathematical framework that can be readily adapted to extensions
investigating a wider variety of dynamics.

accuracy to a task-specific paradigm. Statistical analysis further revealed
that incorporating the temporal ultrasound features significantly improves the

currently the most widely distributed flavivirus of encephalitis worldwide.
This virus infects birds, humans, horses, and other mammals, and its
transmission cycle occurs in urban and rural areas. Climate conditions have
direct and indirect impacts on vector abundance and virus dynamics within the
mosquito. The significance of environmental variables as drivers in WNV
epidemiology is increasing under the current climate change scenario. In this
study, we used a machine learning algorithm to model WNV distributions in South
America. Our model evaluated eight environmental variables (type of biome,
annual temperature, seasonality of temperature, daytime temperature variation,
thermal amplitude, seasonality of precipitation, annual rainfall, and
elevation) for their contribution to the occurrence of WNV since its
introduction in South America (2004). Our results showed that environmental
variables can directly alter the occurrence of WNV, with lower precipitation
and higher temperatures associated with increased virus incidence. High-risk
areas may be modified in the coming years, becoming more evident with high
greenhouse gas emission levels. Countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay will be
greatly affected, drastically changing their current WNV distribution. Several
Brazilian areas will also increase the likelihood of presenting WNV, mainly in
the Northeast and Midwest regions and the Pantanal biome. The Galapagos Islands
will also probably increase their geographic range suitable for WNV occurrence.
It is necessary to develop preventive policies to minimize potential WNV
infection in humans and enhance active epidemiological surveillance in birds,
humans, and other mammals before it becomes a more significant public health
problem in South America.

automated treatment planning algorithms can reduce a planner's active treatment

algorithms called station parameter optimized radiation therapy (SPORT). Within
the SPORT suite of algorithms, we propose a method called NC-POPS to produce
noncoplanar (NC) plans using the fully automated Pareto Optimal Projection

algorithm to the noncoplanar setting with potential applications to both IMRT

beam angle optimization (BAO) and 2) fully automated inverse planning using the
POPS algorithm. We evaluate the performance of NC-POPS by comparing between
various noncoplanar and coplanar configurations. To evaluate plan quality, we
compute the homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), and dose-volume
histogram (DVH) statistics for various organs-at-risk (OARs). As compared to
the evaluated coplanar baseline methods, the proposed NC-POPS method achieves
significantly better OAR sparing, comparable or better dose conformity, and

  details",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce the problem of unitarization. Unitarization is the problem of
taking $k$ input quantum circuits that produce orthogonal states from the all
$0$ state, and create an output circuit implementing a unitary with its first
$k$ columns as those states. That is, the output circuit takes the $k$th
computational basis state to the state prepared by the $k$th input circuit. We
allow the output circuit to use ancilla qubits initialized to $0$. But ancilla
qubits must always be returned to $0$ for any input. The input circuits may use
ancilla qubits, but we are only guaranteed the they return ancilla qubits to
$0$ on the all $0$ input.
  The unitarization problem seems hard if the output states are neither
orthogonal to or in the span of the computational basis states that need to map
to them. In this work, we approximately solve this problem in the case where
input circuits are given as black box oracles by probably finding an
approximate basis for our states. This method may be more interesting than the
application. This technique is a sort of quantum analogue of Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization for quantum states.
  Specifically, we find an approximate basis in polynomial time for the
following parameters. Take any natural $n$, $k =
O\left(\frac{\ln(n)}{\ln(\ln(n))}\right)$, and $\epsilon =
2^{-O(\sqrt{\ln(n)})}$. Take any $k$ input quantum states, $(|\psi_i
\rangle)_{i\in [k]}$, on polynomial in $n$ qubits prepared by quantum oracles,
$(V_i)_{i \in [k]}$ (that we can control call and control invert). Then there
is a quantum circuit with polynomial size in $n$ with access to the oracles
$(V_i)_{i \in [k]}$ that with at least $1 - \epsilon$ probability, computes at
most $k$ circuits with size polynomial in $n$ and oracle access to $(V_i)_{i
\in [k]}$ that $\epsilon$ approximately computes an $\epsilon$ approximate
orthonormal basis for $(|\psi_i \rangle)_{i\in [k]}$.

consequential in intermittent geophysical phenomena such as landslides and

flow and arrest for granular materials under the conditions of constant applied
pressure and shear stress, which are also most relevant in practice. Here the
material can dilate or compact, and flow or arrest, in response to the applied
stress. Our simulations highlight that under external stress, the intrinsic
response of granular materials is characterized by uniquely-defined steady
states of flow or arrest, which are highly sensitive to interparticle friction.
While the flowing states can be equivalently characterized by volume fraction,
coordination number or internal stress ratio, to characterize the states of
shear arrest, one needs to also consider the structural anisotropy in the
contact network. We highlight the role of dilation in the flow-arrest
transition, and discuss our findings in the context of rheological transitions

classifiers that aim to quantify and reduce the severity of mistakes, and not
just reduce the number of errors. The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy
(e.g., the WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for
mistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of
the top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware
deep classifiers do not always show practical improvement over the standard
cross-entropy baseline in making better mistakes. The reason for the reduction
in average mistake-severity can be attributed to the increase in low-severity
mistakes, which may also explain the noticeable drop in their accuracy. To this
end, we use the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for
hierarchy-aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of
likelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at
inference time; it needs no extra hyperparameters and requires adding just a
few lines of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in

applications such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, AR/VR, etc.
Conventionally, scene flow is estimated from dense/regular RGB video frames.
With the development of depth-sensing technologies, precise 3D measurements are
available via point clouds which have sparked new research in 3D scene flow.
Nevertheless, it remains challenging to extract scene flow from point clouds
due to the sparsity and irregularity in typical point cloud sampling patterns.
One major issue related to irregular sampling is identified as the randomness
during point set abstraction/feature extraction -- an elementary process in
many flow estimation scenarios. A novel Spatial Abstraction with Attention
(SA^2) layer is accordingly proposed to alleviate the unstable abstraction
problem. Moreover, a Temporal Abstraction with Attention (TA^2) layer is
proposed to rectify attention in temporal domain, leading to benefits with
motions scaled in a larger range. Extensive analysis and experiments verified
the motivation and significant performance gains of our method, dubbed as Flow
Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Attention (FESTA), when compared to several
state-of-the-art benchmarks of scene flow estimation.

where the notion of time does not always play a major role. Time modeling in

often handled in an ad hoc manner. This paper contributes to the establishment
of a broader understanding of time in conceptual modeling based on a software
and system engineering model denoted thinging machine (TM). TM modeling is
founded on a one-category ontology called a thimac (thing/machine) that is used
to elaborate the design and analysis of ontological presumptions. The issue
under study is a sample of abstract modeling domains as exemplified by time.
The goal is to provide better understanding of the TM model by supplementing it
with a conceptualization of time aspects. The results reveal new
characteristics of time and related notions such as space, events, and system

center our discussion around a conception of quantum gravity involving a notion
of quantum spacetime that arises in metastring theory. This theory allows for
an evolution of a cosmological Universe in which string-dual degrees of freedom
decouple as the Universe ages. Importantly such an implementation of quantum
gravity allows for the inclusion of a fundamental length scale without
introducing the fundamental breaking of Lorentz symmetry. The mechanism seems
to have potential for an entirely novel source for dark matter/energy. The

Navier-Stokes equations as formulated by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun
(BDNK). For this initial investigation we restrict to plane-symmetric
configurations of a conformal fluid in Minkowski spacetime. We consider
evolution of three classes of initial data: a smooth (initially) stationary
concentration of energy, a standard shock tube setup, and a smooth shockwave
setup. We compare these solutions to those obtained with the
Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism, variants of which are the common tools
used to model relativistic, viscous fluids. We find that for the two smooth
initial data cases, simple finite difference methods are adequate to obtain
stable, convergent solutions to the BDNK equations. For low viscosity, the MIS
and BDNK evolutions show good agreement. At high viscosity the solutions begin
to differ in regions with large gradients, and there the BDNK solutions can (as
expected) exhibit violation of the weak energy condition. This behavior is
transient, and the solutions evolve toward a hydrodynamic regime in a way
reminiscent of an approach to a universal attractor. For the shockwave problem,
we give evidence that if a hydrodynamic frame is chosen so that the maximum
characteristic speed of the BDNK system is the speed of light (or larger),
arbitrarily strong shockwaves are smoothly resolved. Regarding the shock tube
problem, it is unclear whether discontinuous initial data is mathematically
well-posed for the BDNK system, even in a weak sense. Nevertheless we attempt
numerical solution, and then need to treat the perfect fluid terms using
high-resolution shock-capturing methods. When such methods can successfully
evolve the solution beyond the initial time, subsequent evolution agrees with
corresponding MIS solutions, as well as the perfect fluid solution in the limit
of zero viscosity.

peer-to-peer communication on the unlicensed bands by operating in a time
division multiplexed manner to coexist with the underlying primary radio access
technology, e.g., long term evolution - MTC (LTE-M). A fundamental requirement
in the current version of SCUBA is that the communicating devices are to be
synchronized with each other so that timing occasions of the devices can be
accurately estimated by each other. However, when the devices are out of sync
with each other, which may be caused due to one or more of the devices being
out of cellular coverage region or are being served by different base stations,

computing. The behavior of these applications should depend not only on their
internal state and user interactions but also on the context sensed during
their execution. Indeed, our approach based on two essential mechanisms,
context sensoring and context reasoning. We consider the information acquired
by the context sensoring as a product line and we use feature models to
represent this information received, the services provided by cloud provider,
the available resources and constraints. At the context reasoning step, the
context provisioning feature model (CSCAFM) algorithm permits to generate
service context-aware that fulfils the requirements of use ensures a certain
level of performance of resources.

suffers from several well-known problems, including mode collapse and
difficulties learning a disconnected set of manifolds. In this paper, we break
down the challenging task of learning complex high dimensional distributions,
supporting diverse data samples, to simpler sub-tasks. Our solution relies on
designing a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having
a simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition.
This is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels.
  We formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the
training of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and
2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with
a direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid
producing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also
facilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We
develop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above
criteria. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we design an effective neural
architecture for the space partitioner that empirically assures these
conditions. Experimental results on various standard benchmarks show that the
proposed unsupervised model outperforms several recent methods.

replication. Given that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) derive their energy from
host cells, we investigated the diversity of ATP-utilizing proteins in MGE
genomes to determine whether they might be associated with proteins that could
suppress related host proteins that consume host energy. A comprehensive search
of 353 huge phage genomes revealed that up to 9% of the proteins have ATPase
domains. For example, ATPase proteins constitute ~3% of the genomes of Lak
phages with ~550 kbp genomes that occur in the microbiomes of humans and other
animals. Statistical analysis shows the number of ATPase proteins increases
linearly with genome length, consistent with a large sink for host ATP during
replication of megaphages. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments, we
found 505 mobilome proteins with ATPase domains fused to diverse functional
domains. Among these composite ATPase proteins, 61.6% have known functional
domains that could contribute to host energy diversion during the mobilome life
cycle. As many have domains that are known to interact with nucleic acids and
proteins, we infer that numerous ATPase proteins are used during replication
and for protection from host immune systems. We found a set of uncharacterized
ATPase proteins with nuclease and protease activities, displaying unique domain
architectures that are energy intensive based on the presence of multiple
ATPase domains. In many cases, these composite ATPase proteins genomically
co-localize with small proteins in genomic contexts that are reminiscent of
toxin-antitoxin systems. Small proteins that function as inhibitors may be a
common strategy for control of cellular processes, thus could inspire the
development of new nucleic acid and protein manipulation tools, with diverse
biotechnological applications.

to a constrained design space for optimal constellation, e.g., fixed resource
mapping and equal power allocation to all codebooks, however, existing AE
architectures produce constellations with suboptimal bit-error-rate (BER)
performance. Accordingly, we propose a new architecture for MU-MDM AE and
underlying training methodology for joint optimization of resource mapping and
a constellation design with bit-to-symbol mapping, aiming at approaching the
BER performance of a single-user MDM (SU-MDM) AE model with the same spectral
efficiency. The core design of the proposed AE architecture is dense resource
mapping combined with the novel power allocation layer that normalizes the sum
of user codebook power across the entire resources. This globalizes the domain
of the constellation design by enabling flexible resource mapping and power
allocation. Furthermore, it allows the AE-based training to approach a global
optimal MU-MDM constellations for CD-NOMA. Extensive BER simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms the existing CD-NOMA designs

oxidation reaction rates by transferring their lattice oxygen at the

described in terms of a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, many outstanding
questions remain unanswered regarding the atomic-scale structure and dynamic
meta-stability (i.e., fluxional behavior) of the interface $\textit{during
catalysis}$. Here, we employ aberration-corrected $\textit{operando}$ electron
microscopy to visualize the structural dynamics occurring at and near
Pt/CeO$_{2}$ interfaces during CO oxidation. Finite element simulations are
performed to develop a reaction rate analysis wherein the atomic-level
structural observations are directly correlated with the catalyst's turnover
frequency for CO oxidation. We show that the increasing frequency of catalytic
turnover correlates with dynamic fluxional behavior that (a) destablizes the
supported Pt particle, (b) marks an enhanced rate of oxygen vacancy creation
and annihilation, and (c) leads to increased strain and reduction in the
surface of the CeO$_{2}$ support. Overall, the results implicate the
interfacial Pt-O-Ce bonds anchoring the Pt to the support as being involved
also in the catalytically-driven oxygen transfer process, and they suggest that
oxygen reduction takes place on the highly reduced nearby CeO2 surface before
migrating to the interfacial perimeter for reaction with CO. The
$\textit{operando}$ electron microscopy approach described here should be
applicable to a large number of nanoparticle catalysts. This technique will
enable the identification of catalytically functional surface structures and
strengthen our ability to establish (dynamic) structure-activity relationships.

is one-dimensional spherical reactor with stoichiometric gaseous n-heptane/air
mixture and ultrafine monodisperse water droplets (initial diameter 5
micrometres). Homogeneous ignitions of two-phase mixtures are first simulated.
The water droplets can complete evaporation in the reactor prior to ignition,
and hence pronouncedly reduce gas temperature, which may induce the
low-chemistry reactions. It is found that the turnover temperature for negative
temperature coefficient range increases with droplet volume fraction.
Three-stage ignitions are present when the volume fraction is beyond a critical
value, i.e., low-temperature, intermediate-temperature, and high-temperature
ignitions. The chemical explosive mode analysis also confirms the low-chemistry
reactions induced by the evaporation of ultrafine water droplets. Then reaction
front development from an ignition spot with temperature gradient in two-phase
mixtures is analysed based on one-dimensional simulations. Different modes for
reaction front origin in the spot are identified, based on the initial gas
temperature and lower turnover temperature. Specifically, the reaction front
can be initiated at the left and right ends of the ignition spot, and inside
it. Detailed reaction front developments corresponding to the above three modes
are discussed. Besides, the pressure wave from high-temperature ignition is
important, compared to those from low- and intermediate-chemistries.

the winner's high bid implies that the winner often over-estimates the value of
the good for sale, resulting in an incurred negative utility. The seminal work
of Eyster and Rabin [Econometrica'05] introduced a behavioral model aimed to
explain this observed anomaly. We term agents who display this bias ""cursed
agents"". We adopt their model in the interdependent value setting, and aim to
devise mechanisms that prevent the cursed agents from obtaining negative
utility. We design mechanisms that are cursed ex-post IC, that is, incentivize
agents to bid their true signal even though they are cursed, while ensuring
that the outcome is individually rational -- the price the agents pay is no
more than the agents' true value.
  Since the agents might over-estimate the good's value, such mechanisms might
require the seller to make positive transfers to the agents to prevent agents
from over-paying. For revenue maximization, we give the optimal deterministic
and anonymous mechanism. For welfare maximization, we require ex-post budget
balance (EPBB), as positive transfers might lead to negative revenue. We
propose a masking operation that takes any deterministic mechanism, and imposes
that the seller would not make positive transfers, enforcing EPBB. We show that
in typical settings, EPBB implies that the mechanism cannot make any positive

mechanism results in a socially optimal EPBB mechanism. This further implies
that if the valuation function is the maximum of agents' signals, the optimal

of coarse-graining [K. Fujii, et al, arXiv:2007.10917]. In this paper, we
extend the original proposal of Deep VQE to obtain the excited states and apply
it to quantum chemistry calculation of a periodic material, which is one of the
most impactful applications of the VQE. We first propose a modified scheme to
construct quantum states for coarse-graining in Deep VQE to obtain the excited
states. We also present a method to avoid a problem of meaningless eigenvalues
in the original Deep VQE without restricting variational quantum states.
Finally, we classically simulate our modified Deep VQE for quantum chemistry
calculation of a periodic hydrogen chain as a typical periodic material. Our
method reproduces the ground-state energy and the first-excited-state energy
with the errors up to O(1)% despite the decrease in the number of qubits
required for the calculation by two or four compared with the naive VQE. Our
result will serve as a beacon for tackling quantum chemistry problems with
classically-intractable sizes by smaller quantum devices in the near future.

latent representations of category, shape and albedo, lighting and camera
projection matrix, decode the representations to segmented 3D shape and albedo

assesses the car's safety in scenarios where the car must avoid collision with
an adversary. Core to this mechanism is a safety measure, called Safe-Kamikaze
Distance (SKD), which computes the average similarity between sets of safe
adversary's trajectories and kamikaze trajectories close to the safe
trajectories. The kamikaze trajectories are generated based on planning under
uncertainty techniques, namely the Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes, to account for the partially observed car policy from the point of
view of the adversary. We found that SKD is inversely proportional to the upper
bound on the probability that a small deformation changes a collision-free
trajectory of the adversary into a colliding one. We perform systematic tests
on a scenario where the adversary is a pedestrian crossing a single-lane road
in front of the car being assessed --which is, one of the scenarios in the

results for SKD to measure the safety of autonomous cars. Moreover, the time
taken for each simulation test is under 11 seconds, enabling a sufficient

controlled in our treatment: the optical interference phase $\Delta\Phi$, the
reduced electric field strength
$\chi=\mathcal{E}_{\omega}^2/{\mathcal{E}_{2\omega}}$, and the final state
energy $\epsilon$. A small energy change near a resonance is shown to flip the
emission direction of photoelectrons with high efficiency, through an example
where $90\%$ of photoelectrons whose energy is near the $2p^2\ ^1S^e$ resonance
flip their emission direction. However, the large fraction of photoelectrons
ionized at the intermediate state energy, which are not influenced by the
optical control, make this control scheme challenging to realize
experimentally.

photo-induced electrostatic gating and magnetic effects. To this end we model
the narrow channel as a one-dimensional atomic chain and use a self-consistent
Keldysh-Nambu Green's function formalism to describe non-equilibrium effects
and SC phenomena. We consider cases where the photon creates electrostatic and
magnetic changes in the absorber, as well as devices with strong and weak
coupling to the metal leads. Our results indicate that the most promising case
is when the SC channel is weakly coupled to the leads and in the presence of a
background magnetic field, where photo-excitation of a magnetic molecule can
trigger a SC-to-normal transition in the channel that leads to a change in the
device current several times larger than in the case of a normal-phase channel

close association between attention and affordance. Therefore, with an

attention that serves as a useful indicating signal of how a demonstrator
accomplishes tasks, instead of explicitly modeling affordances. To achieve
this, we propose a contrastive learning framework that consists of a Siamese

phenomena arising from general-relativistic dynamics and variations in pulse
dispersion. When using various statistical methods, we find that combining

effects within the PSR J0740+6620 system, with the pulsar mass $m_{\rm p} =

relativistic Shapiro time delay. For the first time, we measure secular
variation in the orbital period and argue that this effect arises from apparent
acceleration due to significant transverse motion. After incorporating
contributions from Galactic differential rotation and off-plane acceleration in
the Galactic potential, we obtain a model-dependent distance of $d =
1.14^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ kpc (68.3\% credibility). This improved distance confirms
the ultra-cool nature of the white dwarf companion determined from recent

After analysing the single-exposed PIV image data using a multigrid/multipass
digital PIV (Soria, 1996) with in-house software, proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) was performed on the data to separate flow-fields into
large- and small-scale motions (LSMs and SSMs), with the LSMs further
categorized into high- and low-momentum events. Profiles of the conditionally
averaged Reynolds stresses show that the high-momentum events contribute more
to the Reynolds stresses than the low-momentum between wall to the end of the
log-layer and the opposite is the case in the wake region. The cross-over point
of the profiles of the Reynolds stresses from the high- and low-momentum LSMs
always has a higher value than the corresponding Reynolds stress from the
original ensemble at the same wall-normal location. Furthermore, the cross-over
point in the APG-TBL moves further from the wall than in the ZPG-TBL. By
removing the velocity fields with LSMs, the estimate of the Reynolds streamwise
stress and Reynolds shear stress from the remaining velocity fields is reduced
by up to $42 \%$ in the ZPG-TBL. The reduction effect is observed to be even
larger (up to $50\%$) in the APG-TBL. However, the removal of these LSMs has a
minimal effect on the Reynolds wall-normal stress in both the ZPG- and APG-TBL.

the primary beam patterns of low frequency aperture arrays (LFAA) such as the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This occurs when the observing wavelength
becomes comparable to the dipole separation for LFAA tiles, which for the MWA
occurs at approximately 300 MHz. The presence of these grating sidelobes has
made calibration and image processing for 300 MHz MWA observations difficult.
This work presents a new calibration and imaging strategy which employs
existing techniques to process two example 300 MHz MWA observations.
Observations are initially calibrated using a new 300 MHz sky-model which has
been interpolated from low frequency and high frequency all-sky surveys. Using
this 300 MHz model in conjunction with the accurate MWA tile primary beam
model, we perform sky-model calibration for the two example observations. After
initial calibration a self-calibration loop is performed by all-sky imaging
each observation with WSCLEAN. Using the output all-sky image we mask the main
lobe of the image. Using this masked image we perform a sky-subtraction by
estimating the masked image visibilities using WSCLEAN. We then image the main
lobe of the observations with WSCLEAN. This results in high dynamic range
images of the two example observation main lobes. These images have a
resolution of 2.4 arcminutes, with a maximum sensitivity of 31 mJy/beam. The
calibration and imaging strategy demonstrated in this work, opens the door to
performing science at 300 MHz with the MWA, which was previously an

MX-Font extracts multiple style features not explicitly conditioned on

MX-Font can capture diverse local concepts and show the generalizability to
unseen languages. During training, we utilize component labels as weak

squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole by the tunneling of charged scalar particles
and charged fermions. In contrast to the previous studies of Hawking radiation
from squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes, we consider the phenomenological
quantum gravity effects predicted by the generalized uncertainty principle with
the minimal measurable length. We derive corrections of the Hawking temperature
to general relativity, which are related to the energy of the emitted particle,
the size of the compact extra dimension, the charge of the black hole and the
existence of the minimal length in the squashed Kaluza-Klein geometry. We
obtain some known Hawking temperatures in five and four-dimensional black hole
spacetimes by taking limits in the modified temperature. We show that the
generalized uncertainty principle may slow down the increase of the Hawking
temperature due to the radiation, which may lead to the thermodynamic stable
remnant of the order of the Planck mass after the evaporation of the squashed
Kaluza-Klein black hole. We also find that the sparsity of the Hawking
radiation modified by the generalized uncertainty principle may become infinite
when the mass of the squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole approaches its remnant
mass.

(1) generalization stems from integration of multiple experiences into summary

most scientific publications from this era of growth and discovery have no

time, which are briefly summarised herein. Based on citation counts -- an

bounding boxes from point clouds. 3D object detection methods exploit either
voxel-based or point-based features to represent 3D objects in a scene.
Voxel-based features are efficient to extract, while they fail to preserve
fine-grained 3D structures of objects. Point-based features, on the other hand,
represent the 3D structures more accurately, but extracting these features is
computationally expensive. We introduce in this paper a novel single-stage 3D
detection method having the merit of both voxel-based and point-based features.
To this end, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
dubbed HVPR, that integrates both features into a single 3D representation
effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we augment the point-based features
with a memory module to reduce the computational cost. We then aggregate the
features in the memory, semantically similar to each voxel-based one, to obtain
a hybrid 3D representation in a form of a pseudo image, allowing to localize 3D
objects in a single stage efficiently. We also propose an Attentive Multi-scale
Feature Module (AMFM) that extracts scale-aware features considering the sparse
and irregular patterns of point clouds. Experimental results on the KITTI

a better compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

activations, particularly important for implementing deep neural networks with
limited hardware resources. Most methods use the straight-through estimator
(STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by
replacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of
an identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown
decent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the
same gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and
outputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient
scaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a
quantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given
a gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each
gradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer
input to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed
depending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the
continuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling
factor adaptively using Hessian information of a network. We show extensive
experimental results on the image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10
and ImageNet, with diverse network architectures under a wide range of
bit-width settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

indicators to segment corresponding objects, they do not specify object

consistent in part within an image, and this can be leveraged to discriminate
foreground and background regions inside object bounding boxes. To implement
this idea, we propose a novel pooling method, dubbed background-aware pooling
(BAP), that focuses more on aggregating foreground features inside the bounding
boxes using attention maps. This allows to extract high-quality pseudo
segmentation labels to train CNNs for semantic segmentation, but the labels
still contain noise especially at object boundaries. To address this problem,
we also introduce a noise-aware loss (NAL) that makes the networks less
susceptible to incorrect labels. Experimental results demonstrate that learning
with our pseudo labels already outperforms state-of-the-art weakly- and
semi-supervised methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and the NAL further

car accidents, and another 2873 pedestrians were injured. Each day, at least
one passerby is involved in a tragedy. Knowing the causes to decrease accidents
is crucial, and using system-dynamics to reproduce the collisions' events is
critical to prevent further accidents. This work implements simulations to save
lives by reducing the city's accidental rate and suggesting new safety policies
to implement. Simulation's inputs are video recordings in some areas of the
city. Deep Learning analysis of the images results in the segmentation of the
different objects in the scene, and an interaction model identifies the primary
reasons which prevail in the pedestrians or vehicles' behaviours. The first and
most efficient safety policy to implement-validated by our simulations-would be
to build speed bumps in specific places before the crossings reducing the
accident rate by 80%.

$\mathbb{Q}[z_1, \dots, z_n]$ and let $d = \max_{1 \leq i \leq p} \deg f_i$. We
consider the problem of computing the set of asymptotic critical values of the
polynomial mapping, with the assumption that this mapping is dominant,
$\mathbf{f}: z \in \mathbb{K}^n \to (f\_1(z), \dots, f\_p(z)) \in \mathbb{K}^p$
where $\mathbb{K}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. This is the set of
values $c$ in the target space of $\mathbf{f}$ such that there exists a
sequence of points $(\mathbf{x}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ for which
$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i)$ tends to $c$ and $\|\mathbf{x}_i\| \kappa {\rm d}
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i))$ tends to $0$ when $i$ tends to infinity where ${\rm
d} \mathbf{f}$ is the differential of $\mathbf{f}$ and $\kappa$ is a function
measuring the distance of a linear operator to the set of singular linear
operators from $\mathbb{K}^n$ to $\mathbb{K}^p$. Computing the union of the
classical and asymptotic critical values allows one to put into practice
generalisations of Ehresmann's fibration theorem. This leads to natural and
efficient applications in polynomial optimisation and computational real
algebraic geometry. Going back to previous works by Kurdyka, Orro and Simon, we
design new algorithms to compute asymptotic critical values. Through
randomisation, we introduce new geometric characterisations of asymptotic
critical values. This allows us to dramatically reduce the complexity of
computing such values to a cost that is essentially $O(d^{2n(p+1)})$ arithmetic
operations in $\mathbb{Q}$. We also obtain tighter degree bounds on a
hypersurface containing the asymptotic critical values, showing that the degree
is at most $p^{n-p+1}(d-1)^{n-p}(d+1)^{p}$. Next, we show how to apply these
algorithms to unconstrained polynomial optimisation problems and the problem of
computing sample points per connected component of a semi-algebraic set defined
by a single inequality/inequation. We report on the practical capabilities of
our implementation of this algorithm. It shows how the practical efficiency
surpasses the current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing asymptotic
critical values by tackling examples that were previously out of reach.

even across the negative differential resistance region. We further prove that
the QCL frequency comb can be injection locked with moderate RF power at the

demonstration of stable FC operation, in a QCL, over the full current density

algorithms is proposed to analyze an all-sky map (ASM) obtained using the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope. An attempt was made to simulate a one-year ASM from
a short-exposure ASM generated from one-week observation by applying three ML
based image processing algorithms: dictionary learning, U-net, and Noise2Noise.
Although the inference based on ML is less clear compared to standard
likelihood analysis, the quality of the ASM was generally improved. In
particular, the complicated diffuse emission associated with the galactic plane
was successfully reproduced only from one-week observation data to mimic a
ground truth (GT) generated from a one-year observation. Such ML algorithms can
be implemented relatively easily to provide sharper images without various
assumptions of emission models. In contrast, large deviations between simulated
ML maps and GT map were found, which are attributed to the significant temporal
variability of blazar-type active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over a year. Thus, the
proposed ML methods are viable not only to improve the image quality of an ASM,
but also to detect variable sources, such as AGNs, algorithmically, i.e.,
without human bias. Moreover, we argue that this approach is widely applicable
to ASMs obtained by various other missions; thus, it has the potential to
examine giant structures and transient events, both of which are rarely found
in pointing observations.

the other hand, to better embrace the data heterogeneity commonly existing in

validate the superiority of our proposed PrivRec and DP-PrivRec.

matching input sequences with limited dynamics, (ii) how to predict the
long-term motion context with high-dimensionality (e.g., complex motion). To
address the issues, we propose novel motion context-aware video prediction. To
solve the bottleneck (i), we introduce a long-term motion context memory
(LMC-Memory) with memory alignment learning. The proposed memory alignment
learning enables to store long-term motion contexts into the memory and to
match them with sequences including limited dynamics. As a result, the
long-term context can be recalled from the limited input sequence. In addition,
to resolve the bottleneck (ii), we propose memory query decomposition to store
local motion context (i.e., low-dimensional dynamics) and recall the suitable
local context for each local part of the input individually. It enables to
boost the alignment effects of the memory. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms other sophisticated RNN-based methods, especially

model guided by the causality implicated in the conditions and endings. In the
sketch stage, a skeleton is extracted by removing words which are conflict to
the counterfactual condition, from the original ending. In the customize stage,
a generation model is used to fill proper words in the skeleton under the
guidance of the counterfactual condition. In this way, the obtained
counterfactual ending is both relevant to the original ending and consistent
with the counterfactual condition. Experimental results show that the proposed
model generates much better endings, as compared with the traditional
sequence-to-sequence model.

along their surface for self-propulsion. Although this is well studied in
unbounded domains, the analysis in biologically relevant environments such as
confinements is scarce. In this work, we study the motion of a Janus sphere in
weak confinement. The particle is placed at an arbitrary location, with an
arbitrary orientation between the two walls. Using the method of reflections,
we study the effect of confining planar boundaries on the phoretic and
hydrodynamic interactions, and their consequence on the Janus particle
dynamics. The dynamical trajectories are analyzed using phase diagrams for
different surface coverage of activity and solute-particle interactions. In
addition to near wall states such as `sliding' and `hovering', we demonstrate
that accounting for two planar boundaries reveals two new states:
channel-spanning oscillations and damped oscillations around the centerline,
which were characterized as `scattering' or `reflection' by earlier analyses on
single-wall interactions. Using phase diagrams, we highlight the differences in
inert-facing and active-facing Janus particles. We also compare the dynamics of
Janus particles with squirmers for contrasting the chemical interactions with
hydrodynamic effects. Insights from the current work suggest that biological
and artificial swimmers sense their surroundings through long-ranged
interactions, that can be modified by altering the surface properties.

an emitter with other resonant objects (Purcell effect), can be recast as a
quantum interference of the paths of the photon that define the classical
scattering and absorption by the object. When the coupling is stronger,
additional paths representing the (Rabi oscillations or) possible re-absorption
of the photon from the excited object, by the emitter at ground-state, have to
be included in the quantum interference. The effect of these additional Rabi
paths of the photon on the radiative states and the efficiency of spontaneous
emission, can be approximated using a simple one-loop correction to the
weak-coupling approximation. This effect is especially evident in the anomalous
enhancements of emission due to extremely small non-scattering (or fully
absorbing) metal nanoparticles less than 10 nm in dimensions. Extending these
corrections to a collective model of spontaneous emission that includes
multiple emitters and such very small metal nanoparticles coupled to each
other, the large contribution of Rabi paths to radiative decay in such bulk

reduce peak hour congestion and encourage social distancing in epidemic
prevention. Previous literature has developed bi-level models of the work
starting time choice considering both labor output and urban mobility. Yet,
most analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work)
only and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In
fact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an
influential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection. On
this account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time
choice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work
start time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration
economies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in
work schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal
schedule choices with two system performance indicators. For total commuting
cost, it is found that the rigid school schedule for households may impede the
benefits of flextime in commuting cost saving. In terms of total net benefit,
while work schedule agglomeration of all commuters leads to the maximum in some
cases, the polarized agglomeration of the two heterogenous groups can never
achieve the optimum.

Deep-MCDD, which is effective to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as

important task to improve their retrievability, assist the creation of smart
analytics, and support a variety of approaches for analysing and making sense
of the research environment. In this paper, we present the CSO Classifier, a
new unsupervised approach for automatically classifying research papers
according to the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive ontology of
re-search areas in the field of Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as
input the metadata associated with a research paper (title, abstract, keywords)
and returns a selection of research concepts drawn from the ontology. The
approach was evaluated on a gold standard of manually annotated articles
yielding a significant improvement over alternative methods.

A physical protection system (PPS) integrates people, procedures, and equipment
to protect assets or facilities. PPSs have targeted various systems, including
airports, rail transport, highways, hospitals, bridges, the electricity grid,
dams, power plants, seaports, oil refineries, and water systems. Hence, PPSs
are characterized by a broad set of features, from which part is common, while
other features are variant and depend on the particular system to be developed.
The notion of PPS has been broadly addressed in the literature, and even
domain-specific PPS development methods have been proposed. However, the common
and variant features are fragmented across many studies. This situation
seriously impedes the identification of the required features and likewise the
guidance of the systems engineering process of PPSs. To enhance the
understanding and support the guidance of the development of PPS, in this
paper, we provide a feature-driven survey of PPSs. The approach applies a
systematic domain analysis process based on the state-of-the-art of PPSs. It
presents a family feature model that defines the common and variant features
and herewith the configuration space of PPSs

magnetoresistance anisotropy already for an isotropic Fermi surface and no

to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socio-economic needs of many
sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making. State-of-the-art
operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with
radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events
such as convective initiations. Recently introduced deep learning methods use
radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints.
While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility
is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer
lead times, yielding poor performance on more rare medium-to-heavy rain events.
To address these challenges, we present a Deep Generative Model for the
probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar. Our model produces
realistic and spatio-temporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1536
km x 1280 km and with lead times from 5-90 min ahead. In a systematic
evaluation by more than fifty expert forecasters from the Met Office, our
generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 88% of cases
against two competitive methods, demonstrating its decision-making value and
ability to provide physical insight to real-world experts. When verified
quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We
show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that
improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and
lead times where alternative methods struggle.

on a neglected emerging domain - movie review, and develops a novel

the statistical features of reviews, it is revealed that users will express
their sentiments on different aspects of movies in reviews. An attention
mechanism is introduced in the review embedding, and the conditional generative

typically use recommendation systems, the paradigm of network-friendly
recommendations (NFR) has been proposed recently to boost the network
performance by promoting content that can be efficiently delivered (e.g.,
cached at the edge). NFR increase the network performance, however, at the cost
of being unfair towards certain contents when compared to the standard
recommendations. This unfairness is a side effect of NFR that has not been
studied in literature. Nevertheless, retaining fairness among contents is a key
operational requirement for content providers. This paper is the first to study
the fairness in NFR, and design fair-NFR. Specifically, we use a set of metrics
that capture different notions of fairness, and study the unfairness created by
existing NFR schemes. Our analysis reveals that NFR can be significantly
unfair. We identify an inherent trade-off between the network gains achieved by
NFR and the resulting unfairness, and derive bounds for this trade-off. We show
that existing NFR schemes frequently operate far from the bounds, i.e., there
is room for improvement. To this end, we formulate the design of Fair-NFR
(i.e., NFR with fairness guarantees compared to the baseline recommendations)
as a linear optimization problem. Our results show that the Fair-NFR can
achieve high network gains (similar to non-fair-NFR) with little unfairness.

Plasmas 28, 030703 (2021)","10.1063/5.0041040",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The dense plasma focus is a plasma discharge powered by a capacitor bank.
Standard diagnostics include measurement of the time derivative of the current
through and the voltage across its connections with the capacitor bank.
Interpretation of this diagnostic data often involves some assumptions
regarding the representation of the dense plasma focus as a time varying
inductance. One of the characteristic features of the current derivative
waveform is a relatively sharp dip and an associated sharp voltage spike. This
has often been interpreted as a result of a rapid rise in the time varying
inductance of the plasma. Sometimes, an anomalous plasma impedance is invoked.
This Letter discusses instances where such interpretation creates conceptual
difficulties. A first principles approach to the representation of the dense
plasma focus as a circuit element reveals some fundamental problems with the
traditional representation of plasma focus as a time varying inductance. The
anomalous impedance is shown to be necessary to account for the difference in
the motional impedance implied by a time-varying inductance in the circuit
element representation and a first principles description based on Poynting's
Theorem. Dynamo effects that convert post-stagnation local motion of plasma
into 3-dimensional magnetic fields are shown to contribute to the effective
inductance of the plasma focus and resolve the observed conceptual difficulties

image denoising with the help of large-scale datasets. Earlier methods naively
trained a single CNN with many pairs of clean-noisy images. However, the
conditional distribution of the clean image given a noisy one is too
complicated and diverse, so that a single CNN cannot well learn such
distributions. Therefore, there have also been some methods that exploit
additional noise level parameters or train a separate CNN for a specific noise
level parameter. These methods separate the original problem into easier
sub-problems and thus have shown improved performance than the naively trained
CNN. In this step, we raise two questions. The first one is whether it is an
optimal approach to relate the conditional distribution only to noise level
parameters. The second is what if we do not have noise level information, such
as in a real-world scenario. To answer the questions and provide a better
solution, we propose a novel Bayesian framework based on the variational
approximation of objective functions. This enables us to separate the
complicated target distribution into simpler sub-distributions. Eventually, the
denoising CNN can conquer noise from each sub-distribution, which is generally
an easier problem than the original. Experiments show that the proposed method
provides remarkable performance on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and

detection. Different from existing methods that depend on either an off-line
actor detector or hand-designed actor-positional hypotheses like proposals or
anchors, we propose to directly detect an action tubelet in a video by
simultaneously performing action localization and recognition from a single
representation. TubeR learns a set of tubelet-queries and utilizes a
tubelet-attention module to model the dynamic spatio-temporal nature of a video
clip, which effectively reinforces the model capacity compared to using
actor-positional hypotheses in the spatio-temporal space. For videos containing
transitional states or scene changes, we propose a context aware classification
head to utilize short-term and long-term context to strengthen action
classification, and an action switch regression head for detecting the precise
temporal action extent. TubeR directly produces action tubelets with variable
lengths and even maintains good results for long video clips. TubeR outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art on commonly used action detection datasets AVA,
UCF101-24 and JHMDB51-21.

study tested the feasibility of using 'off the shelf' information extraction
algorithms to identify medical concepts from Italian clinical notes. We used
MetaMap to map medical concepts to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).
The study addressed two questions: (Q1) to understand if it would be possible
to properly map medical terms found in clinical notes and related to the
semantic group of 'Disorders' to the Italian UMLS resources; (Q2) to
investigate if it would be feasible to use MetaMap as it is to extract these
medical concepts from Italian clinical notes. Results in EXP1 showed that the
Italian UMLS Metathesaurus sources covered 91% of the medical terms of the
'Disorders' semantic group, as found in the studied dataset. Even if MetaMap
was built to analyze texts written in English, it worked properly also with
texts written in Italian. MetaMap identified correctly about half of the
concepts in the Italian clinical notes. Using MetaMap's annotation on Italian
clinical notes instead of a simple text search improved our results of about 15
percentage points. MetaMap showed recall, precision and F-measure of 0.53, 0.98

MetaMap to generate Italian meaningful variants. MetaMap's performance in
annotating automatically translated English clinical notes was in line with
findings in the literature, with similar recall (0.75), F-measure (0.83) and
even higher precision (0.95).

to the homogenous half of Maxwell's theory; both have equations of motion
corresponding to the (second) Bianchi identity, built from the dual form of
their respective field strength tensors. In order to have a dually symmetric
counterpart analogous to the non-homogenous half of Maxwell's theory, the first
invariant derived from the procedure in $N = M = 2$ can be introduced. The
complete gauge invariance of a model with respect to Noether's first theorem,
and not just the equation of motion, is a necessary condition for this dual
formulation. We show that this result can be generalized to the higher spin
gauge theories, where the spin-$n$ curvature tensors for all $N = M = n$ are
the field strength tensors for each $n$. These completely gauge invariant
models correspond to the Maxwell-like higher spin gauge theories whose
equations of motion have been well explored in the literature.

undergo planetary migration through magnetic and tidal interactions. We aim to
follow the orbital evolution of a planet along the structural and rotational
evolution of its host star by taking into account simultaneously tidal and
magnetic torques, in order to explain some properties of the distribution of
observed close-in planets. We rely on a numerical model of a coplanar circular
star-planet system taking into account stellar structural changes, wind braking
and star-planet interactions, called ESPEM. We browse the parameter space of
star-planet systems' configurations and assess the relative influence of
magnetic and tidal torques on secular evolution. We then synthesize star-planet
populations and confront their distribution in orbital and stellar rotation
periods to Kepler satellite data. First, we find that after the dissipation of
the protoplanetary disk, both types of interactions can dominate secular
evolution depending on the initial configuration of the system and the
evolutionary phase considered. Moreover, different populations of star-planet
systems emerge from the combined action of both kinds of interactions,
according to the evolutionary phase during which the planet migrates
significantly. This may affect significantly the detectability of star-planet
systems as well as the validity of gyrochonology. All in all, star-planet
interactions significantly impact the global distribution in orbital periods
during the main sequence, while the global distribution in stellar rotation
periods is marginally affected. More precisely, star-planet magnetic
interactions significantly affect the distribution of super-Earths around
slowly rotating stars, while tidal effects are found to shape the distribution

polynomial growth. When $g$ is sufficiently regular at zero and fast decaying
at infinity then, by the Birman-Krein formula, this trace can be computed from
the relative spectral shift function $\xi_{rel}(\lambda) = -\frac{1}{\pi}
\Im(\Xi(\lambda))$, where $\Xi(\lambda)$ is holomorphic in the upper half-plane
and fast decaying. In this paper we study the wave-trace contributions to the
singularities of the Fourier transform of $\xi_{rel}$. In particular we prove
that $\hat\xi_{rel}$ is real-analytic near zero and we relate the decay of
$\Xi(\lambda)$ along the imaginary axis to the first wave-trace invariant of
the shortest bounding ball orbit between the obstacles. The function
$\Xi(\lambda)$ is important in physics as it determines the Casimir
interactions between the objects.

demonstrations are difficult for the teacher to provide. For example in
robotics, providing kinesthetic demonstrations on a robotic manipulator
requires the teacher to control multiple degrees of freedom at once. The
difficulty of requiring optimal state action demonstrations limits the space of
problems where the teacher can provide quality feedback. As an alternative to
state action demonstrations, the teacher can provide corrective feedback such
as their preferences or rewards. Prior work has created algorithms designed to
learn from specific types of noisy feedback, but across teachers and tasks
different forms of feedback may be required. Instead we propose that in order
to learn from a diversity of scenarios we need to learn from a variety of
feedback. To learn from a variety of feedback we make the following insight:
the teacher's cost function is latent and we can model a stream of feedback as
a stream of loss functions. We then use any online learning algorithm to
minimize the sum of these losses. With this insight we can learn from a
diversity of feedback that is weakly correlated with the teacher's true cost
function. We unify prior work into a general corrective feedback meta-algorithm
and show that regardless of feedback we can obtain the same regret bounds. We
demonstrate our approach by learning to perform a household navigation task on
a robotic racecar platform. Our results show that our approach can learn
quickly from a variety of noisy feedback.

employment of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver. Therefore, we
consider an STC MIMO system with cyclic delay diversity at the transmitter and
maximum ratio combining at the receiver, where we develop a UW-based channel

we evaluate numerically the frame error rate (FER) of OTFS and OFDM with 2x2

approximate methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) can be as

for CPDP, namely LSH, NN-filter, and Genetic Instance Selection (GIS). Method:
We conduct experiments with five base learners, optimizing their hyper
parameters, on 13 datasets from PROMISE repository in order to compare the
performance of LSH with benchmark instance selection methods NN-Filter and GIS.
Results: The statistical tests show six distinct groups for F-measure
performance. The top two group contains only LSH and GIS benchmarks whereas the
bottom two groups contain only NN-Filter variants. LSH and GIS favor recall
more than precision. In fact, for precision performance only three
significantly distinct groups are detected by the tests where the top group is
comprised of NN-Filter variants only. Recall wise, 16 different groups are
identified where the top three groups contain only LSH methods, four of the
next six are GIS only and the bottom five contain only NN-Filter. Finally,
NN-Filter benchmarks never outperform the LSH counterparts with the same base
learner, tuned or non-tuned. Further, they never even belong to the same rank
group, meaning that LSH is always significantly better than NN-Filter with the
same learner and settings. Conclusions: The increase in performance and the
decrease in computational overhead and runtime make LSH a promising approach.
However, the performance of LSH is based on high recall and in environments
where precision is considered more important NN-Filter should be considered.

labeled correctly while those carrying a specific trigger are falsely given a
target label. Due to the severity of such attacks, many backdoor detection and

further significantly enhances the difficulty of the defender to learn the

reduces the gap between models trained on in-domain and out-of-domain labeled

easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we

Researchers found that the efficiency of tagging systems steadily decreases
over time, because tags become less precise in identifying specific documents,

how or even whether community managers can improve the efficiency of tags. In
this work, we use information-theoretic measures to track the descriptive and
retrieval efficiency of tags on Stack Overflow, a question-answering system

observe that tagging efficiency stabilizes over time, while tag content and
descriptiveness both increase. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that
limiting the number of tags fosters novelty and diversity in tag usage, two
properties which are both beneficial for tagging efficiency. To provide
qualitative evidence supporting our hypothesis, we present a statistical model
of tagging that demonstrates how novelty and diversity lead to greater tag

resorting to binning temporal observations to construct time series), Hawkes
processes with exponential decay have seen widespread adoption across many
application domains, such as predicting the occurrence time of the next

processes face a noteworthy challenge: There is substantial and often
unquantified variance in decay parameter estimations, especially in the case of

suddenly change. We empirically study the cause of these practical challenges
and we develop an approach to surface and thereby mitigate them. In particular,
our inspections of the Hawkes process likelihood function uncover the
properties of the uncertainty when fitting the decay parameter. We thus propose
to explicitly capture this uncertainty within a Bayesian framework. With a
series of experiments with synthetic and real-world data from domains such as

expected in the Kuiper belt (KB) in our Solar System. To quantify the gas
release in our Solar System, we use models for gas release that have been
applied to extrasolar planetary systems, as well as a physical model that
accounts for gas released due to the progressive internal warming of large
planetesimals. We find that only bodies larger than about 4 km can still
contain CO ice after 4.6 Gyr of evolution. This finding may provide a clue as
to why Jupiter-family comets, thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, are
deficient in CO compared to Oort-clouds comets. We predict that gas is still
produced in the KB right now at a rate of $2 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\oplus$/Myr for
CO and orders of magnitude more when the Sun was younger. Once released, the
gas is quickly pushed out by the Solar wind. Therefore, we predict a gas wind
in our Solar System starting at the KB location and extending far beyond with
regards to the heliosphere with a current total CO mass of $\sim 2 \times
10^{-12}$ M$_\oplus$. We also predict the existence of a slightly more massive
atomic gas wind made of carbon and oxygen (neutral and ionized) with a mass of
$\sim 10^{-11}$ M$_\oplus$. We predict that gas is currently present in our
Solar System beyond the Kuiper belt and that although it cannot be detected
with current instrumentation, it could be observed in the future with an in

first cast the time-varying view popularity as a model-free Markov chain to
effectively capture its dynamic characteristics. After jointly assessing the
caching and computing capacities on both the MEC server and the VR playback
device, a hybrid policy is then implemented to coordinate the dynamic caching
replacement and the deterministic offloading, so as to fully utilize the system
resources. The underlying multi-objective problem is reformulated as a
partially observable Markov decision process, and a deep deterministic policy
gradient algorithm is proposed to iteratively learn its solution, where a long
short-term memory neural network is embedded to continuously predict the
dynamics of the unobservable popularity. Simulation results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed scheme in achieving a trade-off between the energy

magnetic moments can only be obtained from the spectral information, most
commonly from the spectroscopy of semi-core states using the so-called x-ray
magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) sum rules. The validity of the these sum
rules in tracking femtosecond spin dynamics remains, however, an open question.
Employing the time dependent extension of density functional theory (TD-DFT) we
compare spectroscopically obtained moments with those directly calculated from
the TD-DFT densities. We find that for experimentally typical pump pulses these
two very distinct routes to the spin moment are, for Co and Ni, in excellent
agreement, validating the experimental approach. However, for short and intense
pulses or high fluence pulses of long duration the XMCD sum rules fail, with
errors exceeding 50\%. This failure persists only during the pulse and occurs
when the pump pulse excites charge out of the $d$-band and into $sp$-character
bands, invalidating the semi-core to $d$-state transitions assumed by the XMCD
sum rules.

This `soft HJB equation' can be learned from offline data without assuming that
the latter correspond to a previous optimal or near-optimal policy. A
data-driven solution of the soft HJB equation uses methods of Neural PDEs and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks developed in the field of Scientific Machine

DOCTR-L to solving neural PDEs from data. Our algorithm called Deep DOCTR-L
converts offline high-dimensional data into an optimal policy in one step by
reducing it to supervised learning, instead of relying on value iteration or
policy iteration methods. The method enables a computable approach to the
quality control of obtained policies in terms of both their expected returns

the framework of state-to-state formulations, are the most detailed but also
often prohibitively computationally expensive. In this work, we start to
investigate the possibilities offered by the use of machine learning methods
for state-to-state approaches to alleviate such burden.
  In this regard, several tasks have been identified. Firstly, we assessed the
potential of state-of-the-art data-driven regression models based on machine
learning to predict the relaxation source terms which appear in the right-hand
side of the state-to-state Euler system of equations for a one-dimensional
reacting flow of a N$_2$/N binary mixture behind a plane shock wave. It is
found that, by appropriately choosing the regressor and opportunely tuning its
hyperparameters, it is possible to achieve accurate predictions compared to the
full-scale state-to-state simulation in significantly shorter times.
  Secondly, we investigated different strategies to speed-up our in-house
state-to-state solver by coupling it with the best-performing pre-trained
machine learning algorithm. The embedding of machine learning methods into
ordinary differential equations solvers may offer a speed-up of several orders
of magnitude but some care should be paid for how and where such coupling is
realized. Performances are found to be strongly dependent on the mutual nature
of the interfaced codes.
  Finally, we aimed at inferring the full solution of the state-to-state Euler
system of equations by means of a deep neural network completely by-passing the
use of the state-to-state solver while relying only on data. Promising results
suggest that deep neural networks appear to be a viable technology also for
these tasks.

temperature, velocity and pressure as the primary variables. The model includes
the effects of viscosity, surface tension, thermal conductivity and gravity,

Gibbs free energy relaxation procedure is used to model mass transfer. A key
characteristic of the proposed methodology is the use of high performance and
scalable solvers for the solution of the Helmholtz equation for the pressure,
which drastically reduces the computational cost compared to analogous
density-based approaches. We demonstrate the capabilities of the methodology to

provide a wealth of information about stars, such as evolved giants, that have
less evident optical signatures. Due to significant advances in NIR
instrumentation and extension of spectral libraries and stellar population
synthesis (SPS) models to this domain, it is now possible to perform in-depth
studies of spectral features in the NIR to a high level of precision. In the
present work, taking advantage of state-of-the-art SPS models covering the NIR
spectral range, we introduce a new set of NIR indices constructed to be
maximally sensitive to the main stellar population parameters, namely age,
metallicity and initial mass function (IMF). We fully characterize the new
indices against these parameters as well as their sensitivity to individual
elemental abundance variations, velocity dispersion broadening, wavelength
shifts, signal-to-noise ratio and flux calibration. We also present, for the
first time, a method to ensure that the analysis of spectral indices is not

spectroscopy. Moreover, we discuss two main applications: (i) the ability of
some NIR spectral indices to constrain the shape of the low-mass IMF and (ii)
current issues in the analysis of NIR spectral indices for future developments

order to understand cluster properties from optical to mid-infrared regions. We
selected 438 likely members with membership probability higher than $50\%$ and
G$\le$20 mag. We obtained the mean value of proper motion as
$\mu_{x}=1.27\pm0.001$ and $\mu_{y}=-0.73\pm0.002$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The cluster's
radius is determined as 7.5 arcmin (5.67 pc) using radial density profile. Our
analysis suggests that NGC 1348 is located at a distance of $2.6\pm0.05$ kpc.
The mass function slope is found to be $1.30\pm0.18$ in the mass range
1.0$-$4.1 $M_\odot$, which is in fair agreement with Salpeter's value within
the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty. The present study validates that NGC 1348 is a
dynamically relaxed cluster. We computed the apex coordinates $(A, D)$ for NGC
1348 as $(A_\circ, D_\circ)$ = $(-23^{\textrm{o}}.815\pm 0^{\textrm{o}}.135$,
$-22^{\textrm{o}}.228\pm 0^{\textrm{o}}.105)$. In addition, calculations of the
velocity ellipsoid parameters (VEPs), matrix elements $\mu_{ij}$, direction
cosines ($l_j$, $m_j$, $n_j$) and the Galactic longitude of the vertex have

infinite-chord membrane is susceptible to flutter instability due to excitation
of long gravity waves on the free surface if the velocity of the flow exceeds
the phase velocity of the waves and related this phenomenon with the anomalous
Doppler effect. In the present work we derive a full nonlinear eigenvalue
problem for an integro-differential equation for the finite-chord Nemtsov
membrane in the finite-depth flow. In the shallow- and deep water limits we
develop a perturbation theory in the small added mass ratio parameter acting as
an effective dissipation, to find explicit analytical expressions for the
frequencies and the growth rates of the membrane modes coupled to the surface
waves. We find an intricate pattern of instability pockets in the parameter
space and describe it analytically. The case of an arbitrary depth flow with
free surface requires numerical solution of a new non-polynomial nonlinear
eigenvalue problem. We propose an original approach combining methods of
complex analysis and residue calculus, Galerkin discretization, Newton method
and parallelization techniques implemented in MATLAB to produce high-accuracy
stability diagrams within an unprecedentedly wide range of system's parameters.
We believe that the Nemtsov membrane plays the same paradigmatic role for
understanding radiation-induced instabilities as the Lamb oscillator coupled to
a string has played for understanding radiation damping.

phase-dependent and show odd (even)-number patterns at $0$ ($\pi$) phase shift;
while no interference appeared in time domain measurement, the interference

the interferometric sensing with our setup. From the Fisher information-based

mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions
between highly autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale
behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the
Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of
any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal
agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local
individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as
system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF
agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model
2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4).
These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated
by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and
flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also
recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive
ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase
system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between
agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the
dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed
exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational
models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior
(contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on
the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective
intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.

additional analysis in these regions, based on multifrequency fits to a dust

$\sigma_{\beta_d}$ up to $0.45$, $0.30$ at mid-latitudes, and $0.15$ at

and baryonic and dark matter (with $\omega_{dm} \neq 0$), and the other with an
$X$ dark energy (with $\omega_{de} \neq -1$), and baryonic and dark matter
(with $\omega_{dm} \neq 0$), are investigated and compared. Using Bayesian
machine learning analysis, constraints on the free parameters of both models
are obtained for the three redshift ranges: $z\in [0,2]$, $z\in [0,2.5]$, and
$z\in [0,5]$, respectively. For the first two redshift ranges, high-quality
observations of the expansion rate $H(z)$ exist already, and they are used for
validating the fitting results. Additionally, the extended range $z\in [0,5]$
provides predictions of the model parameters, verified when reliable
higher-redshift $H(z)$ data are available. This learning procedure, based on
the expansion rate data generated from the background dynamics of each model,
shows that, at cosmological scales, there is a deviation from the cold dark
matter paradigm, $\omega_{dm} \neq 0$, for all three redshift ranges. The
results show that this approach may qualify as a solution to the $H_{0}$
tension problem. Indeed, it hints at how this issue could be effectively solved
(or at least alleviated) in cosmological models with interacting dark energy.

Joint sampling and consultation of experts whose opinions depend on the hidden

blind, framework as feedback from the true state is not available. We propose
an empirically realizable measure of expert competence that can be inferred
instantaneously using only the opinions of other experts. This measure
preserves the ordering of true competences and thus enables joint sampling and
consultation of stochastic experts based on their opinions on dynamically

give a characterisation of the behaviour of the optimiser $\overline{u}_0$ when
it does not saturate the $L^\infty$ constraints, which is a key step in
implementing efficient numerical algorithms. We give such a characterisation
under mild regularity assumptions by proving that in that case $\overline{u}_0$
can only take values in the ""zone of concavity"" of $f$. This is done using
two-scale asymptotic expansions. We then show how well-known isoperimetric

Our results give a distribution of values for $\alpha$ (defined in terms of

fitting a Gaussian, we obtain a mean and standard deviation of

possible causes of inaccurate measurement of $\tau$, which, if not filtered out

in our sample have large dispersion measures and are therefore likely to be
distant. We find that a model using an isotropic scatter broadening function is
consistent with the data, likely due to the averaging effect of multiple
scattering screens along the line of sight. Our sample of scattering parameters
provides a strong data set upon which we can build to test more complex and

alternative proof, in a slightly greater generality, via a new exact formula in
terms of determinants of discrete Laplacians. We also compute the main term of
the asymptotics of the difference $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_{V}-\epsilon_{H})$ of
the energy density on a vertical and a horizontal edge, which is of order of
$\delta^{2}$, where $\delta$ is the mesh size. The observable
$\epsilon_{V}-\epsilon_{H}$ has been identified by Kadanoff and Ceva as (a

  We then apply the discrete complex analysis methods of Smirnov and Hongler to
compute the multi-point correlations. The fermionic observables are only
periodic with doubled periods; by anti-symmetrization, this leads to
contributions from four ""sectors"". The main new challenge arises in the doubly
periodic sector, due to the existence of non-zero constant (discrete) analytic
functions. We show that some additional input, namely the scaling limit of the
one-point function and of relative contribution of sectors to the partition
function, is sufficient to overcome this difficulty and successfully compute
all correlations.

properties. Although these perovskites are defect-tolerant electronically,
defects hamper their long-term stability and cause degradation. Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations are an important tool to unravel the
microscopic structures of defects, but results suffer from the different
approximations used in the DFT functionals. In the case of metal halide
perovskites, qualitatively different results have been reported with different
functionals, either predicting vacancy or interstitial point defects to be most
dominant. Here, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of a wide range of
functionals for calculating the equilibrium defect formation energies and
concentrations of point defects in the archetype metal halide perovskite,
MAPbI$_3$. We find that it is essential to include long-range Van der Waals
interactions in the functional, and that it is vital to self-consistently
optimize structure and volume of all compounds involved in the defect
formation. For calculating equilibrium formation energies of point defects in
MAPbI$_3$ and similar metal halide perovskites, we argue that the exact values
of the chemical potentials of the species involved, or of the intrinsic Fermi
level, are not important. In contrast to the simple Schottky or Frenkel
pictures, we find that the dominant defects are MA and I interstitials, and Pb
vacancies.

easy or hard, in the finite sample regime. Statistically easy to learn linear
system classes have sample complexity that is polynomial with the system
dimension. Most prior research in the finite sample regime falls in this
category, focusing on systems that are directly excited by process noise.
Statistically hard to learn linear system classes have worst-case sample
complexity that is at least exponential with the system dimension, regardless
of the identification algorithm. Using tools from minimax theory, we show that
classes of linear systems can be hard to learn. Such classes include, for
example, under-actuated or under-excited systems with weak coupling among the
states. Having classified some systems as easy or hard to learn, a natural
question arises as to what system properties fundamentally affect the hardness
of system identifiability. Towards this direction, we characterize how the
controllability index of linear systems affects the sample complexity of
identification. More specifically, we show that the sample complexity of
robustly controllable linear systems is upper bounded by an exponential
function of the controllability index. This implies that identification is easy
for classes of linear systems with small controllability index and potentially
hard if the controllability index is large. Our analysis is based on recent
statistical tools for finite sample analysis of system identification as well
as a novel lower bound that relates controllability index with the least
singular value of the controllability Gramian.

instructions to perform automatic editing would significantly improve
accessibility. This paper introduces the language-based video editing (LBVE)
task, which allows the model to edit, guided by text instruction, a source
video into a target video. LBVE contains two features: 1) the scenario of the
source video is preserved instead of generating a completely different video;
2) the semantic is presented differently in the target video, and all changes
are controlled by the given instruction. We propose a Multi-Modal Multi-Level

correspondence between video perception and language semantic at different
levels, which benefits both the video understanding and video frame synthesis.
We build three new datasets for evaluation, including two diagnostic and one

show that M$^3$L is effective for video editing and that LBVE can lead to a new

time, it is through discrete time mappings that much of the understanding of
chaos is formed. Henri Poincar\'e first made this connection by tracking
consecutive iterations of the continuous flow with a lower-dimensional,
transverse subspace. The mapping that iterates the dynamics through consecutive
intersections of the flow with the subspace is now referred to as a Poincar\'e
map, and it is the primary method available for interpreting and classifying
chaotic dynamics. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest systems, an explicit
form for such a mapping remains outstanding. This work proposes a method for
obtaining explicit Poincar\'e mappings by using deep learning to construct an
invertible coordinate transformation into a conjugate representation where the
dynamics are governed by a relatively simple chaotic mapping. The invertible
change of variable is based on an autoencoder, which allows for dimensionality
reduction, and has the advantage of classifying chaotic systems using the
equivalence relation of topological conjugacies. Indeed, the enforcement of
topological conjugacies is the critical neural network regularization for
learning the coordinate and dynamics pairing. We provide expository
applications of the method to low-dimensional systems such as the R\""ossler and
Lorenz systems, while also demonstrating the utility of the method on

Transformations in radial as well as temporal metric functions split the system
into two arrays. Each array includes the effects of only one source (either
seed or additional). The seed source is assumed to be a vacuum and the
corresponding system is specified through the Schwarzschild metric. In order to
construct a suitable solution of the second system, constraints are applied on
the metric potentials and energy-momentum tensor of the additional source. We
obtain three solutions corresponding to different values of the decoupling
parameter in the presence of a massive scalar field. The extra source is
classified as normal or exotic through energy conditions. It is found that two
solutions agree with the energy bounds and thus have normal matter as their

corresponding manually-annotated data, rendering generalizing across domains
challenging. In this paper, we exploit the stationary properties of human
behavior within an interaction and present a representation learning method to
capture behavioral information from speech in an unsupervised way. We
hypothesize that nearby segments of speech share the same behavioral context

Triplet-Enhanced DCN (TE-DCN) framework to capture the behavioral context and
derive a manifold representation, where speech frames with similar behaviors
are closer while frames of different behaviors maintain larger distances. The

carried out including the error of the targeting manoeuvre performed at the

influence of the uncertainties in the atmospheric density and the ballistic

importance. In this paper, mathematical possibilities for natural extension of
the notion of a catacondensed benzenoid are discussed, leading under plausible
chemically and physically motivated restrictions to the notion of a
catacondensed chemical hexagonal complex (CCHC). A general polygonal complex is
a topological structure composed of polygons that are glued together along
certain edges. A polygonal complex is flat if none of its edges belong to more
than two polygons. A connected flat polygonal complex determines an orientable
or nonorientable surface, possibly with boundary. A CCHC is then a connected
flat polygonal complex all of whose polygons are hexagons and each of whose
vertices belongs to at most two hexagonal faces. We prove that all CCHC are
Kekulean and give formulas for counting the perfect matchings in a series of
examples based on expansion of cubic graphs in which the edges are replaced by
linear polyacenes of equal length. As a preliminary assessment of the likely
stability of molecules with CCHC structure, all-electron quantum chemical
calculations are applied to molecular structures based on several CCHC, using
either linear or kinked unbranched catafused polyacenes as the expansion motif.
The systems examined all have closed shells according to H\""uckel theory and
all correspond to minima on the potential surface, thus passing the most basic

and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets are used for constraining the
model par parameters appearing in the functional form of $q$. The transition
redshift is obtained at $% z_{t}=0.67_{-0.36}^{+0.26}$ for the combined data
set ($H(z)+SN+BAO$), where the model shows signature-flipping and is consistent
with recent observations. Moreover, the present value of the deceleration
parameter comes out to be $q_{0}=-0.50_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$ and the jerk parameter
$% j_{0}=-0.98_{-0.02}^{+0.06}$ (close to 1) for the combined datasets, which
is compatible as per Planck2018 results. The analysis also constrains the omega
value i.e., $\Omega _{m_{0}}\leq 0.269$ for the smooth evolution of the scalar
field EoS parameter. It is seen that energy density is higher for the effective
energy density of the matter field than energy density in the presence of a
scalar field. The evolution of the physical and geometrical parameters is
discussed in some details with the model parameters' numerical constrained
values. Moreover, we have performed the state-finder analysis to investigate
the nature of dark energy.

Niemeyer","The Two-Dimensional Swept Rule Applied on Heterogeneous Architectures","18 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.MS physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The partial differential equations describing compressible fluid flows can be
notoriously difficult to resolve on a pragmatic scale and often require the use
of high performance computing systems and/or accelerators. However, these
systems face scaling issues such as latency, the fixed cost of communicating
information between devices in the system. The swept rule is a technique
designed to minimize these costs by obtaining a solution to unsteady equations
at as many possible spatial locations and times prior to communicating. In this
study, we implemented and tested the swept rule for solving two-dimensional
problems on heterogeneous computing systems across two distinct systems. Our
solver showed a speedup range of 0.22-2.71 for the heat diffusion equation and
0.52-1.46 for the compressible Euler equations. We can conclude from this study
that the swept rule offers both potential for speedups and slowdowns and that
care should be taken when designing such a solver to maximize benefits. These
results can help make decisions to maximize these benefits and inform designs.

disturb the communication services for cellular users. One solution to the
problem is using unmanned aerial vehicles to augment the desired communication
network. The paper demonstrates the design of a UAV-Assisted Imitation Learning
(UnVAIL) communication system that relays the cellular users' information to a
neighbor base station. Since the user equipment (UEs) are equipped with buffers
with limited capacity to hold packets, UnVAIL alternates between different UEs
to reduce the chance of buffer overflow, positions itself optimally close to
the selected UE to reduce service time, and uncovers a network pathway by
acting as a relay node. UnVAIL utilizes Imitation Learning (IL) as a
data-driven behavioral cloning approach to accomplish an optimal scheduling
solution. Results demonstrate that UnVAIL performs similar to a human expert
knowledge-based planning in communication timeliness, position accuracy, and
energy consumption with an accuracy of 97.52% when evaluated on a developed
simulator to train the UAV.

candidate technology for future wireless networks, where the element spacing is

about the spatial-temporal correlation behavior among the elements in an RIS.
In this paper, we investigate the spatial-temporal correlation for an
RIS-enabled wireless communication system. Specifically, a joint small-scale
spatial-temporal correlation model is derived under isotropic scattering, which
can be represented by a four-dimensional sinc function. Furthermore, based upon
the spatial-only correlation at a certain time instant, an essential RIS
property -- the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) -- is revisited, and an
analytical expression is propounded to characterize the spatial DoF for RISs
with realistic hence non-infinitesimal element spacing and finite aperture
sizes. The results are vital to the accurate evaluation of various system
performance metrics.

  Efficient IoT Spectrum Sensors","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.00751",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Current radio frequency (RF) sensors at the Edge lack the computational
resources to support practical, in-situ training for intelligent spectrum
monitoring, and sensor data classification in general. We propose a solution
via Deep Delay Loop Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture that
supports general machine learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by
leveraging delay-loop reservoir computing in combination with innovative
electrooptical hardware. With both digital and photonic realizations of our
design of the loops, DLR delivers reductions in form factor, hardware
complexity and latency, compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The main impact
of the reservoir is to project the input data into a higher dimensional space
of reservoir state vectors in order to linearly separate the input classes.
Once the classes are well separated, traditionally complex, power-hungry
classification models are no longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even
with simple classifiers based on Ridge regression (RR), the complexity grows at
least quadratically with the input size. Hence, the hardware reduction required
for training on compact devices is in contradiction with the large dimension of
state vectors. DLR employs a RR-based classifier to exceed the SoA accuracy,
while further reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of
parallel (split) loops. We present DLR architectures composed of multiple
smaller loops whose state vectors are linearly combined to create a lower
dimensional input into Ridge regression. We demonstrate the advantages of using
DLR for two distinct applications: RF Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) for
IoT authentication, and wireless protocol recognition for IoT situational
awareness.
