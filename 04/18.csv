  Machine Translation","16 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Today's neural machine translation (NMT) can achieve near
human-level translation quality and greatly facilitates international
communications, but the lack of parallel corpora poses a key problem to the
development of translation systems for highly specialized domains, such as
biomedicine. This work presents an unsupervised algorithm for deriving parallel
corpora from document-level translations by using sentence alignment and
explores how training materials affect the performance of biomedical NMT
systems. Materials and Methods: Document-level translations are mixed to train
bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) for the evaluation of cross-lingual word
similarity, and sentence distance is defined by combining semantic and
positional similarities of the sentences. The alignment of sentences is
formulated as an extended earth mover's distance problem. A Chinese-English
biomedical parallel corpus is derived with the proposed algorithm using
bilingual articles from UpToDate and translations of PubMed abstracts, which is
then used for the training and evaluation of NMT. Results: On two manually
aligned translation datasets, the proposed algorithm achieved accurate sentence
alignment in the 1-to-1 cases and outperformed competing algorithms in the
many-to-many cases. The NMT model fine-tuned on biomedical data significantly
improved the in-domain translation quality (zh-en: +17.72 BLEU; en-zh: +17.02
BLEU). Both the size of the training data and the combination of different
corpora can significantly affect the model's performance. Conclusion: The
proposed algorithm relaxes the assumption for sentence alignment and
effectively generates accurate translation pairs that facilitate training high
quality biomedical NMT models.

parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device and
the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing the
model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge level

mode of communication, and using the correct choice of words and styles can
serve to have a long-lasting impact. Stylistics is the study of the use of
various language styles in communication to pass a message with a bigger impact
or to communicate indirectly. Stylistic analysis, therefore, is the study of
the use of linguistic styles in texts to determine how a style has been used,
what is communicated and how it is communicated. Honest deception is the use of
a choice of words to imply something different from the literal meaning. A
person listening or reading a text where honest deception has been used and
with a literal understanding may completely miss out on the point. This is
because the issue of honesty and falsehood arises. However, it would be better
to understand that honest deception is used with the intention of having a
lasting impact rather than to deceive the readers, viewers or listeners. The
major styles used in honest deception are hyperboles, litotes, irony and
sarcasm. The Seinfeld Sitcom TV series was a situational TV comedy show aired
from 1990 to 1998. the show attempts to bring to the understanding the daily
life of a comedian and how comedian views life experiences and convert them
into hilarious jokes. It also shows Jerry's struggle with getting the right
partner from the many women who come into his life. Reflecting on honest
deception in the Seinfeld sitcom TV series, this paper is going to investigate
how honest deception has been used in the series, why it has been used and what
is being communicated. The study is going to use a recapitulative form to give
a better analysis and grouping of the different styles used in honest deception

essential problem in lifelong learning. Structural regularization (SR) refers
to a family of algorithms that mitigate catastrophic forgetting by penalizing
the network for changing its ""critical parameters"" from previous tasks while
learning a new one. The penalty is often induced via a quadratic regularizer
defined by an \emph{importance matrix}, e.g., the (empirical) Fisher
information matrix in the Elastic Weight Consolidation framework. In practice
and due to computational constraints, most SR methods crudely approximate the
importance matrix by its diagonal. In this paper, we propose \emph{Sketched
Structural Regularization} (Sketched SR) as an alternative approach to compress
the importance matrices used for regularizing in SR methods. Specifically, we
apply \emph{linear sketching methods} to better approximate the importance
matrices in SR algorithms. We show that sketched SR: (i) is computationally
efficient and straightforward to implement, (ii) provides an approximation
error that is justified in theory, and (iii) is method oblivious by
construction and can be adapted to any method that belongs to the structural
regularization class. We show that our proposed approach consistently improves

collection of documents is a long-standing problem in Artificial Intelligence.
One way to assess this capability is through the task of slot filling. Given an
entity query in form of [Entity, Slot, ?], a system is asked to `fill' the slot
by generating or extracting the missing value from a relevant passage or
passages. This capability is crucial to create systems for automatic knowledge
base population, which is becoming in ever-increasing demand, especially in
enterprise applications. Recently, there has been a promising direction in
evaluating language models in the same way we would evaluate knowledge bases,
and the task of slot filling is the most suitable to this intent. The recent
advancements in the field try to solve this task in an end-to-end fashion using
retrieval-based language models. Models like Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) show surprisingly good performance without involving complex information
extraction pipelines. However, the results achieved by these models on the two
slot filling tasks in the KILT benchmark are still not at the level required by
real-world information extraction systems. In this paper, we describe several
strategies we adopted to improve the retriever and the generator of RAG in

The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and several other metrics were used as
figures of merit as applied to the task of delineating lesion and bone in both
simulated and clinical SPECT/CT images. We experimentally demonstrated that the
proposed methods yielded good segmentation results on a clinical dataset even

mix magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of the local magnetic field,
and this type of motion is used to trace magnetic fields with the velocity
gradient technique (VGT). The other type of turbulent motion, fast modes,
induces anisotropies orthogonal to Alfv\'enic eddies and interferes with the

dominate other turbulent motions. We identify these localized regions as the
cause of the occasional change of direction of gradients in our synthetic

of mixtures at small compressibility. We start from a general representation
for the local free energy that is valid in stable subregions of the phase
diagram. On the basis of this representation we classify the admissible data to
construct a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model. We then analyze
the incompressible limit, where the molar volume becomes independent of
pressure. Here we are confronted with two problems:
  (i) Our study shows that the physical system at hand cannot remain
incompressible for arbitrary large deviations from a reference pressure unless
its volume is linear in the composition.
  (ii) As a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, the incompressible
limit implies that the molar volume becomes independent of temperature as well.
Most applications, however, reveal the non-appropriateness of this property.
  According to our mathematical treatment, the free energy as a function of
temperature and partial masses tends to a limit in the sense of epi- or
Gamma-convergence. In the context of the first problem, we study the mixing of
two fluids to compare the linearity with experimental observations. The second
problem will be treated by considering the asymptotic behavior of both a

resilience of cooperation among unequals when interaction is random, when
individuals can choose their partners, and where power asymmetries dynamically
depend on accumulated payoffs. We find that the ability to avoid bullies with
higher competitive ability afforded by partner choice mostly restores
cooperative conventions and that the competitive hierarchy never forms. Partner
choice counteracts the hyper dominance of bullies who are isolated in the
network and eliminates the need for others to coordinate in a coalition. When
competitive ability dynamically depends on cumulative payoffs, complex cycles
of coupled network-strategy-rank changes emerge. Effective collaborators gain
popularity (and thus power), adopt aggressive behavior, get isolated, and
ultimately lose power. Neither the network nor behavior converge to a stable
equilibrium. Despite the instability of power dynamics, the cooperative
convention in the population remains stable overall and long-term inequality is
completely eliminated. The interaction between partner choice and dynamic power
asymmetry is crucial for these results: without partner choice, bullies cannot
be isolated, and without dynamic power asymmetry, bullies do not lose their
power even when isolated. We analytically identify a single critical point that
marks a phase transition in all three iterations of our models. This critical
point is where the first individual breaks from the convention and cycles start

intelligent surface (RIS) are two promising technologies for application to
beyond-5G networks. This paper considers Cell-Free Massive MIMO systems with
the assistance of an RIS for enhancing the system performance under the
presence of spatial correlation among the engineered scattering elements of the
RIS. Distributed maximum-ratio processing is considered at the access points
(APs). We introduce an aggregated channel estimation approach that provides
sufficient information for data processing with the main benefit of reducing
the overhead required for channel estimation. The considered system is studied
by using asymptotic analysis which lets the number of APs and/or the number of
RIS elements grow large. A lower bound for the channel capacity is obtained for
a finite number of APs and engineered scattering elements of the RIS, and
closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink ergodic net throughput are
formulated in terms of only the channel statistics. Based on the obtained
analytical frameworks, we unveil the impact of channel correlation, the number
of RIS elements, and the pilot contamination on the net throughput of each
user. In addition, a simple control scheme for optimizing the configuration of
the engineered scattering elements of the RIS is proposed, which is shown to
increase the channel estimation quality, and, hence, the system performance.
Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system design

spacecraft is on the way back to Earth with samples from Ryugu with no critical
issues after the successful departure in November 2019. Here, we propose an
extended mission in which the spacecraft will rendezvous with a small asteroid
with ~30 m - ~40 m in diameter that is rotating at a spin period of ~10 min
after an additional ~10-year cruise phase. We introduce that two scenarios are
suitable for the extended mission. In the first scenario, the spacecraft will
perform swing-by maneuvers at Venus once and Earth twice to arrive at asteroid
2001 AV43. In the second scenario, it will perform swing-by maneuvers at Earth
twice to reach asteroid 1998 KY26. In both scenarios, the mission will continue
until the early 2030s. JAXA recently released the decision that the spacecraft
will rendezvous with 1998 KY26. This paper focuses on our scientific
assessments of the two scenarios but leaves the decision process to go to 1998
KY26 for future reports. Rendezvous operations will be planned to detail the
physical properties and surrounding environments of the target, one of the
smallest elements of small planetary bodies. By achieving the planned
operations, the mission will provide critical hints on the violent histories of
collisions and accumulations of small bodies in the solar system. Furthermore,

the Takagi factorization, and others thereby covering familiar matrix

that Lie theory has one way or another been lurking hidden in the foundations
of the very successful field of matrix computations with applications routinely

processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in
resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law,
puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain
pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be
unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that
existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when
domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case
Holdings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple
choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset
presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and
difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second,
we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While
a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books
and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (using corpus of
approximately 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than
BERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial
performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12%
improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal
tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task
exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of
performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain
specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage
resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures,
too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.

room normally used to block image-degrading electromagnetic Interference (EMI).
To address this, we introduce the EDITER method, an external sensor based
dynamic EMI estimation and removal method to retrospectively remove
time-varying external interference sources.
  Theory and Methods: The method acquires data from multiple EMI detectors
(tuned receive coils and electrodes placed on the body) simultaneous with the
primary MR coil during image data acquisition. We dynamically calculate impulse
response functions that map the data from the detectors to the artifacts in the
kspace data, then remove the transformed detected EMI from the MR data.
Performance of the EDITER algorithm was assessed in phantom and in vivo imaging
experiments in an 80mT portable brain MRI in a controlled EMI environment and
with an open 47.5mT MRI scanner in an uncontrolled EMI setting.
  Results: In the controlled setting, the effectiveness of the EDITER technique
was demonstrated for specific types of introduced EMI sources with up to a 97%
reduction of structured EMI and up to 76% reduction of broadband EMI. In the
uncontrolled EMI experiments, we demonstrate EMI reductions of 37% with a
single pickup coil and 89% with a single electrode and up to 99% with both.
  Conclusion: The EDITER technique is a flexible and robust method to improve
image quality in portable MRI systems with minimal passive shielding. This
could reduce the reliance of MRI on shielded rooms and allow for truly portable
MRI with specialized compact POC scanners

pruning results on benchmark transformers, such as BERT, are not as remarkable
as the pruning results in the literature of convolutional neural networks

technique compresses a model more than that obtained by reducing number of

maximize CPMI, and compare to gold standard linguistic dependencies. Overall,
we find that CPMI dependencies achieve an unlabelled undirected attachment

image from a source domain but have good performance in the target domain with
only unlabeled images. Existing approaches achieve this either by aligning the
feature maps or the region proposals from the two domains, or by transferring
the style of source images to that of target image. Contrasted with prior work,
this paper provides a complementary solution to align domains by learning the
same auxiliary tasks in both domains simultaneously. These auxiliary tasks push
image from both domains towards shared spaces, which bridges the domain gap.
Specifically, this paper proposes Rotation Prediction and Consistency Learning
(PRCL), a framework complementing existing XDD methods for domain alignment by
leveraging the two auxiliary tasks. The first one encourages the model to
extract region proposals from foreground regions by rotating an image and
predicting the rotation angle from the extracted region proposals. The second
task encourages the model to be robust to changes in the image space by
optimizing the model to make consistent class predictions for region proposals
regardless of image perturbations. Experiments show the detection performance
can be consistently and significantly enhanced by applying the two proposed
tasks to existing XDD methods.

that large models are costly to share and serve, and the ability to reuse one

long-wavelength excitations and on the assumption that the ordered part of the
system shows fractal properties near the transition point. We propose that the
scaling ansatz for the singular part of the free energy suggested before for
the transition to the Bose-glass phase is applicable also for other transitions
if the quenched disorder does not produce a local imbalance in sublattices
magnetizations. We show using the scaling consideration that $\eta=2-z$ and
$\beta=\nu d/2$, where $\eta$, $\beta$, and $\nu$, are critical exponents of
the correlation function, the order parameter, and the correlation length,
respectively, and $z$ is the dynamical critical index. These relations were
missed in previous analytical discussions of Bose-glass and Mott-glass phases.
They signify, in particular, that $z=d/2$ for the transition to the Mott-glass
phase and that the density of states of localized excitations shows a
superuniversal (i.e., independent of $d$) behavior near the transitions. Being
derived solely from the scaling analysis, the above relations for $\eta$ and
$\beta$ are valid also for the transition to the random-singlet phase.

operating systems start to incorporate new changes and optimizations. One major
OS support is the direct-access for files, which enables efficient access for
files hosted in byte-addressable NVM systems. With DAX-enabled filesystems,
files can be accessed directly similar to memory with typical load/store
operations. Despite its efficiency, the frequently used system call of direct
access is troublesome for system auditing. File system auditing is mandatory
and widely used because auditing logs can help detect anomalies, suspicious
file accesses, or be used as an evidence in digital forensics. However, the
frequent and long-time usage of direct access call blinds the operating system
or file system from tracking process operations to shared files after the
initial page faults. This might results in imprecise casualty analysis and
leads to false conclusion for attack detection. To remedy the tension between
enabling fine-grained file system auditing and leveraging the performance of

changes which can monitor every read or write event for mapped files on NVM.
Additionally, we propose the optimized schemes, that enable auditing

acceptable extra writes compared to our baseline. Compared to other

efficiency for searching lottery jackpots from two perspectives. Firstly, we
observe that the sparse masks derived from many existing pruning criteria have
a high overlap with the searched mask of our lottery jackpot, among which, the
magnitude-based pruning results in the most similar mask with ours.
Consequently, our searched lottery jackpot removes 90% weights in ResNet-50,
while it easily obtains more than 70% top-1 accuracy using only 5 searching
epochs on ImageNet. In compliance with this insight, we initialize our sparse
mask using the magnitude-based pruning, resulting in at least 3x cost reduction

performance. Secondly, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the searching process
for lottery jackpots. Our theoretical result suggests that the decrease in

impacts on the training loss. Our code is available at

is an operator of fundamental importance in probability, statistics and
analysis. Surprisingly, spaces of sequences with Ces\`aro limits have not
previously been studied. This paper introduces spaces of such sequences,
denoted $K_p(\mathcal{A})$, with the Ces\`aro limit acting as a kind of
integral. The space $\mathcal{F}$ comprised of all binary sequences with a
Ces\`aro limit is studied first, along with the associated functional $\nu:
\mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0,1]$ mapping each such sequence to its Ces\`aro
limit. It is shown that $\mathcal{F}$ can be factored to produce a monotone
class on which $\nu$ induces a countably additive set function. The space
$K_p(\mathcal{A})$ is then defined, and a quotient denoted
$\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{A})$ is shown to be isometrically isomorphic, under
certain conditions, to the function space
$\mathcal{L}_p(\mathbb{N},\mathcal{A},\nu)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a field of
sets isomorphic to a subset of $\mathcal{F}$, and $\nu$ is a finitely additive
measure induced by the functional mentioned above. The Ces\`aro limit of an
element of $K_p(\mathcal{A})$ is shown to be equal to its integral. The
complete $\mathcal{L}_p(\mathbb{N},\mathcal{A},\nu)$ spaces (and by
implication, the $\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{A})$ spaces isomorphic to them) are
characterised, and a sufficient condition for these spaces to be separable is
identified.

  under Nonlinear Vehicle Dynamics",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CAV platooning technology has received considerable attention in the past few
years, driven by the next generation smart transportation systems. Unlike most
of the existing platooning methods that focus on linear vehicle dynamics of
CAVs, this paper considers nonlinear vehicle dynamics and develops fully
distributed optimization based CAV platooning control schemes via the model
predictive control (MPC) approach for a possibly heterogeneous CAV platoon. The
nonlinear vehicle dynamics leads to several major difficulties in distributed
algorithm development and control analysis and design. Specifically, the
underlying MPC optimization problem is nonconvex and densely coupled. Further,
the closed loop dynamics becomes a time-varying nonlinear system subject to
external perturbations, making closed loop stability analysis rather
complicated. To overcome these difficulties, we formulate the underlying MPC
optimization problem as a locally coupled, albeit nonconvex, optimization
problem and develop a sequential convex programming based fully distributed
scheme for a general MPC horizon. Such a scheme can be effectively implemented
for real-time computing using operator splitting methods. To analyze the closed
loop stability, we apply various tools from global implicit function theorems,
stability of linear time-varying systems, and Lyapunov theory for
input-to-state stability to show that the closed loop system is locally
input-to-state stable uniformly in all small coefficients pertaining to the
nonlinear dynamics. Numerical tests on homogeneous and heterogeneous CAV
platoons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fully distributed
schemes and CAV platooning control.

Dice losses. In the abundant segmentation literature, there is no clear
consensus as to which of these losses is a better choice, with varying
performances for each across different benchmarks and applications. In this
work, we develop a theoretical analysis that links these two types of losses,
exposing their advantages and weaknesses. First, we provide a
constrained-optimization perspective showing that CE and Dice share a much
deeper connection than previously thought: They both decompose into
label-marginal penalties and closely related ground-truth matching penalties.
Then, we provide bound relationships and an information-theoretic analysis,
which uncover hidden label-marginal biases: Dice has an intrinsic bias towards
specific extremely imbalanced solutions, whereas CE implicitly encourages the
ground-truth region proportions. Our theoretical results explain the wide
experimental evidence in the medical-imaging literature, whereby Dice losses
bring improvements for imbalanced segmentation. It also explains why CE
dominates natural-image problems with diverse class proportions, in which case
Dice might have difficulty adapting to different label-marginal distributions.
Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose a principled and simple solution,
which enables to control explicitly the label-marginal bias. Our loss
integrates CE with explicit ${\cal L}_1$ regularization, which encourages label
marginals to match target class proportions, thereby mitigating class imbalance
but without losing generality. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies
over different losses and applications validate our theoretical analysis, as
well as the effectiveness of our explicit label-marginal regularizers.

that there is a range when the Gauss-Bonnet corrections are subordinate to the
Einstein gravity terms in the large dimension limit, and yet the merger point
geometry does not approach a black hole away from the neck. We cannot rule out
a topology changing phase transition as argued by Kol. However as the merger
point geometry does not approach the black hole geometry asymptotically it is
not obvious that the transition is directly to a black hole phase. We also
demonstrate that for another range of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, the merger
point geometry approaches the black hole geometry asymptotically when a certain
parameter depending on the Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\alpha$ and on the
parameters in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole metric is small enough.

visual recognition. Recent architecture proposals for sparse CNNs exploit zeros
in the feature maps and filters for performance and energy without losing
accuracy. Sparse architectures that exploit two-sided sparsity in both feature
maps and filters have been studied only at small scales (e.g., 1K
multiply-accumulate(MAC) units). However, to realize their advantages in full,
the sparse architectures have to be scaled up to levels of the dense
architectures (e.g., 32K MACs in the TPU). Such scaling is challenging since
achieving reuse through broadcasts incurs implicit barrier cost raises the
inter-related issues of load imbalance, buffering, and on-chip bandwidth
demand. SparTen, a previous scheme, addresses one aspect of load balancing but
not other aspects, nor the other issues of buffering and bandwidth. To that
end, we propose the barrier-free large-scale sparse tensor accelerator
(BARISTA). BARISTA (1) is the first architecture for scaling up sparse CNN
accelerators; (2) reduces on-chip bandwidth demand by telescoping
request-combining the input map requests and snarfing the filter requests; (3)
reduces buffering via basic buffer sharing and avoids the ensuing barriers
between consecutive input maps by coloring the output buffers; (4) load
balances intra-filter work via dynamic round-robin work assignment; and (5)
employs hierarchical buffering which achieves high cache bandwidth via a few,
wide, shared buffers and low buffering via narrower, private buffers at the
compute. Our simulations show that, on average, barista performs 5.4x, 2.2x,
1.7x, 2.5x better than a dense, a one-sided, a naively-scaled two-sided, and an

takes its values in the extended positive cone of a partially ordered vector
space $E$. The monotone convergence theorem, Fatou's lemma, and the dominated
convergence theorem are established; the analogues of the classical ${\mathcal
L}^1$- and ${\mathrm L}^1$-spaces are investigated. The results extend earlier
work by Wright and specialise to those for the Lebesgue integral when $E$
equals the real numbers.
  The hypothesis on $E$ that is needed for the definition of the integral and
for the monotone convergence theorem to hold ($\sigma$-monotone completeness)
is a rather mild one. It is satisfied, for example, by the space of regular
operators between a directed partially ordered vector space and a
$\sigma$-monotone complete partially ordered vector space, and by every
JBW-algebra. Fatou's lemma and the dominated convergence theorem hold for every
$\sigma$-Dedekind complete space.
  When $E$ consists of the regular operators on a Banach lattice with an order
continuous norm, or when it consists of the self-adjoint elements of a strongly
closed complex linear subspace of the bounded operators on a complex Hilbert
space, then the finite measures as in the current paper are precisely the
strongly $\sigma$-additive positive operator-valued measures. When $E$ is a
partially ordered Banach space with a closed positive cone, then every positive
vector measure is a measure in our sense, but not conversely. Even when a
measure falls into both categories, the domain of the integral as defined in
this paper can properly contain that of any reasonably defined integral with
respect to the vector measure using Banach space methods.

several models have been put forward which have a quantum system coupled to an
apparatus. The system and the apparatus evolve in time and the Born rule for
the system to be in various eigenstates of the observable is naturally
obtained. In this work, we show that the effect of the drive-induced
dissipation in such a system can lead to the Born rule, even if there is no
separate apparatus. The applied drive needs to be much stronger than the
system-environment coupling. In this condition, we show that the dynamics of a
driven-dissipative system could be reduced to a Milburn-like form, using a
recently-proposed fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation [A. Chakrabarti
and R. Bhattacharyya, Phys. Rev. A 97, 063837 (2018)]. The system evolves
irreversibly under the action of the first-order effect of the drive and the
drive-induced dissipation. The resulting mixed state is identical to that
obtained by using the Born rule.

Usually, FS is modelled as a+ bi-objective optimization problem whose
objectives are: 1) classification accuracy; 2) number of features. One of the
main issues in real-world applications is missing data. Databases with missing
data are likely to be unreliable. Thus, FS performed on a data set missing some
data is also unreliable. In order to directly control this issue plaguing the
field, we propose in this study a novel modelling of FS: we include reliability
as the third objective of the problem. In order to address the modified
problem, we propose the application of the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm-III (NSGA-III). We selected six incomplete data sets from the
University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. We used the
mean imputation method to deal with the missing data. In the experiments,
k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) is used as the classifier to evaluate the feature
subsets. Experimental results show that the proposed three-objective model
coupled with NSGA-III efficiently addresses the FS problem for the six data
sets included in this study.

Evolving after inflation, the domain walls may leave their imprint in

power spectrum produced by the distribution of the closed domain walls and
relate it with the recently reported NANOGrav signal excess. We found that the
slope of the frequency dependence of the characteristic strain spectrum

revealed those combinations of the parameters where the signal from the
inflationary induced ALPs domain walls could saturate the amplitude of the

the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine
translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets.

evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering
disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals. Finally,

conflict-free paths for a fleet of agents operating in a given environment.
Arguably, the state-of-the-art approach to computing optimal solutions is
Conflict-Based Search (CBS). In this work we revisit the complexity analysis of
CBS to provide tighter bounds on the algorithm's run-time in the worst-case.
Our analysis paves the way to better pinpoint the parameters that govern (in
the worst case) the algorithm's computational complexity.
  Our analysis is based on two complementary approaches: In the first approach
we bound the run-time using the size of a Multi-valued Decision Diagram (MDD)
-- a layered graph which compactly contains all possible single-agent paths
between two given vertices for a specific path length.
  In the second approach we express the running time by a novel recurrence
relation which bounds the algorithm's complexity. We use generating
functions-based analysis in order to tightly bound the recurrence.
  Using these technique we provide several new upper-bounds on CBS's
complexity. The results allow us to improve the existing bound on the running
time of CBS for many cases. For example, on a set of common benchmarks we
improve the upper-bound by a factor of at least $2^{10^{7}}$.

great interest due to its huge potential in learning discriminative
representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes,
existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency,
e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for
comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we reveal two contradictory
phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and
over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency.
Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the
dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for
contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object
classes. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn
features from excessive negative sample pairs, forcing the model to
over-cluster samples of the same actual classes into different clusters. To
simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel self-supervised
learning framework using a truncated triplet loss. Precisely, we employ a
triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the positive
pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and we
construct the negative pair by selecting a negative sample deputy from all
negative samples to avoid the over-clustering problem, guaranteed by the
Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively evaluate our framework in several
large-scale benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results
demonstrate our model's superiority (e.g., the learning efficiency) over the

adversarial perturbations. However, this technique requires label information,
and thus, its use is limited to supervised settings. In this study, we explore
the concept of incorporating virtual AT (VAT) into the attention mechanisms, by
which adversarial perturbations can be computed even from unlabeled data. To
realize this approach, we propose two general training techniques, namely VAT
for attention mechanisms (Attention VAT) and ""interpretable"" VAT for attention

semi-supervised setting. In particular, Attention iVAT focuses on the
differences in attention; thus, it can efficiently learn clearer attention and
improve model interpretability, even with unlabeled data. Empirical experiments
based on six public datasets revealed that our techniques provide better
prediction performance than conventional AT-based as well as VAT-based
techniques, and stronger agreement with evidence that is provided by humans in
detecting important words in sentences. Moreover, our proposal offers these
advantages without needing to add the careful selection of unlabeled data. That
is, even if the model using our VAT-based technique is trained on unlabeled

that TSGNs can provide more potential information to benefit the identification

attributes, can retain the transaction flow information that captures the
significant topological pattern of phishing scams. By comparing with the TSGN,
Directed-TSGN indeed has much lower time complexity, benefiting the graph

this paper, we propose an automatic and quantifiable metric that allows us to
evaluate humans' perception of a model's ability to preserve privacy with
respect to sensitive variables. In this paper, we focus on saliency-based
explanations, explanations that highlight regions of the input text, to infer
internal workings of a black box model. We use the degree with which
differences in interpretation of general vs privacy preserving models correlate
with sociolinguistic biases to inform metric design. We show how certain
commonly-used methods that seek to preserve privacy do not align with human
perception of privacy preservation leading to distrust about model's claims. We
demonstrate the versatility of our proposed metric by validating its utility
for measuring cross corpus generalization for both privacy and emotion.

achieved success on various commonsense reasoning tasks. However, for a given

KG-augmented models often use attention to focus on specific KG components, the
KG is still always used, and the attention mechanism is never explicitly taught
which KG components should be used. Meanwhile, saliency methods can measure how
much a KG feature (e.g., graph, node, path) influences the model to make the
correct prediction, thus explaining which KG features are useful. This paper
explores how saliency explanations can be used to improve KG-augmented models'
performance. First, we propose to create coarse (Is the KG useful?) and fine
(Which nodes/paths in the KG are useful?) saliency explanations. Second, to
motivate saliency-based supervision, we analyze oracle KG-augmented models

attention. Third, we propose SalKG, a framework for KG-augmented models to
learn from coarse and/or fine saliency explanations. Given saliency
explanations created from a task's training set, SalKG jointly trains the model
to predict the explanations, then solve the task by attending to KG features
highlighted by the predicted explanations. On three commonsense QA benchmarks

physics simulators as they potentially allow near-optimal policies to be

(e.g. mass, friction coefficient etc.) of the associated objects and other
environment-specific factors (e.g. wind speed, air density etc.) to be
accurately specified, without which, it could take considerable additional
learning effort to adapt the learned simulation policy to the real environment.
As such a complete specification can be impractical, in this paper, we instead,
focus on learning task-specific estimates of latent factors which allow the
approximation of real world trajectories in an ideal simulation environment.
Specifically, we propose two new concepts: a) action grouping - the idea that
certain types of actions are closely associated with the estimation of certain
latent factors, and; b) partial grounding - the idea that simulation of
task-specific dynamics may not need precise estimation of all the latent
factors. We first introduce intuitive action groupings based on human physics
knowledge and experience, which is then used to design novel strategies for
interacting with the real environment. Next, we describe how prior knowledge of
a task in a given environment can be used to extract the relative importance of
different latent factors, and how this can be used to inform partial grounding,
which enables efficient learning of the task in any arbitrary environment. We
demonstrate our approach in a range of physics based tasks, and show that it
achieves superior performance relative to other baselines, using only a limited
number of real-world interactions.

green phase. Moreover, the proposed controller performs pulse and glide (PnG)
to optimally control the engine ON and OFF states and save additional fuel.
Furthermore, the performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on a
real-world driving profile and compared against a baseline controller from the
literature. Finally, the influence of different prediction horizons on the fuel
savings and computation times are studied. The results reveal significant
reduction in fuel consumption with HMPC-EACC and demonstrate that the proposed

propose MonoGRNet for the amodal 3D object detection from a monocular image via
geometric reasoning in both the observed 2D projection and the unobserved depth
dimension. MonoGRNet decomposes the monocular 3D object detection task into
four sub-tasks including 2D object detection, instance-level depth estimation,
projected 3D center estimation and local corner regression. The task
decomposition significantly facilitates the monocular 3D object detection,
allowing the target 3D bounding boxes to be efficiently predicted in a single
forward pass, without using object proposals, post-processing or the
computationally expensive pixel-level depth estimation utilized by previous
methods. In addition, MonoGRNet flexibly adapts to both fully and weakly
supervised learning, which improves the feasibility of our framework in diverse
settings. Experiments are conducted on KITTI, Cityscapes and MS COCO datasets.
Results demonstrate the promising performance of our framework in various

only aware of the exact correctness of predictions on phrase-level and ignore
the semantic similarities between similar predictions and targets, which
inhibits the model from learning deep linguistic patterns. In response to this

framework, which considers different granularities: token-level $F_1$ score,
edit distance, duplication, and prediction quantities. On the whole, the new

the vanilla $F_1$ score. This framework helps the model identifying some
partial match phrases which can be further optimized as the exact match ones.
Experiments on KG benchmarks show that our proposed training framework
outperforms the previous RL training frameworks among all evaluation scores. In

Knowledge Graph. Almost all of existing KGC research is applicable to only one
KG at a time, and in one language only. However, different language speakers
may maintain separate KGs in their language and no individual KG is expected to
be complete. Moreover, common entities or relations in these KGs have different
surface forms and IDs, leading to ID proliferation. Entity alignment (EA) and
relation alignment (RA) tasks resolve this by recognizing pairs of entity
(relation) IDs in different KGs that represent the same entity (relation). This
can further help prediction of missing facts, since knowledge from one KG is
likely to benefit completion of another. High confidence predictions may also
add valuable information for the alignment tasks. In response, we study the
novel task of jointly training multilingual KGC, relation alignment and entity
alignment models. We present ALIGNKGC, which uses some seed alignments to
jointly optimize all three of KGC, EA and RA losses. A key component of
ALIGNKGC is an embedding based soft notion of asymmetric overlap defined on the

different noise characteristics. Multiple noise-based data augmentation
approaches have been proposed to counteract this challenge in other speech
domains. But, unlike speech recognition and speaker verification, in emotion
recognition, noise-based data augmentation may change the underlying label of
the original emotional sample. In this work, we generate realistic noisy
samples of a well known emotion dataset (IEMOCAP) using multiple categories of
environmental and synthetic noise. We evaluate how both human and machine
emotion perception changes when noise is introduced. We find that some commonly
used augmentation techniques for emotion recognition significantly change human
perception, which may lead to unreliable evaluation metrics such as evaluating
efficiency of adversarial attack. We also find that the trained
state-of-the-art emotion recognition models fail to classify unseen
noise-augmented samples, even when trained on noise augmented datasets. This
finding demonstrates the brittleness of these systems in real-world conditions.
We propose a set of recommendations for noise-based augmentation of emotion

measurements was evaluated in the brains of six healthy volunteers. Results:
The use of an eddy current compensation reduced the signal variation. As
expected, the distortions caused by the second encoding were larger than those
of the first encoding entailing a stronger need to compensate for them. For an
optimal result, however, both encodings had to be compensated. The artifact
reduction strongly improved the measurement of the \mu FA in ventricles and

absolute \mu FA values in white matter was not observed. Conclusion: It is
advisable to compensate both encodings in DDE measurements for eddy currents.

significant quality improvements and the advent of streaming applications.
Simultaneous translation systems need to find a trade-off between translation
quality and response time, and with this purpose multiple latency measures have
been proposed. However, latency evaluations for simultaneous translation are
estimated at the sentence level, not taking into account the sequential nature
of a streaming scenario. Indeed, these sentence-level latency measures are not
well suited for continuous stream translation resulting in figures that are not
coherent with the simultaneous translation policy of the system being assessed.
This work proposes a stream-level adaptation of the current latency measures

successfully evaluated on streaming conditions for a reference IWSLT task.

(close to) unbiased bit, even when some adversarial parties try to bias the
output. In this work we focus on the case of an arbitrary number of corrupted
parties. Cleve [STOC 1986] has shown that in any such $m$-round coin-flipping
protocol, the corrupted parties can bias the honest parties' common output bit
by $\Theta(1/m)$. For more than two decades, the best known coin-flipping
protocol was the one of Awerbuch et al. [Manuscript 1985], who presented a
$t$-party, $m$-round protocol with bias $\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$. This was changed
by the breakthrough result of Moran et al. [TCC 2009], who constructed an
$m$-round, two-party coin-flipping protocol with optimal bias $\Theta(1/m)$.
Haitner and Tsfadia [STOC 2014] constructed an $m$-round, three-party
coin-flipping protocol with bias $O(\log^3m / m)$. Still for the case of more
than three parties, the best known protocol remained the
$\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$-bias protocol of Awerbuch et al.
  We make a step towards eliminating the above gap, presenting a $t$-party,
$m$-round coin-flipping protocol, with bias $O(\frac{t^4 \cdot 2^t \cdot
\sqrt{\log m}}{m^{1/2+1/\left(2^{t-1}-2\right)}})$ for any $t\le \tfrac12
\log\log m$. This improves upon the $\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$-bias protocol of
Awerbuch et al., and in particular, for $t\in O(1)$ it is an $1/m^{\frac12 +
\Theta(1)}$-bias protocol. For the three-party case, it is an $O(\sqrt{\log
m}/m)$-bias protocol, improving over the $O(\log^3m / m)$-bias protocol of
Haitner and Tsfadia.
  Our protocol generalizes that of Haitner and Tsfadia, by presenting an
appropriate recovery protocol for the remaining parties to interact in, in the
case that some parties abort or are caught cheating. We prove the fairness of
the new protocol by presenting a new paradigm for analyzing fairness of
coin-flipping protocols.

method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised

removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised
approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference

positives and ""contradiction"" pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on
standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and
supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3% and 81.6%

the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. In a
partial TDE (PTDE), the BH's tidal force cannot fully disrupt the star, so the
stellar core survives and only a varied portion of the stellar mass is bound to
the BH and feeds it. We calculate the event rate of PTDEs and full TDEs
(FTDEs). In general, the event rate of PTDEs is higher than that of FTDEs,
especially for the larger BHs. And the detection rate of PTDEs is about dozens
per year by Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF). During the circularization process
of the debris stream in PTDEs, no outflow can be launched due to the efficient
radiative diffusion. The circularized debris ring then experiences viscous
evolution and forms an accretion disk. We calculate the light curves of PTDEs
contributed by these two processes, along with their radiation temperature
evolution. The light curves have double peaks and the spectra peak in UV.
Without obscuration or reprocessing of the radiation by an outflow, PTDEs
provide a clean environment to study the circularization and transient disk
formation in TDEs.

electric fields is studied by the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. The
effects of the chirp parameter on the reduced momentum spectrum, the reduced
total yield of the created pairs for either low or high frequency one-color
field and two-color dynamically assisted combinational fields are investigated
in detail. Also, the enhancement factor is obtained in the later two-color
field case. It is found that for the low frequency field, no matter whether it
is accompanied by the other high frequency field, its chirping has a little
effect on the pair production. For the one-color high frequency field or/and
two-color fields, the momentum spectrum exhibits incomplete interference and
the interference effect becomes more and more remarkable as chirp increases. We
also find that in the chirped dynamically assisted field, the reduced total
yield is enhanced significantly when the chirps are acting on the two fields,
compared with that the chirp is acting only for the low frequency strong field.
Specifically, by the chirping, it is found the reduced pair number is increased
by more than one order of magnitude in the field with a relative narrow spatial
scale, while it is enhanced at least two times in other case of field with
larger spatial scales or even in the quasi-homogeneous region. We also obtain
some optimal chirp parameters and spatial scales for the total yield and
enhancement factor in different scenarios of the studied external field. These
results may provide a theoretical basis for possible experiments in the future.

In the latest research, LLST is decomposed three sub-tasks: scene reconversion,
shadow estimation, and image re-rendering, which provides a new paradigm for
image relighting. However, many problems for scene reconversion and shadow
estimation tasks, including uncalibrated feature information and poor semantic

representation. In this paper, we propose novel down-sampling feature
self-calibrated block (DFSB) and up-sampling feature self-calibrated block
(UFSB) as the basic blocks of feature encoder and decoder to calibrate feature
representation iteratively because the LLST is similar to the recalibration of
image light source. In addition, we fuse the multi-scale features of the
decoder in scene reconversion task to further explore and exploit more semantic

re-rendering. Experimental results in the VIDIT dataset show that the proposed

pre-training stage, using heuristic masking policies for masked language
modeling (MLM), can significantly improve final performance. However, it is
still unclear (1) in what cases such intermediate pre-training is helpful, (2)
whether hand-crafted heuristic objectives are optimal for a given task, and (3)
whether a masking policy designed for one task is generalizable beyond that
task. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to investigate
the effect of various masking policies in intermediate pre-training with nine
selected tasks across three categories. Crucially, we introduce methods to
automate the discovery of optimal masking policies via direct supervision or
meta-learning. We conclude that the success of intermediate pre-training is
dependent on appropriate pre-train corpus, selection of output format (i.e.,
masked spans or full sentence), and clear understanding of the role that MLM
plays for the downstream task. In addition, we find our learned masking
policies outperform the heuristic of masking named entities on TriviaQA, and
policies learned from one task can positively transfer to other tasks in
certain cases, inviting future research in this direction.

witnessed adaptive approach in probability determination. In Adaptive mutation
primarily poor individuals are utilized to explore state space, so mutation
probability is usually generated proportionally to the difference between
fitness of best chromosome and itself (fMAX - f). However, this approach is
susceptible to nature of fitness distribution during optimization. This paper
presents an alternate approach of mutation probability generation using
chromosome rank to avoid any susceptibility to fitness distribution.
Experiments are done to compare results of simple genetic algorithm (SGA) with
constant mutation probability and adaptive approaches within a limited resource
constraint for unimodal, multimodal functions and Travelling Salesman Problem
(TSP). Measurements are done for average best fitness, number of generations
evolved and percentage of global optimum achievements out of several trials.

measurement, we demonstrate that a twisted winding, whose topology consists of
two oppositely oriented loops in contact rather than a single loop, will
dramatically change the NHSE, following previous predictions of unique features
such as the bipolar localization and the Bloch point for a Bloch-wave-like
extended state. This work reveals previously unnoticed features of NHSE, and
provides the observation of physical phenomena originating from complex

propose to insert the feedback of downstream detection task into existing

using perceptual loss calculated on the entire feature map, a novel
region-of-interest (ROI) perceptual loss induced by the lesion detection task
is proposed to further connect these two tasks. To achieve better optimization

log-likelihood-ratio like in that it indicates the degree of similarity of a
pair of samples while taking into consideration their typicality with respect
to a model of the relevant population. A higher-valued score provides more
support for the same-origin hypothesis over the different-origin hypothesis
than does a lower-valued score; however, the absolute values of scores are not
interpretable as log likelihood ratios. Logistic-regression calibration is a
procedure for converting scores to log likelihood ratios, and
logistic-regression fusion is a procedure for converting parallel sets of
scores from multiple forensic-comparison systems to log likelihood ratios.
Logistic-regression calibration and fusion were developed for automatic speaker
recognition and are popular in forensic voice comparison. They can also be

domain specific recognizers. This gives rise to two fundamental concerns:
First, will the data collection protocol yield ecologically valid data? Second,
will the amount of collected data suffice to train sufficiently accurate
classifiers? In this paper, we draw attention to these two concerns. We show
that the ecological validity of the data collection protocol and the ability to
accommodate small datasets are significant factors impacting recognizer
accuracy in realistic scenarios. More specifically, using sketch-based gaming
as a use case, we show that deep learning methods, as well as more traditional
methods, suffer significantly from dataset shift. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that in realistic scenarios where data is scarce and expensive, standard
measures taken for adapting deep learners to small datasets fall short of
comparing favorably with alternatives. Although transfer learning, and
extensive data augmentation help deep learners, they still perform
significantly worse compared to standard setups (e.g., SVMs and GBMs with
standard feature representations). We pose learning from small datasets as a
key problem for the deep sketch recognition field, one which has been ignored

The fitted model also predicts that the delta-variant peak will be
comparatively short, and the cases-per-day data should begin to fall off in
early September 2021 - counter to current expectations. This case study would
make an excellent capstone experience for students interested in scientific

autoencoder (Emo-CVAE) model for generating emotional conversation responses.
In conventional CVAE-based emotional response generation, emotion labels are
simply used as additional conditions in prior, posterior and decoder networks.
Considering that emotion styles are naturally entangled with semantic contents
in the language space, the Emo-CVAE model utilizes emotion labels to regularize
the CVAE latent space by introducing an extra emotion prediction network. In
the training stage, the estimated latent variables are required to predict the
emotion labels and token sequences of the input responses simultaneously.
Experimental results show that our Emo-CVAE model can learn a more informative
and structured latent space than a conventional CVAE model and output responses
with better content and emotion performance than baseline CVAE and
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models.

result our notions of the CW-complex of the admissible polytopes and the
universal space of parameters $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ for $T^n$-action on $G_{n,2}$

this paper it is given an explicit construction of the space $\mathcal{F}_{n}$.
Together with Keel's description of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}(0,n)$, this

Embedding deep learning models to identify animals and filter these images

transmission of data, usually resource-constrained in this type of equipment.
In this work, we present a comparative study on animal recognition models to
analyze the trade-off between precision and inference latency on edge devices.
To accomplish this objective, we investigate classifiers and object detectors
of various input resolutions and optimize them using quantization and reducing
the number of model filters. The confidence threshold of each model was
adjusted to obtain 96% recall for the nonempty class, since instances from the
empty class are expected to be discarded. The experiments show that, when using
the same set of images for training, detectors achieve superior performance,
eliminating at least 10% more empty images than classifiers with comparable
latencies. Considering the high cost of generating labels for the detection
problem, when there is a massive number of images labeled for classification
(about one million instances, ten times more than those available for
detection), classifiers are able to reach results comparable to detectors but
with half latency.

competitive accretion. Dense, gravitationally bound cores are seen in molecular
clouds and some observations have suggested that the CMF is similar in shape to
the IMF, though translated to higher masses by a factor of $\sim3$. Here we
measure the CMF in 28 dense clumps within 3.5 kpc that are likely to be central
regions of massive protoclusters, observed via $1.3\:{\rm{mm}}$ dust continuum
emission by the ALMAGAL project. We identify 222 cores using the dendrogram
algorithm with masses ranging from 0.04 to $252\:M_{\odot}$. We apply
completeness corrections for flux and number recovery, estimated from core
insertion and recovery experiments. At higher masses, the final derived CMF is
well described by a single power law of the form
$dN/d\:{\textrm{log}}\:M\propto\:M^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\simeq0.94\pm0.08$.
However, we find evidence of a break in this power-law behavior between $\sim5$

has been found in distant ($\gtrsim 1$ kpc) regions by ALMA. We compare this
massive protocluster CMF with those derived using the same methods in the G286

strain to failure, low density, and tailorable stiffness and toughness. The
mechanical behavior of elastomers derives mainly from the entropic elasticity
of the underlying network of polymer chains. Elastomers under large deformation
experience bonds breaking within the polymer network. This breaking of chains
damages the network, can lead to material failure, and can be utilized as an
energy dissipation mechanism. In the case of reversible bonds, broken chains
may reform and heal the damage in the network. If the reversible bonds are
dynamic, chains constantly break and reform and create a transient network. A
fundamental constitutive theory is developed to model the mechanics of these
polymer networks. A statistical mechanical derivation is conducted to yield a
framework that takes in an arbitrary single-chain model (a Hamiltonian) and
outputs: the single-chain mechanical response, the breaking and reforming
kinetics, the equilibrium distribution of chains in the network, and the
partial differential equations governing the deformation-coupled network
evolution. This statistical mechanical framework is then brought into the
continuum scale by using macroscopic thermodynamic constitutive theory to
obtain a constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress. The
potential-supplemented freely jointed chain ($u$FJC) model is introduced, and a
parametric study of its mechanical response and breaking kinetics is provided.
This single-chain model is then implemented within the constitutive framework,
which we specialize and apply in two exemplary cases: the mechanical response
and irreversible breakdown of a multinetwork elastomer, and the mechanical
response of a dual crosslink gel. After providing a parametric study of the
general constitutive model, we apply it to a hydrogel with reversible

which the domain contains only well-separated objects, an asymptotic solution
to the forward problem involving 'polarization tensors' exists. These are
functions of the size and material contrast of inclusions, thereby describing
the saturation component of the non-linearity. As such, these asymptotic
expansions can allow fast and stable reconstruction of small isolated objects.
In this paper, we show how such an asymptotic series can be applied to
non-linear least-squares reconstruction problems, by deriving an approximate
diagonal Hessian matrix for the data misfit term.
  Often, the Hessian matrix can play a vital role in dealing with the
non-linearity, generating good update directions which accelerate the solution
towards a global minimum which may lie in a long curved valley, but
computational cost can make direct calculation infeasible. Since the
polarization tensor approximation assumes sufficient separation between
inclusions, our approximate Hessian does not account for non-linearity in the
form of lack of superposition in the inverse problem. It does however account
for the non-linear saturation of the change in the data with increasing
material contrast. We therefore propose to use it as an initial Hessian for
quasi-Newton schemes.
  This is demonstrated for the case of electrical impedance tomography in
numerical experimentation, but could be applied to any other problem which has
an equivalent asymptotic expansion. We present numerical experimentation into
the accuracy and reconstruction performance of the approximate Hessian,
providing a proof of principle of the reconstruction scheme.

however that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each
string and each brane generates its own tension, which can have a different
value for each string or brane. We define a new background fields that can
couple to this new type of extended objects, the tension scalar is capable of
changing locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended
object. When many strings probing the same region of space are considered this
tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal
invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with
different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics,
associated to the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einstein
equations and the consistency of these two Einstein equation determines the
tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically does
not satisfy Einstein equation . The problem is analyzed for Schwarzschild
background and for Kasner type space, for the Milne representation, for the
case of two types of string tensions, with solutions with negative string
tension at the early universe and a positive string tension that appears for
the late universe . The universal metric is not flat, instead it represents a
non singular bounce cosmology. The case in a warped space time where positive

symmetry-breaking ultrasound modes at low temperatures. The lower-field anomaly
corresponds to the well-known first-order metamagnetic

at 30 T, where an electronic-nematic transition was previously suggested to
occur. Both anomalies, observed only within the antiferromagnetic state, are of

angle from the $c$ axis, the anomaly at $B^*$ slowly shifts to higher fields,
broadens, and becomes smaller in magnitude. Traced up to 30$^\circ$ from the

single massive object between the source and the observer, in the details all
the structures near the light path contribute to the observed images. These
additional contributions, known as line-of-sight effects, are non-negligible in
practice. This article proposes a new theoretical framework to model the
line-of-sight effects, together with very promising applications at the
interface of weak and strong lensing. Our approach relies on the dominant-lens
approximation, where one deflector is treated as the main lens while the others
are treated as perturbations. The resulting framework is technically simpler to
handle than the multi-plane lensing formalism, while allowing one to
consistently model any sub-critical perturbation. In particular, it is not
limited to the usual external-convergence and external-shear parameterisation.
As a first application, we identify a specific notion of line-of-sight shear
that is not degenerate with the ellipticity of the main lens, and which could
thus be extracted from strong-lensing images. This result supports and improves
the recent proposal that Einstein rings might be powerful probes of cosmic
shear. As a second application, we investigate the distortions of
strong-lensing critical curves under line-of-sight effects, and more
particularly their correlations across the sky. We find that such correlations
may be used to probe, not only the large-scale structure of the Universe, but
also the dark-matter halo profiles of strong lenses. This last possibility
would be a key asset to improve the accuracy of the measurement of the
Hubble-Lema\^itre constant via time-delay cosmography.

simulation of coupled neutronics, thermal-hydraulics and fuel thermo-mechanics.
The fuel thermo-mechanical response provides essential information for
operational limits and safety analysis. Traditionally, fuel performance
analysis is performed standalone, using calculated spatial-temporal power
distribution and thermal boundary conditions from the coupled
neutronics-thermal-hydraulics simulation as input. Such one-way coupling is
result of the high cost induced by the full-core fuel performance analysis,
which provides more realistic and accurate prediction of the core-wide response
than the ""peak rod"" analysis. It is therefore desirable to improve the
computational efficiency of full-core fuel performance modeling by constructing
fast-running surrogate, such that fuel performance modeling can be utilized in
the core reload design optimization. This work presents methodologies for
full-core surrogate construction based on several realistic equilibrium PWR
core designs. As a fast and conventional approach, look-up tables are only
effective for certain fuel performance quantities of interest (QoIs). Several
representative machine-learning algorithms are introduced to capture the
complicated physics for other fuel performance QoIs. Rule-based model is useful
as a feature extraction technique to account for the spatial-temporal
complexity of operating conditions. Constructed surrogates achieve at least ten
thousand time acceleration with satisfying prediction accuracy. Current work
lays foundation for tighter coupling of fuel performance modeling into the core
design optimization framework. It also sets stage for full-core fuel
performance analysis with BISON where the computational cost becomes more
burdensome.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.08862",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, deep-learning based approaches have achieved impressive performance
for autonomous driving. However, end-to-end vision-based methods typically have
limited interpretability, making the behaviors of the deep networks difficult
to explain. Hence, their potential applications could be limited in practice.
To address this problem, we propose an interpretable end-to-end vision-based
motion planning approach for autonomous driving, referred to as IVMP. Given a
set of past surrounding-view images, our IVMP first predicts future egocentric
semantic maps in bird's-eye-view space, which are then employed to plan
trajectories for self-driving vehicles. The predicted future semantic maps not
only provide useful interpretable information, but also allow our motion
planning module to handle objects with low probability, thus improving the
safety of autonomous driving. Moreover, we also develop an optical flow
distillation paradigm, which can effectively enhance the network while still
maintaining its real-time performance. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes

  Applications","27 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies random fields on the unit sphere. Traditionally, isotropic
Gaussian random fields are considered as the underlying statistical model of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This paper discusses the
generalized multifractional Brownian motion and its pointwise H\""older exponent
on the sphere. The multifractional approach is used to investigate the CMB data
from the Planck mission. These data consist of CMB radiation measurements at
narrow angles of the sky sphere. The obtained results suggest that the
estimated H\""older exponents for different CMB regions do change from location
to location. Therefore, CMB data are multifractional. Then the developed
methodology is used to suggest two approaches for detecting regions with
anomalies in cleaned CMB maps.

  theory","17 pages, 5 figures, revised",,,,"quant-ph nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We have constructed a perturbation theory to treat interactions that can
include the Coulomb interaction, describing a physical problem that is often
encountered in nuclear physics. The Coulomb part is not treated perturbatively;
the exact solutions are employed. The method is an extension of the results
presented in Hoffmann (2021 J. Math. Phys. 62 032105). It is designed to
calculate phase shifts directly rather than the full form of the wavefunctions
in position space. We present formulas that allow calculation of the phase
shifts to second order in the perturbation. The phase shift results to second
order, for a short-range potential, were compared with the exact solution,
where we found an error of third order in the coupling strength. A different
model, meant as a simple approximation of nuclear scattering of a proton on
Helium-4 and including a Coulomb potential and a spherical well, was
constructed to test the theory. The wavepacket scattering formalism of Hoffmann
(2017 J. Phy. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys 50 215302), known to give everywhere finite
results, was employed. We found physically acceptable results and a cross
section of the correct order of magnitude.
