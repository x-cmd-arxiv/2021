In this work, we propose \emph{Task Agnostic Transfer Learning (TATL)}, a novel

learns an attribute-agnostic segmenter that detects lesion skin regions and
then transfers this knowledge to a set of attribute-specific classifiers to
detect each particular attribute. Since TATL's attribute-agnostic segmenter
only detects skin attribute regions, it enjoys ample data from all attributes,
allows transferring knowledge among features, and compensates for the lack of
training data from rare attributes. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate the proposed TATL transfer learning mechanism with various neural
network architectures on two popular skin attributes detection benchmarks. The
empirical results show that TATL not only works well with multiple

minimal model and computational complexities. We also provide theoretical

possible from a subset of the remaining nodes. By now, there are examples of RS
codes that have efficient repair schemes, and some even attain the cut-set

considerable field extension degree. They do not provide any nontrivial repair
scheme over prime fields. Lastly, they are all linear repairs, i.e., the
computed functions are linear over the base field. Motivated by these and by a

one that has an ambiguity function with minimal spread in the continuous
coefficient space (also called phase space). Since the ambiguity function is
the reproducing kernel of the coefficient space, optimal windows lead to phase
space representations which are ""optimally sharp."" Namely, the wavelet
coefficients have minimal correlations with each other. Such a construction
also promotes sparsity in phase space. The spread of the ambiguity function is
modeled as the sum of variances along the axes in phase space. In order to
optimize the mother wavelet directly as a 1D signal, we pull-back the
variances, defined on the 2D phase space, to the so called window-signal space.
This is done using the recently developed wavelet-Plancharel theory. The
approach allows formulating the optimization problem of the 2D ambiguity
function as a minimization problem of the 1D mother wavelet. The resulting 1D
formulation is more efficient and does not involve complicated constraints on
the 2D ambiguity function. We optimize the mother wavelet using gradient

  Classification through Reinforced Label Hierarchy Reasoning","Accepted to Main Conference of NAACL 2021 as Long Paper",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exploiting label hierarchies has become a promising approach to tackling the
zero-shot multi-label text classification (ZS-MTC) problem. Conventional
methods aim to learn a matching model between text and labels, using a graph
encoder to incorporate label hierarchies to obtain effective label
representations \cite{rios2018few}. More recently, pretrained models like BERT
\cite{devlin2018bert} have been used to convert classification tasks into a
textual entailment task \cite{yin-etal-2019-benchmarking}. This approach is
naturally suitable for the ZS-MTC task. However, pretrained models are
underexplored in the existing work because they do not generate individual
vector representations for text or labels, making it unintuitive to combine
them with conventional graph encoding methods. In this paper, we explore to
improve pretrained models with label hierarchies on the ZS-MTC task. We propose
a Reinforced Label Hierarchy Reasoning (RLHR) approach to encourage
interdependence among labels in the hierarchies during training. Meanwhile, to
overcome the weakness of flat predictions, we design a rollback algorithm that
can remove logical errors from predictions during inference. Experimental
results on three real-life datasets show that our approach achieves better
performance and outperforms previous non-pretrained methods on the ZS-MTC task.

data in memory cells, excessive memory allocation, (accidental) heap alteration
in unexpected regions and others. Excessive memory allocation is nowadays
successfully resolved by memory analysers like Valgrind. Essentially, papers in
those areas did not bring any big breakthrough. Possible reasons may also
include the decrease of tension due to more available memory and parallel
threads. However, starting with Apt, problems related to variable modes have
not yet been resolved -- neither entirely nor in an acceptable way. Research
contributions over the last decades show again and again that heap issues
remain and remain complex and still important. A significant contribution was

Neptune. Only a fraction of the known centaurs have been found to display
comet-like features. Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is the most remarkable
active centaur. It orbits the Sun just beyond Jupiter in a nearly circular
path. Only a handful of known objects follow similar trajectories.
  Aims. We present photometric observations of 2020 MK4, a recently found
centaur with an orbit not too different from that of 29P, and we perform a
preliminary exploration of its dynamical evolution.
  Methods. We analyzed broadband Cousins R and Sloan g', r', and i' images of
2020 MK4 acquired with the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope and the IAC80 telescope to
search for cometary-like activity, and to derive its surface colors and size.
Its orbital evolution was studied using direct N-body simulations.
  Results. Centaur 2020 MK4 is neutral-gray in color and has a faint, compact
cometary-like coma. The values of its color indexes, (g'-r')=0.42+/-0.04 and
(r'-i')=0.17+/-0.04, are similar to the solar ones. A lower limit for the
absolute magnitude of the nucleus is Hg=11.30+/-0.03 mag which, for an albedo
in the range of 0.1-0.04, gives an upper limit for its size in the interval
(23, 37) km. Its orbital evolution is very chaotic and 2020 MK4 may be ejected
from the Solar System during the next 200 kyr. Comet 29P experienced relatively
close flybys with 2020 MK4 in the past, sometimes when they were temporary
Jovian satellites.
  Conclusions. We confirm the presence of a coma of material around a central
nucleus. Its surface colors place this centaur among the most extreme members
of the gray group. Although its past, present, and future dynamical evolution
resembles that of 29P, more data are required to confirm or reject a possible
connection between the two objects and perhaps others.

the generality of our rule by applying it to two distinct models: a complex
synapse with internal states which consolidate task-shared information, and a
dual-system architecture in which a primary network is rapidly modulated by
another one to learn the specifics of each task. For both models, our
meta-learning rule matches or outperforms reference algorithms on a wide range
of benchmark problems, while only using information presumed to be locally
available at neurons and synapses. We corroborate these findings with a
theoretical analysis of the gradient estimation error incurred by our rule.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Classical machine learning algorithms often assume that the data are drawn
i.i.d. from a stationary probability distribution. Recently, continual learning
emerged as a rapidly growing area of machine learning where this assumption is
relaxed, i.e. where the data distribution is non-stationary and changes over
time. This paper represents the state of data distribution by a context
variable $c$. A drift in $c$ leads to a data distribution drift.
  A context drift may change the target distribution, the input distribution,
or both. Moreover, distribution drifts might be abrupt or gradual. In continual
learning, context drifts may interfere with the learning process and erase
previously learned knowledge; thus, continual learning algorithms must include
specialized mechanisms to deal with such drifts. In this paper, we aim to
identify and categorize different types of context drifts and potential
assumptions about them, to better characterize various continual-learning
scenarios. Moreover, we propose to use the distribution drift framework to
provide more precise definitions of several terms commonly used in the
continual learning field.

techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These techniques have attracted
biologists as they offer powerful tools to explore microbial communities and
investigate their patterns of diversity in biological and biomedical samples at
remarkable resolution. However, the accuracy of these methods can negatively
affected by the presence of contamination. Several studies have recognized that
contamination is a common problem in microbial studies and have offered
promising computational and laboratory-based approaches to assess and remove
contaminants. Here we propose a novel strategy, MI-based (mutual information
based) filtering method, which uses information theoretic functionals and graph
theory to identify and remove contaminants. We applied MI-based filtering
method to a mock community data set and evaluated the amount of information
loss due to filtering taxa. We also compared our method to commonly practice
traditional filtering methods. In a mock community data set, MI-based filtering
approach maintained the true bacteria in the community without significant loss
of information. Our results indicate that MI-based filtering method effectively
identifies and removes contaminants in microbial communities and hence it can
be beneficial as a filtering method to microbiome studies. We believe our
filtering method has two advantages over traditional filtering methods. First,
it does not required an arbitrary choice of threshold and second, it is able to
detect true taxa with low abundance.

Two simulation methodologies were developed and can reproduce the nanogrid

challenge is to know \textit{when} to use load balancing techniques. In
general, this is done through load balancing criteria, which trigger load
balancing based on runtime application data and/or user-defined information. In
the first part of this paper, we introduce a novel, automatic load balancing
criterion derived from a simple mathematical model. In the second part, we
propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to find the load balancing iterations that
lead to the optimal application performance. This algorithm finds the optimal
load balancing scenario in quadratic time while, to the best of our knowledge,
this has never been addressed in less than an exponential time. Finally, we
compare the performance of the scenarios produced by state-of-the-art load
balancing criteria relative to the optimal load balancing scenario in synthetic
benchmarks and parallel N-body simulations. In the synthetic benchmarks, we
observe that the proposed criterion outperforms the other automatic criteria.
In the numerical experiments, we show that our new criterion is, on average,
$4.9\%$ faster than state-of-the-art load balancing criteria and can outperform
them by up to $17.6\%$. Moreover, we see in the numerical study that the
state-of-the-art automatic criteria are at worst $47.4\%$ slower than the

arbitrary BNN. It was constructed with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency
per classification. At the top-level, TULIP consists of a collection of unique
processing elements (TULIP-PEs) that are organized in a SIMD fashion. Each
TULIP-PE consists of a small network of binary neurons, and a small amount of
local memory per neuron. The unique aspect of the binary neuron is that it is
implemented as a mixed-signal circuit that natively performs the inner-product
and thresholding operation of an artificial binary neuron. Moreover, the binary
neuron, which is implemented as a single CMOS standard cell, is reconfigurable,
and with a change in a single parameter, can implement all standard operations
involved in a BNN. We present novel algorithms for mapping arbitrary nodes of a
BNN onto the TULIP-PEs. TULIP was implemented as an ASIC in TSMC 40nm-LP
technology. To provide a fair comparison, a recently reported BNN that employs
a conventional MAC-based arithmetic processor was also implemented in the same
technology. The results show that TULIP is consistently 3X more
energy-efficient than the conventional design, without any penalty in
performance, area, or accuracy.

identify the regions in phase space where the neutrino energy can be

reconstructed neutrino energy does not depend strongly on how one treats the
final-state interactions and is not much affected by the description of the

between these waves and larger-scale structures, such as current sheets and
ongoing turbulence remain a topic of investigation. Similarly, the
instabilities producing ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind remains an open
question. The goals of this paper are to investigate kinetic electrostatic
Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind at 0.5 AU and determine
whether current sheets and associated streaming instabilities can produce the
observed waves. The relationship between these waves and currents is
investigated statistically. Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves instrument
suite provides high-resolution snapshots of the fluctuating electric field. The
Low Frequency Receiver resolves the waveforms of ion-acoustic waves and the
Time Domain Sampler resolves the waveforms of both ion-acoustic and Langmuir
waves. Using these waveform data we determine when these waves are observed in
relation to current structures in the solar wind, estimated from the background
magnetic field. Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves are frequently observed in the
solar wind. Ion-acoustic waves are observed about 1% of the time at 0.5 AU. The
waves are more likely to be observed in regions of enhanced currents. However,
the waves typically do not occur at current structures themselves. The observed
currents in the solar wind are too small to drive instability by the relative
drift between single ion and electron populations. When multi-component ion
and/or electron distributions are present the observed currents may be
sufficient for instability. Ion beams are the most plausible source of
ion-acoustic waves. The spacecraft potential is confirmed to be a reliable
probe of the background electron density by comparing the peak frequencies of
Langmuir waves with the plasma frequency calculated from the spacecraft
potential.

in both the number of subjects and number of predictors; and can easily

estimators which minimize a penalized rank-based criterion often outperform
alternative estimators which minimize penalized weighted least squares
criteria. Application to nine cancer datasets further demonstrates that
rank-based estimators of semiparametric AFT models are competitive with
estimators assuming proportional hazards model in high-dimensional settings,

that can learn compact but expressive vector representations of nodes have
become highly desirable. Recently, bearing the message passing paradigm, graph
neural networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the performance of node
representation learning on graphs. However, a majority class of GNNs are only
designed for homogeneous graphs, leading to inferior adaptivity to the more
informative heterogeneous graphs with various types of nodes and edges. Also,
despite the necessity of inductively producing representations for completely
new nodes (e.g., in streaming scenarios), few heterogeneous GNNs can bypass the
transductive learning scheme where all nodes must be known during training.
Furthermore, the training efficiency of most heterogeneous GNNs has been
hindered by their sophisticated designs for extracting the semantics associated
with each meta path or relation. In this paper, we propose WIde and DEep
message passing Network (WIDEN) to cope with the aforementioned problems about
heterogeneity, inductiveness, and efficiency that are rarely investigated
together in graph representation learning. In WIDEN, we propose a novel
inductive, meta path-free message passing scheme that packs up heterogeneous
node features with their associated edges from both low- and high-order
neighbor nodes. To further improve the training efficiency, we innovatively
present an active downsampling strategy that drops unimportant neighbor nodes
to facilitate faster information propagation. Experiments on three real-world
heterogeneous graphs have further validated the efficacy of WIDEN on both
transductive and inductive node representation learning, as well as the
superior training efficiency against state-of-the-art baselines.

automatically learning high-order interactions among features to make
predictions without the need for manual feature engineering. With the prominent
development of deep neural networks (DNNs), there is a recent and ongoing trend
of enhancing the expressiveness of FM-based models with DNNs. However, though
better results are obtained with DNN-based FM variants, such performance gain
is paid off by an enormous amount (usually millions) of excessive model
parameters on top of the plain FM. Consequently, the heavy parameterization
impedes the real-life practicality of those deep models, especially efficient
deployment on resource-constrained IoT and edge devices. In this paper, we move
beyond the traditional real space where most deep FM-based models are defined,
and seek solutions from quaternion representations within the hypercomplex
space. Specifically, we propose the quaternion factorization machine (QFM) and
quaternion neural factorization machine (QNFM), which are two novel lightweight
and memory-efficient quaternion-valued models for sparse predictive analytics.
By introducing a brand new take on FM-based models with the notion of
quaternion algebra, our models not only enable expressive inter-component
feature interactions, but also significantly reduce the parameter size due to
lower degrees of freedom in the hypercomplex Hamilton product compared with
real-valued matrix multiplication. Extensive experimental results on three
large-scale datasets demonstrate that QFM achieves 4.36% performance
improvement over the plain FM without introducing any extra parameters, while
QNFM outperforms all baselines with up to two magnitudes' parameter size
reduction in comparison to state-of-the-art peer methods.

This phenomenon is known in predictive analytics as concept drift. This paper

questions were proposed and answered: (i) How do drift handling strategies

is to minimize the distortion of a group of pictures (GOP) under a rate

problem by maximizing a single reward function that often combines a distortion
and a rate reward. However, the way how these rewards are combined is usually
ad hoc and may not generalize well to various coding conditions and video

gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm for use with two critics, with
one learning to predict the distortion reward and the other the rate reward. In
particular, the distortion critic works to update the agent when the rate
constraint is satisfied. By contrast, the rate critic makes the rate constraint
a priority when the agent goes over the bit budget. Experimental results on
commonly used datasets show that our method outperforms the bit allocation
scheme in x265 and the single-critic baseline by a significant margin in terms

stability. Atomistic and molecular simulations have played an essential role in
the description of the optoelectronic properties and dynamical behaviour of
MHPs, respectively. However, the complex interplay of the dynamical and
optoelectronic properties in MHPs requires the simultaneous modelling of
electrons and ions in relatively large systems, which entails a high
computational cost, sometimes not affordable by the standard quantum mechanics
methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). Here, we explore the
suitability of the recently developed Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB)
method, GFN1-xTB, for simulating MHPs with the aim of exploring an efficient
alternative to DFT. The performance of GFN1-xTB for computing structural,
vibrational and optoelectronic properties of several MHPs is benchmarked
against experiments and DFT calculations. In general, this method produces
accurate predictions for many of the properties of the studied MHPs, which are
comparable to DFT and experiments. However, we also identify a few
shortcomings, related to specific geometries and chemical compositions.
Nevertheless, we believe that the tunability of GFN1-xTB is the key to
resolving any observed issues and we propose specific targets, whose refinement
will turn this method into a powerful computational tool for the study of MHPs

optical medium is usually substantially influenced by the medium optical
nonlinearity that can noticeably affect the laser pulse parameters around the
nonlinear focus and lead to unavoidable and often undesirable spatial
distortions of the focal waist. We present the results of our experimental
study and numerical simulations on a femtosecond Ti-Sapphire laser pulse
propagation in air under different spatial focusing. We concentrated our study
on spectral-angular and spatial pulse transformations under different focusing
regimes, from linear to nonlinear one, when pulse filamentation occurs. For the
first time to the best of our knowledge, we found the laser pulse numerical
apertures range,namely, from NA=0.002 to 0.005 (for laser pulse energy of 1
mJ), where the laser pulse distortions both in frequency-angular spectrum and
pulse spatial shape are minimal. By means of the numerical simulations, we
found the threshold pulse energy and peak power in a wide range of focusing
conditions, within which a transition between the linear and strongly nonlinear
laser pulse focusing in air takes place. This energy limit is shown to decrease
with pulse numerical aperture enhancement. Our findings identify the laser
pulse numerical apertures and energy adequate for getting a maximum laser
intensity with a good beam quality around the focal point suitable for various
laser micropatterning and micromachining technologies.

explainability that tries to give users more insights into how and why the
network arrives at its predictions, restricts the underlying model and hinders
performance to a certain degree. For example, decision trees are thought of as
being more explainable than deep neural networks but they lack performance on
visual tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that applying methods
and architectures from the explainability literature can, in fact, achieve
state-of-the-art performance for the challenging task of domain generalization
while offering a framework for more insights into the prediction and training
process. For that, we develop a set of novel algorithms including DivCAM, an
approach where the network receives guidance during training via gradient based
class activation maps to focus on a diverse set of discriminative features, as
well as ProDrop and D-Transformers which apply prototypical networks to the
domain generalization task, either with self-challenging or attention
alignment. Since these methods offer competitive performance on top of
explainability, we argue that the proposed methods can be used as a tool to
improve the robustness of deep neural network architectures.

application framework of higher-dimensional digital chaotic system (HDDCS). In
this study, topological mixing for HDDCS is strictly proved theoretically at
first. Topological mixing implies Devaney's definition of chaos in compact
space, but not vise versa. Therefore, the proof of topological mixing improves
and expands the theoretical framework of HDDCS. Then, a general design method
for constructing HDDCS via loop-state contraction algorithm is given. The
construction of the iterative function uncontrolled by random sequences
(hereafter called iterative function) is the starting point of this research.
On this basis, this article put forward a general design method to solve the
problem of HDDCS construction, and a number of examples illustrate the
effectiveness and feasibility of this method. The adjacency matrix
corresponding to the designed HDDCS is used to construct the chaotic echo state
network (ESN) for the Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The prediction
accuracy is improved with the increase of the size of the reservoir and the
dimension of HDDCS, indicating that higher-dimensional systems have better

transaction code variants over index selections up to database system parameter
tuning. UDO uses reinforcement learning to converge to near-optimal
configurations, creating and evaluating different configurations via actual
query executions (instead of relying on simplifying cost models). To cater to
different parameter types, UDO distinguishes heavy parameters (which are
expensive to change, e.g. physical design parameters) from light parameters.
Specifically for optimizing heavy parameters, UDO uses reinforcement learning
algorithms that allow delaying the point at which the reward feedback becomes
available. This gives us the freedom to optimize the point in time and the
order in which different configurations are created and evaluated (by
benchmarking a workload sample). UDO uses a cost-based planner to minimize
reconfiguration overheads. For instance, it aims to amortize the creation of
expensive data structures by consecutively evaluating configurations using
them. We evaluate UDO on Postgres as well as MySQL and on TPC-H as well as
TPC-C, optimizing a variety of light and heavy parameters concurrently.

data is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of
a data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning
algorithms, is \emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by
including each data point from the original data set with a known probability.
Although the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data
set is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution
obtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution
when using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss
caused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular
maximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects
each data point with probability at least $r\in[0,1]$. If we set $r=1$, our
problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full data set. We
define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal solution obtained
from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from the samples, over
independence systems. Our main contribution is to show that if the sampling
probability of each data point is at least $r$ and the utility function is
policywise submodular, then the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower
bounded by $1/r$. We show that the property of policywise submodular can be
found in a wide range of real-world applications, including pool-based active
learning and adaptive viral marketing.

decompose problems and provide interpretable intermediate outputs that give
confidence that the model is not simply latching onto data artifacts. Learning
these models is challenging, however, because end-task supervision only
provides a weak indirect signal on what values the latent decisions should
take. This often results in the model failing to learn to perform the
intermediate tasks correctly. In this work, we introduce a way to leverage
paired examples that provide stronger cues for learning latent decisions. When
two related training examples share internal substructure, we add an additional
training objective to encourage consistency between their latent decisions.
Such an objective does not require external supervision for the values of the
latent output, or even the end task, yet provides an additional training signal
to that provided by individual training examples themselves. We apply our
method to improve compositional question answering using neural module networks

been well studied in the literature. However, most previous studies made the
assumption that all road users require parking spaces at CBD area. However, in
recent years, due to technological advancements and low market entry barrier,
more and more e-dispatch FHVs (eFHVs) are provided in service. The rapidly
growing eFHVs, on one hand, supply substantial trip services and complete the
trips requiring no parking demand; on the other hand, imposes congestion
effects to all road users. In this study, we investigate the multi-modal
morning commute problem with bottleneck congestion and parking space
constraints in the presence of ride-sourcing and transit service. Meanwhile, we
derive the optimal number of parking spaces to best manage the commute traffic.
One interesting finding is that, in the presence of ride-sourcing, excessive
supply of parking spaces could incur higher system commute costs in the
multi-modal case.

parameters (e.g., height, chest size, etc.) poses a fundamental challenge for
person identification, online shopping and virtual reality. Existing approaches
for creating such 3D shapes often suffer from complex measurement by range
cameras or high-end scanners, which either involve heavy expense cost or result
in low quality. However, these high-quality equipments limit existing
approaches in real applications, because the equipments are not easily
accessible for common users. In this paper, we have designed a 3D human body
reshaping system by proposing a novel feature-selection-based local mapping
technique, which enables automatic anthropometric parameter modeling for each
body facet. Note that the proposed approach can leverage limited anthropometric
parameters (i.e., 3-5 measurements) as input, which avoids complex measurement,
and thus better user-friendly experience can be achieved in real scenarios.
Specifically, the proposed reshaping model consists of three steps. First, we
calculate full-body anthropometric parameters from limited user inputs by
imputation technique, and thus essential anthropometric parameters for 3D body
reshaping can be obtained. Second, we select the most relevant anthropometric
parameters for each facet by adopting relevance masks, which are learned
offline by the proposed local mapping technique. Third, we generate the 3D body
meshes by mapping matrices, which are learned by linear regression from the
selected parameters to mesh-based body representation. We conduct experiments
by anthropomorphic evaluation and a user study from 68 volunteers. Experiments
show the superior results of the proposed system in terms of mean
reconstruction error against the state-of-the-art approaches.

poorly on minor classes of scarce training data. Several recent works attribute
this to over-fitting to minor classes. In this paper, we provide a novel
explanation of this issue. We found that a neural network tends to first
under-fit the minor classes by classifying most of their data into the major
classes in early training epochs. To correct these wrong predictions, the
neural network then must focus on pushing features of minor class data across
the decision boundaries between major and minor classes, leading to much larger
gradients for features of minor classes. We argue that such an under-fitting
phase over-emphasizes the competition between major and minor classes, hinders
the neural network from learning the discriminative knowledge that can be
generalized to test data, and eventually results in over-fitting. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learning strategy to equalize the training
progress across classes. We mix features of the major class data with those of
other data in a mini-batch, intentionally weakening their features to prevent a
neural network from fitting them first. We show that this strategy can largely
balance the training accuracy and feature gradients across classes, effectively
mitigating the under-fitting then over-fitting problem for minor class data. On
several benchmark datasets, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art

Instead, they can drop off directly at the destination and AVs can cruise for

of AVs may increase the potential parking span substantially and affect the
spatial parking equilibrium. Given this, from urban planners' perspective, it
is of great necessity to reconsider the planning of parking supply along the

equilibrium considering the mix of AVs and HVs with parking cruising effect. It
is found that the equilibrium solution of travellers' parking location choices

optimal parking span of AVs at given parking supply should be no less than that
at equilibrium. Besides, the optimal parking planning to minimize the total
parking cost is also explored in a bi-level parking planning design problem

Dimensionality to identify and quantify hierarchies of kinematic patterns in
heterogeneous media. s-LID measures how outlying a grain's motion is relative
to its s nearest neighbors in displacement state space. To demonstrate the
merits of s-LID over the conventional measure of strain, we apply it to data on
individual grain motions in a set of deforming granular materials. Several new
insights into the evolution of failure are uncovered. First, s-LID reveals a
hierarchy of concurrent deformation bands that prevails throughout loading
history. These structures vary not only in relative dominance but also spatial
and kinematic scales. Second, in the nascent stages of the pre-failure regime,
s-LID uncovers a set of system-spanning, criss-crossing bands: microbands for
small s and embryonic-shearbands at large s, with the former being dominant. At
the opposite extreme, in the failure regime, fully formed shearbands at large s
dominate over the microbands. The novel patterns uncovered from s-LID
contradict the common belief of a causal sequence where a subset of microbands
coalesce and/or grow to form shearbands. Instead, s-LID suggests that the
deformation of the sample in the lead-up to failure is governed by a complex
symbiosis among these different coexisting structures, which amplifies and
promotes the progressive dominance of the embryonic-shearbands over microbands.
Third, we probed this transition from the microband-dominated regime to the
shearband-dominated regime by systematically suppressing grain rotations. We
found particle rotation to be an essential enabler of the transition to the
shearband-dominated regime. When grain rotations are completely suppressed,
this transition is prevented: microbands and shearbands coexist in relative
parity.

this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide
collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices
to train a shared AI model without exposing their data, which enjoys
considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL
implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing
decentralized FL training without the need for any central server.
Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm,

and the Dirac fermion DM coupled to charm quark. For $J/\psi\to \gamma+{\rm

operators with distinct Lorentz structures and photon spectra. The limits on
the decay branching fractions are obtained for different neutrino or DM
scenarios and then converted to the lower bounds on the new energy scales. The
most stringent bounds on the energy scale in neutrino and DM EFTs are 12.8 GeV
and 11.6 GeV, respectively. The purely invisible decay $J/\psi\to {\rm

relevant bound on the energy scale is above 100 GeV for the dipole operators.
We also evaluate the limit on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section converted
from $J/\psi$ data. The data of $J/\psi$ invisible decays are sensitive to the
light DM mass range where the DM direct detection experiments cannot probe yet.
The future Super Tau Charm Factory after one year run can push the limits down

enhancing the generalization performance across faces of people from different
ethnic backgrounds. Exploiting the ordinality of age, we also impose ranking
constraints on the prediction of the model and design our model such that it
takes as input a pair of images, and outputs both the relative age difference
and the rank of the first identity with respect to the other in terms of their
ages. Furthermore, we implement Multi-Dimensional Scaling to retrieve absolute
ages from the predicted age differences from as few as two labeled images from
the domain to be adapted to. We experiment with a publicly available dataset
with age labels, dividing it into subsets based on the ethnicity labels, and
evaluating the performance of our approach on the data from an ethnicity
different from the one that the model is trained on. Additionally, we impose a
constraint to preserve the sanity of the predictions with respect to relative

Similarly, choosing a unit imaginary split octonion u' in Im(O') equips O' with
a complex structure J', except that there are now two inequivalent complex
structures, one parametrised by a choice of a timelike and the other of a
spacelike unit u'. In either case, the identification S=OxO' implies that there
are two natural commuting complex structures J, J' on S. Our main new
observation is that the subgroup of Spin(11,3) that commutes with both J, J' on
S is the direct product Spin(6) x Spin(4) x Spin(1,3) of the Pati-Salam and
Lorentz groups, when u' is chosen to be timelike. The splitting of S into
eigenspaces of J corresponds to splitting into particles and anti-particles.
The splitting of S into eigenspaces of J' corresponds to splitting of Lorentz
Dirac spinors into two different chiralities. We also study the simplest
possible symmetry breaking scenario with the ""Higgs"" field taking values in the
representation that corresponds to 3-forms in R^{11,3}. We show that this Higgs
can be designed to transform as the bi-doublet of the left/right symmetric

address these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up

joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to
possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates
human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more
robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the
top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final
3D poses. Besides the integration of top-down and bottom-up networks, unlike
existing pose discriminators that are designed solely for single person, and
consequently cannot assess natural inter-person interactions, we propose a
two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions.
Lastly, we also apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3D ground-truth

paper, we show that such a BSM scheduling (with a fixed RRI) suffers from
severe under- and over- utilization of radio resources under varying vehicle

which in turn leads to increased collision risks. To address this, we extend
SPS to accommodate an adaptive RRI, termed as SPS++. Specifically, SPS++ allows
each vehicle -- (i) to dynamically adjust RRI based on the channel resource
availability (by accounting for various vehicle traffic scenarios), and then,
(ii) select suitable transmission opportunities for timely BSM transmissions at
the chosen RRI. Our experiments based on Mode-4 C-V2X standard implemented

galaxy size: the median radius $r_\mathrm{med}$, defined as the radius of a
sphere that contains 50% of the total luminosity or mass, that is, the median
distance of a star to the galaxy center. We examine how $r_\mathrm{med}$
depends on projected size measurements as a function of S\'ersic index and
intrinsic axis ratios, and demonstrate its relative independence of these
parameters. As an application we show that the projected semi-major axis length
of the ellipse enclosing 50% of the light is an unbiased proxy for
$r_\mathrm{med}$, with small galaxy-to-galaxy scatter of $\sim$10% (1$\sigma$),
under the condition that the variation in triaxiality within the population is
small. For galaxy populations with unknown or a large range in triaxiality an
unbiased proxy for $r_\mathrm{med}$ is $1.3\times R_{e}$, where $R_{e}$ is the
circularized half-light radius, with galaxy-to-galaxy scatter of 20-30%

galaxies based on the measured projected shape and prior knowledge of the
intrinsic shape distribution of the corresponding galaxy population. We make

LAGOS-AND datasets are substantially different from the existing ones. The
initial versions of the datasets (v1.0, released in February 2021) include 7.5M
citations authored by 798K unique authors (LAGOS-AND-BLOCK) and close to 1M
instances (LAGOS-AND-PAIRWISE). And both datasets show close similarities to
the whole Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) across validations of six facets. In
building the datasets, we reveal the variation degrees of last names in three
literature databases, PubMed, MAG, and Semantic Scholar, by comparing author
names hosted to the authors' official last names shown on the ORCID pages.
Furthermore, we evaluate several baseline disambiguation methods as well as the
MAG's author IDs system on our datasets, and the evaluation helps identify
several interesting findings. We hope the datasets and findings will bring new
insights for future studies. The code and datasets are publicly available.

models with a binary outcome (i.e., binary classification models) are often
constructed using methodology which assumes the costs of different
classification errors are equal. In many healthcare applications this
assumption is not valid, and the differences between misclassification costs
can be quite large. For instance, in a diagnostic setting, the cost of
misdiagnosing a person with a life-threatening disease as healthy may be larger
than the cost of misdiagnosing a healthy person as a patient. In this work, we
present Tailored Bayes (TB), a novel Bayesian inference framework which
""tailors"" model fitting to optimise predictive performance with respect to
unbalanced misclassification costs. We use simulation studies to showcase when
TB is expected to outperform standard Bayesian methods in the context of
logistic regression. We then apply TB to three real-world applications, a
cardiac surgery, a breast cancer prognostication task and a breast cancer
tumour classification task, and demonstrate the improvement in predictive
performance over standard methods.

Thus there are infinitely many string tensions, and this has been understood as

considerations, however, this richness in the spectrum of string tensions seems
mysterious. Conventional wisdom has it that it is the center symmetry that
classifies string tensions, but being finite it cannot explain infinitely many

solar coronal loops on the resonant absorption of kink magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) oscillations. We modelled a typical coronal loop by a straight and
axisymmetric cylindrical magnetic flux tube filled with cold plasma. We solved
the dispersion relation numerically for different values of the longitudinal
mass density stratification. We show that, in inclined and asymmetric loops,
the frequencies and their corresponding damping rates of the fundamental and
first-overtone modes of kink oscillations are smaller in comparison with
semi-circular uninclined loops with the same lengths. The results also indicate
that, the period ratio $P_1/P_2$, increases with increasing the inclination of
the loop, but it decreases less than $2\%$ while imposing the asymmetry to each
loop side, up to $9.66\%$ of the loop length. The ratio of each mode frequency
to its corresponding damping rate remain unchanged approximately while the
inclination or the asymmetry imposed. Hence, we conclude that these ratios are
reliable for inferring the physical parameters of coronal loops and coronal
medium, regardless of the loop shape or the state of its inclination. In
addition, in contrast with the effect of asymmetry which is not significant on
the period ratio $P_1/P_2$, when an observed oscillating loop has a smaller
apex height, the state of its inclination is an important factor that should be
considered, especially when the period ratio $P_1/P_2$, is taken into
consideration for coronal seismology.

formulated by Caragiannis and Micha [10]. Here, we are in a setting with two
election alternatives out of which one is assumed to be correct. In ODP, the
goal is to organise the delegations in the social network in order to maximize
the probability that the correct alternative, referred to as ground truth, is
elected. While the problem is known to be computationally hard, we strengthen
existing hardness results by providing a novel strong approximation hardness
result: For any positive constant $C$, we prove that, unless $P=NP$, there is
no polynomial-time algorithm for ODP that achieves an approximation guarantee
of $\alpha \ge (\ln n)^{-C}$, where $n$ is the number of voters. The reduction
designed for this result uses poorly connected social networks in which some
voters suffer from misinformation. Interestingly, under some hypothesis on
either the accuracies of voters or the connectivity of the network, we obtain a
polynomial-time $1/2$-approximation algorithm. This observation proves formally
that the connectivity of the social network is a key feature for the efficiency
of the liquid democracy paradigm. Lastly, we run extensive simulations and
observe that simple algorithms (working either in a centralized or
decentralized way) outperform direct democracy on a large class of instances.
Overall, our contributions yield new insights on the question in which
situations liquid democracy can be beneficial.

shown toxicity in mammary and pituitary cancers, as well as in monoblastic

increasing natural killer cell activity, IL-2 generation, as well as of
inhibiting tumor growth. DEP administration in old female rats has increased
IL-2 generation and inverted the age-related depletion of IFN-{\gamma}
generation in the spleen. Co-adjuvant DEP administration helped
preventing/mitigating symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy in cancer
treatment. It also enhanced the cytotoxic effects of antineoplastic drugs -

protected healthy cells from being damaged. DEP presented effect against
dysfunctions such as debilitating hormone imbalance triggered by pituitary
gland tumor; this gland produces the stimulatory hormone of adrenocorticotropic

widely accepted. Particularly in time series forecasting problems, this
combination is often dynamic to cope with potential non-stationary sources of
variation present in the data. Despite their superior predictive performance,
ensemble methods entail two main limitations: high computational costs and lack
of transparency. These issues often preclude the deployment of such approaches,
in favour of simpler yet more efficient and reliable ones. In this paper, we
leverage the idea of model compression to address this problem in time series
forecasting tasks. Model compression approaches have been mostly unexplored for
forecasting. Their application in time series is challenging due to the
evolving nature of the data. Further, while the literature focuses on neural
networks, we apply model compression to distinct types of methods. In an
extensive set of experiments, we show that compressing dynamic forecasting
ensembles into an individual model leads to a comparable predictive performance
and a drastic reduction in computational costs. Further, the compressed
individual model with best average rank is a rule-based regression model. Thus,
model compression also leads to benefits in terms of model interpretability.
The experiments carried in this paper are fully reproducible.

  Generalized Zero-Shot Learning","Accepted at AAAI2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) targets recognizing new categories by
learning transferable image representations. Existing methods find that, by
aligning image representations with corresponding semantic labels, the
semantic-aligned representations can be transferred to unseen categories.
However, supervised by only seen category labels, the learned semantic
knowledge is highly task-specific, which makes image representations biased
towards seen categories. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Contrastive
Embedding Network (DCEN) that simultaneously learns task-specific and
task-independent knowledge via semantic alignment and instance discrimination.
First, DCEN leverages task labels to cluster representations of the same
semantic category by cross-modal contrastive learning and exploring
semantic-visual complementarity. Besides task-specific knowledge, DCEN then
introduces task-independent knowledge by attracting representations of
different views of the same image and repelling representations of different
images. Compared to high-level seen category supervision, this instance
discrimination supervision encourages DCEN to capture low-level visual
knowledge, which is less biased toward seen categories and alleviates the
representation bias. Consequently, the task-specific and task-independent
knowledge jointly make for transferable representations of DCEN, which obtains
averaged 4.1% improvement on four public benchmarks.

and 9.2 (19.3) K, respectively, with J'/J = 0.47 (0.43) for A = Ba (Sr). For
each compound, heat capacity at low temperatures shows a large T-linear
component with no signature of long-range magnetic order above 2 K, which
suggests a gapless spin liquid state of one-dimensional character of the J
chains in spite of the significantly large J' couplings. This is a consequence
of one-dimensionalization by geometrical frustration in the ATL magnet; a
similar phenomenon has been observed in two compounds with slightly smaller
J'/J values: Cs2CuCl4 (J'/J = 0.3) and the related compound Ca3ReO5Cl2 (0.32).
Our findings demonstrate that 5d mixed-anion compounds provide a unique
opportunity to explore novel quantum magnetism.

  Proceedings",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of multilevel converters to renewable energy systems is a
growing topic due to their advantages in energy efficiency. Regarding its
control, model predictive control (MPC) has become very appealing due to its
natural consideration of discrete inputs, its optimization capability, and the
present-day availability of powerful processing hardware. The main drawback of
MPC compared to other control techniques in this field is that the control
input is held constant during the sampling period, and it is usually difficult
or even impossible to reduce this sampling period because of hardware
limitations. For this reason, a multirate MPC algorithm is proposed, which
allows to change the control input several times within the sampling period.
The optimization problem is simplified and made suboptimal to substantially
decrease computational burden. This approach is tested in simulation on a
three-phase, five-level diode-clamped converter (DCC) operating in inverted
mode with a three-phase resistive load. Results show significant reduction in
harmonic distortion at the cost of an increase in the number of commutations
with respect to a standard MPC operating at the same sampling period.

unlabeled domain by transferring knowledge from a separate labeled source
domain. However, most of these conventional UDA approaches make the strong
assumption of having access to the source data during training, which may not
be very practical due to privacy, security and storage concerns. A recent line
of work addressed this problem and proposed an algorithm that transfers
knowledge to the unlabeled target domain from a single source model without
requiring access to the source data. However, for adaptation purposes, if there
are multiple trained source models available to choose from, this method has to
go through adapting each and every model individually, to check for the best
source. Thus, we ask the question: can we find the optimal combination of
source models, with no source data and without target labels, whose performance
is no worse than the single best source? To answer this, we propose a novel and
efficient algorithm which automatically combines the source models with
suitable weights in such a way that it performs at least as good as the best
source model. We provide intuitive theoretical insights to justify our claim.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets
to show the effectiveness of our algorithm, where in most cases, our method not

how retail investors influence each other, and how social behaviours impact

specific assets spread at an increasing rate before peaking, and eventually
diminishing in importance -- a pattern reminiscent of an epidemiological

social dynamics among retail investors on asset prices. We find that the
interplay between `trend following' and `consensus formation' determines the
stability of price returns, with socially-driven investing potentially causing
oscillations and cycles. Our framework helps identify components of asset
demand stemming from social dynamics, which we predict using WSB data. Our
predictions explain significant variation in stock market activity. These

where a subset of the possible beam directions at the transmitter and receiver

transmit and receive antennas deployed in mmWave systems increase the
complexity of the beam selection and channel estimation tasks. In this work, we
tackle the channel estimation problem in analog systems from a different
perspective than used by previous works. In particular, we propose to move the
channel estimation problem from the angular domain into the transformed spatial
domain, in which estimating the angles of arrivals and departures corresponds
to estimating the angular frequencies of paths constituting the mmWave channel.
The proposed approach, referred to as transformed spatial domain channel
estimation (TSDCE) algorithm, exhibits robustness to additive white Gaussian
noise by combining low-rank approximations and sample autocorrelation functions
for each path in the transformed spatial domain. Numerical results evaluate the
mean square error of the channel estimation and the direction of arrival

a remarkably low computational complexity compared with well-known benchmarking

extremely sensitive to the confining potential and generically yields chaotic
flows. Here we study the quantum correlations and entanglement of such edge
modes in 4D droplets confined by harmonic traps, whose boundary is a squashed

independently along $S^1$ fibers, forming a bundle of 1D conformal field
theories over a 2D base space. By contrast, incommensurable frequencies produce
quasi-periodic, ergodic trajectories, each of which covers its invariant torus
densely; the corresponding correlation function of edge modes has fractal
features. This wealth of behaviors highlights the sharp differences between 4D

realized as the conformal boundary of a black droplet in even-dimensional
global AdS bulk spacetime. In $(2+1)$-dimensional CFT, the first law is shown
to be always satisfied by analyzing a class of metric perturbations of the

certain bulk hypersurface anchored to the conformal boundary of the boundary

there being no energy flux across the boundary of the boundary AdS black hole.

robust smart grid that capitalises on frequency reserves of renewable energy.
Frequency reserves are resources that adjust power production or consumption in
real time to react to a power grid frequency deviation. Revenue generation
motivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations.
However, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and
optimal bidding strategies for trading such capacities in multiple frequency
reserves markets. We address this limitation by making the following research
contributions. Firstly, a generalised model is designed based on an extensive
study of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets.
Secondly, three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to
capitalise on price peaks in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed
for non-reschedulable loads, in which case the bidding strategy aims to select
the market with the highest anticipated price, and the third bidding strategy
focuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices
are anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence
(AI) based bidding optimization framework that implements these three
strategies, with novel uncertainty metrics that supplement data-driven price
prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically using a case study
of multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland. The results from this
evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bidding strategies and the
AI-based bidding optimization framework in terms of cumulative revenue
generation, leading to an increased availability of frequency reserves.

historical measurements of environmental variables at monitoring stations. In
recent years, in addition to traditional data sources, large amounts of
information related to floods have been made available via social media.
Members of the public are constantly and promptly posting information and
updates on local environmental phenomena on social media platforms. Despite the
growing interest of scholars towards the usage of online data during natural
disasters, the majority of studies focus exclusively on social media as a
stand-alone data source, while its joint use with other type of information is

cosmology, remaining a prerequisite of many analyses. In creating novel methods
to produce redshift estimations, there has been a shift towards using machine
learning techniques. However, there has not been as much of a focus on how well
different machine learning methods scale or perform with the ever-increasing
amounts of data being produced. Here, we introduce a benchmark designed to
analyse the performance and scalability of different supervised machine
learning methods for photometric redshift estimation. Making use of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS - DR12) dataset, we analysed a variety of the most
used machine learning algorithms. By scaling the number of galaxies used to
train and test the algorithms up to one million, we obtained several metrics
demonstrating the algorithms' performance and scalability for this task.
Furthermore, by introducing a new optimisation method, time-considered
optimisation, we were able to demonstrate how a small concession of error can
allow for a great improvement in efficiency. From the algorithms tested we
found that the Random Forest performed best in terms of error with a mean
squared error, MSE = 0.0042; however, as other algorithms such as Boosted
Decision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbours performed incredibly similarly, we used
our benchmarks to demonstrate how different algorithms could be superior in
different scenarios. We believe benchmarks such as this will become even more
vital with upcoming surveys, such as LSST, which will capture billions of
galaxies requiring photometric redshifts.

largely due to the varying writing styles that exist amongst us. Prior works
however generally operate with the assumption that there is a limited number of
styles, most of which have already been captured by existing datasets. In this
paper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption
that there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we
will only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This
results in a commercially viable solution -- the model has the best shot at
adaptation being exposed to the new style, and the few samples nature makes it
practical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework
which exploits additional new-writer data through a support set, and outputs a
writer-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We
discover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key
characters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For
that, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a
character-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with
the sequential nature of text data. Our writer-adaptive MetaHTR framework can
be easily implemented on the top of most state-of-the-art HTR models.
Experiments show an average performance gain of 5-7% can be obtained by
observing very few new style data. We further demonstrate via a set of ablative
studies the advantage of our meta design when compared with alternative
adaption mechanisms.

derive speaker specific embeddings. The output of the SCAM are speaker specific

decisions generated using an end-to-end speaker diarization system. A joint
learning approach is also proposed where the diarization model and the ASR
acoustic model are jointly optimized. The experiments are performed on the
mixed-channel two speaker recordings from the Switchboard corpus of telephone

incorporating speaker activity decisions and joint optimization, improves
significantly over the ASR system with explicit source filtering (relative
improvements of 12% in word error rate (WER) over the baseline system).

$n$-dimensional random vector, and ${\bf N}$ is a Gaussian vector with a
covariance matrix ${\bf \mathsf{K}}_{\bf N}$. The object under consideration in
this paper is the conditional mean of ${\bf X}$ given ${\bf Y}={\bf y}$, that
is ${\bf y} \to E[{\bf X}|{\bf Y}={\bf y}]$. Several identities in the
literature connect $E[{\bf X}|{\bf Y}={\bf y}]$ to other quantities such as the
conditional variance, score functions, and higher-order conditional moments.
The objective of this paper is to provide a unifying view of these identities.
  In the first part of the paper, a general derivative identity for the
conditional mean is derived. Specifically, for the Markov chain ${\bf U}
\leftrightarrow {\bf X} \leftrightarrow {\bf Y}$, it is shown that the Jacobian
of $E[{\bf U}|{\bf Y}={\bf y}]$ is given by ${\bf \mathsf{K}}_{{\bf N}}^{-1}
{\bf Cov} ( {\bf X}, {\bf U} | {\bf Y}={\bf y})$.
  In the second part of the paper, via various choices of ${\bf U}$, the new
identity is used to generalize many of the known identities and derive some new
ones. First, a simple proof of the Hatsel and Nolte identity for the
conditional variance is shown. Second, a simple proof of the recursive identity
due to Jaffer is provided. Third, a new connection between the conditional
cumulants and the conditional expectation is shown. In particular, it is shown
that the $k$-th derivative of $E[X|Y=y]$ is the $(k+1)$-th conditional
cumulant.
  The third part of the paper considers some applications. In a first
application, the power series and the compositional inverse of $E[X|Y=y]$ are
derived. In a second application, the distribution of the estimator error
$(X-E[X|Y])$ is derived. In a third application, we construct consistent
estimators (empirical Bayes estimators) of the conditional cumulants from an
i.i.d. sequence $Y_1,...,Y_n$.

Segmenting breast regions accurately from ultrasound image is a challenging
task due to the inherent speckle artifacts, blurry breast lesion boundaries,
and inhomogeneous intensity distributions inside the breast lesion regions.
Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, the convolutional
operations in a CNN often focus on local regions, which suffer from limited
capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies of the input ultrasound
image, resulting in degraded breast lesion segmentation accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network equipped with a global
guidance block (GGB) and breast lesion boundary detection (BD) modules for
boosting the breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. The GGB utilizes the
multi-layer integrated feature map as a guidance information to learn the
long-range non-local dependencies from both spatial and channel domains. The BD
modules learn additional breast lesion boundary map to enhance the boundary
quality of a segmentation result refinement. Experimental results on a public
dataset and a collected dataset show that our network outperforms other medical
image segmentation methods and the recent semantic segmentation methods on
breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. Moreover, we also show the application
of our network on the ultrasound prostate segmentation, in which our method
better identifies prostate regions than state-of-the-art networks.

two BBHs from the first (O1) and second (O2) LIGO-Virgo observing runs, and two
additional BBHs from the O3a run. We then provide joint constraints with

the corresponding acceptable error in acceleration on the basis of the mission

block is inversely proportional to the computing power of the miner. To reduce
the average block generation time, a group of individual miners can form a
mining pool to aggregate their computing power to solve the puzzle together and
share the reward contained in the block. However, if the aggregated computing
power of the pool forms a substantial portion of the total computing power in
the network, the pooled mining undermines the core spirit of blockchain, i.e.,
the decentralization, and harms its security. To discourage the pooled mining,
we develop a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Age (PoA) that builds upon
the native PoW protocol. The core idea of PoA lies in using Age-of-Work (AoW)
to measure the effective mining period that the miner has devoted to
maintaining the security of blockchain. Unlike in the native PoW protocol, in
our PoA protocol, miners benefit from its effective mining period even if they
have not successfully mined a block. We first employ a continuous time Markov
chain (CTMC) to model the block generation process of the PoA based blockchain.
Based on this CTMC model, we then analyze the block generation rates of the
mining pool and solo miner respectively. Our analytical results verify that
under PoA, the block generation rates of miners in the mining pool are reduced
compared to that of solo miners, thereby disincentivizing the pooled mining.
Finally, we simulate the mining process in the PoA blockchain to demonstrate
the consistency of the analytical results.

graphene nanoribbon with a centric symmetry. The Rashba effect in this system
is associated with the local dipole field transverse to and in the plane of the
nanoribbon. That dipole field is induced by the off-center adsorption of the Gd
adatom above the hex-carbon ring near the nanoribbon edges. The transverse
Rashba effect at the two Gd adatoms enhances each other in the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and cancels each other in the
ferromagnetic (FM) meta-stable state, because of the centrosymmetric atomic
structure. The transverse Rashba parameter is 1.51 eV A. This system shows a
strong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), which is 1.4 meV per
Gd atom in the AFM state or 2.2 meV per Gd atom in the FM state. The origin of
the perpendicular MCA is analyzed in k-space by filtering out the contribution
of the transverse Rashba effect from the band structures perturbed by the
spin-orbit coupling interactions. The first-order perturbation of the orbit and
spin angular momentum coupling is the major source of the MCA, which is
associated with the one-dimensionality of the system. The transverse Rashba
effect and the strong perpendicular magnetization hosted simultaneously by the
proposed AFM Gd-adsorbed graphene nanoribbon lock the up- (or down-) spin
quantization direction to the forward (or backward) movement. This finding
offers a magnetic approach to a high coherency spin propagation in

propose that FRBs are triggered by crust fracturing of magnetars, with the
burst event rate depending on the magnetic field strength in the crust. Since
the crust fracturing rate is relatively higher in polar regions, FRBs are
preferred to be triggered near the directions of multipolar magnetic poles.
Crust fracturing produces Alfv\'en waves, forming a charge starved region in
the magnetosphere and leading to non-stationary pair plasma discharges. An FRB
is produced by coherent plasma radiation due to nonuniform pair production
across magnetic field lines. Meanwhile, the FRB-associated XRB is produced by
the rapid relaxation of the external magnetic field lines. In this picture, the
sharp-peak hard X-ray component in association with FRB 200428 is from a region
between adjacent trapped fireballs, and its spectrum with a high cutoff energy
is attributed to resonant Compton scattering. The persistent X-ray emission is
from a hot spot heated by the magnetospheric activities, and its temperature
evolution is dominated by magnetar surface cooling. Within this picture,
magnetars with stronger fields tend to produce brighter and more frequent
repeated bursts.

  2020)",,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Detecting and segmenting salient objects from given image scenes has received
great attention in recent years. A fundamental challenge in training the
existing deep saliency detection models is the requirement of large amounts of
annotated data. While gathering large quantities of training data becomes cheap
and easy, annotating the data is an expensive process in terms of time, labor
and human expertise. To address this problem, this paper proposes to learn the
effective salient object detection model based on the manual annotation on a
few training images only, thus dramatically alleviating human labor in training
models. To this end, we name this task as the few-cost salient object detection
and propose an adversarial-paced learning (APL)-based framework to facilitate
the few-cost learning scenario. Essentially, APL is derived from the self-paced
learning (SPL) regime but it infers the robust learning pace through the
data-driven adversarial learning mechanism rather than the heuristic design of
the learning regularizer. Comprehensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively
approach to the existing supervised deep salient object detection models with
only 1k human-annotated training images. The project page is available at

account the whole system containing the accelerator. With whole-system
visibility, the toolchain can better assist accelerator scoping and composition

Despite being focused on the 'meta-level' of accelerators, this would build on
existing and ongoing DSLs and toolchains for accelerator design. Basing this on
our experience in programmable networking and reconfigurable-hardware
programming, we propose an integrative approach that relies on three
activities: (i) generalizing the focus of acceleration to offloading to
accommodate a broader variety of non-functional needs -- such as security and
power use -- while using similar implementation approaches, (ii) discovering
what to offload, and to what hardware, through semi-automated analysis of a
whole system that might compose different offload choices that changeover time,
(iii) connecting with research and state-of-the-art approaches for using
domain-specific languages (DSLs) and high-level synthesis (HLS) systems for
custom offload development. We outline how this integration can drive new
development tooling that accepts models of programs and resources to assist
system designers through design-space exploration for the accelerated system.

parametric models with equation of state (EOS), $w(z) = w_0 + w_a f(z)$ for a
given function of redshift $f(z)$, we show that the errors in $w_a$ are
sensitive to $f(z)$: if $f(z)$ increases quickly with redshift $z$, then errors
in $w_a$ are smaller, and vice versa. As a result, parametric DDE models suffer
from a degree of arbitrariness and focusing too much on one model runs the risk
that DDE may be overlooked. In particular, we show the ubiquitous
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model is one of the least sensitive to DDE. We also
comment on ``wiggles"" in $w(z)$ uncovered in non-parametric reconstructions.
Concretely, we isolate the most relevant Fourier modes in the wiggles, model
them and fit them back to the original data to confirm the wiggles at
$\lesssim2\sigma$. We delve into the assumptions going into the reconstruction
and argue that the assumed correlations, which clearly influence the wiggles,
place strong constraints on field theory models of DDE.

quantum computer than on a classical computer. However, the currently available
quantum devices lack the capability to implement fault-tolerant quantum
algorithms for quantum simulation. Hybrid classical quantum algorithms such as
the variational quantum algorithms have been proposed to effectively use
current term quantum devices. One promising approach to quantum simulation in
the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the diagonalisation based
approach, with some of the promising examples being the subspace Variational
Quantum Simulator (SVQS), Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), fixed-state
Variational Fast Forwarding (fs-VFF), and the Variational Hamiltonian
Diagonalisation (VHD) algorithms. However, these algorithms require a feedback
loop between the classical and quantum computers, which can be a crucial
bottleneck in practical application. Here, we present the Classical Quantum
Fast Forwarding (CQFF) as an alternative diagonalisation based algorithm for
quantum simulation. CQFF shares some similarities with SVQS, VFF, fs-VFF and
VHD but removes the need for a classical-quantum feedback loop and controlled
multi-qubit unitaries. The CQFF algorithm does not suffer from the barren
plateau problem and the accuracy can be systematically increased. Furthermore,
if the Hamiltonian to be simulated is expressed as a linear combination of
tensored-Pauli matrices, the CQFF algorithm reduces to the task of sampling
some many-body quantum state in a set of Pauli-rotated bases, which is easy to
do in the NISQ era. We run the CQFF algorithm on existing quantum processors
and demonstrate the promise of the CQFF algorithm for current-term quantum
hardware. Our work provides a $10^4$ improvement over the previous record.

value decomposition methods. However, there are still a lot of limitations in
value function factorization. In VDN, the joint action-value function is the
sum of per-agent action-value function while the joint action-value function of
QMIX is the monotonic mixing of per-agent action-value function. To some
extent, QTRAN reduces the limitation of joint action-value functions that can
be represented, but it has unsatisfied performance in complex tasks. In this
paper, in order to extend the class of joint value functions that can be
represented, we propose a novel actor-critic method called NQMIX. NQMIX
introduces an off-policy policy gradient on QMIX and modify its network
architecture, which can remove the monotonicity constraint of QMIX and
implement a non-monotonic value function factorization for the joint
action-value function. In addition, NQMIX takes the state-value as the learning
target, which overcomes the problem in QMIX that the learning target is
overestimated. Furthermore, NQMIX can be extended to continuous action space
settings by introducing deterministic policy gradient on itself. Finally, we
evaluate our actor-critic methods on SMAC domain, and show that it has a
stronger performance than COMA and QMIX on complex maps with heterogeneous
agent types. In addition, our ablation results show that our modification of
mixer is effective.

reasonable questions. We show that accuracy in this fill-in-the-blank task is
well-correlated with human judgements of whether a question is reasonable, and
that these models can be trained to achieve nearly human-level performance in
completing comparative questions in three different subdomains. However,
analysis shows that what they learn fails to model any sort of broad notion of
which entities are semantically comparable or similar -- instead the trained
models are very domain-specific, and performance is highly correlated with
co-occurrences between specific entities observed in the training set. This is
true both for models that are pretrained on general text corpora, as well as
models trained on a large corpus of comparison questions. Our study thus

in population and medical genetics studies. With the advancement and decreasing
cost of sequencing technology, the increasingly available whole genome
sequencing data provide much richer information about the underlying population
structure. The traditional method (Patterson, Price, and Reich, 2006)
originally developed for array-based genotype data for computing and selecting
top principal components that capture population structure may not perform well
on sequencing data for two reasons. First, the number of genetic variants p is
much larger than the sample size n in sequencing data such that the
sample-to-marker ratio n/p is nearly zero, violating the assumption of the
Tracy-Widom test used in their method. Second, their method might not be able
to handle the linkage disequilibrium well in sequencing data. To resolve those
two practical issues, we propose a new method called ERStruct to determine the
number of top informative principal components based on sequencing data. More
specifically, we propose to use the ratio of consecutive eigenvalues as a more
robust test statistic, and then we approximate its null distribution using
modern random matrix theory. Both simulation studies and applications to two

gradient descent moves most of the iterations to lower, cheaper levels with the
aim of requiring only a few iterations on the higher, more expensive levels

descent variant that uses the highest-level distribution only. Under certain
assumptions, in the mean-field limit, the error of the proposed multilevel
Stein method decays by a log factor faster than the error of the single-level

enhanced pulling and pushing transversal optical forces acting on a single bead
placed above a one-dimensional photonic crystal due to directional excitation
of Bloch surface wave at the photonic crystal interface. Our theoretical
results, which are supported with numerical simulations, demonstrate angle or

shown to be prospective for precise optical sorting of nanoparticles,

the learning outcomes of the courses, to decide on offering transfer credits to

but also influenced by undue bias and administrative complexity. The proposed
research article focuses on identifying a model that exploits the advancements
in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively automate this

learning outcomes (LOs), a need for designing a tailor-made model arises. The
proposed model uses a clustering-inspired methodology based on knowledge-based
semantic similarity measures to assess the taxonomic similarity of LOs and a
transformer-based semantic similarity model to assess the semantic similarity
of the LOs. The similarity between LOs is further aggregated to form course to
course similarity. Due to the lack of quality benchmark datasets, a new
benchmark dataset containing seven course-to-course similarity measures is
proposed. Understanding the inherent need for flexibility in the
decision-making process the aggregation part of the model offers tunable
parameters to accommodate different scenarios. While providing an efficient
model to assess the similarity between courses with existing resources, this

  assimilation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High-fidelity patient-specific modeling of cardiovascular flows and
hemodynamics is challenging. Direct blood flow measurement inside the body with
in-vivo measurement modalities such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D
flow MRI) suffer from low resolution and acquisition noise. In-vitro
experimental modeling and patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
models are subject to uncertainty in patient-specific boundary conditions and
model parameters. Furthermore, collecting blood flow data in the near-wall
region (e.g., wall shear stress) with experimental measurement modalities poses
additional challenges. In this study, a computationally efficient data
assimilation method called reduced-order modeling Kalman filter (ROM-KF) was
proposed, which combined a sequential Kalman filter with reduced-order modeling
using a linear model provided by dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The goal of
ROM-KF was to overcome low resolution and noise in experimental and uncertainty
in CFD modeling of cardiovascular flows. The accuracy of the method was
assessed with 1D Womersley flow, 2D idealized aneurysm, and 3D patient-specific
cerebral aneurysm models. Synthetic experimental data were used to enable
direct quantification of errors using benchmark datasets. The accuracy of
ROM-KF in reconstructing near-wall hemodynamics was assessed by applying the
method to problems where near-wall blood flow data were missing in the
experimental dataset. The ROM-KF method provided blood flow data that were more
accurate than the computational and synthetic experimental datasets and
improved near-wall hemodynamics quantification.

framework handles such behaviors in two levels: 1) short-term human behaviors
are adapted through our novel Anticipatory Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (A-POMDP) models, covering a human's changing intent (motivation),
availability, and capability; 2) long-term changing human characteristics are
adapted by our novel Adaptive Bayesian Policy Selection (ABPS) mechanism that
selects a short-term decision model, e.g., an A-POMDP, according to an estimate
of a human's workplace characteristics, such as her expertise and collaboration
preferences. To design and evaluate our framework over a diversity of human

framework in simulation over novel human models. Then, we deploy and evaluate
it on our novel physical experiment setup that induces cognitive load on humans
to observe their dynamic behaviors, including their mistakes, and their
changing characteristics such as their expertise. We conduct user studies and
show that our framework effectively collaborates non-stop for hours and adapts
to various changing human behaviors and characteristics in real-time. That
increases the efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration with a higher
perceived collaboration, positive teammate traits, and human trust. We believe

joint evolution of object-system and measuring apparatus. For this, a model of
measurement is proposed which lends itself to theoretical analysis using
Hamiltonian mechanics and Bayesian probability. At odds with a widely-held
intuition, it is found that the ideal measurement capable of extracting finite
information without disturbing the system is ruled out (by the third law of
thermodynamics). And in its place a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance
relation is found, with the role of $\hbar/2$ played by $k_BT/\Omega$; where
$T$ and $\Omega$ are a certain temperature and frequency characterizing the
ready-state of the apparatus. The proposed model is argued to be maximally
efficient, in that it saturates this Heisenberg-like inequality, while various
modifications of the model fail to saturate it. The process of continuous
measurement is then examined; yielding a novel pair of Liouville-like master
equations -- according to whether the measurement record is read or discarded
-- describing the dynamics of (a rational agent's knowledge of) a system under
continuous measurement. The master equation corresponding to discarded record
doubles as a description of an open thermodynamic system. The fine-grained
Shannon entropy is found to be a Lyapunov function (i.e. $\dot S\geq0$) of the
dynamics when the record is discarded, providing a novel H-theorem suitable for
studying the second law and non-equilibrium statistical physics. These findings
may also be of interest to those working on the foundations of quantum
mechanics, in particular along the lines of attempting to identify and unmix a
possible epistemic component of quantum theory from its ontic content. More
practically, these results may find applications in the fields of precision

of Einstein's relativity. This is mainly due to the distinction between
measuring and seeing, where the former is described by the Lorentz
Transformation and the latter considers the time light rays (emitted by each
point on the object) take to reach the observer. We compute the apparent
position of a point given its velocity, initial position, and observation time.
The apparent speed of a point is calculated, and we obtain that it exceeds the
speed of light when approaching the observer, similar to superluminal motion.
For parameterizable surfaces, we analyze properties (such as curvature and
torsion) of apparent shapes. The observation that a sphere retains its circular
silhouette when transformed to its apparent shape, independent of the initial
conditions, is proved mathematically. Plots describing the apparent speed and
length of objects are made, and the metric tensor for a distorted sphere is
calculated. A generalized equation for the Doppler effect and relativistic
aberration is derived to analyze regions of redshift and blueshift. Using the
Born-rigidity conditions, we compute the hyperbolic trajectories of each point
on an extended object given an initial velocity, position, and proper
acceleration for any reference point. The claim that a rigid body, accelerating
in Special Relativity, cannot exceed a given length in certain circumstances is
justified. We obtain many non-trivial results, which are proved algebraically
and using light cones, that are tested by taking the limit of acceleration
approaching 0 to retrieve results in the constant velocity scenario. In
conclusion, these visualizations may be used by teachers to explain SR
intuitively. Finally, we provide an overview of extending the same problem to
curved spacetime and explain the potential applications of this project.

  South American Protests",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research across different disciplines has documented the expanding
polarization in social media. However, much of it focused on the US political
system or its culturally controversial topics. In this work, we explore
polarization on Twitter in a different context, namely the protest that
paralyzed several countries in the South American region in 2019. By leveraging
users' endorsement of politicians' tweets and hashtag campaigns with defined
stances towards the protest (for or against), we construct a weakly labeled
stance dataset with millions of users. We explore polarization in two related
dimensions: language and news consumption patterns. In terms of linguistic
polarization, we apply recent insights that leveraged machine translation
methods, showing that the two communities speak consistently ""different""
languages, mainly along ideological lines (e.g., fascist translates to
communist). Our results indicate that this recently-proposed methodology is
also informative in different languages and contexts than originally applied.
In terms of news consumption patterns, we cluster news agencies based on
homogeneity of their user bases and quantify the observed polarization in its
consumption. We find empirical evidence of the ""filter bubble"" phenomenon
during the event, as we not only show that the user bases are homogeneous in
terms of stance, but the probability that a user transitions from media of
different clusters is low.

diagonalization of sets of matrices by an invertible matrix, a new algorithm is
developed based on the generalized eigen vectors of a commuting matrix.
Moreover, a new characterization for the simultaneous block diagonalization by

industrial applications, and recently a lot of attention is paid to the deep
interest models which use attention mechanism to capture user interests from
historical behaviors. However, most current models are based on sequential
models which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have
difficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is
that sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,
carrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a
non-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first
represent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector
contains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance
the Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel
attention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large
scale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional
partition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition
data into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among
information aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also
partition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among
them. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets: one is an advertising
dataset and the other is a production recommender dataset. Our models
outperform other state-of-the-art models on both datasets.

  Maximization Problem","39 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.SI cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given a social network of users with selection cost, the \textsc{Budgeted
Influence Maximization Problem} (\emph{BIM Problem} in short) asks for
selecting a subset of the nodes (known as \emph{seed nodes}) within an
allocated budget for initial activation to maximize the influence in the
network. In this paper, we study this problem under the
\emph{co\mbox{-}operative game theoretic} framework. We model this problem as a
co\mbox{-}operative game where the users of the network are the players and for
a group of users, the expected influence by them under the \emph{Maximum
Influence Arborences} diffusion model is its utility. We call this game as
\emph{BIM Game} and show this is `non-convex' and `sub-additive'. Based on the
proposed game\mbox{-}theoretic model and using the solution concept called
`Shapley Value', we propose an iterative algorithm for finding seed nodes. The
proposed methodology is divided into mainly two broad steps: the first one is
computing the approximate marginal gain in \emph{Shapley Value} for all the
nodes of the network, and the second one is selecting seed nodes from the
sorted list until the budget is exhausted. We also show that the proposed
methodology can even be more effective when the community structure of the
network is exploited. The proposed methodologies have been implemented, and an
extensive set of experiments have been conducted with three publicly available
social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the seed set
selected by the proposed methodologies lead to more number of influence nodes
compared to many standard and baseline methods from the literature with a
reasonable computational overhead. In particular, if the community structure of
the network is exploited then there is an increase upto $2 \%$ in number of
influenced nodes.

express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as
natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a
catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as
depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of
deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis
with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with
COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where the rise and
fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and
employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people
have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep
understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we
present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long
short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis
during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM
language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language
model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which
covers the first major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises
multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be
expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have
been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel
COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak.
The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been
optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way
the pandemic was handled by the authorities.

inconsistencies that result when deriving equivalent micropolar models of
periodic beam-lattice materials through standard continualization schemes. In
fact, this technique identifies higher order micropolar continua characterized
by non-positive defined elastic potential energy. Despite this, such models are
capable of accurately simulating the optical branches of the discrete
Lagrangian model, a property lacking in the thermodynamically consistent
standard micropolar continuum. To overcome these thermodynamic inconsistencies
while preserving good simulations of the frequency band structure, a dynamic
high-frequency consistent continualization is proposed. This continualization
scheme is based on a first order regularization approach coupled with a
suitable transformation of the difference equation of motion of the discrete
Lagrangian system into pseudo-differential equations. A formal Taylor expansion
of the pseudo-differential operators allows to obtain differential field
equations at various orders according to the continualization order.
Thermodynamically consistent higher order micropolar continua with non-local
elasticity and inertia are obtained. Finally, the convergence of the frequency
band structure of the higher order micropolar models to that of the discrete
Lagrangian system is shown as the continualization order increases.

has limits in simulating the frequency band structure of packed granular
materials (see Merkel et al., 2011). It is here shown that if a standard
continualization of the difference equation of motion of the discrete model is
carried out, an equivalent micropolar continuum is obtained which is able to
accurately simulate the optical branches of the discrete model. Nevertheless,
this homogenized continuum presents non-positive defined elastic potential
energy, a deficiency that limits the reliability of the model and implies
instability phenomena (destabilizing effects) in the acoustic branches. This
drawback is circumvented here through an high-frequency dynamic homogenization
scheme which is based on an enhanced continualization of the discrete governing
equations into pseudo-differential equations. Through a formal Taylor expansion
of the pseudo-differential operators a higher order differential equation
corresponding to the governing equation of a non-local continuum
thermodynamically consistent are obtained. The resulting approach allows
obtaining an equivalent micropolar continuum characterized by inertial
non-locality. Moreover, higher order continua with non-local constitutive and
inertial terms may be derived. The proposed continuum models are proved to be
able to accurately describe both the static and dynamic behavior of the
discrete granular model. Finally, the convergence to the response of the
discrete system is shown when increasing the order of the higher order
continuum.

devices and vibration attenuation tools, with nearly complete band gaps for
shear waves. It is shown that such structures, named pentamode bearings, can
respond either in the stretching-dominated regime, or in the bending-dominated
regime, depending on the nature of the joints connecting the different members.
Their response is characterized by high vertical stiffness and theoretically
zero shear stiffness in the stretching dominated regime, or considerably low
values of such a quantity in the bending dominated regime. Available results on
the experimental response of 3d printed models to combined compression and
shear loading highlight that the examined structures are able to exhibit energy
dissipation capacity and effective damping that are suitable for seismic
isolation devices. Their fabrication does not necessarily require heavy
industry, and expensive materials, being possible with ordinary 3-D printers.

queries is not straightforward for non-expert users who need to have sufficient
knowledge about both the vocabulary and the structure of the queried knowledge
graph, as well as the syntax of the structured query language used to describe
the user's information needs. The most popular approach introduced to overcome
the aforementioned challenges is to use natural language to query these
knowledge graphs. Although several question answering benchmarks can be used to
evaluate question-answering systems over a number of popular knowledge graphs,
choosing a benchmark to accurately assess the quality of a question answering
system is a challenging task.
  In this paper, we introduce CBench, an extensible, and more informative
benchmarking suite for analyzing benchmarks and evaluating question answering
systems. CBench can be used to analyze existing benchmarks with respect to
several fine-grained linguistic, syntactic, and structural properties of the
questions and queries in the benchmark. We show that existing benchmarks vary
significantly with respect to these properties deeming choosing a small subset
of them unreliable in evaluating QA systems. Until further research improves
the quality and comprehensiveness of benchmarks, CBench can be used to
facilitate this evaluation using a set of popular benchmarks that can be
augmented with other user-provided benchmarks. CBench not only evaluates a
question answering system based on popular single-number metrics but also gives
a detailed analysis of the linguistic, syntactic, and structural properties of
answered and unanswered questions to better help the developers of question
answering systems to better understand where their system excels and where it
struggles.
