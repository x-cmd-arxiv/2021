string-of-pearls configuration, we examine in detail observations of the
reformation of a fast magnetosonic shock observed on the upstream edge of a
foreshock transient structure upstream of Earth's bow shock. The four MMS
spacecraft were separated by several hundred km, comparable to suprathermal ion
gyro-radius scales or several ion inertial lengths. At least half of the shock
reformation cycle was observed, with a new shock ramp rising up out of the
""foot"" region of the original shock ramp. Using the multipoint observations, we
convert the observed time-series data into distance along the shock normal in
the shock's rest frame. That conversion allows for a unique study of the
relative spatial scales of the shock's various features, including the shock's
growth rate, and how they evolve during the reformation cycle. Analysis
indicates that: the growth rate increases during reformation, electron-scale
physics play an important role in the shock reformation, and energy conversion
processes also undergo the same cyclical periodicity as reformation. Strong,
thin electron-kinetic-scale current sheets and large-amplitude electrostatic
and electromagnetic waves are reported. Results highlight the critical
cross-scale coupling between electron-kinetic- and ion-kinetic-scale processes
and details of the nature of nonstationarity, shock-front reformation at
collisionless, fast magnetosonic shocks.

measures the largest diagonal tensor that can be obtained by applying linear
operations to the different indices (legs) of the tensor (just like the matrix
rank measures the largest diagonal matrix that can be obtained using row and

Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as lexical categories
created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out

feedback because it influences the heat radiated to space. Convective
self-aggregation (CSA) is a profound modelling paradigm for explaining the
clustering of tropical oceanic thunderstorms. However, CSA is hampered in the
realistic limit of fine model resolution when cold pools -- dense air masses
beneath thunderstorm clouds -- are well-resolved. Studies on CSA usually assume
the surface temperature to be constant, despite realistic surface temperatures
varying significantly between night and day, even over the sea. Here we mimic
oscillating surface temperatures in cloud resolving numerical experiments and
show that, in the presence of a diurnal cycle, CSA is enabled by high
resolutions. We attribute this finding to vigorous combined cold pools emerging
in symbiosis with mesoscale convective systems. Such cold pools suppress
buoyancy in extended regions ($\mathbf{\sim 100}$ km) and enable the formation
of persistent dry patches. Our findings help clarify how the tropical cloud
field forms sustained clusters under realistic conditions and may have
implications for the origin of extreme thunderstorm rainfall and tropical
cyclones.

  early epidemic stage",,,,,"stat.AP q-bio.PE stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Background: Following the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic in early 2020,
municipalities, regional governments and policymakers worldwide had to plan
their Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) amidst a scenario of great
uncertainty. At this early stage of an epidemic, where no vaccine or medical
treatment is in sight, algorithmic prediction can become a powerful tool to
inform local policymaking. However, when we replicated one prominent
epidemiological model to inform health authorities in a region in the south of
Brazil, we found that this model relied too heavily on manually predetermined
covariates and was too reactive to changes in data trends.
  Methods: Our four proposed variations of the original method allow accessing
data of daily reported infections and take into account the under-reporting of
cases more explicitly. Two of the proposed versions also attempt to model the
delay in test reporting. We simulated weekly forecasting of deaths from the
period from 31/05/2020 until 31/01/2021. That workflow allowed us to run a
lighter version of the model after the first calibration week. Google Mobility
data, weekly updated, were used as covariates to the model at each simulated
run.
  Findings: The changes made the model significantly less reactive and more
rapid in adapting to scenarios after a peak in deaths is observed. Assuming
that reported cases were under-reported greatly benefited the model in its
stability, and modelling retroactively-added data (due to the ""hot"" nature of
the data used) had a negligible impact on performance.
  Interpretation: Although not as reliable as death statistics, case
statistics, when modelled in conjunction with an ""overestimate"" parameter,
provide a good alternative for improving the forecasting of models, especially
in long-range predictions and after the peak of an infection wave.

Linear SVM and DenseNet, using three data averaging strategies. We used a
standard average, weighted based on number of training data, and weighted based
on the number of ASD patients in the training data to average the results,
thereby increasing accuracy in clinical applications. The results we obtained
support our hypothesis. Our novel architecture is able to effectively automate
ASD pre-screening with a maximum weighted accuracy of 84%.

non-zero density away from an integer filling the excitations interact. The
system on the small mass side has a large bandwidth and forms a Fermi liquid.
On the large mass side the bandwidth is narrow, the compressibility is negative
and the Fermi liquid is likely unstable. This explains the observed sawtooth
features in compressibility, the Landau fans pointing away from charge
neutrality as well as their degeneracies. By providing a description of the
charge itineracy in the normal state this framework sets the stage for
superconductivity at lower temperatures.

constructivist grounded theory, which proves a suitable qualitative method for

both new practitioners and scientists. We identify five challenges that
practitioners experience: event system evolution, the steep learning curve,
lack of available technology, rebuilding projections, and data privacy. For the
first challenge of event system evolution, we uncover five tactics and
solutions that support practitioners in their design choices when developing
evolving event sourced systems: versioned events, weak schema, upcasting,

accretion disk created around the newly formed black hole due to the
supermassive black hole binaries which merge inside the gaseous disk. The newly
formed black hole would have a kick velocity at up to thousands of km/s that
drives a perturbation on a newly accreted torus around the black hole. Some of
the observed supermassive black holes at the center of the Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) move with a certain velocity relative to its broader accretion
disk. In this paper, the effects of the kicked black holes onto the
infinitesimally thin accreted torus are studied by using the general
relativistic hydrodynamical code, focusing on changing the dynamics of the
accretion disk during the accretion disk-black hole interaction. We have found
the non-axisymmetric global mode m=1 inhomogeneity, which causes a spiral-wave
structure, is excited on the torus due to kicked black hole. The higher the
perturbation velocity produced by the kicked black hole, the longer time the
torus takes to reach the saturation point. The created spiral density waves
which rapidly evolve into the spiral shocks are also observed from the
numerical simulations. The spiral shock is responsible for accreting matter
toward the black hole. Firstly, the spiral-wave structure is developed and the
accretion through the spiral arms is stopped around the black hole. At the
later time of simulation, the formed spiral shocks partly cause the angular
momentum loss across the torus.

The median velocity difference between thus calculated LSRs and the Galactic

significantly to as large as ~40 km/s. More importantly, the velocity

  algebra induced by piecewise affine maps",,,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, for $p\in(1,\infty)$ we study $p$-complete boundedness of
weighted homomorphisms on the $p$-analog of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebras,
$B_p(G)$, based on the $p$-operator space structure defined by the authors.
Here, for a locally compact group $G$, the space $B_p(G)$ stands for Runde's
definition of the $p$-analog of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra and the
implemented $p$-operator space structure is come from the duality between
$B_p(G)$ and the algebra of universal $p$-pseudofunctions, $UPF_p(G)$. It is
established that the homomorphism $\Phi_\alpha:B_p(G)\to B_p(H)$, defined by
$\Phi(u)=u\circ\alpha$ on $Y$ and zero otherwise, is $p$-completely contractive
when the continuous and proper map $\alpha :Y\subseteq H\to G$ is affine, and
it is $p$-completely bounded whenever $\alpha$ is piecewise affine map.
Moreover, we assume that $Y$ belongs to the coset ring generated by open and
amenable subgroups of $H$. To obtain the result, by utilizing the properties of
$QSL_p$-spaces and representations on them, the relation between $B_p(G/N)$ and
a closed subalgebra of $B_p(G)$ is shown, where $N$ is a closed normal subgroup
of $G$. Additionally, $p$-complete boundedness of several well-known maps on
such algebras are obtained.

power spectrum estimator based on a diagonal approximation to the quadratic
Fisher matrix estimator. XFaster uses Monte Carlo simulations to compute noise
biases and filter transfer functions and is thus a hybrid of both Monte Carlo

based methods, the algorithm described here requires a minimal number of
simulations, and does not require them to be precisely representative of the
data to estimate accurate covariance matrices for the bandpowers. The formalism
works with polarization-sensitive observations and also data sets with
identical, partially overlapping, or independent survey regions. The method was
first implemented for the analysis of BOOMERanG data, and also used as part of
the Planck analysis. Here, we describe the full, publicly available analysis
package, written in Python, as developed for the analysis of data from the 2015
flight of the SPIDER instrument. The package includes extensions for
self-consistently estimating null spectra and for estimating fits for Galactic

gapped states harboring emergent topology with quantized Hall conductivity.
Emergent topological states have been found in partially filled Landau levels
and Hofstadter bands; in both cases, a large magnetic field is required to
engineer the underlying flat band. The recent observation of quantum anomalous
Hall effects (QAH) in narrow band moir\'e systems has led to the theoretical
prediction that such phases may be realized even at zero magnetic field. Here
we report the experimental observation of insulators with Chern number $C=1$ in
the zero magnetic field limit at $\nu=3/2$ and $7/2$ filling of the moir\'e
superlattice unit cell in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG). Our
observation of Chern insulators at half-integer values of $\nu$ suggests
spontaneous doubling of the superlattice unit cell, in addition to spin- and
valley-ferromagnetism. This is confirmed by Hartree-Fock calculations, which
find a topological charge density wave ground state at half filling of the
underlying $C=2$ band, in which the Berry curvature is evenly partitioned
between occupied and unoccupied states. We find the translation symmetry
breaking order parameter is evenly distributed across the entire folded
superlattice Brillouin zone, suggesting that the system is in the flat band,
strongly correlated limit. Our findings show that the interplay of quantum
geometry and Coulomb interactions in moir\'e bands allows for topological
phases at fractional superlattice filling that spontaneously break
time-reversal symmetry, a prerequisite in pursuit of zero magnetic field phases
harboring fractional statistics as elementary excitations or bound to lattice
dislocations.

indefinitely stable neutron stars, through supramassive (SMNS) or hypermassive
(HMNS) neutron stars supported only temporarily against gravity, to black holes
formed promptly after the merger. Up-to-date constraints on the BNS total mass
and the neutron star equation of state suggest that a long-lived SMNS may form
in $\sim 0.45-0.9$ of BNS mergers. A maximally rotating SMNS needs to lose
$\sim 3-6\times 10^{52}$ erg of it's rotational energy before it collapses, on
a fraction of the spin-down timescale. A SMNS formation imprints on the
electromagnetic counterparts to the BNS merger. However, a comparison with
observations reveals tensions. First, the distribution of collapse times is too
wide and that of released energies too narrow (and the energy itself too large)
to explain the observed distributions of internal X-ray plateaus, invoked as
evidence for SMNS-powered energy injection. Secondly, the immense energy
injection into the blastwave should lead to extremely bright radio transients
which previous studies found to be inconsistent with deep radio observations of
short gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we show that upcoming all-sky radio
surveys will constrain the extracted energy distribution, independently of a
GRB jet formation. Our results can be self-consistently understood, provided
that most BNS merger remnants collapse shortly after formation (even if their
masses are low enough to allow for SMNS formation). This naturally occurs if
the remnant retains half or less of its initial energy by the time it enters
solid body rotation.

incident UV background radiation. Models of UV background are known to have
large variations, mainly because they are synthesized using poorly constrained
parameters, which introduce uncertainty in the inferred properties of the CGM.
Here, we quantify this uncertainty using a large set of new UV background
models with physically motivated toy models of metal-enriched CGM. We find
that, the inferred density and metallicity of low-density ($10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$)
gas is uncertain by factors of 6.3 and 3.2, whereas high density ($10^{-3}$
cm$^{-3}$) gas by factors of 4 and 1.6, respectively. The variation in the
shape of the UV background models is entirely responsible for such a variation
in the metallicity while variation in the density arises from both
normalization and shape of the UV background. Moreover, we find a harder
(softer) UV background infers higher (lower) density and metallicity. We also
study warm-hot gas at $T= 10^{5.5}$ K and find that metallicity is robustly
estimated but the inferred density is uncertain by a factor of 3 to 5.4 for low
to high-density gas. Such large uncertainties in density and metallicity may
severely limit the studies of the CGM and demand better observational
constraints on the input parameters used in synthesizing UV background.

the total mass density and either the galaxy number density distributions or
the stellar mass distribution. Star-forming galaxies are spatially
significantly less concentrated than quiescent galaxies. The orbits of cluster
galaxies are isotropic near the center and more radial outside. Star-forming
galaxies and galaxies of low stellar mass tend to move on more radially
elongated orbits than quiescent galaxies and galaxies of high stellar mass.
Q(r), determined either using the total mass or the number density profile, is
very close to the power-law behavior predicted by numerical simulations. The

results ($z_s=1.0-2.0$), we also provide results for maps inferred from lensing
of the cosmic microwave background, i.e., $z_s=1100$. We include a {\em
Euclid}-type realistic survey mask and noise. In agreement with the recent
studies on the position-dependent power spectrum, we find that the results from

corrections are included. Performing a rough estimate, we find that the (S/N)

the value of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution parameter

errors made when reconstructing accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
data.
  Methods: Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in k-space (SPARK) trains a
convolutional-neural-network to estimate and correct k-space errors made by an
input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error
loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input technique's
reconstructed ACS. First, SPARK is applied to GRAPPA and demonstrates improved
robustness over other scan-specific models, such as RAKI and residual-RAKI.
Subsequent experiments demonstrate that SPARK synergizes with residual-RAKI to
improve reconstruction performance. SPARK also improves reconstruction quality
when applied to advanced acquisition and reconstruction techniques like 2D
virtual coil (VC-) GRAPPA, 2D LORAKS, 3D GRAPPA without an integrated ACS
region, and 2D/3D wave-encoded images.
  Results: SPARK yields 1.5x - 2x RMSE reduction when applied to GRAPPA and
improves robustness to ACS size for various acceleration rates in comparison to
other scan-specific techniques. When applied to advanced reconstruction
techniques such as residual-RAKI, 2D VC-GRAPPA and LORAKS, SPARK achieves up to
20% RMSE improvement. SPARK with 3D GRAPPA also improves performance by ~2x and
perceived image quality without a fully sampled ACS region. Finally, SPARK
synergizes with non-cartesian 2D and 3D wave-encoding imaging by reducing RMSE
between 20-25% and providing qualitative improvements.
  Conclusion: SPARK synergizes with physics-based acquisition and
reconstruction techniques to improve accelerated MRI by training scan-specific
models to estimate and correct reconstruction errors in k-space.

the performance of the traditional GS relaxation based on a triangular solve is
compared with two-stage variants, replacing the direct triangular solve with a
fixed number of inner Jacobi-Richardson (JR) iterations. When a small number of
inner iterations is sufficient to maintain the Krylov convergence rate, the
two-stage GS (GS2) often outperforms the traditional algorithm on many-core

of flops for SpMV (e.g. three JR sweeps compared to two GS sweeps with one
inner JR sweep), the GS2 iterations, and the Krylov solver preconditioned with
GS2, may converge faster than the JR iterations. Moreover, for some problems
(e.g. elasticity), it was found that JR may diverge with a damping factor of
one, whereas two-stage GS may improve the convergence with more inner

weakly labeled with categorical information but without dense temporal
annotations. Furthermore, optimizing the model over brief clips impedes its
ability to learn long-term temporal dependencies. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a collaborative memory mechanism that encodes
information across multiple sampled clips of a video at each training

the optimization difficulties. Our proposed framework is end-to-end trainable

Accordingly, their locomotive strategies must adapt to a wide range of terrain,

patterns (ICPs) vary smoothly with walking speed, rather than switching between
distinct gaits as in vertebrates (e.g., horses transitioning between trotting
and galloping). Such a continuum of stepping patterns implies that separate
neural controllers are not necessary for each observed ICP. Furthermore, the
spectrum of \textit{Drosophila} stepping patterns includes all canonical
coordination patterns observed during forward walking in insects. This raises
the exciting possibility that the controller in \textit{Drosophila} is common

encode a logical qubit, which is protected against errors at the physical qubit
level. Here we use a trapped ion system to experimentally prepare $m$-qubit GHZ
states and sample the measurement results to construct $m\times m$ logical
states of the $[[m^2,1,m]]$ Shor code, up to $m=7$. The synthetic logical
fidelity shows how deeper encoding can compensate for additional gate errors in
state preparation for larger logical states. However, the optimal code size
depends on the physical error rate and we find that $m=5$ has the best
performance in our system. We further realize the direct logical encoding of
the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code on nine qubits in a thirteen-ion chain for
comparison, with $98.8(1)\%$ and $98.5(1)\%$ fidelity for state
$\left\vert\pm\right\rangle_L$, respectively.

through the usage of the service itself, so that the observations are censored,
as they are inherently limited by available supply. Since the 1980s, various
works on Censored Quantile Regression models have performed well under such
conditions. Further, in the last two decades, several papers have proposed to
implement these models flexibly through Neural Networks. However, the models in
current works estimate the quantiles individually, thus incurring a
computational overhead and ignoring valuable relationships between the
quantiles. We address this gap by extending current Censored Quantile
Regression models to learn multiple quantiles at once and apply these to
synthetic baseline datasets and datasets from two shared mobility providers in
the Copenhagen metropolitan area in Denmark. The results show that our extended

(ii) extends traditional pointwise annotations by accounting for the spatial
uncertainty of each annotation, which can either be directly specified by the
user, or aggregated from pointwise annotations from multiple experts; and (iii)
naturally provides a new strategy for the evaluation of deformable registration
algorithms. Our approach is validated on four different registration tasks. The
experimental results show the efficacy of suggesting annotations according to
their informativeness, and an improved capacity to assess the quality of the
outputs of registration algorithms. In addition, our approach yields, from
sparse annotations only, a dense visualization of the errors made by a

transmitted through virus-laden particles expelled when an infectious person
sneezes, coughs, talks, or breathes. These virus-laden particles are more
highly concentrated in the expiratory jet of an infectious person than in a
well-mixed room, but this near-field enhancement in virion exposure has not
been well quantified. Transmission of airborne viruses depends on factors that
are inherently variable and, in many cases, poorly constrained, and quantifying
this uncertainty requires large ensembles of model simulations that span the
variability in input parameters. However, models that are well-suited to
simulate the near-field evolution of respiratory particles are also
computationally expensive, which limits the exploration of parametric
uncertainty. In order to perform many simulations that span the wide
variability in factors governing transmission, we developed the
Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD). QuaRAD is
an efficient framework for simulating the evolution of virus-laden particles
after they are expelled from an infectious person, their deposition to the
nasal cavity of a susceptible person, and the subsequent risk of initial
infection. We simulated 10,000 scenarios to quantify the risk of initial
infection by a particular virus, SARS-CoV-2. The predicted risk of infection
was highly variable among scenarios and, in each scenario, was strongly
enhanced near the infectious individual. In more than 50% of scenarios, the
physical distancing needed to avoid near-field enhancements in airborne
transmission was beyond the recommended safe distance of two meters (six feet)
if the infectious person is not wearing a mask, though this distance defining
the near-field extent was also highly variable among scenarios.

obstruction flat CR manifolds are plentiful, the only known compact examples
are the spherical CR manifolds. We consider the obstruction flatness problem
for small deformations of the standard CR 3-sphere. That rigidity holds for the
CR sphere was previously known (in all dimensions) for the case of embeddable
CR structures, where it also holds at the infinitesimal level. In the
3-dimensional case, however, a CR structure need not be embeddable. While in
the nonembeddable case we may no longer interpret the obstruction density
$\mathcal{O}$ in terms of the boundary regularity of Fefferman's equation (or
the logarithmic singularity of the Bergman kernel) the equation
$\mathcal{O}\equiv 0$ is still of great interest, e.g., since it corresponds to
the Bach flat equation of conformal gravity for the Fefferman space of the CR
structure (a conformal Lorentzian 4-manifold). Unlike in the embeddable case,
it turns out that in the nonembeddable case there is an infinite dimensional
space of solutions to the linearized obstruction flatness equation on the

space of the embeddable deformations. In spite of this, we show that the CR

enhanced by several orders of magnitude. In the resonant case the bilayer SHG
signal reaches amplitudes comparable to the off-resonant signal from a
monolayer. In applied electric fields the interlayer exciton energies can be
tuned due to their in-built electric dipole via the Stark effect. As a result
the interlayer exciton degeneracy is lifted and the bilayer SHG response is
further enhanced by an additional two orders of magnitude, well reproduced by
our model calculations.

short of the precise and flexible wavefront control over large beam areas
needed to empower emerging integrated miniaturized optical systems that
leverage volumetric light matter interactions, including trapping, cooling, and

techniques, and solutions obtained by them are often difficult to physically
understand and generalize. Here by posing the problem to a carefully
constrained computational inverse design algorithm capable of large area
structures, we discover a qualitatively new class of grating couplers. The
numerically found solutions can be understood as coupling an incident photonic
slab mode to a spatially extended slow-light (near-zero refractive index)
region, backed by a Bragg reflector. The structure forms a spectrally broad
standing wave resonance at the target wavelength, radiating vertically into
free space. A reflection-less adiabatic transition critically couples the
incident photonic mode to the resonance, and the numerically optimized lower
cladding provides 70 $\%$ overall theoretical conversion efficiency. We have
experimentally validated efficient surface normal collimated emission of

tunable operating wavelength of $\approx$ 780 nm. The variable-mesh-deformation

dwarf ages. We compile a sample of 892 M dwarfs with Halpha equivalent width
(HaEW) measurements from the literature that are either co-moving with a white
dwarf of known age (21 stars) or in a known young association (871 stars). In
this sample we identify 7 M dwarfs that are new candidate members of known
associations. By dividing the stars into active and inactive categories
according to their HaEW and spectral type (SpT), we find that the fraction of
active dwarfs decreases with increasing age, and the form of the decline
depends on SpT. Using the compiled sample of age-calibrators we find that HaEW
and fractional Halpha luminosity (LHaLbol) decrease with increasing age. HaEW
for SpT<M7 decreases gradually up until ~1Gyr. For older ages, we found only
two early M dwarfs which are both inactive and seem to continue the gradual
decrease. We also found 14 mid-type out of which 11 are inactive and present a
significant decrease of HaEW, suggesting that the magnetic activity decreases
rapidly after ~1Gyr. We fit LHaLbol versus age with a broken power-law and find
an index of -0.11+0.02-0.01 for ages <~776Myr. The index becomes much steeper
at older ages however a lack of field age-calibrators leaves this part of the
relation far less constrained. Finally, from repeated independent measurements
for the same stars we find that 94% of these has a level of HaEW variability
<=5A at young ages (<1Gyr).

spin textures. In chiral magnets with cubic lattice symmetry, all
previously-observed skyrmion phases require thermal fluctuations to become
thermodynamically stable in bulk materials, and therefore exist only at
relatively high temperature, close to the helimagnetic transition temperature.
Other stabilization mechanisms require a lowering of the cubic crystal
symmetry. Here, we report the identification of a second skyrmion phase in
Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$ at low temperature and in the presence of an applied
magnetic field. The new skyrmion phase is thermodynamically disconnected from
the well-known, nearly-isotropic, high-temperature phase, and exists, in
contrast, when the external magnetic field is oriented along the
$\langle100\rangle$ crystal axis only. Theoretical modelling provides evidence
that the stabilization mechanism is given by well-known cubic anisotropy terms,
and accounts for an additional observation of metastable helices tilted away
from the applied field. The identification of two distinct skyrmion phases in
the same material and the generic character of the underlying mechanism suggest
a new avenue for the discovery, design, and manipulation of topological spin
textures.

third-body perturbations caused by the Moon and the Sun. Orbit propagations are
performed using two algorithms based on different equations of motion and
numerical integration methods: (i) Gauss planetary equations for modified

8-7th-order Dorman and Prince formulas; (ii) Cartesian state equations of
motion in an Earth-fixed frame with a Runge-Kutta Fehlberg 7/8 integration
scheme. The numerical results exhibit excellent agreement over integration
times of decades. Some well-known phenomena emerge, such as the longitudinal
drift due to the resonance between the orbital motion and Earth's rotation,
attributable to the J22 term of the geopotential. In addition, the third-body
perturbation due to Sun and Moon causes two major effects: (a) a precession of
the orbital plane, and (b) complex longitudinal dynamics. This study proposes
an analytical approach for the prediction of the precessional motion and shows
its agreement with the orbit evolution obtained numerically. Moreover,
long-term orbit propagations show that the above mentioned complex longitudinal

symbiotic entities (Model-S), based on Conway's Game of Life. In this article,
we examine three trends that biologists have observed in the evolution of
symbiotes. (1) Management: If one partner is able to control the symbiotic
relation, this control can reduce conflict; thus, evolutionary selection
favours symbiotes that have a manager. (2) Mutualism: Although partners in a
symbiote often have conflicting needs, evolutionary selection favours symbiotes
in which partners are better off together inside the symbiote than they would
be as individuals outside of the symbiote. (3) Interaction: Repeated
interaction among partners in symbiosis tends to promote increasing fitness due
to evolutionary selection. We have added new components to Model-S that allow
us to observe these three trends in runs of Model-S. The new components are
analogous to the practice of staining cells in biology research, to reveal
patterns that are not usually visible. When we measure the fitness of a
symbiote by making it compete with other symbiotes, we find that fitter
symbiotes have significantly more management, mutualism, and interaction than
less fit symbiotes. These results confirm the trends observed in nature by
biologists. Model-S allows biologists to study these evolutionary trends and
other characteristics of symbiosis in ways that are not tractable with living

These interactions include protein diffusion and formation of aggregates due to
protein-protein interactions in the plane of the membrane. Recently, we
developed a model that couples the in-plane flow of lipids and diffusion of
proteins with the out-of-plane bending of the membrane. Building on this work,
here, we focus on the role of explicit aggregation of proteins on the surface
of the membrane in the presence of membrane bending and diffusion. We develop a
comprehensive framework that includes lipid flow, membrane bending, the entropy
of protein distribution, along with an explicit aggregation potential and
derive the governing equations for the coupled system. We compare this
framework to the Cahn-Hillard formalism to predict the regimes in which the
proteins form patterns on the membrane. We demonstrate the utility of this
model using numerical simulations to predict how aggregation and diffusion,
when coupled with curvature generation, can alter the landscape of
membrane-protein interactions.

studied. Disorder causes an obvious effect of broadening. Microscopically, an

Much less trivial is that short-scale fluctuations, with a period of the order
of the Bohr radius, cause a well-defined down-shift of the exciton levels. We
demonstrate that this shift exceeds the broadening parametrically and study the
dependence of this shift on the orbital number. Difference of the shifts for
neighboring levels leads to effective renormalization of the Bohr energy. Most
remarkable effect is the disorder-induced splitting of S and P exciton levels.
The splitting originates from the fact that disorder lifts the accidental

dissipation of wave energy by sea ice, based on model-data inversion, and
studied the correlation with various other parameters, such as ice thickness
and sea state variables. Here, we use that dataset to propose a new dissipation
parameterization which explicitly incorporates the dependence on the ice
thickness, in addition to the wave frequency. The goal is to determine whether
a parameterization dependent on wave frequency and ice thickness can be more
accurate than one dependent only on wave frequency. Due to the dominant impact
of frequency and confounding difficulties of field measurements, this is not a
foregone conclusion. A parameterization is developed using the
non-dimensionalization approach proposed by Yu et al. (2019). We find that the
non-dimensionalization does result in significant scale collapse of the data,

strategy for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 terms has been to offer instruction
weighted toward hybrid or fully online modalities. Colleges are now considering
whether and how to expand hybrid or fully in-person instruction for future
terms, and learn lessons from this experience for future use. Our paper uses
Fall 2019 enrollment data for a medium-sized public American university to
analyze whether some student groupings by class standing or course level are
more susceptible to the spread of infectious disease through academic
enrollment networks. Replicating Weeden and Cornwell [8], we find that
enrollment networks at the institution are ""small worlds"" characterized by high
clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent connections.
Connectivity decreases as class standing (graduate vs. undergraduate; senior
vs. freshman) and course level increase; as students move from generalized to
specialized course loads, networks cluster by major. Holding other factors
constant, policies focusing on in-person instruction for lower division
students conflict with the greater risk of infectious spread through a lower
division network in the absence of additional steps to minimize academic
connectivity. There are academic and financial incentives for emphasizing the
freshman experience, including concerns about student attrition from the first
to second academic year and recouping costs of infrastructure investments in
dormitories. Possible solutions could include (i) restricting face-to-face or
hybrid instruction to courses in students' academic majors, which would disrupt
larger networks into smaller ones and thus restrict the spread of infection
across majors, and (ii) take a ""scalpel"" approach to instruction modes by
moving online courses most likely to facilitate epidemic spread.

understanding of urban geometry. High-quality building footprint generation

municipal decision-making at scale. However, previous Deep Learning-based
approaches face consequential issues such as scale invariance and defective
footprints, partly due to ever-present class-wise imbalance. Additionally, most

teacher forcing, guides a model with the reference output history. At inference
stage, the generated output history must be used. This mismatch can impact
performance. However, it is highly challenging to train the model using the
generated output. Several approaches have been proposed to address this
problem, normally by selectively using the generated output history. To make
training stable, these approaches often require a heuristic schedule or an
auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces attention forcing for NMT. This
approach guides the model with the generated output history and reference
attention, and can reduce the training-inference mismatch without a schedule or
a classifier. Attention forcing has been successful in TTS, but its application
to NMT is more challenging, due to the discrete and multi-modal nature of the
output space. To tackle this problem, this paper adds a selection scheme to
vanilla attention forcing, which automatically selects a suitable training
approach for each pair of training data. Experiments show that attention
forcing can improve the overall translation quality and the diversity of the

flaring times, and constrain the physical mechanism responsible for gamma-ray
emission. We adopt here a Scan-Statistic driven clustering method (iSRS) to
recognize flaring states within the FERMI-LAT data, and identify the time of
activity-peaks. Results: Flares waiting times can be described with a
poissonian process, consisting of a set of overlapping bursts of flares, with
an average burst duration of about 0.6 year, and average rate of 1.3/y . For
waiting times below 1d host-frame we found a statistically-relevant second
population, the fast-component, mainly from CTA 102 data. The period of
conspicuous detection of the fast component for CTA 102 coincides with the
crossing-time of the superluminal K1 feature with the C1 stationary feature in
radio reported in Jorstad et al. (2017); Casadio et al. (2019). Conclusions: To
reconcile the mechanism proposed in Jorstad et al. (2017); Casadio et al.
(2019) with the bursting-activity, we have to assume that plasma streams with a
typical length of about 2pc (in the stream reference-frame) reach the
recollimation-shock. Otherwise, the distribution of waiting-times can be
interpreted as originating from relativistic-plasma moving along the jet for a
deprojected length of about 30-50pc (assuming a Lorentz-factor=10), that
sporadically produces gamma-ray flares. In magnetic-reconnection scenario,
reconnection events or plasma injection to the reconnection-sites should be
intermittent. Individual plasmoids can be resolved in a few favourable cases
only (Christie et al., 2019); they could be responsible for the fast component.

quantitative analysis of the stones, particularly stone-size estimation, that
helps the surgeon decide if the stone requires more fragmentation. Factors such
as turbid fluid inside the cavity, specularities, motion blur due to kidney
movements and camera motion, bleeding, and stone debris impact the quality of
vision within the kidney and lead to extended operative times. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt made towards multi-class segmentation
in ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy data. We propose an end-to-end CNN-based
framework for the segmentation of stones and laser fiber. The proposed approach
utilizes two sub-networks: HybResUNet, a version of residual U-Net, that uses
residual connections in the encoder path of U-Net and a DVFNet that generates
DVF predictions which are then used to prune the prediction maps. We also
present ablation studies that combine dilated convolutions, recurrent and
residual connections, ASPP and attention gate. We propose a compound loss
function that improves our segmentation performance. We have also provided an
ablation study to determine the optimal data augmentation strategy. Our
qualitative and quantitative results illustrate that our proposed method
outperforms SOTA methods such as UNet and DeepLabv3+ showing an improvement of
5.2% and 15.93%, respectively, for the combined mean of DSC and JI in our
invivo test dataset. We also show that our proposed model generalizes better on
a new clinical dataset showing a mean improvement of 25.4%, 20%, and 11% over
UNet, HybResUNet, and DeepLabv3+, respectively, for the same metric.

Formal static analysis is seeing increasingly widespread adoption as a tool for

can take minutes or hours to get batch analysis results after a code change.
While existing techniques offer some demand-driven or incremental aspects for
certain classes of analysis, the fundamental challenge we tackle is doing both
for arbitrary abstract interpreters.
  Our technique, demanded abstract interpretation, lifts program syntax and
analysis state to a dynamically evolving graph structure, in which program
edits, client-issued queries, and evaluation of abstract semantics are all
treated uniformly. The key difficulty addressed by our approach is the
application of general incremental computation techniques to the complex,
cyclic dependency structure induced by abstract interpretation of loops with
widening operators. We prove that desirable abstract interpretation
meta-properties, including soundness and termination, are preserved in our
approach, and that demanded analysis results are equal to those computed by a
batch abstract interpretation. Experimental results suggest promise for a
prototype demanded abstract interpretation framework: by combining incremental

results at interactive speeds, answering 95% of queries within 1.2 seconds.

methods for a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that drive the behavior of

interpretation of those systems. Defining rules that determine how the output
activity of biological entities is regulated by their respective inputs has
proven to be challenging, due to increasingly larger models and the presence of
noise in data, allowing multiple model parameterizations to fit the
experimental observations.
  We present several Boolean function metrics that provide modelers with the
appropriate framework to analyze the impact of a particular model
parameterization. We demonstrate the link between a semantic characterization
of a Boolean function and its consistency with the model's underlying
regulatory structure. We further define the properties that outline such
consistency and show that several of the Boolean functions under study violate
them, questioning their biological plausibility and subsequent use. We also
illustrate that regulatory functions can have major differences with regard to
their asymptotic output behavior, with some of them being biased towards
specific Boolean outcomes when others are dependent on the ratio between
activating and inhibitory regulators.
  Application results show that in a specific signaling cancer network, the
function bias can be used to guide the choice of logical operators for a model
that matches data observations. Moreover, graph analysis indicates that the
standardized Boolean function bias becomes more prominent with increasing
numbers of regulators, confirming the fact that rule specification can
effectively determine regulatory outcome despite the complex dynamics of

widely used in practical unstructured-grid fluid-dynamics solvers but with
confusions: e.g., third-order accuracy with kappa=1/2 or kappa=1/3. This paper
clarifies some of these confusions: e.g., the U-MUSCL scheme can be third-order
accurate in the point-valued solution with kappa=1/3 on regular grids for
linear equations in all dimensions, it can be third-order accurate with
kappa=1/2 as the QUICK scheme in one dimension. It is shown that the U-MUSCL

special case of kappa=1/2 on regular simplex-element grids, but it can be an
accurate low-dissipation second-order scheme. It is also shown that U-MUSCL
extrapolates a quadratic function exactly with kappa=1/2 on arbitrary grids
provided the gradient is computed by a quadratic least-squares method. Two
techniques are discussed, which transform the U-MUSCL scheme into being
genuinely third-order accurate on a regular grid: an efficient

in advance the set of constructions subject to variation. The learned CxG is
evaluated on how well it describes held-out test corpora while dialectometry is
evaluated on how well it can model regional varieties of English. Themethod is
tested using two distinct datasets: First, the International Corpus of English
representing eight outer circle varieties; Second, a web-crawled corpus

produces a grammar with stable quality across sub-sets of a single corpus that

high degree of accuracy, thus (3) supporting dialectometricmethods formeasuring
the similarity between varieties of English and (4) measuring the degree to
which each construction is subject to regional variation. This is important for
cognitive sociolinguistics because it operationalizes the idea that competition
between constructions is organized at the functional level so that

through an orientation and measure-preserving domain diffeomorphism. The
development is then verified for Lagrangian variants of POD and DMD using
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of two canonical flow configurations at Mach
0.5, the lid-driven cavity and flow past a cylinder, representing internal and
external flows, respectively, at pre- and post-bifurcation Reynolds numbers.
The LMA is demonstrated for several situations encompassing unsteady flow
without and with boundary and mesh deformation as well as non-uniform base
flows that are steady in Eulerian but not in Lagrangian frames. We show that
LMA application to steady nonuniform base flow yields insights into flow
stability and post-bifurcation dynamics. LMA naturally leads to Lagrangian
coherent flow structures and connections with finite-time Lyapunov exponents
(FTLE). We examine the mathematical link between FTLE and LMA by considering a
double-gyre flow pattern. Dynamically important flow features in the Lagrangian
sense are recovered by performing LMA with forward and backward (adjoint) time
procedures.

is common practice for the analysis of stochastic chemical systems. Despite
their widespread use, however, many such techniques rely on unverifiable
assumptions and only few provide mechanisms to control the approximation error
quantitatively. Addressing this gap, Dowdy and Barton [The Journal of Chemical
Physics, 149(7), 074103 (2018)] proposed a method for the computation of
guaranteed bounds on the moment trajectories associated with stochastic
chemical systems described by the Chemical Master Equation, thereby providing a
general framework for error quantification. Here, we present an extension of
this method. The key contribution is a new hierarchy of convex necessary moment
conditions crucially reflecting the temporal causality and other regularity
conditions that are inherent to the moment trajectories associated with
stochastic processes described by the Chemical Master Equation. Analogous to
the original method, these conditions generate a hierarchy of semidefinite
programs that furnishes monotonically improving bounds on the trajectories of
the moments and related statistics. Compared to its predecessor, the presented
hierarchy produces bounds that are at least as tight and it often enables the
computation of dramatically tighter bounds as it enjoys superior scaling
properties and the generated semidefinite programs are highly structured. We
analyze the properties of the presented hierarchy, discuss some aspects of its
practical implementation and demonstrate its merits with several examples.

open interval is a finite union of points and open intervals. The latter is a
variant of van den Dries and Miller's analytic geometric categories and
Shiota's $\mathfrak X$-sets and $\mathfrak Y$-sets. In them, the family of

  Another contribution of this paper is a uniform local definable cell

$\mathcal M=(M,<,0,+,\ldots)$. Let $\{A_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ be a
finite family of definable subsets of $M^{m+n}$. Take an arbitrary positive
element $R \in M$ and set $B=]-R,R[^n$. Then, there exists a finite partition

\emptyset$ or $X_i \subseteq A_\lambda$ for any $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $\lambda
\in \Lambda$. Here, the notation $S_b$ denotes the fiber of a definable subset
$S$ of $M^{m+n}$ at $b \in M^m$. We introduce the notion of multi-cells and

through their angular anisotropies within the crystal structure. However, the
increasing complexity of novel materials and emerging phenomena hamper the
interpretation of experiments solely based on the investigation of hybridized
valence states. Here, polarization-resolved SHG in the extreme ultraviolet
(XUV-SHG) is demonstrated for the first time, enabling element-resolved angular
anisotropy investigations. In non-centrosymmetric LiNbO$_3$, elemental
contributions by lithium and niobium are clearly distinguished by energy
dependent XUV-SHG measurements. This element-resolved and symmetry-sensitive
experiment suggests that the displacement of Li ions in LiNbO$_3$, which is
known to lead to ferroelectricity, is accompanied by distortions to the Nb ion
environment that breaks the inversion symmetry of the NbO$_{6}$ octahedron as
well. Our simulations show that the measured second harmonic spectrum is
consistent with Li ion displacements from the centrosymmetric position by
$\sim$0.5 Angstrom while the Nb-O bonds are elongated/contracted by
displacements of the O atoms by $\sim$0.1 Angstrom. In addition, the
polarization-resolved measurement of XUV-SHG shows excellent agreement with
numerical predictions based on dipole-induced SHG commonly used in the optical
wavelengths. This constitutes the first verification of the dipole-based SHG
model in the XUV regime. The findings of this work pave the way for future
angle and time-resolved XUV-SHG studies with elemental specificity in condensed

Furthermore, we propose an efficient geometry module to detect unknown moving
objects by clustering the depth image into a few regions and identifying the
dynamic regions via their reprojection errors. The proposed method is evaluated
on public datasets and real-world conditions. To the best of our knowledge, it

uncertainty from object detectors to identify and reject open-set errors.
GMM-Det trains the detector to produce a structured logit space that is
modelled with class-specific Gaussian Mixture Models. At test time, open-set
errors are identified by their low log-probability under all Gaussian Mixture
Models. We test two common detector architectures, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet,
across three varied datasets spanning robotics and computer vision. Our results
show that GMM-Det consistently outperforms existing uncertainty techniques for
identifying and rejecting open-set detections, especially at the low-error-rate
operating point required for safety-critical applications. GMM-Det maintains
object detection performance, and introduces only minimal computational
overhead. We also introduce a methodology for converting existing object
detection datasets into specific open-set datasets to evaluate open-set
performance in object detection.

learning networks rely nowadays on cascade architectures, where multiple object
detectors are trained sequentially, re-sampling the ground truth at each step.
This offers a solution to the problem of exponentially vanishing positive
samples. However, it also translates into an increase in network complexity in
terms of the number of parameters. To address this issue, we propose
Recursively Refined R-CNN (R^3-CNN) which avoids duplicates by introducing a
loop mechanism instead. At the same time, it achieves a quality boost using a
recursive re-sampling technique, where a specific IoU quality is utilized in
each recursion to eventually equally cover the positive spectrum. Our
experiments highlight the specific encoding of the loop mechanism in the
weights, requiring its usage at inference time. The R^3-CNN architecture is
able to surpass the recently proposed HTC model, while reducing the number of
parameters significantly. Experiments on COCO minival 2017 dataset show
performance boost independently from the utilized baseline model. The code is

ultrasonic experiments on the exterior surface of the containment wall in the
gusset area for three consecutive years. During each experiment, the pressure
inside the containment wall increased gradually from 0 MPa to 0.43 MPa and then
decreased back to 0 Mpa.From the analysis of the ultrasonic coda waves obtained
in the multiple scattering regime, we performed Coda Wave Interferometry to
calculate the apparent velocity changes in the structure (denoted by $dV/V_a$)
and Coda Wave Decorrelation (DC) measurements to produce 3D cartographies of
stress and crack distribution. From three source-receiver pairs, located at the
top, middle and bottom of the experimental region, we observe that coda waves
dilate, shrink and remain almost unchanged, respectively. This corresponds to
the decreasing, increasing and invariant pressure inside the concrete. The
comparison of three years' results demonstrates that the variation of $dV/V_a$
and DC under the same pressure test increases through the years, which
indicates the progressive deterioration and aging of the concrete. From a large
collection of source-receiver pairs at different times, the spatial-temporal
variations of $dV/V_a$ and DC are then used to produce a map of the structural
velocity and scattering changes, respectively. We observe a decreasing velocity
on the top part and an increasing in the middle one, which is in line with the
$dV/V_a$ analysis. The reconstructed scattering changes (or structural changes)
highlight the active region during the inflation-deflation procedure,
corresponding to the opening and closing (and sometimes the development) of

spectrum, the spikes started with typical broadband clouds of spikes, and then
their distribution in frequencies changed into unique, very narrow bands having
non-integer frequency ratios. We successfully fitted frequencies of these
narrow spike bands by those, calculating dispersion branches and growth rates
of the Bernstein modes. For comparison, we also analyzed the model, where the
narrow bands of spikes are generated at the upper-hybrid frequencies. Using
both models, we estimated the plasma density and magnetic field in spike
sources. Then the models are discussed, and arguments in favor of the model
with the Bernstein modes are presented. Analyzing frequency profiles of this

Du Val symplectic resolution of C^2/G, with G \subset SL_2(C) a finite group.
The first of these infinite groups is G=Z, identified to triangular matrices
with spectrum {1}. Smooth functions on the quotient R^2/G come with a natural
Poisson bracket, and R^2/Gis for an arbitrary k \geq 1 set-isomorphic to the
real Du Val singular variety A_{2k} = {(x,y,z) \in R^3 , x^2 +y^2= z^{2k}}. We
show that each one of the usual minimal resolutions of these Du Val varieties
are symplectic resolutions of R^2/G. The same holds for G'=Z \rtimes Z/2Z
(identified to triangular matrices with spectrum {\pm 1}), with the upper half
of D_{2k+1} playing the role of A_{2k}.

oriented lines and preserves a standard area form. A caustic is a curve $C$
whose tangent lines are reflected by the billiard to lines tangent to $C$. The
famous Birkhoff Conjecture states that the only strictly convex billiards with
a foliation by closed caustics near the boundary are ellipses. By Lazutkin's
theorem, there always exists a Cantor family of closed caustics approaching the
boundary. In the present paper we deal with an open billiard, whose boundary is
a strictly convex embedded (non-closed) curve $\gamma$. We prove that there
exists a domain $U$ adjacent to $\gamma$ from the convex side and a
$C^\infty$-smooth foliation of $U\cup\gamma$ whose leaves are $\gamma$ and
(non-closed) caustics of the billiard. This generalizes a previous result by
R.Melrose, which yields existence of a germ of foliation as above at a boundary
point. We show that there exists a continuum of above foliations by caustics
whose germs at each point in $\gamma$ are pairwise different. We prove a more
general version of this statement in the cases, when $\gamma$ is just an arc,
and also when both $\gamma$ and the caustics are immersed curves. It also
applies to a billiard bounded by a closed strictly convex curve $\gamma$ and
yields infinitely many ""immersed"" foliations by immersed caustics. For the
proof of the above results, we state and prove their analogue for a special
class of area-preserving maps generalizing billiard reflections: the so-called
$C^{\infty}$-lifted strongly billiard-like maps. We also prove a series of
results on conjugacy of billiard maps near the boundary for open curves of the
above type.

effective transmission conditions prescribed on the acoustic meta-surface

analysis with respect to the layer thickness, proportional to the plate
thickness and to the perforation period, yields an implicit
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the homogenized metasurface. An

for novel cavity geometries exploiting nano-optic concepts. For
high-reflectivity coated ridge lasers, where light is tightly confined in the
waveguide, a low threshold can only be achieved by strongly reducing the
diffraction losses arising at the laser facet. We show here that, somewhat
counter-intuitively, opening a carefully designed aperture in a metallic facet
coating can simultaneously enhance both its transmission and modal reflectivity
by correcting the phase front at the subwavelength scale. Numerical simulations
and experimental results demonstrate a reduction of optical mirror loss by up
to 40% while the transmission is increased by four orders of magnitude.
Applying this approach to both facets of a short cavity quantum cascade laser,
we achieve laser operation at room temperature with an electrical dissipation
of only 143 mW. Such light sources are especially suitable for portable and
battery-operated chemical agent sensing applications operating in the
mid-infrared wavelength range, where multiple greenhouse and pollutant gases
have their fundamental absorption lines. Our work suggests possibilities for
further applications including frequency comb dispersion engineering, and can
be implemented in a broad range of optoelectronic systems.

of the latent space, which enables models to generate grammatical and
consistent text from aggregated latent vectors. As a successful application of
this property, unsupervised opinion summarization models generate a summary by
decoding the aggregated latent vectors of inputs. More specifically, they
perform the aggregation via simple average. However, little is known about how
the vector aggregation step affects the generation quality. In this study, we
revisit the commonly used simple average approach by examining the latent space
and generated summaries. We found that text autoencoders tend to generate
overly generic summaries from simply averaged latent vectors due to an
unexpected $L_2$-norm shrinkage in the aggregated latent vectors, which we
refer to as summary vector degeneration. To overcome this issue, we develop a
framework Coop, which searches input combinations for the latent vector
aggregation using input-output word overlap. Experimental results show that
Coop successfully alleviates the summary vector degeneration issue and
establishes new state-of-the-art performance on two opinion summarization
benchmarks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/megagonlabs/coop}.

equivalent potential temperature, $\theta_e,$ the liquid water potential

are all shown to be potential temperatures, in the sense that they measure the
temperatures of certain reference state systems whose entropy is the same as
that of the air-parcel. They only differ in the choice of reference state
composition: $\theta_\ell$ describes the temperature a condensate-free state,
$\theta_e$ a vapor-free state, and $\theta_s$ a water-free state would require
to have the same entropy as the given state. Although in this sense $\theta_e,$
$\theta_\ell,$ and $\theta_s$ are all different flavors of the same thing, only
$\theta_\ell$ satisfies the stricter definition of a `potential temperature',
as corresponding to a reference temperature accessible by an isentropic and
closed transformation of a system in equilibrium; both $\theta_e$ and
$\theta_\ell$ measure the `relative' enthalpy of an air parcel at their

None mix linearly, but all do so approximately, and all reduce to the dry
potential temperature, $\theta$ in the limit as the water mass fraction goes to
zero. As is well known, $\theta$ does mix linearly and inherits all the
favorable (entropic, enthalpic, and potential temperature) properties of its
various -- but descriptively less rich -- moist counterparts. All, involve
quite complex expressions, but admit relatively simple and useful
approximations. Of the three moist `potential' temperatures, $\theta_s$ is the
least familiar, but the most well mixed in the broader tropics, a property that
merits further study as a possible basis for constraining mixing processes.

arms of the Galaxy on the age of classical Cepheids. The catalog of Cepheids
(Mel'nik et al. 2015) was divided into two samples$-$relatively young
($P>9^\text{d}$) and relatively old ($P<9^\text{d}$) objects. The parameters of
the spiral structure were determined both for two samples separately and
jointly for the combination of two systems of segments traced by young and old
objects. For most of the segments, their parameters for young and old objects
differ significantly. Taking into account the difference between the two
segment systems, we obtained the estimate $R_0$ equal to $7.23^{+0.19}_{-0.18}$
kpc, which in the modern LMC calibration corresponds to the value of
$R_0={8.08^{+0.21}_{-0.20}}|_{\text{stat.}} {}^{+0.38}_{-0.36}|_{\text{cal.}}$
kpc. It is shown that the displacement between the segments is not reduced to
the effect of differential rotation only. To interpret this displacement for
objects of Perseus and Sagittarius-2 segments we carried out a dynamic modeling
of the change in the position of the segment points when moving in the smooth
gravitational field of the Galaxy. At the angular velocity of rotation of the
spiral pattern $\Omega_{\text{p}} = 25.2 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$
(Dambis et al. 2015) the observed displacement between segments on young and
old objects can be explained by the amplitude of spiral perturbations of the
radial velocity of $u = 10 \pm1.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For the constructed double
system of spiral segments, it is demonstrated that the assumption of constancy
of the pitch angles within each segment and the assumption that the pole of the
spiral pattern is in the direction of the nominal center of the Galaxy do not
contradict the data within the range of uncertainty.

array, characterized by a quadrimer primitive cell, allows for implementing
transitions between Hermitian and odd-PT -symmetric configurations, broken and

generalizes the Rice-Mele Hamiltonian for a nonlinear non-Hermitian quadrimer

systems with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. In contrast with
well-known abstraction-based methods, the proposed framework directly
characterizes the winning set, i.e., the set of initial conditions from which a
given LTL formula can be realized, over the continuous state space of the
system via a monotonic operator. Following this characterization, an algorithm
is proposed to practically approximate the operator via an adaptive interval
subdivision scheme, which yields a finite-memory control strategy. We show that
the proposed algorithm is sound for full LTL specifications, and robustly
complete for specifications recognizable by deterministic B\""uchi automata
(DBA), the latter in the sense that control strategies can be found whenever
the given specification can be satisfied with additional bounded disturbances.
Without having to compute and store the abstraction and the resulting product
system with the DBA, the proposed method is more memory efficient, which is
demonstrated by complexity analysis and performance tests. A pre-processing
stage is also devised to reduce computational cost via a decomposition of the
specification. We show that the proposed method can effectively solve

cache when it does not contain their datum. Such advertisements are used in
multiple networked domains such as 5G networks, wide area networks, and
information-centric networking. The selection of an advertisement strategy
exposes a trade-off between the access cost and bandwidth consumption. Still,
existing works mostly apply a trial-and-error approach for selecting the best
strategy, as the rigorous foundations required for optimizing such decisions is
lacking. Our work shows that the desired advertisement policy depends on
numerous parameters such as the cache policy, the workload, the cache size, and
the available bandwidth. In particular, we show that there is no ideal single
configuration. Therefore, we design an adaptive, self-adjusting algorithm that
periodically selects an advertisement policy. Our algorithm does not require
any prior information about the cache policy, cache size, or workload, and does
not require any apriori configuration. Through extensive simulations, using
several state-of-the-art cache policies, and real workloads, we show that our
approach attains a similar cost to that of the best static configuration (which
is only identified in retrospect) in each case.

continuous symmetry or in open domains. In the absence of continuous symmetry,
the lack of a conserved quantity makes the study of flows intrinsically
challenging. In a toroidal domain, the requirement of double-periodicity for
physical quantities adds to the complications. In particular, the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of plasma steady-state with the flow in a
non-symmetric toroidal domain allows the development of singularities when the
rotational transform of the magnetic field is rational, much like the
equilibrium MHD model. In this work, we show that steady flows can still be
maintained provided the rotational transform is close to rational and the
magnetic shear is weak. We extend the techniques developed in carrying out
perturbation methods to all orders for static MHD equilibrium by Weitzner
(Physics of Plasmas 21, 022515 (2014)) to MHD equilibrium with flows. We
construct perturbative MHD equilibrium in a doubly-periodic domain with nearly
parallel flows by systematically eliminating magnetic resonances order by
order. We then utilize an additional symmetry of the flow problem, first
discussed by E. Hameiri in (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{22}, 2080 (1981) Sec. III),
to obtain a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for a class of non-symmetric
three-dimensional MHD equilibrium with flows both parallel and perpendicular to
the magnetic field. For this class of flows, we are able to obtain
non-symmetric generalizations of integrals of motion, such as Bernoulli's
function and angular momentum. Finally, we obtain the generalized Hamada
conditions, which are consistency conditions necessary to suppress singular
currents in such a system when the magnetic field lines are closed. We do not

needed for most of the current imitation learning (IL) algorithms. For IL

However, BC-like methods tend to be affected by distribution shift. To mitigate
this problem, we come up with a Robust Model-Based Imitation Learning (RMBIL)
framework that casts imitation learning as an end-to-end differentiable
nonlinear closed-loop tracking problem. RMBIL applies Neural ODE to learn a
precise multi-step dynamics and a robust tracking controller via Nonlinear
Dynamics Inversion (NDI) algorithm. Then, the learned NDI controller will be
combined with a trajectory generator, a conditional VAE, to imitate an expert's
behavior. Theoretical derivation shows that the controller network can
approximate an NDI when minimizing the training loss of Neural ODE. Experiments
on Mujoco tasks also demonstrate that RMBIL is competitive to the
state-of-the-art generative adversarial method (GAIL) and achieves at least 30%
performance gain over BC in uneven surfaces.

i-place and i-d-place bisimilarities, which are still decidable, do preserve

power spectrum on small scales is the effect of baryonic physics. Accurate
cosmology for Stage-IV surveys requires knowledge of the matter power spectrum
deep in the nonlinear regime at the percent level. Therefore, it is important
to develop reliable mitigation techniques to take into account baryonic
uncertainties if information from small scales is to be considered in the
cosmological analysis. In this work, we develop a new mitigation method for
dealing with baryonic physics for the case of the shear angular power spectrum.
The method is based on an extended covariance matrix that incorporates baryonic
uncertainties informed by hydrodynamical simulations. We use the results from
13 hydrodynamical simulations and the residual errors arising from a fit to a
$\Lambda$CDM model using the extended halo model code {\tt HMCode} to account
for baryonic physics. These residual errors are used to model a so-called
theoretical error covariance matrix that is added to the original covariance
matrix. In order to assess the performance of the method, we use the 2D
tomographic shear from four hydrodynamical simulations that have different
extremes of baryonic parameters as mock data and run a likelihood analysis
comparing the residual bias on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ of our method and the
HMCode for an LSST-like survey. We use different modelling of the theoretical
error covariance matrix to test the robustness of the method. We show that it
is possible to reduce the bias in the determination of the tested cosmological
parameters at the price of a modest decrease in the precision.

developed model is verified in simulation by extracting dispersion
characteristics of a standard waveguide a priori known by theory. The extracted
phase velocity does not deviate from the true value by more than $ 9 \times

dispersion characteristics of non-standard waveguides embedded with their

dual-domain methods usually operate on both domains in a specific order, which
implicitly imposes a certain priority prior into MAR and may ignore the latent

exploits a denoising diffusion framework to transform the noise signal into a
mel-spectrogram via diffusion time steps. In order to learn the mel-spectrogram
distribution conditioned on the text, we present a likelihood-based
optimization method for TTS. Furthermore, to boost up the inference speed, we
leverage the accelerated sampling method that allows Diff-TTS to generate raw
waveforms much faster without significantly degrading perceptual quality.
Through experiments, we verified that Diff-TTS generates 28 times faster than
the real-time with a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.

distributed across its components. Yet in an environment with rapidly enlarging
complexity, this information may need to change adaptively to enable not only
cooperation but also the mere survival of an organism. Combining the methods of
evolutionary game theory, agent-based simulation, and statistical physics, we
develop a model of the evolution of cooperation in an ageing population of
artificial decision makers playing spatial tag-mediated prisoner's dilemma
games with their ingroup neighbors and with genetically unrelated immigrant
agents. In our model with six strategies we introduce the concept of
time-varying tags such that the phenotypic features of 'new' agents can change
into 'approved' following variable approval times. Our Monte Carlo simulations
show that ingroup-biased ethnocentric cooperation can dominate only at low
costs and short approval times. In the standard 4-strategy model with fixed
tags, we identified a critical cost $c_{\mathrm{crit}}$ above which cooperation
transitioned abruptly into the phase of pure defection, revealing remarkable
fragility of ingroup-biased generosity. In our generalized 6-strategy model
with time-varying tags, elevated cooperation was observed for a wider region of
the parameter space, peaking at intermediate approval times and cost values
above $c_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our findings show that in an open system subject to
immigration dynamics, high levels of social cooperation are possible if a
fraction of the population adopts the strategy with an egalitarian generosity
directed towards both native and approved naturalized citizens, regardless of
their actual origin. These findings also suggest that instead of relying upon
arbitrarily fixed approval times, there is an optimal duration of the
naturalization procedure from which the society as a whole can profit most.

$m$ is the fermion mass and $p$ is its momentum. In this regime, the whole
bosonized action also has a modified Maxwell term, involving the same

static potential has a repulsive term (given by the Coulomb potential) and an
attractive part (given by a sum of special functions), whose competition
generates bound states of particles with the same charge. Having in mind
two-dimensional materials, we also conclude that the presence of a PCS term

to bring about functionality and efficiency in sensory, motor and cognitive

complex, brain-like topologies. Present models, however, cannot account for the
emergence of complex directed connectivity structures. We tested a biologically
plausible model of adaptive rewiring in directed networks, based on two
algorithms widely used in distributed computing: advection and consensus. When
both are used in combination as rewiring criteria, adaptive rewiring shortens
path length and enhances connectivity. When keeping a balance between advection
and consensus, adaptive rewiring produces convergent-divergent units consisting
of convergent hub nodes, which collect inputs from pools of sparsely connected,
or local, nodes and project them via densely interconnected processing nodes
onto divergent hubs that broadcast output back to the local pools.
Convergent-divergent units operate within and between sensory, motor, and
cognitive brain regions as their connective core, mediating context-sensitivity
to local network units. By showing how these structures emerge spontaneously in
directed networks models, adaptive rewiring offers self-organization as a
principle for efficient information propagation and integration in the brain.

reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated, where the incident
wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into

manipulation of signal propagation. Based on the introduced basic signal model
of `STAR', three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed,
namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS).
Moreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both
unicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS)
sends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power
consumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active
beamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming
at the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols,
subject to communication rate constraints of the users. For ES, the resulting
highly-coupled non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iterative
algorithm, which exploits the penalty method and successive convex
approximation. Then, the proposed penalty-based iterative algorithm is extended
to solve the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for MS. For TS, the
optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which can be
consecutively solved using state-of-the-art algorithms and convex optimization
techniques. Finally, our numerical results reveal that: 1) the TS and ES
operating protocols are generally preferable for unicast and multicast
transmission, respectively; and 2) the required power consumption for both
scenarios is significantly reduced by employing the proposed STAR-RIS instead
of conventional reflecting/transmiting-only RISs.

that samples in one cluster and their augmentations should all be similar.

distorted structures and blurry textures in high-resolution images (e.g.,
512x512). The challenges mainly drive from (1) image content reasoning from
distant contexts, and (2) fine-grained texture synthesis for a large missing
region. To overcome these two challenges, we propose an enhanced GAN-based
model, named Aggregated COntextual-Transformation GAN (AOT-GAN), for
high-resolution image inpainting. Specifically, to enhance context reasoning,
we construct the generator of AOT-GAN by stacking multiple layers of a proposed
AOT block. The AOT blocks aggregate contextual transformations from various
receptive fields, allowing to capture both informative distant image contexts
and rich patterns of interest for context reasoning. For improving texture
synthesis, we enhance the discriminator of AOT-GAN by training it with a
tailored mask-prediction task. Such a training objective forces the
discriminator to distinguish the detailed appearances of real and synthesized
patches, and in turn, facilitates the generator to synthesize clear textures.
Extensive comparisons on Places2, the most challenging benchmark with 1.8
million high-resolution images of 365 complex scenes, show that our model
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin in terms of FID with
38.60% relative improvement. A user study including more than 30 subjects
further validates the superiority of AOT-GAN. We further evaluate the proposed
AOT-GAN in practical applications, e.g., logo removal, face editing, and object
removal. Results show that our model achieves promising completions in the real
world. We release code and models in

for discretizing the surface diffusion of a closed curve in two dimensions (2D)

preserving the two fundamental geometric structures of the surface diffusion
flow: (i) the conservation of the area/volume enclosed by the closed
curve/surface, and (ii) the decrease of the perimeter/total surface area of the
curve/surface. For simplicity of notations, we begin with the surface diffusion
of a closed curve in 2D and present a weak (variational) formulation of the
governing equation. Then we discretize the variational formulation by using the
backward Euler method in time and piecewise linear parametric finite elements
in space, with a proper approximation of the unit normal vector by using the
information of the curves at the current and next time step. The constructed
numerical method is shown to preserve the two geometric structures and also
enjoys the good property of asymptotic equal mesh distribution. The proposed
SP-PFEM is ""weakly"" implicit (or almost semi-implicit) and the nonlinear system
at each time step can be solved very efficiently and accurately by the Newton's
iterative method. The SP-PFEM is then extended to discretize the surface
diffusion of a closed surface in 3D. Extensive numerical results, including
convergence tests, structure-preserving property and asymptotic equal mesh
distribution, are reported to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed SP-PFEM for simulating surface diffusion in 2D and 3D.

Single-line millimetre-waveband spectral detections of phosphine (with a

on the observation of the spectral absorption feature of phosphine in the

  We use datasets that contain recordings of coughing, sneezing, speech and
other noises, but do not contain COVID-19 labels, to pre-train three deep

  These pre-trained networks are subsequently either fine-tuned using smaller

or are used as bottleneck feature extractors.
  Results show that a Resnet50 classifier trained by this transfer learning
process delivers optimal or near-optimal performance across all datasets
achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98,
0.94 and 0.92 respectively for all three sound classes (coughs, breaths and

  This indicates that coughs carry the strongest COVID-19 signature, followed
by breath and speech.
  Our results also show that applying transfer learning and extracting
bottleneck features using the larger datasets without COVID-19 labels led not
only to improve performance, but also to minimise the standard deviation of the
classifier AUCs among the outer folds of the leave-$p$-out cross-validation,

system of ordinary differential equations. Although this model was intensively
studied in recent years for properly capturing traffic phenomena and driver
braking behavior, a rigorous study of the well-posedness has, to our knowledge,
never been performed. First it is shown that, for a specific class of initial
data, the vehicles' velocities become negative or even diverge to $-\infty$ in
finite time, both undesirable properties for a car-following model. Various
modifications of the IDM are then proposed in order to avoid such
ill-posedness. The theoretical remediation of the model, rather than post facto
by ad-hoc modification of code implementations, allows a more sound numerical
implementation and preservation of the model features. Indeed, to avoid
inconsistencies and ensure dynamics close to the one of the original model, one
may need to inspect and clean large input data, which may result in practically
impossible scenarios for large-scale simulations. Although well-posedness
issues occur only for specific initial data, this may happen frequently when
different traffic scenarios are analyzed, and especially in presence of
lane-changing, on ramps and other network components as it is the case for most
commonly used micro-simulators. On the other side, it is shown that
well-posedness can be guaranteed by straight-forward improvements, such as
those obtained by slightly changing the acceleration to prevent the velocity
from becoming negative.

surroundings is difficult for current models. A major challenge is that the
intrinsic similarities between such foreground objects and background
surroundings make the features extracted by deep model indistinguishable. To
overcome this challenge, an ideal model should be able to seek valuable, extra
clues from the given scene and incorporate them into a joint learning framework
for representation co-enhancement. With this inspiration, we design a novel
Mutual Graph Learning (MGL) model, which generalizes the idea of conventional
mutual learning from regular grids to the graph domain. Specifically, MGL
decouples an image into two task-specific feature maps -- one for roughly
locating the target and the other for accurately capturing its boundary details
-- and fully exploits the mutual benefits by recurrently reasoning their
high-order relations through graphs. Importantly, in contrast to most mutual
learning approaches that use a shared function to model all between-task
interactions, MGL is equipped with typed functions for handling different
complementary relations to maximize information interactions. Experiments on
challenging datasets, including CHAMELEON, CAMO and COD10K, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our MGL with superior performance to existing state-of-the-art

correspondence at occlusions, shadows, reflections, lack of texture and changes
in illumination over time. Thus, unsupervised methods face major challenges as
they need to tune complex cost functions with several terms designed to handle
each of these sources of ambiguity. In contrast, supervised methods avoid these
challenges altogether by relying on explicit ground truth optical flow obtained
directly from synthetic or real data. In the case of synthetic data, the ground
truth provides an exact and explicit description of what optical flow to assign
to a given scene. However, the domain gap between synthetic data and real data
often limits the ability of a trained network to generalize. In the case of
real data, the ground truth is obtained through multiple sensors and additional
data processing, which might introduce persistent errors and contaminate it. As
a solution to these issues, we introduce a novel method to build a training set
of pseudo-real images that can be used to train optical flow in a supervised
manner. Our dataset uses two unpaired frames from real data and creates pairs
of frames by simulating random warps, occlusions with super-pixels, shadows and
illumination changes, and associates them to their corresponding exact optical
flow. We thus obtain the benefit of directly training on real data while having
access to an exact ground truth. Training with our datasets on the Sintel and

the TTS model on the training dataset can significantly improve the similarity
and speech quality for new speakers. Our model converges using only 11
speakers, reaching state-of-the-art results for similarity with new speakers,
as well as high speech quality.

central aim of psychological and behavioural science. We implemented the
principles of the Projective Consciousness Model into artificial agents
embodied as virtual humans, as a proof-of-concept for a methodological
framework aimed at simulating behaviours and assessing underlying psychological
parameters, in the context of experiments in virtual reality. We focus on
simulating the role of Theory of Mind (ToM) in the choice of strategic
behaviours of approach and avoidance to optimise the satisfaction of agents'
preferences. We designed an experiment in a virtual environment that could be
used with real humans, allowing us to classify behaviours as a function of
order of ToM, up to the second order. We show that our agents demonstrate
expected behaviours with consistent parameters of ToM in this experiment. We
also show that the agents can be used to estimate correctly each other order of
ToM. A similar approach could be used with real humans in virtual reality
experiments not only to enable human participants to interact with parametric,
virtual humans as stimuli, but also as a mean of inference to derive
model-based psychological assessments of the participants.

  Performance of NLP Machine Learning Classification Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Classification Models use input data to predict the likelihood that the
subsequent input data will fall into predetermined categories. To perform
effective classifications, these models require large datasets for training. It
is becoming common practice to utilize synthetic data to boost the performance
of Machine Learning Models. It is reported that Shell is using synthetic data
to build models to detect problems that rarely occur; for example Shell created
synthetic data to help models to identify deteriorating oil lines. It is common
practice for Machine Learning Practitioners to generate synthetic data by
rotating, flipping, and cropping images to increase the volume of image data to
train Convolutional Neural Networks. The purpose of this paper is to explore
creating and utilizing synthetic NLP data to improve the performance of Natural
Language Processing Machine Learning Classification Models. In this paper I
used a Yelp pizza restaurant reviews dataset and transfer learning to fine-tune
a pre-trained GPT-2 Transformer Model to generate synthetic pizza reviews data.
I then combined this synthetic data with the original genuine data to create a
new joint dataset. The new combined model significantly outperformed the
original model in accuracy and precision.

to improve the training of streaming recurrent neural network transducer
(RNN-T) model. Streaming RNN-T trained from scratch usually performs worse than
non-streaming RNN-T. Although it is common to address this issue through
pre-training components of RNN-T with other criteria or frame-wise alignment
guidance, the alignment is not easily available in end-to-end manner. In this
work, frame-wise alignment, used to pre-train streaming RNN-T's encoder, is
generated without using a HMM-based system. Therefore an all-neural framework
equipping HMM-free encoder pre-training is constructed. This is achieved by
expanding the spikes of CTC model to their left/right blank frames, and two
expanding strategies are proposed. To our best knowledge, this is the first
work to simulate HMM-based frame-wise label using CTC model for pre-training.
Experiments conducted on LibriSpeech and MLS English tasks show the proposed
pre-training procedure, compared with random initialization, reduces the WER by
relatively 5%~11% and the emission latency by 60 ms. Besides, the method is
lexicon-free, so it is friendly to new languages without manually designed
lexicon.

  in IoT networks","Accepted, in IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
  Workshops, 2021",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning framework
to solve a multi-objective optimization problem, where we consider minimizing
the expected long-term task completion delay and energy consumption of IoT
devices. This is done by optimizing offloading decisions, computation resource
allocation, and transmit power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a
mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), we first cast our problem as a
multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) problem and address
it using double deep Q-network (DDQN), where the actions are offloading
decisions. The immediate cost of each agent is calculated through solving
either the transmit power optimization or local computation resource
optimization, based on the selected offloading decisions (actions). Then, to
enhance the learning speed of IoT devices (agents), we incorporate federated
learning (FDL) at the end of each episode. FDL enhances the scalability of the
proposed DRL framework, creates a context for cooperation between agents, and
minimizes their privacy concerns. Our numerical results demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed federated DDQN framework in terms of learning speed
compared to federated deep Q network (DQN) and non-federated DDQN algorithms.
In addition, we investigate the impact of batch size, network layers, DDQN
target network update frequency on the learning speed of the FDL.

computer program package to calculate these auxiliary functions in high
accuracy is presented. It is designed in Julia programming language. It is
capable of yielding highly accurate results for molecular integrals over a wide
range of orbital parameters and quantum numbers. Additionally, the program
package provides numerous tools such as efficient calculation for the angular
momentum coefficients arising in the product of two normalized associated
Legendre functions centered on different atomic positions, the rotation angular

Internet of Things (MIoT) devices and networks will present several limitations
in terms of power and communication overhead. One traditional solution to cope
with the large-size data challenge is to use lossy compression. However,
current lossy compression schemes require low compression rate to guarantee
acceptable perceived image quality, which results in a low reduction of the
communicated data size and consequently a low reduction in the energy and
bandwidth consumption. Thus, an efficient compression solution is required for
striking a good balance between data size (and consequently communication
overhead) and visual degradation. In this paper, a Deep-Learning (DL)
super-resolution model is applied to recuperate high quality images (at the
application server side) given as input degraded images with a high compression
ratio (at the sender side). The experimental analysis shows the effectiveness
of the proposed solution in enhancing the visual quality of the compressed and
down-scaled images. Consequently, the proposed solution reduces the overall
communication overhead and power consumption of limited MIoT devices.
