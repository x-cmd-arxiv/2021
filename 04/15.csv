Simulations show that the pressure inside the chamber linearly depends on the

compatible with experiments. We have found that the pressure-driven speed of

to be higher for larger detectors and different geometries.

interpretations of that event (e.g., aesthetics, emotions), and our current

a strong sway of the visual world itself in influencing what we remember and
forget. Certain items -- including certain faces, words, images, and movements
-- are intrinsically memorable or forgettable across observers, regardless of
individual differences. Further, neuroimaging research has revealed that the
brain is sensitive to memorability both rapidly and automatically during late
perception. These strong consistencies in memory across people may reflect the
broad organizational principles of our sensory environment, and may reveal how
the brain prioritizes information before encoding items into memory. In this
chapter, I will discuss our current state-of-the-art understanding of
memorability for visual information, and what these findings imply about how we

to detect them using sweeping agents. We assume that the agents have line
sensors of equal length. We propose procedures for designing cooperative
sweeping processes that ensure successful completion of the task, thereby
deriving conditions on the sweeping speed of the agents and their paths.
Successful completion of the task means that evaders with a known limit on
their speed cannot escape the sweeping agents. A simpler task for the sweeping
swarm is the confinement of the evaders to their initial domain. The
feasibility of completing these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic
constraints that impose a lower bound on the speed the sweeping agent must
have. This critical speed is derived to ensure the satisfaction of the
confinement task. Increasing the speed above the lower bound enables the agents
to complete the search task as well. We present a quantitative and qualitative
comparison analysis between the total search time of same-direction sweep
processes and pincer-movement search strategies. We evaluate the different
strategies by using two metrics, total search time and the minimal critical
speed required for a successful search. We compare two types of pincer-movement
search processes, circular and spiral, with their same-direction counterparts,
for any even number of sweeping agents. We prove that pincer based strategies
provide superior results in all practical scenarios and that the spiral pincer
sweep process allows detection of all evaders while sweeping at nearly
theoretically optimal speeds.

works as linear transformation on hyperbolic manifolds. It ensures the
transformed node representations still lie on the hyperbolic manifold by
imposing the orthogonal constraint on the transformation sub-matrix. The
hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation updates each node representation via the

show that the H2H-GCN achieves substantial improvements on the link prediction,

collisional terms included in the equations of the model play on the evolution
of the instability and the generation of magnetic field. We find that when no
collisional coupling is considered between the two fluids, the effect of the
Biermann battery mechanism does not depend on the ionisation degree. However,
when elastic collisions are taken into account, the generation of magnetic
field is increased as the ionisation degree is reduced. This behaviour is
slightly enhanced if the process of charge-exchange is also considered. We also
find a dependence on the total density of the plasma related to the dependence
on the coupling degree between the two fluids. As the total density is
increased, the results from the two-fluid model converge to the predictions of
single-fluid models.

coupling to an ensemble of similarly small systems, and that a large ensemble
of small systems forms its own thermodynamic bath. We adapt these ideas to
study how a large system may subdivide into an ensemble of smaller subsystems,
causing internal heterogeneity across multiple size scales. For the
semi-classical ideal gas, maximum entropy favors subdividing a large system of
atoms into regions of variable size. The mechanism of region formation could
come from quantum exchange that makes atoms in each region indistinguishable,
while decoherence between regions allows atoms in separate regions to be
distinguishable by location. Combining regions reduces the total entropy, as
expected when distinguishable particles become indistinguishable, and as
required by theorems for sub-additive entropy. Combining large volumes of small
regions gives the entropy of mixing for a semi-classical ideal gas, resolving
Gibbs paradox without invoking quantum symmetry for distant atoms. Other models
we study are based on Ising-like spins in 1-D. We find similarity in the
properties of a two-state model in the nanocanonical ensemble and a three-state
model in the canonical ensemble. Thus, emergent phenomena may alter the thermal
behavior of microscopic models, and the correct ensemble is necessary for
fully-accurate predictions. We add a nonlinear correction to Boltzmann's factor
in simulations of the Ising-like spins to imitate the dynamics of spin exchange
on intermediate lengths, yielding the statistics of indistinguishable states.
These simulations exhibit 1/f-like noise at low frequencies (f), and white
noise at higher f, similar to the thermal fluctuations found in many materials.

their resource efficiency throughout the training, indexing and query

effective dual-encoder dense retrieval (DR) models recently. A dense text
retrieval model uses a single vector representation per query and passage to
score a match, which enables low-latency first stage retrieval with a nearest
neighbor search. Increasingly common, training approaches require enormous
compute power, as they either conduct negative passage sampling out of a
continuously updating refreshing index or require very large batch sizes for
in-batch negative sampling. Instead of relying on more compute capability, we
introduce an efficient topic-aware query and balanced margin sampling
technique, called TAS-Balanced. We cluster queries once before training and
sample queries out of a cluster per batch. We train our lightweight 6-layer DR
model with a novel dual-teacher supervision that combines pairwise and in-batch
negative teachers. Our method is trainable on a single consumer-grade GPU in
under 48 hours (as opposed to a common configuration of 8x V100s). We show that

graph $G$. It is well known that ${\rm mc}(G)\ge m/2$ for any $m$-edge graph
$G$, and the difference ${\rm mc}(G)-m/2$ is called the surplus of $G$. The
study of the surplus of $H$-free graphs was initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz
in the 70s, who in particular asked what happens for triangle-free graphs. This
was famously resolved by Alon, who showed that in the triangle-free case the
surplus is $\Omega(m^{4/5})$, and found constructions matching this bound. We
prove several new results in this area.
  Firstly, we show that for every fixed odd $r\ge 3$, any $C_r$-free graph with
$m$ edges has surplus $\Omega_r\big(m^{\frac{r+1}{r+2}}\big)$. This is tight,
as is shown by a construction of pseudorandom $C_r$-free graphs due to Alon and
Kahale. It improves previous results of several researchers, and complements a
result of Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov which is the same bound when $r$ is
even.
  Secondly, generalizing the result of Alon, we allow the graph to have
triangles, and show that if the number of triangles is a bit less than in a
random graph with the same density, then the graph has large surplus. For
regular graphs our bounds on the surplus are sharp.
  Thirdly, we prove that an $n$-vertex graph with few copies of $K_r$ and
average degree $d$ has surplus $\Omega_r(d^{r-1}/n^{r-3})$, which is tight when
$d$ is close to $n$ provided that a conjectured dense pseudorandom $K_r$-free
graph exists. This result is used to improve the best known lower bound (as a
function of $m$) on the surplus of $K_r$-free graphs.
  Our proofs combine techniques from semidefinite programming, probabilistic
reasoning, as well as combinatorial and spectral arguments.

drawn widespread attention in remote sensing due to its inherent complexity.
Although significant efforts have been made for developing a variety of
methods, most of them rely on supervised strategies. Subspace clustering
methods, such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), have become a popular tool
for unsupervised learning due to their high performance. However, the
computational complexity of SSC methods prevents their use on large spectral
remotely sensed datasets. Furthermore, since SSC ignores the spatial
information in the spectral images, its discrimination capability is limited,
hampering the clustering results' spatial homogeneity. To address these two
relevant issues, in this paper, we propose a fast algorithm that obtains a
sparse representation coefficient matrix by first selecting a small set of
pixels that best represent their neighborhood. Then, it performs spatial
filtering to enforce the connectivity of neighboring pixels and uses fast
spectral clustering to get the final segmentation. Extensive simulations with
our method demonstrate its effectiveness in land cover segmentation, obtaining
remarkable high clustering performance compared with state-of-the-art SSC-based
algorithms and even novel unsupervised-deep-learning-based methods. Besides,
the proposed method is up to three orders of magnitude faster than SSC when

RGB images of the same scene. To solve the challenges in interpreting the
working mechanism, extracting cross-modal features and RGB texture

using DCT to solve the channel-wise optimization problem derived from the image

shared convolutional kernels to extract common information and private kernels
to extract modality-specific information. Third, we employ an edge attention

for the wide spreading of information in complex networks. Thus, a variety of
centrality-based methods have been proposed to identify the most influential
spreaders. However, most of the existing studies have overlooked the fact that
in real social networks it is more costly and difficult to convince influential
individuals to act as initial spreaders, resulting in a high risk in maximizing
the spreading. In this paper, we address this problem on the basis of the
assumption that large-degree nodes are activated with a higher risk than
small-degree nodes. We aim to identify the effective initial spreaders to
maximize spreading when considering both the activation risk and the outbreak
size of initial spreaders. On random networks, the analytical analysis reveals
that the degree of optimal initial spreaders does not correspond to the largest
degree of nodes in the network but rather be determined by infection
probability and difference of activation risk among nodes with different
degree. Here, we propose a risk-aware metric to identify the effective
spreaders on real networks. The numerical simulation shows that the risk-aware
metric outperforms the existing benchmark centralities in maximizing the
effective spreading.

strategy is applied. First, given high-resolution aerial images, the land cover
information is determined. To achieve this, an encoder-decoder based
convolutional neural net-work (CNN) is proposed. Second, the pixel-wise land
cover information along with the aerial images serves as input for another CNN
to classify land use. Because the object catalogue of geospatial databases is
frequently constructed in a hierarchical manner, we propose a new CNN-based
method aiming to predict land use in multiple levels hierarchically and
simultaneously. A so called Joint Optimization (JO) is proposed where
predictions are made by selecting the hier-archical tuple over all levels which
has the maximum joint class scores, providing consistent results across the
different levels. The conducted experiments show that the CNN relying on JO
outperforms previous results, achieving an overall accuracy up to 92.5%. In
addition to the individual experiments on two test sites, we investigate
whether data showing different characteristics can improve the results of land
cover and land use classification, when processed together. To do so, we
combine the two datasets and undertake some additional experiments. The results
show that adding more data helps both land cover and land use classification,

The probe molecule consists of two distinct functional modules which are

the two-photon (2p) imaging agent and photo-induced electron transfer (PeT)
dye, TPE. Two-photon imaging agents have demonstrated less damage and larger

demonstrated, the photoconductivity is rapid and reversible, and the material

wetness is decreased in an Earth-like general circulation model, the tropics

transition is dominated by near-surface relative humidity changes in contrast

near-surface relative humidity changes responsible for the regime transition

address this issue by providing a new mathematical description of one of the
most commonly used circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, a transmon qubit
coupled to microwave transmission lines. Expressed in terms of
three-dimensional vector fields, our new model is better suited to developing
numerical solvers than the circuit element descriptions commonly used in the
literature. We present details on the quantization of our new model, and derive
quantum equations of motion for the coupled field-transmon system. These
results can be used in developing full-wave numerical solvers in the future. To
make this work more accessible to the engineering community, we assume only a
limited amount of training in quantum physics and provide many background
details throughout derivations.

low-latency communication. In the literature on streaming codes, the
commonly-assumed Gilbert-Elliott channel model, is replaced by a more
tractable, delay-constrained, sliding-window (DCSW) channel model that can
introduce either random or burst erasures. The known streaming codes that are
rate optimal over the DCSW channel model are constructed by diagonally
embedding a scalar block code across successive packets. These code
constructions have field size that is quadratic in the delay parameter $\tau$
and have a somewhat complex structure with an involved decoding procedure. This
led to the introduction of simple streaming (SS) codes in which diagonal
embedding is replaced by staggered-diagonal embedding (SDE). The SDE approach
reduces the impact of a burst of erasures and makes it possible to construct
near-rate-optimal streaming codes using Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code
having linear field size. The present paper takes this development one step
further, by retaining the staggered-diagonal feature, but permitting the
placement of more than one code symbol from a given scalar codeword within each
packet. These generalized, simple streaming codes allow us to improve upon the
rate of SS codes, while retaining the simplicity of working with MDS codes. We
characterize the maximum code rate of streaming codes under a constraint on the
number of contiguous packets over which symbols of the underlying scalar code
are dispersed. Such a constraint leads to simplified code construction and
reduced-complexity decoding.

calculation of infinite terms of multiple integrals in Neumann solution
simultaneously. Under this perspective we redescribed MCRT procedure
systematically, in which the main work amounts to choose an associated
probability distribution function (PDF) for a set of random variables and the
corresponding unbiased estimation functions. We can select a relatively optimal
estimation procedure that has a lower variance from an infinite possible
choices, such as the term by term estimation. In this scheme, MCRT can be
regarded as a pure problem of integral evaluation, rather than as the tracing
of random walking photons. Keeping this in mind, one can avert some subtle
intuitive mistakes. In addition the $\delta$-functions in these integrals can
be eliminated in advance by integrating them out directly. This fact together
with the optimal chosen random variables can remarkably improve the Monte Carlo
(MC) computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in systems with axial or
spherical symmetry. An MCRT code, Lemon (Linear Integral Equations' Monte Carlo

subsurface ocean that is salty, indicating water-rock reaction at present or in
the past, important for its habitability. Here, we investigate how salinity and
the partition of heat production between the silicate core and the ice shell
affect ocean dynamics and the associated heat transport -- a key factor that
determines the equilibrium ice shell geometry. Assuming steady state
conditions, we show that the meridional overturning circulation of the ocean,
driven by heat and salt exchange with the ice, has opposing signs at very low
and very high salinities. Regardless of these differing circulations, heat and
freshwater converge towards the equator, where the ice is thick, acting to
homogenize thickness variations. In order to maintain the observed ice
thickness variation, the polar-amplified ice dissipation needs to be strong
enough and ocean heat convergence cannot overwhelm well-constrained heat loss
rates through the thick equatorial ice sheet. This requirement is found
violated if the main heat source is in the core rather than the ice shell, or
if the ocean is very fresh or very salty. Instead, with a salinity of
intermediate range, the temperature- and salinity-induced density gradient
largely cancel one another, leading to much reduced overturning and equatorial
heat convergence rates and consistent budgets in appearance of a significant
ice dissipation.

research under the angle of distinct regimes of collective dislocation dynamics

criticality, deterministic chaos, or synchronization. It concludes with the
formulation of diverse open questions, notably concerning manifestations of the

garment, enabling these elements to be edited separately. Joint training on
pose transfer and inpainting helps with detail preservation and coherence of

recent methods like ADGAN in terms of output quality, and handles a wide range
of editing functions for which there is no direct supervision.

strongly with redshift, this combination can result in an additional
scale-dependent clustering anisotropy. We demonstrate the size of this effect
on the eBOSS DR16 Quasar sample and show that, while the impact on monopole is

proto-white dwarf (WD) and a massive ($M\approx 0.95\,M_{\odot}$) WD companion.
The system's optical light curve is dominated by large-amplitude ellipsoidal
variability but also exhibits additional scatter, likely driven by pulsations.
The proto-WD is cooler ($T_{\rm eff} = 6800\pm 100$ K) and more puffy
($\log\left[g/\left({\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right)\right]=4.74\pm0.07$) than any known
extremely low mass (ELM) WD, but hotter than any known cataclysmic variable

($R/R_{{\rm Roche\,lobe}}=0.99\pm0.01$), suggesting ongoing or recently
terminated mass transfer. No dwarf nova-like outbursts have been observed. The
spectrum is dominated by the proto-WD but shows tentative hints of H$\alpha$
emission, perhaps due to accretion onto the massive WD. The properties of the
system are well-matched by MESA binary evolution models of CVs with donors that
underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of mass transfer. In
these models, the bloated proto-WD is either still losing mass via stable Roche
lobe overflow or was doing so until very recently. In either case, it is
evolving toward higher temperatures at near-constant luminosity to become an
ELM WD. If the system is detached, mass transfer likely ended when the donor
became too hot for magnetic braking to remain efficient. Evolutionary models
predict that the binary will shrink to $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim 10$ minutes within
a few Gyr, when it will either merge or become an AM CVn binary. J0140 provides
an observational link between the formation channels of CVs, ELM WDs, detached

We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for computing the intrinsic scatter of
scaling relations that accounts for nonlinear error propagation and covariant
uncertainties. Bayesian intrinsic scatters are ~25percent more accurate than
those obtained with a first-order classical method, which systematically
underestimates the true intrinsic scatter. Structural galaxy scaling relations

central stellar surface density (Sigma1), stellar mass (M*), dynamical mass
(Mdyn), stellar angular momentum (j*), and dynamical angular momentum (jdyn),
are examined to demonstrate the power and importance of the Bayesian formalism.
Our analysis is based on a diverse selection of over 1000 late-type galaxies
from the Photometry and Rotation Curve Observations from Extragalactic Surveys
compilation with deep optical photometry and extended rotation curves. We
determine the tightest relation for each parameter by intrinsic orthogonal
scatter, finding M*-V23.5, R23.5-j*, and L23.5-jdyn to be especially tight. The
scatter of the R23.5-L23.5, V23.5-(g-z), and R23.5-jdyn relations is mostly
intrinsic, making them ideal for galaxy formation and evolutionary studies. Our
code to compute the Bayesian intrinsic scatter of any scaling relation is also
presented. We quantify the correlated nature of many uncertainties in galaxy
scaling relations and scrutinize the uncertain nature of disk inclination

spin-$1/2$ quantum link lattice gauge theories that upon introducing an
energy-penalty term of sufficiently large strength $V$, unitary gauge-breaking
errors at strength $\lambda$ are suppressed $\propto\lambda^2/V^2$ up to all
accessible evolution times. Here, we show numerically that this result extends
to quantum link models in the thermodynamic limit and with larger spin-$S$. As
we show analytically, the dynamics at short times is described by an
\textit{adjusted} gauge theory up to a timescale that is at earliest
$\tau_\text{adj}\propto\sqrt{V/V_0^3}$, with $V_0$ an energy factor. Moreover,
our analytics predicts that a renormalized gauge theory dominates at
intermediate times up to a timescale $\tau_\text{ren}\propto\exp(V/V_0)/V_0$.
In both emergent gauge theories, $V$ is volume-independent and scales at worst
$\sim S^2$. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that robust gauge

massive, free scalar field propagating in an arbitrary curved spacetime. The
usual procedures for computing the propagator -- either as a time ordered
correlator or from a partition function defined through a path integral --
requires introduction of a field $\phi(x)$ and its action functional
$A[\phi(x)]$. An alternative, more geometrical, procedure is to define a
propagator in terms of the world-line path integral which only uses curves,
$x^i(s)$, defined on the manifold. I show how the world-line path integral can
be reinterpreted as an ordinary integral by introducing the concept of
effective number of quantum paths of a given length. Several manipulations of
the world-line path integral become algebraically tractable in this approach.
In particular, I derive an explicit expression for the propagator $G_{\rm
QG}(x_2,x_1)$, which incorporates the quantum structure of spacetime through a
zero-point-length, in terms of the standard propagator $G_{\rm std}(x_2,x_1)$,
in an arbitrary curved spacetime. This approach also helps to clarify the
interplay between the path integral amplitude and the path integral measure in
determining the form of the propagator. This is illustrated with several
explicit examples.

X-ray binary in view of its X-ray properties and dipping behaviour during
outburst. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the source
in quiescence that allow us to reveal the ellipsoidal modulation of the
companion star and absorption features consistent with those of an early K-type
star (Teff = 4610 +130 -160 K). The central wavelengths of the absorption lines
vary periodically at Porb = 0.394 +- 0.004 d with an amplitude of K2 = 554 +- 8
km/s . They imply a mass function for the compact object of f(M1) = 6.9 +- 0.3
Msun, confirming its black hole nature. The simultaneous absence of X-ray
eclipses and the presence of dips set a conservative range of allowed
inclinations 60 deg < i < 82 deg, while modelling of optical light curves
further constrain it to i = 72 +5 -8 deg. The above parameters together set a
black hole mass of M1 = 8.9 +1.6 -1.0 Msun and a companion mass of M2=0.43 +-
0.16 Msun, much lower than that of a dwarf star of the observed spectral type,
implying it is evolved. Estimates of the distance to the system (d = 7.5 +1.8
-1.4 kpc) and space velocity (vspace = 270 +- 60 km/s ) place it in the
Galactic thick disc and favour a significant natal kick during the formation of
the BH if the supernova occurred in the Galactic Plane.

great interest as an alternative to standard, collisionless Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) because of its novel structure-formation dynamics, described by the
coupled Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations. In the free-field (""fuzzy"") limit of
SFDM (FDM), structure is inhibited below the de Broglie wavelength, but
resembles CDM on larger scales. Virialized haloes have ""solitonic"" cores of
radius $\sim\lambda_\text{deB}$, surrounded by CDM-like envelopes. When a
strong enough repulsive self-interaction (SI) is also present, structure can be
inhibited below a second length scale, $\lambda_\text{SI}$, with
$\lambda_\text{SI}> \lambda_\text{deB}$ -- called the Thomas-Fermi (TF) regime.
FDM dynamics differs from CDM because of quantum pressure, and SFDM-TF differs
further by adding SI pressure. In the small-$\lambda_\text{deB}$ limit,
however, we can model all three by fluid conservation equations for a
compressible, $\gamma=5/3$ ideal gas, with ideal gas pressure sourced by
internal velocity dispersion and, for the TF regime, an added SI pressure,
$P_\text{SI}\propto \rho^2$. We use these fluid equations to simulate halo
formation from gravitational collapse in 1D, spherical symmetry, demonstrating
for the first time that SFDM-TF haloes form with cores the size of
$R_\text{TF}$, the radius of an SI-pressure-supported $(n=1)$-polytrope,
surrounded by CDM-like envelopes. In comparison with rotation curves of dwarf
galaxies in the local Universe, SFDM-TF haloes pass the [""too-big-to-fail"" +

forming galaxies can be quenched by two distinct processes: mass quenching and
environment quenching (Peng et al. 2010). To explore the mass quenching process
in local galaxies, we study the massive central disk galaxies with stellar mass
above the Schechter characteristic mass. In Zhang et al. (2019), we showed that
during the quenching of the massive central disk galaxies as their star
formation rate (SFR) decreases, their molecular gas mass and star formation
efficiency drop rapidly, but their HI gas mass remains surprisingly constant.
To identify the underlying physical mechanisms, in this work we analyze the
change during quenching of various structure parameters, bar frequency, and
active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. We find three closely related facts. On
average, as SFR decreases in these galaxies: (1) they become progressively more
compact, indicated by their significantly increasing concentration index,
bulge-to-total mass ratio, and central velocity dispersion, which are mainly
driven by the growth and compaction of their bulge component; (2) the frequency
of barred galaxies increases dramatically, and at a given concentration index
the barred galaxies have a significantly higher quiescent fraction than
unbarred galaxies, implying that the galactic bar may play an important role in
mass quenching; and (3) the ""AGN"" frequency increases dramatically from 10% on
the main sequence to almost 100% for the most quiescent galaxies, which is
mainly driven by the sharp increase of LINERs. These observational results lead
to a self-consistent picture of how mass quenching operates.

iterating and applying a threshold on a set of matched filters. These filters
are defined by properties of the transient such as time and dispersion. A real
transient can trigger hundreds of search trials, each of which has to be
post-processed for visualization and classification tasks. In this paper, we
have explored a range of unsupervised clustering algorithms to cluster these
redundant candidate detections. We demonstrate this for Realfast, the commensal
fast transient search system at the Very Large Array. We use four features for
clustering: sky position (l, m), time and dispersion measure (DM). We develop a
custom performance metric that makes sure that the candidates are clustered
into a small number of pure clusters, i.e, clusters with either astrophysical
or noise candidates. We then use this performance metric to compare eight
different clustering algorithms. We show that using sky location along with
DM/time improves clustering performance by $\sim$10% as compared to the
traditional DM/time-based clustering. Therefore, positional information should
be used during clustering if it can be made available. We conduct several tests
to compare the performance and generalisability of clustering algorithms to
other transient datasets and propose a strategy that can be used to choose an
algorithm. Our performance metric and clustering strategy can be easily
extended to different single-pulse search pipelines and other astronomy and
non-astronomy-based applications.

which limits our capability to infer astrophysical lens properties or
cosmological parameters from observations. As the number of gravitational wave
observations grows, detecting lensed events will become more likely, and to
assess how the mass-sheet degeneracy may affect them is crucial. Here we study
both analytically and numerically how the lensed waveforms are affected by the
mass-sheet degeneracy computing the amplification factor from the diffraction
integral. In particular, we differentiate between the geometrical optics, wave
optics and interference regimes, focusing on ground-based gravitational waves
detectors. In agreement with expectations of gravitational lensing of
electromagnetic radiation, we confirm how, in the geometrical optics scenario,
the mass-sheet degeneracy cannot be broken with only one lensed image. However,
we find that in the interference regime, and in part in the wave-optics regime,
the mass-sheet degeneracy can be broken with only one lensed waveform thanks to
the characteristic interference patterns of the signal. Finally, we quantify,
through template matching, how well the mass-sheet degeneracy can be broken. We
find that, within present GW detector sensitivities and considering signals as
strong as those which have been detected so far, the mass-sheet degeneracy can
lead to a $1\sigma$ uncertainty on the lens mass of $\sim 12\%$. With these
values the MSD might still be a problematic issue. But in case of signals with
higher signal-to-noise ratio, the uncertainty can drop to $\sim 2\%$, which is
less than the current indeterminacy achieved by dynamical mass measurements.

intensity-based multimodal registration methods infeasible to generate correct

motor function to individuals with spinal cord injury. These systems have
traditionally focused on the restoration of upper extremity function; however,
the lower extremities have received relatively little attention. Early
feasibility studies used noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs to
restore walking function to people with paraplegia. However, the limited
spatiotemporal resolution of EEG signals restricted the application of these
BCIs to elementary gait tasks, such as the initiation and termination of
walking. To restore more complex gait functions, BCIs must accurately decode
additional degrees of freedom from brain signals. In this study, we used
subdurally recorded electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from able-bodied subjects
to design a decoder capable of predicting the walking state and step rate
information. We recorded ECoG signals from the motor cortices of two
individuals as they walked on a treadmill at different speeds. Our offline
analysis demonstrated that the state information could be decoded from >16
minutes of ECoG data with an unprecedented accuracy of 99.8%. Additionally,
using a Bayesian filter approach, we achieved an average correlation
coefficient between the decoded and true step rates of 0.934. When combined,
these decoders may yield decoding accuracies sufficient to safely operate
present-day walking prostheses.

systems without symmetry-breaking orders. We present a topological quantum
field theoretical (TQFT) study on topological orders in five-dimensional
spacetime ($5$D) in which \textit{topological excitations} include not only
point-like \textit{particles}, but also two types of spatially extended
objects: closed string-like \textit{loops} and two-dimensional closed
\textit{membranes}. Especially, membranes have been rarely explored in the
literature of topological orders. By introducing higher-form gauge fields, we
construct exotic TQFT actions that include mixture of two distinct types of
$BF$ topological terms and many twisted topological terms. The gauge
transformations are properly defined and utilized to compute level quantization
and classification of TQFTs. Among all TQFTs, some are not in Dijkgraaf-Witten
cohomological classification. To characterize topological orders, we concretely
construct all braiding processes among topological excitations, which leads to
very exotic links formed by closed spacetime trajectories of particles, loops,
and membranes. For each braiding process, we construct gauge-invariant Wilson
operators and calculate the associated braiding statistical phases. As a
result, we obtain expressions of link invariants all of which have manifest
geometric interpretation. Following Wen's definition, the boundary theory of a
topological order exhibits gravitational anomaly. We expect that the
characterization and classification of 5D topological orders in this paper
encode information of 4D gravitational anomaly. Further consideration, e.g.,
putting TQFTs on 5D manifolds with boundaries, is left to future work.

stellar activity for far longer. Studying young, fast-rotating M dwarfs is key
to understanding their near stellar environment and the evolution of activity
Aims: We study stellar activity on the fast-rotating M dwarf GJ 3270. Methods:
We analyzed dedicated high cadence, simultaneous, photometric and
high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained with CARMENES of GJ 3270
over 7.7 h, covering a total of eight flares of which two are strong enough to
facilitate a detailed analysis. We consult the TESS data, obtained in the month
prior to our own observations, to study rotational modulation and to compare
the TESS flares to those observed in our campaign. Results: The TESS data
exhibit rotational modulation with a period of 0.37 d. The strongest flare
covered by our observing campaign released a total energy of about 3.6e32 erg,
putting it close to the superflare regime. This flare is visible in the B,V, r,
i, and z photometric bands, which allows us to determine a peak temperature of
about 10,000 K. The flare also leaves clear marks in the spectral time series.
In particular, we observe an evolving, mainly blue asymmetry in chromospheric
lines, which we attribute to a post-flare, corotating feature. To our knowledge
this is the first time such a feature has been seen on a star other than our
Sun. Conclusions: Our photometric and spectroscopic time series covers the
eruption of a strong flare followed up by a corotating feature analogous to a
post-flare arcadal loop on the Sun with a possible failed ejection of material.

based on discrete mathematical optimization. While there exist several
appealing approaches based on convex relaxations and nonconvex heuristics, we
focus on optimal solutions for the $\ell_0$-regularized formulation, a problem
that is relatively unexplored due to computational challenges. Our methodology
covers both high-dimensional linear regression and nonparametric sparse
additive modeling with smooth components. Our algorithmic framework consists of
approximate and exact algorithms. The approximate algorithms are based on
coordinate descent and local search, with runtimes comparable to popular sparse
learning algorithms. Our exact algorithm is based on a standalone
branch-and-bound (BnB) framework, which can solve the associated mixed integer
programming (MIP) problem to certified optimality. By exploiting the problem
structure, our custom BnB algorithm can solve to optimality problem instances
with $5 \times 10^6$ features and $10^3$ observations in minutes to hours --
over $1000$ times larger than what is currently possible using state-of-the-art
commercial MIP solvers. We also explore statistical properties of the
$\ell_0$-based estimators. We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that
our proposed estimators have an edge over popular group-sparse estimators in
terms of statistical performance in various regimes. We provide an open-source
implementation of our proposed framework.

Using these two types of layers, we replace the bottleneck layers in
MobileNet-V2 to reduce the network's number of parameters with a slight loss in

reduce the number of parameters from 2.270M to 540K. This reduces the accuracy

more efficient than the $1\times1$ convolution layer. The fast Walsh-Hadamard

previous works use complex training objectives to learn a latent embedding,

In contrast, we directly model the style variability of images, independent of
the image synthesis task. Specifically, we pre-train a generic style encoder
using a novel proxy task to learn an embedding of images, from arbitrary
domains, into a low-dimensional style latent space. The learned latent space
introduces several advantages over previous traditional approaches to
multi-modal I2I translation. First, it is not dependent on the target dataset,
and generalizes well across multiple domains. Second, it learns a more powerful
and expressive latent space, which improves the fidelity of style capture and
transfer. The proposed style pre-training also simplifies the training
objective and speeds up the training significantly. Furthermore, we provide a
detailed study of the contribution of different loss terms to the task of
multi-modal I2I translation, and propose a simple alternative to VAEs to enable
sampling from unconstrained latent spaces. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art

analytical method, namely we provide an analytical solution for the
corresponding diffusion equations on a cylindrical specimen and a cylindrical
container for three boundary conditions. These conditions occur in three phases
-- loading phase, evacuation phase and gas release phase. In the loading phase
the specimen is charged with hydrogen assuring a constant partial pressure of
hydrogen. Then the gas will be quickly removed by a vacuum pump in the second
phase, and finally in the third time interval, the hydrogen is released from
the specimen to the gaseous phase, where the pressure increase will be measured
by an equipment which is attached to the cylindrical container. The
investigated diffusion equation in each phase is a simple homogeneous equation,
but due to the complex time-dependent boundary conditions which include the
Sieverts' constant and the pressure, we transform the homogeneous equations to
the non-homogeneous ones with a zero Dirichlet boundary condition. Compared
with the time consuming numerical methods our analytical approach has an
advantage that the flux of desorbed hydrogen can be explicitly given and
therefore can be evaluated efficiently. Our analytical solution also assures
that the time-dependent boundary conditions are exactly satisfied and

the design of devices. Given the recent advances in computer technology and
additive manufacturing, topology optimization is increasingly being used to
design complex porous structures, for example, microfluidic devices. For the
flow of fluids in such miniature-sized porous structures, viscous shearing
stress will be significant. But the Darcy model -- the most popular
mathematical model describing the flow of a single-phase incompressible fluid
in rigid porous media -- neglects the internal friction arising from viscous
shearing stress. We will therefore develop a material design framework under
the topology optimization based on the Darcy-Brinkman model -- a mathematical
model for the flow of fluids through porous media that accounts for internal
friction besides the drag considered in the Darcy model. The proposed framework
uses the total rate of mechanical dissipation -- a physical quantity -- for the
objective function. To understand the effect of viscous shearing stress on the
design, we will compare the optimal material layouts provided by the Darcy and
Darcy-Brinkman models under topology optimization. In particular, we show,
using analytical solutions corroborated by numerical simulations, that the
optimal material layouts are identical for the class of problems exhibiting
axisymmetry, for which viscous shearing stress vanishes. These analytical
solutions will be valuable to check the veracity of numerical simulators. For
those problems with dominant viscous shearing stresses (e.g., flow in a
backward-facing step domain), we show, using numerical solutions, that the
optimal material layouts under the Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman models are very
different. Also, the associated solution fields (i.e., velocity and pressure)
are qualitatively different under their respective optimal layouts for these
two models.

the Kelsall and Wright models, which have been used in foreground removal

reduced chi squared of 3.5 for the Kelsall model and a chi squared of 2.0 for
the Wright model. The best description of our data is provided by a simple

This adjusted model describes the data with a reduced chi squared of 1.5 and
yields an inferred offset amplitude of 46 +- 19 nW m^-2 sr^-1 extrapolated to
12500 Angstroms. These measurements elude to the potential existence of a dust

\textit{active L\'evy swimmers} to model such behavior. The focus is on ideal
swimmers that only interact with the walls but not with each other, which
reduces to the classical L\'evy walk model but now under confinement. We study
the density distribution in the channel and force exerted on the walls by the
L\'evy swimmers, where the boundaries require proper explicit treatment. We
analyze stronger confinement via a set of coupled kinetics equations and the
swimmers' stochastic trajectories. Previous literature demonstrated that
power-law scaling in a multiscale analysis in free space results in a
fractional diffusion equation. We show that in a channel, in the weak
confinement limit active L\'evy swimmers are governed by a modified Riesz
fractional derivative. Leveraging recent results on fractional fluxes, we
derive steady state solutions for the bulk density distribution of active
L\'evy swimmers in a channel, and demonstrate that these solutions agree well
with particle simulations. The profiles are non-uniform over the entire domain,
in contrast to constant-in-the-bulk profiles of active Brownian and
run-and-tumble particles. Our theory provides a mathematical framework for
L\'evy walks under confinement with sliding no-flux boundary conditions and

be attractive, i.e. the FR moves towards the CH (for anti-aligned polarities)

is likely due to the formation of vanishing magnetic field regions or null

which is a stochastic formulation of the traffic-theoretic link transmission
model. The proposed network model is scalable and computationally efficient,
making it suitable for urban network optimization. For a network with $r$
links, each of space capacity $\ell$, the model has a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(r\ell)$. The network model yields the marginal distribution of
link states. The model is validated versus a simulation-based network
implementation of the stochastic link transmission model. The validation
experiments consider a set of small network with intricate traffic dynamics.
For all scenarios, the proposed model accurately captures the traffic dynamics.
The network model is used to address a signal control problem. Compared to the
probabilistic link model of Lu and Osorio (2018) with an exogenous node model

derives signal plans with better performance. The case study highlights the
added value of using between-link (i.e., across-node) interaction information
for traffic management and accounting for stochasticity in the network.

protons and neutrons is key for constraining the mechanisms of SU(6)
spin-flavor symmetry breaking in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). While vast
amounts of proton structure measurements were done, data on the structure of
the neutron is much more spars as experiments typically extract the structure
of neutrons from measurements of light atomic nuclei using model-dependent
corrections for nuclear effects. Recently the MARATHON collaboration performed
such an extraction by measuring inclusive deep-inelastic electron-scattering on
helium-3 and tritium mirror nuclei where nuclear effects are expected to be
similar and thus be suppressed in the helium-3 to tritium ratio. Here we
evaluate the model dependence of this extraction by examining a wide range of
models including the effect of using instant-form and light-cone nuclear wave
functions and several different parameterizations of nucleon modification
effects, including those with and without isospin dependence. We find that,
while the data cannot differentiate among the different models of nuclear
structure and nucleon modification, they consistently prefer a
neutron-to-proton structure function ratio of at $x_B \rightarrow 1$ of $\sim
0.4$ with a typical uncertainty ($1\sigma$) of $\sim0.05$ and $\sim0.10$ for
isospin-independent and isospin-dependent modification models, respectively.
While strongly favoring SU(6) symmetry breaking models based on perturbative
QCD and the Schwinger-Dyson equation calculation, the MARATHON data do not
completely rule out the scalar di-quark models if an isospin-dependent
modification exist.

stars very efficiently in intergalactic space. We map nebular lines in 3 dense
HI clumps of the Leo ring and complement these data with archival stellar
continuum observations to investigate the slow building up of a sparse
population of stars in localized areas of the ring. Individual young stars as
massive as O7-types are powering some HII regions. The average star formation
rate density is of order of 10^{-5} Msun/yr/kpc^2 and proceeds with local
bursts a few hundred parsecs in size, where loose stellar associations of
500-1000 Msun occasionally host massive outliers. The far ultraviolet-to-Halpha
emission ratio in nebular regions implies recent stellar bursts, from 2 to 7
Myr ago. The relation between the local HI gas density and the star formation
rate in the ring is similar to what is found in dwarfs and outer disks with gas
depletion times as long as 100~Gyrs. We find a candidate planetary nebula in a
compact and faint Halpha region with [OIII]/Halpha line enhancement, consistent
with the estimated mean stellar surface brightness of the ring. The presence of

it is thus desirable to have accurate yet affordable methods for their
simulation. Here, we introduce a linearized semiclassical method, the
generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation (GDTWA), which is
well-established in the context of quantum spin lattice systems, into the arena
of chemical nonadiabatic systems. In contrast to traditional continuous mapping
approaches, e.g. the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss and the spin mappings, GDTWA
samples the electron degrees of freedom in a discrete phase space, and thus
forbids an unphysical unbounded growth of electronic state populations. The
discrete sampling also accounts for an effective reduced but non-vanishing
zero-point energy without an explicit parameter, which makes it possible to
treat the identity operator and other operators on an equal footing. As
numerical benchmarks on two Linear Vibronic Coupling models show, GDTWA has a
satisfactory accuracy in a wide parameter regime, independently of whether the
dynamics is dominated by relaxation or by coherent interactions. Our results
suggest that the method can be very adequate to treat challenging nonadiabatic
dynamics problems in chemistry and related fields.

introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research
on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and
contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models,
and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for
the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains,
including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as
hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark
system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs
perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the
GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not
maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more
research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs.
Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN

Through a duality scheme, developed recently for the design of pre-stressed

convex problems $(\mathcal{P})$, $(\mathcal{P}^*)$ formulated on the 2D
reference region. The vault constructed upon solutions of those problems is
proved to be both of minimum volume and minimum compliance; analytical examples
of optimal vaults are given. Through a measure-theoretic approach, thus found

structure method applied to the convex problems furnishes a pair of discrete,
conic quadratic programs $(\mathcal{P}_X)$, $(\mathcal{P}_X^*)$ leading to
optimal design of grid-shells. By adopting the member-adding adaptive technique
this pair is efficiently tackled numerically, which is demonstrated on a number

  Collaborative Dynamic Bandit Solution",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collaborative bandit learning, i.e., bandit algorithms that utilize
collaborative filtering techniques to improve sample efficiency in online
interactive recommendation, has attracted much research attention as it enjoys
the best of both worlds. However, all existing collaborative bandit learning
solutions impose a stationary assumption about the environment, i.e., both user
preferences and the dependency among users are assumed static over time.
Unfortunately, this assumption hardly holds in practice due to users'
ever-changing interests and dependence relations, which inevitably costs a
recommender system sub-optimal performance in practice.
  In this work, we develop a collaborative dynamic bandit solution to handle a
changing environment for recommendation. We explicitly model the underlying
changes in both user preferences and their dependency relation as a stochastic
process. Individual user's preference is modeled by a mixture of globally
shared contextual bandit models with a Dirichlet Process prior. Collaboration
among users is thus achieved via Bayesian inference over the global bandit
models. Model selection and arm selection for each user are done via Thompson
sampling to balance exploitation and exploration. Our solution is proved to
maintain a standard $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ sublinear regret even in such a
challenging environment. And extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic
and real-world datasets further confirmed the necessity of modeling a changing
environment and our algorithm's practical advantages against several
state-of-the-art online learning solutions.

to lack of negative class data, it is often modeled as a one-class

server, e.g, all android-based devices are connected to Google server through
internet. This device-server structure can be exploited by recently proposed
Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) frameworks to perform
collaborative learning over the data distributed among multiple devices. Using
FL/SL frameworks, we can alleviate the lack of negative data problem by
training a user authentication model over multiple user data distributed across
devices. To this end, we propose a novel user active authentication training,

of FL/SL. We first show that existing FL/SL methods are suboptimal for FAA as
they rely on the data to be distributed homogeneously (i.e. IID) across

method that is able to tackle heterogeneous/non-IID distribution of data in

variance corresponding to data from each user which are later combined in a
central server to learn a multi-class classifier and sent back to the
individual devices. We conduct extensive experiments using three active
authentication benchmark datasets (MOBIO, UMDAA-01, UMDAA-02) and show that
such approach performs better than state-of-the-art one-class based FAA methods

(KD) is a prominent model compression technique for deep neural networks in

attributed to its training objective function, which exploits the soft-target
information (also known as ""dark knowledge"") besides the given regular hard

larger the gap between the teacher and the student networks, the more difficult

propose an improved knowledge distillation method (called Annealing-KD) by
feeding the rich information provided by the teacher's soft-targets

gradual transition over annealed soft-targets generated by the teacher at

challenging because the time-lapse signature of the growth of CO2 plumes is
weak in amplitude and therefore difficult to detect seismically. This situation
is compounded by the fact that the surveys are often coarsely sampled and not
replicated to reduce costs. As a result, images obtained for different vintages
(baseline and monitor surveys) often contain artifacts that may be attributed
wrongly to time-lapse changes. To address these issues, we propose to invert
the baseline and monitor surveys jointly. By using the joint recovery model, we
exploit information shared between multiple time-lapse surveys. Contrary to
other time-lapse methods, our approach does not rely on replicating the surveys
to detect time-lapse changes. To illustrate this advantage, we present a
numerical sensitivity study where CO2 is injected in a realistic synthetic

notes and ratings between the introduction of the feature in early 2021 and end

Twitter's historical API. In addition, we use text mining methods to extract
content characteristics from the text explanations in the Birdwatch notes
(e.g., sentiment). Our empirical analysis yields the following main findings:
(i) users more frequently file Birdwatch notes for misleading than not
misleading tweets. These misleading tweets are primarily reported because of
factual errors, lack of important context, or because they treat unverified
claims as facts. (ii) Birdwatch notes are more helpful to other users if they
link to trustworthy sources and if they embed a more positive sentiment. (iii)
The social influence of the author of the source tweet is associated with
differences in the level of user consensus. For influential users with many
followers, Birdwatch notes yield a lower level of consensus among users and
community-created fact checks are more likely to be seen as being incorrect and
argumentative. Altogether, our findings can help social media platforms to
formulate guidelines for users on how to write more helpful fact checks. At the
same time, our analysis suggests that community-based fact-checking faces
challenges regarding opinion speculation and polarization among the user base.

extended such a spectroscopic investigation into crystals containing a Sm

remaining incoherent down to the lowest measurement temperature due to their
continued interaction with the spin excitons that remain uncondensed. This
result shows that the detailed topological nature of SmB$_6$ could vary
drastically in the presence of disorder in the lattice. This sensitiveness to

either incorrect or do not capture all the observed phenomena, which include
reflectivity exceeding unity, large shifts of Josephson plasmon edges, and
appearance of new peaks in terahertz reflectivity. These observations can be
explained from the perspective of a Floquet theory involving a periodic drive

unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that following incoherent
photoexcitation, long-lived oscillations are generally expected in
superconductors with low-energy Josephson plasmons, such as in cuprates or
fullerene superconductor K$_3$C$_{60}$. These oscillations arise from the
parametric generation of plasmon pairs due to pump-induced perturbation of the
superconducting order parameter. We show that this bi-plasmon response can
persist even above the transition temperature as long as strong superconducting
fluctuations are present. Our analysis offers a robust framework to understand
light-induced superconducting behavior, and the predicted bi-plasmon

translated into practical deployments. There are several causes contributing
towards the wide gap between research and production, such as the limited
ability of comprehensive evaluation of ML models and lack of understanding of
internal ML operations. This paper tightens the gap by evaluating the
generalisability of a common feature set to different network environments and
attack scenarios. Therefore, two feature sets (NetFlow and CICFlowMeter) have
been evaluated in terms of detection accuracy across three key datasets, i.e.,
CSE-CIC-IDS2018, BoT-IoT, and ToN-IoT. The results show the superiority of the
NetFlow feature set in enhancing the ML models detection accuracy of various
network attacks. In addition, due to the complexity of the learning models,
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an explainable AI methodology, has been
adopted to explain and interpret the classification decisions of ML models. The
Shapley values of two common feature sets have been analysed across multiple
datasets to determine the influence contributed by each feature towards the
final ML prediction.

runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. For rooted edge connectivity this is the first
algorithm to improve on the $\Omega(n^3)$ time bound in the dense-graph
high-connectivity regime. Our result relies on a simple combination of sampling
coupled with sparsification that appears new, and could lead to further
tradeoffs for directed graph connectivity problems.
  We extend the edge connectivity ideas to rooted and global vertex
connectivity in directed graphs. We obtain a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation for
rooted vertex connectivity in $\tilde{O}(nW/\epsilon)$ time where $W$ is the
total vertex weight (assuming integral vertex weights); in particular this
yields an $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon)$ time randomized algorithm for unweighted
graphs. This translates to a $\tilde{O}(\kappa nW)$ time exact algorithm where
$\kappa$ is the rooted connectivity. We build on this to obtain similar bounds
for global vertex connectivity.
  Our results complement the known results for these problems in the low
connectivity regime due to work of Gabow [9] for edge connectivity from 1991,
and the very recent work of Nanongkai et al. [24] and Forster et al. [7] for
vertex connectivity.

requirements: to support new ontologies (i.e., intents and slots),
practitioners crowdsource thousands of samples for supervised fine-tuning.
Partly, this is due to the structure of de facto copy-generate parsers; these
models treat ontology labels as discrete entities, relying on parallel data to
extrinsically derive their meaning. In our work, we instead exploit what we
intrinsically know about ontology labels; for example, the fact that
SL:TIME_ZONE has the categorical type ""slot"" and language-based span ""time
zone"". Using this motivation, we build our approach with offline and online
stages. During preprocessing, for each ontology label, we extract its intrinsic
properties into a component, and insert each component into an inventory as a
cache of sorts. During training, we fine-tune a seq2seq, pre-trained
transformer to map utterances and inventories to frames, parse trees comprised
of utterance and ontology tokens. Our formulation encourages the model to
consider ontology labels as a union of its intrinsic properties, therefore
substantially bootstrapping learning in low-resource settings. Experiments show
our model is highly sample efficient: using a low-resource benchmark derived

and to improve classification for longer texts, researchers have sought to
resolve the underlying causes of the computational cost and have proposed
optimizations for the attention mechanism, which is the key element of every

Instead, we propose a text truncation method called Text Guide, in which the
original text length is reduced to a predefined limit in a manner that improves
performance over naive and semi-naive approaches while preserving low

performing evolutions of rotating single stars with zero- and non-zero
temperature gradients, as well as evolutions of binary neutron star mergers. We
find that our new finite-temperature EoS implementation can support stable
stars over many dynamical timescales. We also perform a first parameter study
to explore the role of the M* parameters in binary neutron star merger
simulations. All simulations start from identical initial data with identical
cold EoSs, and differ only in the thermal part of the EoS. We find that both
the thermal profile of the remnant and the post-merger gravitational wave
signal depend on the choice of M* parameters, but that the total merger ejecta
depends only weakly on the finite-temperature part of the EoS across a wide
range of parameters. Our simulations provide a first step toward understanding
how the finite-temperature properties of dense matter may affect future
observations of binary neutron star mergers.

galaxy NGC 3504. With three times higher angular resolution (~ 0.""8) than
previous studies, our observations reveal an inner molecular gas bar, a nuclear
ring, and four inner spiral arm-like structures in the central 1 kpc region.
Furthermore, the CO emission is clearly aligned with the two dust lanes in the
outer bar region, with differences in shape and intensity between them. The
total molecular gas mass in the observed region (50""x57"") is estimated to be
$\sim 3.1\times 10^9 \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$, which is 17 per cent of the stellar
mass. We used the Kinemetry package to fit the velocity field and found that
circular motion strongly dominates at $R= 0.3-0.8$ kpc, but radial motion
becomes important at $R<0.3$ kpc and $R=1.0-2.5$ kpc, which is expected due to
the presence of the inner and outer bars. Finally, assuming that the gas moves
along the dust lanes in the bar rotating frame, we derived the pattern speed of
the outer bar to be $ 18\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, the average streaming
velocities on each of the two dust lanes to be 165 and 221 km s$^{-1}$, and the
total mass inflow rate along the dust lanes to be 12 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our
results give a new example of an inner gas bar within a gas-rich double-barred
galaxy and suggest that the formation of double-barred galaxies could be
associated with the existence of such gas structures.

corona, and new generation of numerical modelling of the evolution of coronal
magnetic fields, as featured with boundary conditions driven directly by

data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of solar active region (AR)
magnetic field evolution, which is for the first time that a data-driven
full-MHD model utilizes directly the photospheric velocity field from DAVE4VM.
We constructed a well-established MHD equilibrium based on a single vector
magnetogram by employing an MHD-relaxation approach with sufficiently small
kinetic viscosity, and used this MHD equilibrium as the initial conditions for
subsequent data-driven evolution. Then we derived the photospheric surface
flows from a time series of observed magentograms based on the DAVE4VM method.
The surface flows are finally inputted in time sequence to the bottom boundary
of the MHD model to self-consistently update the magnetic field at every time
step by solving directly the magnetic induction equation at the bottom
boundary. We applied this data-driven model to study the magnetic field
evolution of AR 12158 with SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. Our model reproduced a
quasi-static stress of the field lines through mainly the rotational flow of
the AR's leading sunspot, which makes the core field lines to form a coherent S
shape consistent with the sigmoid structure as seen in the SDO/AIA images. The
total magnetic energy obtained in the simulation matches closely the
accumulated magnetic energy as calculated directly from the original vector
magnetogram with the DAVE4VM derived flow field. Such a data-driven model will
be used to study how the coronal field, as driven by the slow photospheric
motions, reaches a unstable state and runs into eruptions.

pandemic. On the other hand, CXR data with other findings are abundant. This
situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture,
where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the
self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal,
since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in
the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we
propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus
obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings.
Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets
to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc.
Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a
Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of
COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally
different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The
experimental results confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art

phenomenon, involving the intricate dynamics of one or more oscillators with

two mesoscopic model reductions for finite sparse networks of coupled
oscillators to quantitatively capture the dynamics close to bifurcation from
global to partial synchronization. Our model reduction builds upon the method
of collective coordinates. We first show that standard collective coordinate
reduction has difficulties capturing this bifurcation. We identify a particular
topological structure at bifurcation consisting of a main synchronized cluster,
the oscillator that desynchronizes at bifurcation, and an intermediary node
connecting them. Utilizing this structure and ensemble averages we derive an
analytic expression for the mismatch between the true bifurcation from global

coordinate approach without prior knowledge of which node will desynchronize.
We introduce a second mesoscopic reduction, utilizing the same particular
topological structure, which allows for a quantitative dynamical description of

computational complexity of the collective coordinate approach, reducing from
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We perform numerical simulations for

(IMF), which is a measure of the Sun's total open flux, is observed to vary by
roughly a factor of two over the 11 yr solar cycle. Several recent studies have
proposed that the Sun's open flux consists of a constant or ""floor"" component
that dominates at sunspot minimum, and a time-varying component due to coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). Here, we point out that CMEs cannot account for the
large peaks in the IMF strength which occurred in 2003 and late 2014, and which
coincided with peaks in the Sun's equatorial dipole moment. We also show that
near-Earth interplanetary CMEs, as identified in the catalog of Richardson and
Cane, contribute at most $\sim$30\% of the average radial IMF strength even
during sunspot maximum. We conclude that the long-term variation of the radial
IMF strength is determined mainly by the Sun's total dipole moment, with the
quadrupole moment and CMEs providing an additional boost near sunspot maximum.
Most of the open flux is rooted in coronal holes, whose solar cycle evolution
in turn reflects that of the Sun's lowest-order multipoles.

sphere translating steadily in a wormlike micellar solution is caused due to
the breakage of long micelles downstream of the sphere once the Weissenberg
number exceeds a critical value based on the two-species Vasquez-Cook-McKinley
(VCM) constitutive model for wormlike micelles (C. Sasmal, Unsteady motion past
a sphere translating steadily in wormlike micellar solutions: a numerical
analysis, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 912, A52, 2021). This study further shows
that this unsteady motion is strongly influenced by the micelle breakage rate
and wall slip present on the sphere surface. In particular, we find that the
onset of this unsteady motion is delayed to higher values of the Weissenberg
number as the micelle breakage rate decreases or, in other words, as the
micelles become hard to break. Additionally, we observe that at some values of
the micelle breakage rate, a transition in the flow field from steady to
unsteady occurs as the Weissenberg number increases, and then again, a
transition from unsteady to steady occurs as the Weissenberg number further
increases. Therefore, there is a window of the Weissenberg number present in
which one can see this unsteady motion past the translating sphere. On the
other hand, we show that the presence of wall slip on the sphere surface

between sources of information (i.e., inter-source uncertainty). Increasingly,
however, research is focusing upon uncertainty arising at the level of
individual measurements (i.e., within- or intra-source), such as for a given
sensor output or human response. Here, adopting intervals rather than numbers
as the fundamental data-type provides an efficient, powerful, yet challenging
way forward -- offering systematic capture of uncertainty-at-source, increasing
informational capacity, and ultimately potential for insight. Following recent
progress in the capture of interval-valued data, including from human
participants, conducting machine learning directly upon intervals is a crucial
next step. This paper focuses on linear regression for interval-valued data as
a recent growth area, providing an essential foundation for broader use of
intervals in AI. We conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art methods,
elucidating their behaviour, advantages, and pitfalls when applied to datasets
with different properties. Specific emphasis is given to the challenge of
preserving mathematical coherence -- i.e., ensuring that models maintain
fundamental mathematical properties of intervals throughout -- and the paper
puts forward extensions to an existing approach to guarantee this. Carefully
designed experiments, using both synthetic and real-world data, are conducted
-- with findings presented alongside novel visualizations for interval-valued
regression outputs, designed to maximise model interpretability. Finally, the
paper makes recommendations concerning method suitability for data sets with
specific properties and highlights remaining challenges and important next

autonomous vehicles are still unable to handle all kinds of situations and

adaptability in complex driving scenarios, it is of great importance to
introduce humans into the training loop of artificial intelligence, leveraging
human intelligence to further advance machine learning algorithms. In this
study, a real-time human-guidance-based deep reinforcement learning (Hug-DRL)
method is developed for policy training of autonomous driving. Leveraging a
newly designed control transfer mechanism between human and automation, human
is able to intervene and correct the agent's unreasonable actions in real time
when necessary during the model training process. Based on this
human-in-the-loop guidance mechanism, an improved actor-critic architecture
with modified policy and value networks is developed. The fast convergence of
the proposed Hug-DRL allows real-time human guidance actions to be fused into
the agent's training loop, further improving the efficiency and performance of
deep reinforcement learning. The developed method is validated by
human-in-the-loop experiments with 40 subjects and compared with other
state-of-the-art learning approaches. The results suggest that the proposed

circuits to additive error $\delta$ is often called weak simulation and is a
direct way to determine when they confer a quantum advantage. Weak simulation
of the $T$+Clifford gateset is $BQP$-complete and is expected to scale
exponentially with the number $t$ of $T$ gates. We constructively tighten the
upper bound on the worst-case $L_1$ norm sampling cost to next order in $t$
from $\mathcal O(\xi^t \delta^{-2})$ if $\delta^2 \gg \xi^{-t}$ to $\mathcal
O((\xi^t{-}t) \delta^{-2} )$ if $\delta^2 \gg (\xi^t -t)^{-1}$, where $\xi^t =
2^{\sim 0.228 t}$ is the stabilizer extent of the $t$-tensored $T$ gate magic

popular SPARSIFY algorithm used in many weak simulators with correlated $L_1$
sampling. As an aside, this result demonstrates that the $T$ gate magic state's
approximate stabilizer state decomposition is not multiplicative with respect
to $t$, for finite values, despite the multiplicativity of its stabilizer
extent. This is the first weak simulation algorithm that has lowered this

establishes how to obtain further such reductions in $t$.

geometries. In a 3D simulation with a cylindrical geometry, the acceleration
process of electrons terminates early due to the higher phase velocity of the

to have prolonged electron acceleration and thus produce much more energetic

and anomalously shortened Cu-apical O$_{\rm A}$ separations compared with other
cuprates. The stoichiometric system $\delta=0$, with its strongly
one-dimensional (1D) Cu-O$_{\rm P}$ chain structure, when nonmagnetic shows 1D
Fermi surfaces that lead, within density functional theory, to
antiferromagnetic Cu-O$_{\rm P}$ chains (a spin-Peierls instability).
Accounting for 1D fluctuations and small interchain coupling according to the
theory of Schulz indicates this system, like Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, is near the 1D
Luttinger-liquid quantum critical phase. The unusual Cu-O bond lengths per se
have limited effects on other properties for $\delta$=0. We find that a
`doubled bilayer' structure of alternating Cu-O$_{\rm P}$ chains and wide rung
Cu$_3$O$_4$ ladders is the energetically preferred one of three possibilities
where the additional oxygen ions bridge Cu-O$_{\rm P}$ chains in the

sites are discussed. The six-fold (octahedral) site is the most highly
oxidized, accepting somewhat more holes in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital than in the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The implication is that two-band physics is involved in
the pairing mechanism and the superconducting carriers. The Fermi surfaces of
this metallic bilayer structure show both 1D and 2D strong (incipient) nesting
instabilities, possibly accounting for the lack of clean single-phase samples
based on this structure and suggesting importance for the pairing mechanism.

Hladk\'y, Pelekis, and \v{S}ileikis (2021) in the case where $H$ is a clique.
In this paper, we extend this result to any fixed graph $H$. Towards this we
introduce a notion of $H$-regularity of graphons and show that if the graphon
$W$ is not $H$-regular, then $X_n(H, W)$ has Gaussian fluctuations with scaling
$n^{|V(H)|-\frac{1}{2}}$. On the other hand, if $W$ is $H$-regular, then the
fluctuations are of order $n^{|V(H)|-1}$ and the limiting distribution of
$X_n(H, W)$ can have both Gaussian and non-Gaussian components, where the
non-Gaussian component is a (possibly) infinite weighted sum of centered
chi-squared random variables with the weights determined by the spectral
properties of a graphon derived from $W$. Our proofs use the asymptotic theory
of generalized $U$-statistics developed by Janson and Nowicki (1991). We also
investigate the structure of $H$-regular graphons for which either the Gaussian
or the non-Gaussian component of the limiting distribution (but not both) is
degenerate. Interestingly, there are also $H$-regular graphons $W$ for which
both the Gaussian or the non-Gaussian components are degenerate, that is,
$X_n(H, W)$ has a degenerate limit even under the scaling $n^{|V(H)|-1}$. We
give an example of this degeneracy with $H=K_{1, 3}$ (the 3-star) and also
establish non-degeneracy in a few examples. This naturally leads to interesting

suppliers or customers. While knowing the impact of individual companies on
national economies is a prerequisite for efficient risk management, the
quantitative assessment of the involved economic systemic risks (ESR) is
hitherto practically non-existent, mainly because of a lack of fine-grained
data in combination with coherent methods. Based on a unique value added tax
dataset we derive the detailed production network of an entire country and
present a novel approach for computing the ESR of all individual firms. We
demonstrate that a tiny fraction (0.035%) of companies has extraordinarily high
systemic risk impacting about 23% of the national economic production should
any of them default. Firm size alone cannot explain the ESR of individual
companies; their position in the production networks does matter substantially.
If companies are ranked according to their economic systemic risk index (ESRI),
firms with a rank above a characteristic value have very similar ESRI values,
while for the rest the rank distribution of ESRI decays slowly as a power-law;
99.8% of all companies have an impact on less than 1% of the economy. We show
that the assessment of ESR is impossible with aggregate data as used in
traditional Input-Output Economics. We discuss how simple policies of
introducing supply chain redundancies can reduce ESR of some extremely risky

physical properties of planets is not well-understood. In this paper, we
numerically study the formation of planetary systems via pebble accretion and
investigate the effects of disc properties such as masses, dissipation
timescales, and metallicities on planet formation outcomes. Methods. We
improved the N-body code SyMBA that was modified by taking account of new
planet-disc interaction models and type II migration. We adopted the 'two-alpha
disc' model to mimic the effects of both the standard disc turbulence and the
mass accretion driven by the magnetic disc wind. Results. We successfully
reproduced the overall distribution trends of semi-major axes, eccentricities,
and planetary masses of extrasolar giant planets. We find that, when planet
formation happens fast enough, giant planets are fully grown (Jupiter mass or
higher) and are distributed widely across the disc. On the other hand, when
planet formation is limited by the disc's dissipation, discs generally form
low-mass cold Jupiters (CJs). Our simulations also naturally explain why hot
Jupiters (HJs) tend to be alone and how the observed eccentricity-metallicity
trends arise. The low-metallicity discs tend to form nearly circular and
coplanar HJs in situ, because planet formation is slower than high-metallicity
discs, and thus protoplanetary cores migrate significantly before gas
accretion. The high-metallicity discs, on the other hand, generate HJs in situ
or via tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits. Both pathways usually involve
dynamical instabilities, and thus HJs tend to have broader eccentricity and
inclination distributions. When giant planets with very wide orbits
('super-cold Jupiters') are formed, we find that they often belong to
metal-rich stars, have eccentric orbits, and tend to have (~80%) companions
interior to their orbits.

parsers to map utterances to semantic frames proceeds in three steps: encoding
an utterance $x$, predicting a frame's length |y|, and decoding a |y|-sized
frame with utterance and ontology tokens. Though empirically strong, these
models are typically bottlenecked by length prediction, as even small
inaccuracies change the syntactic and semantic characteristics of resulting
frames. In our work, we propose span pointer networks, non-autoregressive
parsers which shift the decoding task from text generation to span prediction;
that is, when imputing utterance spans into frame slots, our model produces
endpoints (e.g., [i, j]) as opposed to text (e.g., ""6pm""). This natural
quantization of the output space reduces the variability of gold frames,
therefore improving length prediction and, ultimately, exact match.
Furthermore, length prediction is now responsible for frame syntax and the
decoder is responsible for frame semantics, resulting in a coarse-to-fine
model. We evaluate our approach on several task-oriented semantic parsing
datasets. Notably, we bridge the quality gap between non-autogressive and
autoregressive parsers, achieving 87 EM on TOPv2 (Chen et al. 2020).
Furthermore, due to our more consistent gold frames, we show strong
improvements in model generalization in both cross-domain and cross-lingual
transfer in low-resource settings. Finally, due to our diminished output
vocabulary, we observe 70% reduction in latency and 83% reduction in memory at
beam size 5 compared to prior non-autoregressive parsers.

to represent the interaction of an environment and an agent, under state
uncertainty. Since the agent does not observe the environment state, its
uncertainty is typically represented through a probabilistic belief. While the
set of possible beliefs is infinite, making exact planning intractable, the
belief space's complexity (and hence planning complexity) is characterized by
its covering number. Many POMDP solvers uniformly discretize the belief space
and give the planning error in terms of the (typically unknown) covering
number. We instead propose an adaptive belief discretization scheme, and give
its associated planning error. We furthermore characterize the covering number
with respect to the POMDP parameters. This allows us to specify the exact
memory requirements on the planner, needed to bound the value function error.
We then propose a novel, computationally efficient solver using this scheme. We
demonstrate that our algorithm is highly competitive with the state of the art

internal map of the environment, and then design several simple rules, in
conjunction with a localization and planning approach, to navigate through the
internal map. These approaches often involve a variety of assumptions and prior
knowledge. In contrast, recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods can provide
a model-free, self-learning mechanism as the robot interacts with an initially
unknown environment, but are expensive to deploy in real-world scenarios due to
inefficient exploration. In this paper, we focus on efficient navigation with
the RL technique and combine the advantages of these two kinds of methods into
a rule-based RL (RuRL) algorithm for reducing the sample complexity and cost of
time. First, we use the rule of wall-following to generate a closed-loop
trajectory. Second, we employ a reduction rule to shrink the trajectory, which
in turn effectively reduces the redundant exploration space. Besides, we give
the detailed theoretical guarantee that the optimal navigation path is still in
the reduced space. Third, in the reduced space, we utilize the Pledge rule to
guide the exploration strategy for accelerating the RL process at the early
stage. Experiments conducted on real robot navigation problems in hex-grid
environments demonstrate that RuRL can achieve improved navigation performance.

Although current detection approaches have achieved promising results on

new data. However, fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on previous
data. Retraining takes a lot of time and computation resources. Besides,
previous data are unavailable due to privacy in some situations. To solve the
above problems, this paper proposes detecting fake without forgetting, a
continual-learning-based method, to make the model learn new spoofing attacks
incrementally. A knowledge distillation loss is introduced to loss function to
preserve the memory of original model. Supposing the distribution of genuine
voice is consistent among different scenarios, an extra embedding similarity
loss is used as another constraint to further do a positive sample alignment.
Experiments are conducted on the ASVspoof2019 dataset. The results show that
our proposed method outperforms fine-tuning by the relative reduction of

multiple strains has many applications in ecology and epidemiology. Because of
high dimensionality and complex feedbacks between traits manifested in
infection and co-infection, the study of such systems remains a challenge. In
the case where strains are similar (quasi-neutrality assumption), we can model
trait variation as perturbations in parameters, which simplifies analysis.
Here, we apply singular perturbation theory to many strain parameters
simultaneously, and advance analytically to obtain their explicit collective
dynamics. We consider and study such a quasi-neutral model of
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics among N strains which vary in 5
fitness dimensions: transmissibility, clearance rate of single-and
co-infection, transmission probability from mixed coinfection, and
co-colonization vulnerability factors encompassing cooperation and competition.
This quasi-neutral system is analyzed with a singular perturbation method
through an appropriate slow-fast decomposition. The fast dynamics correspond to
the embedded neutral system, while the slow dynamics are governed by an
N-dimensional replicator equation, describing the time evolution of strain
frequencies. The coefficients of this replicator system are pairwise invasion
fitnesses between strains, which, in our model, are an explicit weighted sum of
pairwise asymmetries along all trait dimensions. Remarkably these weights
depend only on the parameters of the neutral system. Such model reduction
highlights the centrality of the neutral system for dynamics at the edge of
neutrality, and exposes critical features for maintenance of diversity.

obtain node embeddings and simultaneously perform clustering assignments on the
embedding space. It is effective since graph convolution combines the
structural and attributive information for node embedding learning. However, a
major limitation of such works is that the graph convolution only incorporates
the attribute information from the local neighborhood of nodes but fails to
exploit the mutual affinities between nodes and attributes. In this regard, we
propose a variational co-embedding learning model for attributed network
clustering (VCLANC). VCLANC is composed of dual variational auto-encoders to
simultaneously embed nodes and attributes. Relying on this, the mutual affinity
information between nodes and attributes could be reconstructed from the
embedding space and served as extra self-supervised knowledge for
representation learning. At the same time, trainable Gaussian mixture model is
used as priors to infer the node clustering assignments. To strengthen the
performance of the inferred clusters, we use a mutual distance loss on the
centers of the Gaussian priors and a clustering assignment hardening loss on
the node embeddings. Experimental results on four real-world attributed network
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VCLANC for attributed
network clustering.

envelope into a large, dusty, molecule-rich circumstellar nebula which
typically develops a high degree of structural complexity. Most of the
large-scale, spatially correlated structures in the nebula are thought to
originate from the interaction of the stellar wind with a companion. As part of
the Atomium large programme, we observed the M-type asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) star R Hydrae with ALMA. The morphology of the inner wind of R Hya, which
has a known companion at ~3500 au, was determined from maps of CO and SiO
obtained at high angular resolution. A map of the CO emission reveals a
multi-layered structure consisting of a large elliptical feature at an angular
scale of ~10'' that is oriented along the north-south axis. The wind morphology
within the elliptical feature is dominated by two hollow bubbles. The bubbles
are on opposite sides of the AGB star and lie along an axis with a position
angle of ~115 deg. Both bubbles are offset from the central star, and their
appearance in the SiO channel maps indicates that they might be shock waves
travelling through the AGB wind. An estimate of the dynamical age of the
bubbles yields an age of the order of 100 yr, which is in agreement with the
previously proposed elapsed time since the star last underwent a thermal pulse.
When the CO and SiO emission is examined on subarcsecond angular scales, there
is evidence for an inclined, differentially rotating equatorial density
enhancement, strongly suggesting the presence of a second nearby companion. The
position angle of the major axis of this disc is ~70 deg in the plane of the
sky. We tentatively estimate that a lower limit on the mass of the nearby
companion is ~0.65 Msol on the basis of the highest measured speeds in the disc
and the location of its inner rim at ~6 au from the AGB star.

in-the-wild crowded scenes. While much progress has been in 3D human mesh
estimation, existing methods struggle when test input has crowded scenes. The
first reason for the failure is a domain gap between training and testing data.
A motion capture dataset, which provides accurate 3D labels for training, lacks
crowd data and impedes a network from learning crowded scene-robust image
features of a target person. The second reason is a feature processing that
spatially averages the feature map of a localized bounding box containing
multiple people. Averaging the whole feature map makes a target person's
feature indistinguishable from others. We present 3DCrowdNet that firstly
explicitly targets in-the-wild crowded scenes and estimates a robust 3D human
mesh by addressing the above issues. First, we leverage 2D human pose
estimation that does not require a motion capture dataset with 3D labels for
training and does not suffer from the domain gap. Second, we propose a
joint-based regressor that distinguishes a target person's feature from others.
Our joint-based regressor preserves the spatial activation of a target by
sampling features from the target's joint locations and regresses human model
parameters. As a result, 3DCrowdNet learns target-focused features and
effectively excludes the irrelevant features of nearby persons. We conduct
experiments on various benchmarks and prove the robustness of 3DCrowdNet to the
in-the-wild crowded scenes both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is

applicability and convenience of the model. Furthermore, these anchor boxes
require complicated calculations, such as calculating their
intersection-over-union (IoU) with ground truth bounding boxes.Due to the
problems related to anchor boxes, we propose a simple yet effective anchor-free
tracker (named Siamese corner networks, SiamCorners), which is end-to-end
trained offline on large-scale image pairs. Specifically, we introduce a
modified corner pooling layer to convert the bounding box estimate of the
target into a pair of corner predictions (the bottom-right and the top-left
corners). By tracking a target as a pair of corners, we avoid the need to
design the anchor boxes. This will make the entire tracking algorithm more
flexible and simple than anchorbased trackers. In our network design, we
further introduce a layer-wise feature aggregation strategy that enables the
corner pooling module to predict multiple corners for a tracking target in deep
networks. We then introduce a new penalty term that is used to select an
optimal tracking box in these candidate corners. Finally, SiamCorners achieves
experimental results that are comparable to the state-of-art tracker while
maintaining a high running speed. In particular, SiamCorners achieves a 53.7%
AUC on NFS30 and a 61.4% AUC on UAV123, while still running at 42 frames per
second (FPS).

ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in which the right-hand-side is
comprised of terms which correspond to individual 'processes' or 'fluxes'.
Frequently, these ODEs are characterised by multiple time-scale phenomena due
to order of magnitude differences between contributing processes and the
presence of switching, i.e., dominance or sub-dominance of particular terms as
a function of state variables. We outline a heuristic procedure for the
identification of small parameters in ODE models of this kind, with a
particular emphasis on the identification of small parameters relating to
switching behaviours. This procedure is outlined informally in generality, and
applied in detail to a model for intracellular calcium dynamics characterised
by switching and multiple (more than two) time-scale dynamics. A total of five
small parameters are identified, and related to a single perturbation parameter
by a polynomial scaling law based on order of magnitude comparisons. The
resulting singular perturbation problem has a time-scale separation which
depends on the region of state space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of
stable relaxation oscillations with three distinct time-scales using a
coordinate-independent formulation of GSPT in combination with the blow-up
method. We also provide an estimate for the period of the oscillations, and
consider a number of possibilities for their onset under parameter variation.

gives rise to serrated deformation curves and a complex evolution of the strain
heterogeneity. A rich example of this phenomenon is the Portevin-Le Chatelier
effect in alloys. The corresponding spatiotemporal patterns showed some
universal features which provided a basis for a well-known phenomenological
classification. Recent studies revealed peculiar features in both the stress
serration sequences and the kinematics of deformation bands in Al-based alloys
containing fine microstructure elements, such as nanosize precipitates and (or)
submicron grains. In the present work, jerky flow of an AlMgScZr alloy is
studied using statistical analysis of stress serrations and the accompanying
acoustic emission. As in the case of coarse-grained binary AlMg alloys, the
amplitude distributions of acoustic events obey a power-law scaling which is
usually considered as evidence of avalanchelike dynamics. However, the scaling
exponents display specific dependences on the strain and strain rate for the
investigated materials. The observed effects bear evidence to a competition
between the phenomena of synchronization and randomization of dislocation
avalanches, which may shed light on the mechanisms leading to a high variety of
jerky flow patterns observed in applied alloys.

reflectance property, beyond typical device-dependent RGB albedos, opens the
door to applications requiring a high-fidelity 3D model in terms of both
geometry and photometry. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Inverse
Rendering (MVIR) method called Spectral MVIR for jointly reconstructing the 3D
shape and the spectral reflectance for each point of object surfaces from
multi-view images captured using a standard RGB camera and low-cost lighting
equipment such as an LED bulb or an LED projector. Our main contributions are
twofold: (i) We present a rendering model that considers both geometric and
photometric principles in the image formation by explicitly considering camera
spectral sensitivity, light's spectral power distribution, and light source
positions. (ii) Based on the derived model, we build a cost-optimization MVIR
framework for the joint reconstruction of the 3D shape and the per-vertex
spectral reflectance while estimating the light source positions and the
shadows. Different from most existing spectral-3D acquisition methods, our
method does not require expensive special equipment and cumbersome geometric
calibration. Experimental results using both synthetic and real-world data
demonstrate that our Spectral MVIR can acquire a high-quality 3D model with
accurate spectral reflectance property.

the framework of the peak theory that allows one to derive from first
principles andno free parameters the typical halo properties from the
statistics of peaks in the filtered Gaussian random field of density
perturbations. The predicted halo mass function, spherically averaged density,
velocity dispersion, velocity anisotropy, ellipticity, prolateness and
potential profiles, as well as the abundance and number density profiles of
accreted and stripped subhalos and diffuse dark matter accurately recover the
results of cosmological $N$-body simulations. CUSP is thus a powerful tool for
the calculation, in any desired hierarchical cosmology with Gaussian

covered by simulations. More importantly, CUSP unravels the origin of the
characteristic features of those properties. In the present Paper we culminate
its construction. We show that all halo properties but those related with
subhalo stripping are independent of the assembly history of those objects, and
that the Gaussian is the only smoothing window able to find the finite

=\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, their infinite Reynolds number limit, and
the rate of logarithmic decay in the outer part of the flow. Inspired by the
landmark paper of Chen and Sreenivasan (2021), two terms of the inner
asymptotic expansion of $\langle uu\rangle^+$ in the small parameter
$Re_\tau^{-1/4}$ are extracted for the first time from a set of direct

by a matching outer expansion, which not only fits the same set of channel DNS

a slope that becomes positive for $Re_\tau \gtrapprox 20'000$, leading up to an

time-reversal symmetry in spatial-symmetry-broken systems, including chiral
states, on the basis of the free-energy functional derived in the weak-coupling
theory. We consider a generic a_1 + i a_2 wave state, with a_1 and a_2 being
different symmetry indices such as (a_1,a_2) = (d,s), (p_x,p_y), and (d,d').The
time-reversal symmetry of the mixed-symmetry state with the a_1- and a_2-wave
components is broken when the phases of these components differ, and such a
state is called the time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) state. However,
their phases are equated by Cooper-pair scattering between these components if
it occurs; i.e., when the off-diagonal elements S_{a_1 a_2} = S_{a_2 a_1} of
the scattering matrix are nonzero, they destabilize the TRSB state. Hence, it
has often been believed that the TRSB state is stable only in systems with a
spatial symmetry that guarantees S_{a_1 a_2}=0. We note that, contrary to this
belief, the TRSB state can remain stable in systems without the spatial
symmetry when the relative phase shifts so that S_{a_1 a_2} = 0 is restored,
which results in a distorted TRSB (a_1 + a_2) + i a_2 wave state. Here, note
that the restoration of S_{a_1 a_2} = 0 does not imply that the symmetry of the
quasi-particle energy E_k is recovered. This study shows that such
stabilization of the TRSB state occurs when the distortion is sufficiently
small and \Delta_{a_1} \Delta_{a_2} is sufficiently large, where \Delta_a is
the amplitude of the a-wave component in the TRSB state in the absence of the
distortion. We clarify the manner in which the shift in the relative phase
eliminates S_{a_1 a_2} and prove that such a state yields a free-energy
minimum. We also propose a formula for the upper bound of the degree of lattice
distortion, below which the TRSB state can be stable.

considerable attention in various emerging fields such as wearable computing

these so-called multifunctional materials can undergo large deformations as
high as 600% strain without losing their electrical conductivity. Moreover, the
desperation of conductive liquid-metal inclusions within the entire medium of

foundation of this methodology is based on a key observation - both the maximum

ensuring the normal operation of the network infrastructure. Our proposal
includes an IDS that automatically detects several DDoS attacks, and then as an
attack is detected, it notifies a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller.
The current proposal also downloads some convenient traffic forwarding
decisions from the SDN controller to network devices. The evaluation results
suggest that our proposal timely detects several types of cyber-attacks based
on DDoS, mitigates their negative impacts on the network performance, and
ensures the correct data delivery of normal traffic. Our work sheds light on
the programming relevance over an abstracted view of the network infrastructure

the Weyl nodes into Weyl exceptional rings having multiple topological
structures and no Hermitian counterparts. Recently, it was discovered that
higher-order Weyl semimetals, as a novel class of higher-order topological
phases, can uniquely exhibit coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. However,
non-Hermitian higher-order topological semimetals have not yet been explored.
Here, we identify a new type of topological semimetals, i.e, a higher-order
topological semimetal with Weyl exceptional rings. In such a semimetal, these
rings are characterized by both a spectral winding number and a Chern number.
Moreover, the higher-order Weyl-exceptional-ring semimetal supports both
surface and hinge Fermi-arc states, which are bounded by the projection of the
Weyl exceptional rings onto the surface and hinge, respectively. Noticeably,
the dissipative terms can cause the coupling of two exceptional rings with
opposite topological charges, so as to induce topological phase transitions.
Our studies open new avenues for exploring novel higher-order topological
semimetals in non-Hermitian systems.

anti-correlations with an optical lag of 1 s and X-ray lag of 4 s. This
indicates the two light curves have some common signal components with
different delays. In this study, we extracted and reconstructed those signal
components from the data for GX 339-4. The results confirmed that correlation
and anti-correlation with the optical lag are two common components. However,
we found that the reconstructed light curve for the anti-correlated component
indicates a positively correlated variation with an X-ray lag of ~ +1 s. In
addition, the CCF for this signal component shows anti-correlations not only
with the optical lag, but also with the X-ray lag, which is consistent with the
CCF for the data. Therefore, our results suggest that the combination of the
two positively correlated components, that is, the X-ray preceding signal with
the 0.15-s optical lag and the optical preceding signal with the 1-s X-ray lag,
can make the observed CCF without anti-correlated signals. The optical
preceding signal may be caused by synchrotron emission in a magnetically

define four notions of complexity: Host-Kra complexity, Weyl complexity, true

characteristic factor of the progression, the third one refers to the
smallest-degree Gowers norm controlling the progression, and the fourth one
concerns algebraic relations between terms of the progressions. We conjecture
that these four notions are equivalent, which would give a purely algebraic
criterion for determining the smallest Host-Kra factor or the smallest Gowers
norm controlling a given progression. We prove this conjecture for all
progressions whose terms only satisfy homogeneous algebraic relations and
linear combinations thereof. This family of polynomial progressions includes,
but is not limited to, arithmetic progressions, progressions with linearly
independent polynomials $P_1,\; \ldots,\; P_t$ and progressions whose terms
satisfy no quadratic relations. For progressions that satisfy only linear
relations, such as $$(x,\; x+y^2,\; x+2y^2,\; x+y^3,\; x+2y^3),$$ we derive
several combinatorial and dynamical corollaries: (1) an estimate for the count
of such progressions in subsets of cyclic groups or totally ergodic dynamical

difference result in cyclic groups. Lastly, we show that Weyl complexity and

depth map using very sparse input data. In this paper, we try to solve this
problem in a more effective way, by reformulating the regression-based depth
estimation problem into a combination of depth plane classification and
residual regression. Our proposed approach is to initially densify sparse depth
information by figuring out which plane a pixel should lie among a number of
discretized depth planes, and then calculate the final depth value by
predicting the distance from the specified plane. This will help the network to
lessen the burden of directly regressing the absolute depth information from
none, and to effectively obtain more accurate depth prediction result with less
computation power and inference time. To do so, we firstly introduce a novel
way of interpreting depth information with the closest depth plane label $p$
and a residual value $r$, as we call it, Plane-Residual (PR) representation. We
also propose a depth completion network utilizing PR representation consisting
of a shared encoder and two decoders, where one classifies the pixel's depth
plane label, while the other one regresses the normalized distance from the
classified depth plane. By interpreting depth information in PR representation
and using our corresponding depth completion network, we were able to acquire
improved depth completion performance with faster computation, compared to

the translation quality, deeper and wider architectures are applied to
multilingual modeling for larger model capacity, which suffers from the

recommendation methods usually infer users' personal interest based on their
historical clicked news, and train the news recommendation models by predicting
future news clicks. A core assumption behind these methods is that news click
behaviors can indicate user interest. However, in practical scenarios, beyond
the relevance between user interest and news content, the news click behaviors
may also be affected by other factors, such as the bias of news presentation in
the online platform. For example, news with higher positions and larger sizes
are usually more likely to be clicked. The bias of clicked news may bring
noises to user interest modeling and model training, which may hurt the
performance of the news recommendation model.
  In this paper, we propose a bias-aware personalized news recommendation
method named DebiasRec, which can handle the bias information for more accurate
user interest inference and model training. The core of our method includes a
bias representation module, a bias-aware user modeling module, and a bias-aware
click prediction module. The bias representation module is used to model
different kinds of news bias and their interactions to capture their joint
effect on click behaviors. The bias-aware user modeling module aims to infer
users' debiased interest from the clicked news articles by using their bias
information to calibrate the interest model. The bias-aware click prediction
module is used to train a debiased news recommendation model from the biased
click behaviors, where the click score is decomposed into a preference score
indicating user's interest in the news content and a news bias score inferred
from its different bias features. Experiments on two real-world datasets show
that our method can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation.

approximately periodically (e.g. daily), timing models with significantly
different frequencies (including but not limited to glitch models with
different frequency increments) return near-equivalent timing residuals. The
average scheduling aperiodicity divided by the phase error due to
time-of-arrival uncertainties is a useful indicator of when the degeneracy is
important. Synthetic data are used to explore the effect of this degeneracy
systematically. It is found that phase-coherent tempo2 or temponest-based
approaches are biased sometimes toward reporting small glitch sizes regardless
of the true glitch size. Local estimates of the spin frequency alleviate this
bias. A hidden Markov model is free from bias towards small glitches and
announces explicitly the existence of multiple glitch solutions but sometimes
fails to recover the correct glitch size. Two glitches in the UTMOST public
data release are re-assessed, one in PSR J1709$-$4429 at MJD 58178 and the
other in PSR J1452$-$6036 at MJD 58600. The estimated fractional frequency jump
in PSR J1709$-$4429 is revised upward from $\Delta f/f = (54.6\pm 1.0) \times

insufficient to explore users' preferences. We take inspiration from dynamic

connects different user sequences through a dynamic graph structure, exploring
the interactive behavior of users and items with time and order information.
Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Graph Recommendation Network to extract user's
preferences from the dynamic graph. Consequently, the next-item prediction task
in sequential recommendation is converted into a link prediction between the
user node and the item node in a dynamic graph. Extensive experiments on three

inseparable relationship between production and distribution, economic growth
and inequality. Chapters 3 and 4 argue that despite the fact that the founders
of the neoclassical school had shown an active interest in social issues,

discussed separately among neoclassicals. Toward the end of the 20th century,
however, there was a renewed awareness within economics of the problem of the
relationship between production and distribution. The young Piketty's
beginnings as an economist are set against this backdrop. Chapters 5 to 8

in the comparison of black-box optimization algorithms. Over the years,
research has identified many desired qualities for benchmark suites, such as
diverse topology, different difficulties, scalability, representativeness of
real-world problems among others. However, while the topology characteristics
have been subjected to previous studies, there is no study that has
statistically evaluated the difficulty level of benchmark functions, how well
they discriminate optimization algorithms and how suitable is a benchmark suite
for algorithm comparison. In this paper, we propose the use of an item response
theory (IRT) model, the Bayesian two-parameter logistic model for multiple
attempts, to statistically evaluate these aspects with respect to the empirical
success rate of algorithms. With this model, we can assess the difficulty level
of each benchmark, how well they discriminate different algorithms, the ability
score of an algorithm, and how much information the benchmark suite adds in the
estimation of the ability scores. We demonstrate the use of this model in two
well-known benchmark suites, the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) for
continuous optimization and the Pseudo Boolean Optimization (PBO) for discrete
optimization. We found that most benchmark functions of BBOB suite have high
difficulty levels (compared to the optimization algorithms) and low
discrimination. For the PBO, most functions have good discrimination parameters
but are often considered too easy. We discuss potential uses of IRT in
benchmarking, including its use to improve the design of benchmark suites, to
measure multiple aspects of the algorithms, and to design adaptive suites.

of the Gibbs measures for the gauged equations. These results can be brought
back to the ungauged side by inverting the gauge transformation and exploiting
the invariance of the Gibbs measures under spatial translations. We thus
complete the program initiated by Bourgain (1994) on the invariance of the

an estimator, which determines joint collision points with other agents.

contribution to the perturbative QCD part of the correlation functions.
Compared with the leading order (LO) result, the NLO contribution is found to
be very important to the $\Omega_{QQQ}$. This is because the NLO not only
results in a large correction, but also reduces the parameter dependence,
making the Borel platform more distinct, especially for the $\Omega_{bbb}$ in
the $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ scheme, where the platform appears only at NLO but not
at LO. Particularly, owing to the inclusion of the NLO contribution, the
renormalization schemes ($\bar {MS}$ and On-Shell) dependence and the scale
dependence are significantly reduced. Consequently, after including the NLO
contribution to the perturbative part in the QCD sum rules, the masses are
estimated to be $4.53^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ GeV for $\Omega_{ccc}$ and
$14.27^{+0.33}_{-0.32}$ GeV for $\Omega_{bbb}$, where the results are obtained
at $\mu=M_B$ with errors including those from the variation of the
renormalization scale $\mu$ in the range $(0.8-1.2) M_B$. A careful study of
the $\mu$ dependence in a wide range is further performed, which shows that the
LO results are very sensitive to the choice of $\mu$ whereas the NLO results
are considerably better. In addition to the $\mu=M_B$ result, a more stable
value, (4.75-4.80) GeV, for the $\Omega_{ccc}$ mass is found in the range of
$\mu=(1.2-2.0) M_B$, which should be viewed as a more relevant prediction in

(direct-revelation) mechanism takes agents' reported valuations as input and
outputs an allocation that satisfies a given fairness requirement. A natural
and fundamental open problem, first raised by [Chen et al., 2010] and
subsequently raised by [Procaccia, 2013] [Aziz and Ye, 2014] [Branzei and

(or even proportional) cake cutting mechanism. In this paper, we resolve this
open problem by proving that there does not exist a deterministic, truthful and
proportional cake cutting mechanism, even in the special case where all of the
following hold: 1) there are only two agents; 2) agents' valuations are
piecewise-constant; 3) agents are hungry. The impossibility result extends to
the case where the mechanism is allowed to leave some part of the cake
unallocated.
  We also present a truthful and envy-free mechanism when each agent's
valuation is piecewise-constant and monotone. However, if we require
Pareto-optimality, we show that truthful is incompatible with approximate
proportionality for any positive approximation ratio under this setting.
  To circumvent this impossibility result, motivated by the kind of
truthfulness possessed by the I-cut-you-choose protocol, we propose a weaker
notion of truthfulness: the proportional risk-averse truthfulness. We show that
several well-known algorithms do not have this truthful property. We propose a
mechanism that is proportionally risk-averse truthful and envy-free, and a
mechanism that is proportionally risk-averse truthful that always outputs
allocations with connected pieces.

unlabeled data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional

pretraining a SSL model on pseudo-labels derived from the original signal. This
technique is particularly relevant for speech data where various meaningful
signal processing features may serve as pseudo-labels. However, the process of
selecting pseudo-labels, for speech or other types of data, remains mostly

to substantial computational (hence carbon) costs. Thus, this paper introduces
a practical and theoretical framework to select relevant pseudo-labels with

estimator of the pseudo-label utility grounded in the conditional independence
theory, which does not require any training. The experiments conducted on
speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition validate our estimator,
showing a significant correlation between the performance observed on the

four different antiferromagnetic spintronic states can be achieved: WSs with

state-of-the-art attitude estimators do not generalize well over these

characteristics and circumstances. We propose RIANN, a ready-to-use, neural
network-based, parameter-free, real-time-capable inertial attitude estimator,
which generalizes well across different motion dynamics, environments, and
sampling rates, without the need for application-specific adaptations. We
gather six publicly available datasets of which we exploit two datasets for the
method development and the training, and we use four datasets for evaluation of
the trained estimator in three different test scenarios with varying practical
relevance. Results show that RIANN outperforms state-of-the-art attitude
estimation filters in the sense that it generalizes much better across a
variety of motions and conditions in different applications, with different
sensor hardware and different sampling frequencies. This is true even if the
filters are tuned on each individual test dataset, whereas RIANN was trained on
completely separate data and has never seen any of these test datasets. RIANN
can be applied directly without adaptations or training and is therefore
expected to enable plug-and-play solutions in numerous applications, especially
when accuracy is crucial but no ground-truth data is available for tuning or
when motion and disturbance characteristics are uncertain. We made RIANN
publicly available.

increased popularity. They consist of groups of neurons, called capsules, which
encode properties of objects or object parts. The connections between capsules

approach to overcome such limitations would be to train deeper network
architectures, as it has been done for convolutional neural networks with much

However, many researches indicated that DNN is vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
The attacker can create a hidden backdoor in target DNN model, and trigger the
malicious behaviors by submitting specific backdoor instance. However, almost
all the existing backdoor works focused on the digital domain, while few
studies investigate the backdoor attacks in real physical world. Restricted to
a variety of physical constraints, the performance of backdoor attacks in the
real physical world will be severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a
robust physical backdoor attack method, PTB (physical transformations for
backdoors), to implement the backdoor attacks against deep learning models in
the real physical world. Specifically, in the training phase, we perform a
series of physical transformations on these injected backdoor instances at each
round of model training, so as to simulate various transformations that a
backdoor may experience in real world, thus improves its physical robustness.
Experimental results on the state-of-the-art face recognition model show that,
compared with the backdoor methods that without PTB, the proposed attack method
can significantly improve the performance of backdoor attacks in real physical
world. Under various complex physical conditions, by injecting only a very
small ratio (0.5%) of backdoor instances, the attack success rate of physical
backdoor attacks with the PTB method on VGGFace is 82%, while the attack
success rate of backdoor attacks without the proposed PTB method is lower than
11%. Meanwhile, the normal performance of the target DNN model has not been
affected.

Earth}$), in a quasi-circular orbit with an initial orbital distance between
0.01 and 0.10 au, around a solar-type star evolving from the Pre-Main-Sequence

evolution of: the stellar structure, the stellar angular momentum due to tides
and magnetic braking, the tidal interactions (equilibrium and dynamical tides
in stellar convective zones), the mass-evaporation of the planet, and the
secular evolution of the planetary orbit. We consider that at the beginning of
the evolution, the proto-planetary disk has fully dissipated and planet
formation is complete. Both a rapid initial stellar rotation, and a more
efficient angular momentum transport inside the star, in general, contribute
toward the enlargement of the domain which is devoid of planets after the PMS
phase, in the plane of planet mass vs. orbital distance. Comparisons with the
observed distribution of exoplanets orbiting solar mass stars, in the plane of
planet mass vs. orbital distance (addressing the ""Neptunian desert"" feature),
show an encouraging agreement with the present simulations, especially since no
attempts have been made to fine-tune initial parameters of the models to fit
the observations. We also obtain an upper limit for the orbital period of
bare-core planets, that agrees with observations of the ""radius valley"" feature
in the plane of planet radius vs. orbital period. The two effects, tides and
planet evaporation, should be accounted for simultaneously and in a consistent
way, with a detailed model for the evolution of the star.

shock acceleration in a colliding-wind binary. Our model accounts for the
oblique nature of the global shocks bounding the wind-wind collision region and
the finite velocity of the scattering centres to the gas. It also includes
magnetic field amplification by the cosmic ray induced streaming instability
and the dynamical back reaction of the amplified field. We assume that the
injection of the ions and electrons is independent of the shock obliquity and
that the scattering centres move relative to the fluid at the Alfv\'{e}n
velocity (resulting in steeper non-thermal particle distributions). We find
that the Mach number, Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number, and transverse field strength
vary strongly along and between the shocks, resulting in significant and
non-linear variations in the particle acceleration efficiency and shock nature
(turbulent vs. non-turbulent). We find much reduced compression ratios at the
oblique shocks in most of our models compared to our earlier work, though total
gas compression ratios that exceed 20 can still be obtained in certain
situations. We also investigate the dependence of the non-thermal emission on
the stellar separation and determine when emission from secondary electrons
becomes important. We finish by applying our model to WR 146, one of the
brightest colliding wind binaries in the radio band. We are able to match the
observed radio emission and find that roughly 30 per cent of the wind power at

cosmic microwave background (CMB) is of critical importance for CMB science.
For a general CMB survey, the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator for
CMB polarization has been proved to be the optimal estimator with minimal
uncertainties, but it is computationally very expensive. In this article, we
propose two new QML methods for B-mode power spectrum estimation. We use the
Smith-Zaldarriaga approach to prepare pure-B mode map, and E-mode recycling
method to obtain a leakage free B-mode map. We then use the scalar QML
estimator to analyze the scalar pure-B map (QML-SZ) or B-mode map (QML-TC). The
QML-SZ and QML-TC estimators have similar error bars as the standard QML
estimators but their computational cost is nearly one order of magnitude
smaller. The basic idea is that one can construct the pure B-mode CMB map by
using the E-B separation method proposed by Smith-Zaldarriaga (SZ) or the one
considering the template cleaning (TC) technique, then apply QML estimator to
these scalar fields. By simulating potential observations of space-based and
ground-based detectors, we test the reliability of these estimators by
comparing them with the corresponding results of the traditional QML estimator
and the pure B-mode pseudo-Cl estimator.

continuously leveraging the evolution of network architecture, communication
protocols, next-generation communication techniques (5G, 6G, Wi-Fi 6), and the
internet of things (IoT). However, SCADA system has become the most profitable
and alluring target for ransomware attackers. This paper proposes the deep
learning-based novel ransomware detection framework in the SCADA controlled
electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) with the performance analysis of three
deep learning algorithms, namely deep neural network (DNN), 1D convolution
neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
network. All three-deep learning-based simulated frameworks achieve around 97%
average accuracy (ACC), more than 98% of the average area under the curve
(AUC), and an average F1-score under 10-fold stratified cross-validation with
an average false alarm rate (FAR) less than 1.88%. Ransomware driven
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack tends to shift the SOC profile by
exceeding the SOC control thresholds. The severity has been found to increase
as the attack progress and penetration increases. Also, ransomware driven false
data injection (FDI) attack has the potential to damage the entire BES or
physical system by manipulating the SOC control thresholds. It's a design
choice and optimization issue that a deep learning algorithm can deploy based
on the tradeoffs between performance metrics.

translation is more inferior to what could be achieved with a direct parallel
corpus of a reasonable size for that pair. In a real-time simultaneous
translation setting, the quality of pivot language translation deteriorates
even further given that the model has to output translations the moment a few
source words become available. To solve this issue, we propose multi-pivot
translation and apply it to a simultaneous translation setting involving pivot
languages. Our approach involves simultaneously translating a source language
into multiple pivots, which are then simultaneously translated together into
the target language by leveraging multi-source NMT. Our experiments in a
low-resource setting using the N-way parallel UN corpus for Arabic to English
NMT via French and Spanish as pivots reveals that in a simultaneous pivot NMT

either reflect or propagate inside the plasma depending on whether it is
overdense or underdense. In a magnetised plasma, however, there are usually
several pass and stop bands for the EM wave depending on the orientation of the
magnetic field with respect to the propagation direction. The EM wave while
propagating in a plasma can excite electrostatic disturbances in the plasma [1,
2]. In this work Particle - In - Cell simulations have been carried out to
illustrate the complete transparency of the EM wave propagation inside a
strongly magnetised plasma. The external magnetic field is chosen to be
perpendicular to both the wave propagation direction and the electric field of
the EM wave, which is the X mode configuration. Despite the presence of charged
electron and ion species the plasma medium behaves like a vacuum. The
observation is understood with the help of particle drifts. It is shown that
though the two particle species move under the influence of EM fields their
motion does not lead to any charge or current source to alter the dispersion
relation of the EM wave propagating in the medium. Furthermore, it is also
shown that the stop band for EM wave in this regime shrinks to a zero width as
both the resonance and cut-off points approach each other. Thus transparency to
the EM radiation in such a strongly magnetised case appears to be a norm. This
may have important implications in astrophysical scenarios. For instance, the
plasma surrounding objects like pulsars and magnetars is often threaded with
strong magnetic fields.

remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been developed as an intrinsic liveness
clue for 3D mask PAD without relying on the mask appearance. However, the rPPG
features for 3D mask PAD are still needed expert knowledge to design manually,
which limits its further progress in the deep learning and big data era. In
this letter, we propose a pure rPPG transformer (TransRPPG) framework for

multi-scale spatial-temporal maps (MSTmap) are constructed from facial skin and
background regions. Then the transformer fully mines the global relationship
within MSTmaps for liveness representation, and gives a binary prediction for
3D mask detection. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark
datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the TransRPPG on both intra- and
cross-dataset testings. Our TransRPPG is lightweight and efficient (with only
547K parameters and 763M FLOPs), which is promising for mobile-level

showed a great performance on classifying ECGs from only lead-I compared to
cardiologists. The AI model reached the weighted average precision, recall,
F1-score and total accuracy 94.1%, 93.6%, 93.7% and 93.6% respectively, and the
average of each of the three cardiologists has reached weighted average

accelerate the early detection of AFIB as a cardiologist assistant. It is also
able to identify patients into different risk groups as part of remote patient
monitoring systems.

the regression testing process of complex software systems. Flaky tests
manifest non-deterministic behaviour, send confusing signals to developers, and
break their trust in test suites. Both industrial reports and research studies
highlighted the negative impact of flakiness on software quality and
developers' productivity. While researchers strive to devise solutions that
could help developers addressing test flakiness, the elaboration and assessment
of these solutions are hindered by the lack of datasets large enough to
leverage learning techniques. Aim: To address this lack, we conduct an

tests. Method: We propose an approach that relies on program mutation to inject
flakiness in software tests. In particular, we plan to delete helper statements
from tests to make their outcomes order-dependent, i.e., pass in certain
running orders but fail in other orders. We intend to apply our mutation-based
approach to a set of 14 Java projects to assess the effectiveness of test
mutation in injecting order-dependency and generate a new dataset that could be

In this study, we have presented the implementation of a simple QKD with the
help of a stable transmitter-receiver scheme, which simplifies the
self-alignment and is robust enough to withstand environmental disturbances. In
case of the stability test, the implementation system is able to remain stable
for 48 hours and exhibits an average quantum bit error rate of less than 1\%
without any feedback control. The scheme is also tested over a fiber spool,
obtaining a stable and secure finite key rate of 7.32k bits per second over a

This answers a question of Kang, McDiarmid, Reed and Scott. Using the

question the usefulness of post-processing for contextualized embeddings
obtained from different layers of pre-trained language models. More
specifically, we standardize individual neuron activations using z-score,
min-max normalization, and by removing top principle components using the
all-but-the-top method. Additionally, we apply unit length normalization to
word representations. On a diverse set of pre-trained models, we show that
post-processing unwraps vital information present in the representations for
both lexical tasks (such as word similarity and analogy)and sequence
classification tasks. Our findings raise interesting points in relation to
theresearch studies that use contextualized representations, and suggest
z-score normalization as an essential step to consider when using them in an

individual radioactive particles. PEPT relies on the detection of back-to-back
photon pairs emitted by positron annihilation. It requires an algorithm to
locate the radioactive particles based on the set of lines defined by
successive photon-pair detections. We propose and test a new algorithm for this
task. The algorithm relies on the maximization of a likelihood arising from a
simple Gaussian-mixture model defined in the space of lines. The model includes
a component that accounts for spurious lines caused by scattering and random
coincidence, and treats the relative activity of particles as well as their
positions as parameters to be inferred. Values of these parameters that
approximately maximize the likelihood are computed by application of an
expectation-maximization algorithm. A generalization of the model that includes
the particle velocities and accelerations as additional parameters takes
advantage of the information contained in the exact timing of positron
annihilations to reconstruct pieces of trajectories rather than fixed
positions, with clear benefits.
  We test the algorithm on both simulated and experimental data. The results
show the algorithm to be highly effective for the simultaneous tracking of many
particles (up to 80 in one test). It provides estimates of particle positions
that are easily mapped to entire trajectories and handles a variable number of
particles in the field of view. The ability to track a large number of
particles robustly offers the possibility of a dramatic expansion of the scope
of PEPT

Protectiveness of data is natural in this setting; data is a precious commodity
for data owners, which if used properly can provide them with useful insights
on operations and processes leading to a competitive advantage. Unfortunately,
novel AI technologies often require large amounts of training data in order to
perform well, something that in many scenarios is unrealistic. However, recent
machine learning advances, e.g. federated learning and privacy-preserving

decentralized data, (i.e. data that are not exchanged or shared but remain with
the owners) to develop a cross-silo machine learning model that facilitates
data sharing across supply chains. We focus our data sharing proposition on
improving production optimization through soybean yield prediction, and provide
potential use-cases that such methods can assist in other problem settings. Our
results demonstrate that our approach not only performs better than each of the

deal with this problem in non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., hyperbolic geometry.
Although hyperbolic GCNs achieve promising performance, existing hyperbolic
graph operations actually cannot rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry,
which may limit the ability of hyperbolic geometry and thus hurt the
performance of hyperbolic GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic
GCN named Lorentzian graph convolutional network (LGCN), which rigorously
guarantees the learned node features follow the hyperbolic geometry.
Specifically, we rebuild the graph operations of hyperbolic GCNs with
Lorentzian version, e.g., the feature transformation and non-linear activation.
Also, an elegant neighborhood aggregation method is designed based on the
centroid of Lorentzian distance. Moreover, we prove some proposed graph
operations are equivalent in different types of hyperbolic geometry, which
fundamentally indicates their correctness. Experiments on six datasets show
that LGCN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. LGCN has lower
distortion to learn the representation of tree-likeness graphs compared with

using AO-assisted IFU observations from GEMINI/NIFS. The brighter, blue-shifted
jet is collimated quickly after launch. This early collimation requires the
presence of magnetic fields. We confirm velocity asymmetries between the two
jet lobes, & confirm no time variability in the asymmetry over a 20 year
interval. This sustained asymmetry is in accordance with recent simulations of
magnetised disk-winds. We examine the data for jet rotation. We report an upper
limit on differences in radial velocity of 6.3 & 8.7 km/s for the blue &
red-shifted jets, respectively. Interpreting this as an upper limit on jet
rotation implies that any steady, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal model of jet
launching is constrained to a launch radius in the disk-plane of 0.5 & 0.3 au
for the blue & red-shifted jets, respectively. This supports an X-wind or
narrow disk-wind model. This pertains only to the observed high velocity [FeII]
emission, & does not rule out a wider flow launched from a wider radius. We
report detection of small amplitude jet axis wiggling in both lobes. We rule
out orbital motion of the jet source as the cause. Precession can better
account for the observations but requires double the precession angle, & a
different phase for the counter-jet. Such non-solid body precession could arise
from an inclined massive Jupiter companion, or a warping instability induced by
launching a magnetic disk-wind. Overall, our observations are consistent with
an origin of the DO Tau jets from the inner regions of the disk.

memoryless algorithms [Bubeck et al. 2020]. A memoryless algorithm coincides
with the notion of a selector in functional analysis. The Steiner point is
noted for being Lipschitz with respect to the Hausdorff metric, and for
achieving the minimal Lipschitz constant possible. It is natural to ask whether
every selector with this Lipschitz property yields a competitive algorithm for
nested convex body chasing. We answer this question in the negative by
exhibiting a selector which yields a non-competitive algorithm for nested

stellar multiple systems and the gravitational-wave signals from their inspiral

been interpreted as indication that NS spins are either induced with the NS
kicks or inherited from progenitor rotation, which thus might play a
dynamically important role during stellar collapse. Current three-dimensional
supernova simulations suggest that NS kicks are transferred in the first
seconds of the explosion, mainly by anisotropic mass ejection and, on a
secondary level, anisotropic neutrino emission. In contrast, the NS spins are
only determined minutes to hours later by angular momentum associated with
fallback of matter that does not become gravitationally unbound in the
supernova. Here, we propose a novel scenario to explain spin-kick alignment as
a consequence of tangential vortex flows in the fallback matter that is
accreted mostly from the direction of the NS's motion. For this effect the
initial NS kick is crucial, because it produces a growing offset of the NS away
from the explosion center, thus promoting onesided accretion. In this new
scenario conclusions based on traditional concepts are reversed. For example,
pre-kick NS spins are not required, and rapid progenitor-core rotation can
hamper spin-kick alignment. We also discuss implications for natal BH kicks and
the possibility of tossing the BH's spin axis during its formation.

downstream NLP tasks when used as text encoders. Unfortunately, MLMs also
demonstrate significantly worrying levels of social biases. We show that the
previously proposed evaluation metrics for quantifying the social biases in
MLMs are problematic due to following reasons: (1) prediction accuracy of the
masked tokens itself tend to be low in some MLMs, which raises questions
regarding the reliability of the evaluation metrics that use the (pseudo)
likelihood of the predicted tokens, and (2) the correlation between the
prediction accuracy of the mask and the performance in downstream NLP tasks is
not taken into consideration, and (3) high frequency words in the training data
are masked more often, introducing noise due to this selection bias in the test
cases. To overcome the above-mentioned disfluencies, we propose All Unmasked
Likelihood (AUL), a bias evaluation measure that predicts all tokens in a test
case given the MLM embedding of the unmasked input. We find that AUL accurately
detects different types of biases in MLMs. We also propose AUL with attention
weights (AULA) to evaluate tokens based on their importance in a sentence.
However, unlike AUL and AULA, previously proposed bias evaluation measures for
MLMs systematically overestimate the measured biases, and are heavily
influenced by the unmasked tokens in the context.

growing consensus that Linux containers are a promising solution. However,
existing container build solutions require root privileges and cannot be used
directly on HPC resources. This limitation is compounded as supercomputer
diversity expands and HPC architectures become more dissimilar from commodity
computing resources. Our analysis suggests this problem can best be solved with
low-privilege containers. We detail relevant Linux kernel features, propose a
new taxonomy of container privilege, and compare two open-source
implementations: mostly-unprivileged rootless Podman and fully-unprivileged
Charliecloud. We demonstrate that low-privilege container build on HPC
resources works now and will continue to improve, giving normal users a better
workflow to securely and correctly build containers. Minimizing privilege in
this way can improve HPC user and developer productivity as well as reduce
support workload for exascale applications.

We perform a next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) resummation

visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG

thousands of edge devices to train model locally without uploading data
concentrically to the server. But since real federated settings are
resource-constrained, FL is encountered with systems heterogeneity which causes
a lot of stragglers directly and then leads to significantly accuracy reduction
indirectly. To solve the problems caused by systems heterogeneity, we introduce
a novel self-adaptive federated framework FedSAE which adjusts the training
task of devices automatically and selects participants actively to alleviate
the performance degradation. In this work, we 1) propose FedSAE which leverages
the complete information of devices' historical training tasks to predict the
affordable training workloads for each device. In this way, FedSAE can estimate
the reliability of each device and self-adaptively adjust the amount of
training load per client in each round. 2) combine our framework with Active
Learning to self-adaptively select participants. Then the framework accelerates
the convergence of the global model. In our framework, the server evaluates
devices' value of training based on their training loss. Then the server
selects those clients with bigger value for the global model to reduce
communication overhead. The experimental result indicates that in a highly
heterogeneous system, FedSAE converges faster than FedAvg, the vanilla FL
framework. Furthermore, FedSAE outperforms than FedAvg on several federated
datasets - FedSAE improves test accuracy by 26.7% and reduces stragglers by
90.3% on average.

hosted in an underground infrastructure. Underground sites promise a greatly
reduced contribution of the environment to detector noise thereby opening the
possibility to extend the observation band to frequencies well below 10 Hz. For
this reason, the proposed next-generation infrastructure Einstein Telescope in
Europe would be realized underground aiming for an observation band that
extends from 3 Hz to several kHz. However, it is known that ambient noise in
the low-frequency band 10 Hz - 20 Hz at current surface sites of the Virgo and
LIGO detectors is predominantly produced by the detector infrastructure. It is
of utmost importance to avoid spoiling the quality of an underground site with
noisy infrastructure, at least at frequencies where this noise can turn into a
detector-sensitivity limitation. In this paper, we characterize the KAGRA
underground site to determine the impact of its infrastructure on environmental
fields. We find that while excess seismic noise is observed, its contribution
in the important band below 20 Hz is minor preserving the full potential of
this site to realize a low-frequency gravitational-wave detector. Moreover, we
estimate the Newtonian-noise spectra of surface and underground seismic waves
and of the acoustic field inside the caverns. We find that these will likely
remain a minor contribution to KAGRA's instrument noise in the foreseeable
future.

the reward, in order to directly improve the metric. However, it was reported
that the gain in BLEU does not translate to real quality improvement, limiting
the application in industry. Recently, it became clear to the community that
BLEU has a low correlation with human judgment when dealing with

metrics. These new metrics are shown to have a much higher human correlation.
In this paper, we investigate whether it is beneficial to optimize NMT models

Results show that the reward optimization with BLEURT is able to increase the

PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, a public software package that processes calibrated
interferometric and total power data into science-ready data products.
PHANGS-ALMA is a large, high-resolution survey of CO J=2-1 emission from nearby
galaxies. The observations combine ALMA's main 12-m array, the 7-m array, and
total power observations and use mosaics of dozens to hundreds of individual
pointings. We describe the processing of the u-v data, imaging and
deconvolution, linear mosaicking, combining interferometer and total power
data, noise estimation, masking, data product creation, and quality assurance.
Our pipeline has a general design and can also be applied to VLA and ALMA
observations of other spectral lines and continuum emission. We highlight our
recipe for deconvolution of complex spectral line observations, which combines
multiscale clean, single scale clean, and automatic mask generation in a way
that appears robust and effective. We also emphasize our two-track approach to
masking and data product creation. We construct one set of ""broadly masked""
data products, which have high completeness but significant contamination by
noise, and another set of ""strictly masked"" data products, which have high
confidence but exclude faint, low signal-to-noise emission. Our quality
assurance tests, supported by simulations, demonstrate that 12-m+7-m
deconvolved data recover a total flux that is significantly closer to the total
power flux than the 7-m deconvolved data alone. In the appendices, we measure
the stability of the ALMA total power calibration in PHANGS--ALMA and test the
performance of popular short-spacing correction algorithms.

performance of ML using implicit features did not appear to be superior to ML
using explicit features. There are a range of ML-based solutions poised to
become treatment response monitoring biomarkers for glioblastoma. To achieve

are based on supervised learning applied to the continuous stream of sensors
data. However, these methods perform well on restricted sets of activities in
domains for which there is a fully labeled dataset. It is still a challenge to
cope with the intra- and inter-variability of activity execution among
different subjects in large scale real world deployment. Semi-supervised
learning approaches for HAR have been proposed to address the challenge of
acquiring the large amount of labeled data that is necessary in realistic
settings. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and
privacy problems when the process involves a large number of users. Federated
Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the
FL methods that have been proposed for HAR assume that the participating users
can always obtain labels to train their local models. In this work, we propose
FedHAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and
federated learning. Indeed, FedHAR combines active learning and label
propagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled
sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable
and privacy-aware fashion. FedHAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to
personalize the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two
public datasets, showing that FedHAR reaches recognition rates and
personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised
approaches. As a major advantage, FedHAR only requires a very limited number of
annotated data to populate a pre-trained model and a small number of active
learning questions that quickly decrease while using the system, leading to an
effective and scalable solution for the data scarcity problem of HAR.

investigate an interacting dark energy model in the context of Lyra's geometry.
Pressure-less dust is considered as dark matter, mass of which varies with time
via scalar field in the sense that decaying of dark matter particles reproduces
the scalar field. Here, quintessence scalar field is adopted as dark energy
candidate which evolves in exponential potential. Mass of the dark matter
particles is also considered to be evolved in exponential function of the
scalar field. Cosmological evolution equations are studied in the framework of
dynamical systems analysis. Dimension-less variables are chosen properly so
that the cosmological evolution equations are converted into an autonomous
system of ordinary differential equations. Linear stability is performed to
find the nature of critical points by perturbing the system around the critical
points in the phase space. Classical stability is also executed by finding out
the speed of sound. Dynamical systems explore several viable results which are
physically interested in some parameter regions. Late-time scalar field
dominated attractors are found by critical points, corresponding to the
accelerating universe. Scalar field-displacement vector field scaling solutions
are realized that represent late time decelerated universe. Dark energy -dark
matter scaling solutions are also exhibited by critical points which correspond
to accelerated attractors possessing similar order of energy densities of dark

confidence score, which indicates the reliability of the prediction results, is

known to be overconfident, making it important to calibrate the confidence
score. Many studies have been conducted on confidence calibration. They
calibrate the confidence score of the model to match its accuracy, but it is
not clear whether these confidence scores can improve the performance of
systems that use confidence scores. This paper focuses on cascade inference
systems, one kind of systems using confidence scores, and discusses the desired
confidence score to improve system performance in terms of inference accuracy

calibration method, Learning to Cascade. Learning to Cascade is a simple but
novel method that optimizes the loss term for confidence calibration
simultaneously with the original loss term. Experiments are conducted using two

application of existing calibration methods to cascade inference systems
sometimes performs worse. However, Learning to Cascade always achieves a better
trade-off between inference accuracy and computational cost. The simplicity of

heterogeneity of ESV. Taking Haian city in the Jiangsu province as the study
case, we implemented the proposed dynamic multi-level grids-based (DMLG) to

(BP) measurement is interesting for various reasons. First, PPG can easily be
measured using fingerclip sensors. Second, camera-based approaches allow to
derive remote PPG (rPPG) signals similar to PPG and therefore provide the
opportunity for non-invasive measurements of BP. Various methods relying on
machine learning techniques have recently been published. Performances are
often reported as the mean average error (MAE) on the data which is
problematic. This work aims to analyze the PPG- and rPPG-based BP prediction
error with respect to the underlying data distribution. First, we train
established neural network (NN) architectures and derive an appropriate
parameterization of input segments drawn from continuous PPG signals. Second,
we apply this parameterization to a larger PPG dataset and train NNs to predict
BP. The resulting prediction errors increase towards less frequent BP values.
Third, we use transfer learning to train the NNs for rPPG based BP prediction.
The resulting performances are similar to the PPG-only case. Finally, we apply
a personalization technique and retrain our NNs with subject-specific data.
This slightly reduces the prediction errors.

countries with more COVID-19 cases reported. We performed some experiments in
which we compare state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as LSTM,
against online incremental machine learning algorithms to adapt them to the
daily changes in the spread of the disease and predict future COVID-19 cases.
To compare the methods, we performed three experiments: In the first one, we
trained the models using only data from the country we predicted. In the second
one, we use data from all fifty countries to train and predict each of them. In
the first and second experiment, we used a static hold-out approach for all
methods. In the third experiment, we trained the incremental methods
sequentially, using a prequential evaluation. This scheme is not suitable for
most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms because they need to be
retrained from scratch for every batch of predictions, causing a computational
burden. Results show that incremental methods are a promising approach to adapt
to changes of the disease over time; they are always up to date with the last

computational cost than other techniques such as LSTMs.

concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this

learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a
dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by
malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and
unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to
detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been
trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two
traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a
model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the
participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a
global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large
data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable
positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while
preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized
ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the
federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants
poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model
aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears
highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The
performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is
thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a
significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are
still needed to make federated approaches robust.

been determined by taking advantage of the quantum-chemical computations.To
this aim, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using DFT B3LYP

precise calculations for hydrogen cyanide and its salts containing both light

indicate that while the EA-parameter roughly determines the LD50 values for the
cyanides considered, the omega-descriptor is related rather to the product of
cyanide LD50 and hydrolysis n-degree.Hence,the theoretical LD50CN(omega)
function proposed is interconnected with the nLD50 collective variable, whereas
LD50(EA)directly approximates LD50 indicating that the toxicity of cyanides
decreases with increasing EA, omega-values.The calculations carried out suggest
that some of the LD50(Exp)experimentally determined are incorrect (AgCN) or
inaccurate (Cd(CN)2) and require revision.Comparison of the theoretically
estimated LD50(omega) with NOAEL toxicity parameters indicates that they are
well correlated in contrast to LD50(EA) and LD50(Exp), exhibiting lower and
marginal degrees of correlation, respectively.

describe how we build virtines from the ground up by pushing hardware
virtualization to its limits. Virtines give developers fine-grained control in

that adds extensions to the C language. We present a detailed analysis of the
overheads of running individual functions in isolated VMs, and guided by those
findings, we present Wasp, an embeddable hypervisor that allows programmers to

dynamical computer models (or simulators). The method relies on emulating the
short-time numerical flow map of the system, where the flow map is a function
that returns the solution of a dynamical system at a certain time point, given
initial conditions. In order to predict the model output times series, a single
realisation of the emulated flow map (i.e., its posterior distribution) is
taken and used to iterate from the initial condition ahead in time. Repeating
this procedure with multiple such draws creates a distribution over the time
series whose mean and variance serve as the model output prediction and the
associated uncertainty, respectively. However, since there is no known method
to draw an exact sample from the GP posterior analytically, we approximate the
kernel with random Fourier features and generate approximate sample paths. The
proposed method is applied to emulate several dynamic nonlinear simulators
including the well-known Lorenz and van der Pol models. The results suggest
that our approach has a high predictive performance and the associated
uncertainty can capture the dynamics of the system accurately. Additionally,
our approach has potential for ``embarrassingly"" parallel implementations where
one can conduct the iterative predictions performed by a realisation on a

screening effects are numerically analyzed for the first time using a

frameworks, this approach rigorously models the nonlinear coupling between the
