abruptly forced into working from home. Yet teaching never stopped, and neither
did developing software, fixing software, and expanding into new markets.
Demands for flexible ways of working, responding to new requirements, have
never been so high. How did we manage to continue working, when we had to
suddenly switch all communication to online and virtual forms of contact? In
this short paper we describe how Ocuco Ltd., a medium-sized organization
headquartered in Ireland, managed our software development teams--distributed
throughout Ireland, Europe, Asia and America during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
describe how we expanded, kept our customers happy, and our teams motivated. We
made changes, some large, such as providing emergency financial support; others
small, like implementing regular online social pizza evenings. Technology and
process changes were minor, an advantage of working in globally distributed
teams since 2016, when development activities were coordinated according to the
Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). The results of implementing the changes were
satisfying; productivity went up, we gained new customers, and preliminary
results from our wellness survey indicate that everyone feels extremely
well-supported by management to achieve their goals. However, the anonymised
survey responses did show some developers' anxiety levels were slightly raised,
and many are working longer hours. Administering this survey is very
beneficial, as now we know, so we can act.

regularization for deep learning and is essentially important for both
optimization and generalization of deep networks. Some works attempted to
artificially simulate SGN by injecting random noise to improve deep learning.
However, it turned out that the injected simple random noise cannot work as
well as SGN, which is anisotropic and parameter-dependent. For simulating SGN
at low computational costs and without changing the learning rate or batch
size, we propose the Positive-Negative Momentum (PNM) approach that is a
powerful alternative to conventional Momentum in classic optimizers. The
introduced PNM method maintains two approximate independent momentum terms.
Then, we can control the magnitude of SGN explicitly by adjusting the momentum
difference. We theoretically prove the convergence guarantee and the
generalization advantage of PNM over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By
incorporating PNM into the two conventional optimizers, SGD with Momentum and
Adam, our extensive experiments empirically verified the significant advantage
of the PNM-based variants over the corresponding conventional Momentum-based
optimizers.

to several atomic species, in particular to the case of Lanthanides such as Er,
Dy, and fermionic Yb, but also to alkali-earth metals such as fermionic Sr. We

achieved remarkable performance for the separate tasks of AEC and residual echo

recurrent network (FCRN) structure, which has already proven its performance on
both noise suppression and AEC tasks, individually. However, the combination of
AEC, postfiltering, and noise suppression to a single network typically leads
to a noticeable decline in the quality of the near-end speech component due to
the lack of a separate loss for echo estimation. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage model (Y$^2$-Net) which consists of two FCRNs, each with two inputs

as a novelty for a DNN AEC model - is further used by the second stage to
perform RES and noise suppression. While the subjective listening test of the
Interspeech 2021 AEC Challenge mostly yielded results close to the baseline,

interest, and often lead to unique applications. The most well known example --
superconductivity -- is caused by the formation and condensation of pairs of
electrons. A key property of superconductors is diamagnetism: magnetic fields
are screened by dissipationless currents. Fundamentally, what distinguishes
superconducting states from normal states is a spontaneously broken symmetry
corresponding to long-range coherence of fermion pairs. Here we report a set of
experimental observations in hole doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ which are
not consistent with conventional superconducting behavior. Our specific-heat
measurements indicate the formation of fermionic bound states when the
temperature is lowered from the normal state. However, for $x \sim 0.8$,
instead of the standard for superconductors, zero resistance and diamagnetic
screening, for a range of temperatures, we observe the opposite effect: the
generation of self-induced magnetic fields measured by spontaneous Nernst
effect and muon spin rotation experiments. The finite resistance and the lack
of any detectable diamagnetic screening in this state exclude the spontaneously
broken symmetry associated with superconducting two-fermion correlations.
Instead, combined evidence from transport and thermodynamic measurements
indicates that the formation of fermionic bound states leads to spontaneous
breaking of time-reversal symmetry above the superconducting transition
temperature. These results demonstrate the existence of a
broken-time-reversal-symmetry bosonic metal state. In the framework of a
multiband theory, such a state is characterized by quartic correlations: the
long-range order exists only for {\it pairs} of fermion pairs.

LP 119-10 was also observed by the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)
space telescope in 120-second cadence mode.
  Methods. We performed standard Fourier analysis of the daily, weekly, and the
whole data sets, together with test data of different combinations of weekly
observations. We then performed asteroseismic fits utilising the observed and
the calculated pulsation periods. For the calculations of model grids necessary
for the fits, we applied the 2018 version of the White Dwarf Evolution Code.
  Results. We derived six possible pulsation modes for PM J22299+3024, and five
plus two TESS pulsation frequencies for LP 119-10. Note that further pulsation
frequencies may be present in the data sets, but we found their detection
ambiguous, so we omitted them from the final frequency list. Our asteroseismic
fits of PM J22299+3024 give 11 400 K and 0.46 Msun for the effective
temperature and the stellar mass. The temperature is ~800 K higher, while the
mass of the model star is exactly the same as it was earlier derived by
spectroscopy. Our model fits of LP~119-10 put the effective temperature in the
range of 11 800 - 11 900 K, which is again higher than the spectroscopic 11 290
K value, while our best model solutions give M* = 0.70 Msun mass for this
target, near to the spectroscopic value of 0.65 Msun, likewise in the case of
PM J22299+3024. The seismic distances of our best-fitting model stars agree
with the Gaia astrometric distances of PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10 within the
errors, validating our model results.

typically makes a model of a system incomplete (i.e., partial) until a more
advanced and complete stage of development is reached. Existing model execution
approaches (interpretation of models or code generation) do not support the
execution of partial models. Supporting the execution of partial models at the
early stages of software development allows early detection of defects, which
can be fixed more easily and at a lower cost. This paper proposes a conceptual
framework for the execution of partial models, which consists of three steps:
static analysis, automatic refinement, and input-driven execution. First, a
static analysis that respects the execution semantics of models is applied to
detect problematic elements of models that cause problems for the execution.
Second, using model transformation techniques, the models are refined
automatically, mainly by adding decision points where missing information can
be supplied. Third, refined models are executed, and when the execution reaches
the decision points, it uses inputs obtained either interactively or by a
script that captures how to deal with partial elements. We created an execution
engine called PMExec for the execution of partial models of UML-RT (i.e., a
modeling language for the development of soft real-time systems) that embodies
our proposed framework. We evaluated PMExec based on several use-cases that
show that the static analysis, refinement, and application of user input can be
carried out with reasonable performance and that the overhead of approach,
which is mostly due to the refinement and the increase in model complexity it
causes, is manageable. We also discuss the properties of the refinement
formally and show how the refinement preserves the original behaviors of the
model.

indistinguishable from real images in the RGB pixel space. Recent works have
observed that CNN-generated images share a systematic shortcoming in
replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Furthermore,
these works have successfully exploited this systematic shortcoming to detect
CNN-generated images reporting up to 99% accuracy across multiple
state-of-the-art GAN models.
  In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that
CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay
consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency
spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted
experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show
that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change
in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this
counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics
detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes
for CNN-generated image detection.
  Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay
discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based
generative models--contrary to the belief of some existing work--, and such
features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection. Our results
prompt re-thinking of using high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes

learning idea. However, most of them use a post-processing algorithm called
Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) only during inference. While there were attempts
to include NMS in the training pipeline for tasks such as 2D object detection,
they have been less widely adopted due to a non-mathematical expression of the
NMS. In this paper, we present and integrate GrooMeD-NMS -- a novel Grouped
Mathematically Differentiable NMS for monocular 3D object detection, such that
the network is trained end-to-end with a loss on the boxes after NMS. We first
formulate NMS as a matrix operation and then group and mask the boxes in an
unsupervised manner to obtain a simple closed-form expression of the NMS.
GrooMeD-NMS addresses the mismatch between training and inference pipelines
and, therefore, forces the network to select the best 3D box in a
differentiable manner. As a result, GrooMeD-NMS achieves state-of-the-art
monocular 3D object detection results on the KITTI benchmark dataset performing
comparably to monocular video-based methods. Code and models at

Mach-Zehnder interferometer employing strong (macroscopic) classic light can be
greatly enhanced with the addition of a weak (microscopic) light field in a
non-classical state. The resulting precision is much greater than that possible
with either the macroscopic classical or microscopic quantum states alone. In
the context of quantifying non-classicality, the amount by which a
non-classical state can enhance precision in this way has been termed its
""metrological power"". Given the technological difficulty of producing
high-amplitude non-classical states of light, this use of non-classical light
is likely to provide a technological advantage much sooner than the Heisenberg
scaling employing much stronger non-classical states. To date, the enhancement
provided by weak nonclassical states has been calculated only for specific
measurement configurations. Here we are able to optimize over all measurement
configurations to obtain the maximum enhancement that can be achieved by any
single or multi-mode nonclassical state together with strong classical states,
for local and distributed quantum metrology employing any linear or nonlinear
single-mode unitary transformation. Our analysis reveals that the quantum
Fisher information for \textit{quadrature displacement sensing} is the sole
property that determines the maximum achievable enhancement in all of these
different scenarios, providing a unified quantification of the metrological
power. It also reveals that the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is an optimal
network for phase sensing for an arbitrary single-mode nonclassical input
state, and how the Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be extended to make optimal
use of any multi-mode nonclassical state for metrology.

  Optimization","28 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.NI cs.SI cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Payment channel networks (PCNs) have emerged as a scalability solution for
blockchains built on the concept of a payment channel: a setting that allows
two nodes to safely transact between themselves in high frequencies based on
pre-committed peer-to-peer balances. Transaction requests in these networks may
be declined because of unavailability of funds due to temporary uneven
distribution of the channel balances. In this paper, we investigate how to
alleviate unnecessary payment blockage via proper prioritization of the
transaction execution order. Specifically, we consider the scheduling problem
in PCNs: as transactions continuously arrive on both sides of a channel, nodes
need to decide which ones to process and when in order to maximize their
objective, which in our case is the channel throughput. We introduce a
stochastic model to capture the dynamics of a payment channel under random
arrivals, and propose that channels can hold incoming transactions in buffers
up to some deadline in order to enable more elaborate processing decisions. We
describe a policy that maximizes the channel success rate/throughput for
uniform transaction requests of fixed amounts, both in the presence and absence
of buffering capabilities, and formally prove its optimality. We also develop a
discrete event simulator of a payment channel, and evaluate different heuristic
scheduling policies in the more general heterogeneous amounts case, with the
results showing superiority of the heuristic extension of our policy in this
case as well. Our work opens the way for more formal research on improving PCN
performance via joint consideration of routing and scheduling decisions.

potential in combination with magnetic field measurements by MAG to study
fields and density fluctuations in the solar wind observed by Solar Orbiter

particular we use the polarization of the wave magnetic field, the phase
between the compressible magnetic field and density fluctuations and the
compressibility ratio (the ratio of the normalized density fluctuations to the
normalized compressible fluctuations of B) to characterize the observed waves
and turbulence. We find that the density fluctuations are out-of-phase with the
compressible component of magnetic fluctuations for intervals of turbulence,
while they are in phase for the circular-polarized waves around the proton
cyclotron frequency. We analyze in detail two specific events with simultaneous
presence of left- and right-handed waves at different frequencies. We compare
observed wave properties to a prediction of the three-fluid (electrons, protons
and alphas) model. We find a limit on the observed wavenumbers, $10^{-6} < k <
7 \times 10^{-6}$~m$^{-1}$, which corresponds to wavelength $7 \times 10^6
>\lambda > 10^6$~m. We conclude that most likely both the left- and

implement than Galerkin methods because the elements of the discretization

matrix assembly also requires fewer computations. However, collocation methods
typically yield slower convergence rates and less robustness, compared to
Galerkin methods. We explore the extent to which oversampled collocation can
improve both robustness and convergence rates. We show that in some cases
convergence rates can actually be higher than the corresponding Galerkin
method, although this requires oversampling at a faster than linear rate. In
most cases of practical interest, oversampling at least lowers the error by a
constant factor. This can still be a substantial improvement: we analyze an
example where linear oversampling by a constant factor $J$ (leading to a
rectangular system of size $JN \times N$) improves the error at a cubic rate in
the constant $J$. Furthermore, the oversampled collocation method is much less
affected by a poor choice of collocation points, as we show how oversampling
can lead to guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments are included for the

reported all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental results.
The mechanical properties of dsDNA ($L_p$ $\sim$ 50nm, $\gamma \sim$ 800-1500

oxDNA are in very good agreement with the all-atom MD and experimental values,
while the stiff elastic network Martini reproduces order of magnitude higher
values of $L_p$ and $\gamma$. The high flexibility of small dsDNA is also
depicted in our calculations. However, Martini models proved inadequate to
capture the salt concentration effects on the mechanical properties with
increasing salt molarity. OxDNA captures the salt concentration effect on small
dsDNA mechanics. But it is found to be ineffective to reproduce the
salt-dependent mechanical properties of DNTs. Also, unlike Martini, the time

detection. We define a new scale-aware search space, where both image- and
box-level augmentations are designed for maintaining scale invariance. Upon
this search space, we propose a new search metric, termed Pareto Scale Balance,
to facilitate search with high efficiency. In experiments, Scale-aware AutoAug
yields significant and consistent improvement on various object detectors
(e.g., RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and FCOS), even compared with
strong multi-scale training baselines. Our searched augmentation policies are
transferable to other datasets and box-level tasks beyond object detection
(e.g., instance segmentation and keypoint estimation) to improve performance.
The search cost is much less than previous automated augmentation approaches
for object detection. It is notable that our searched policies have meaningful

we consider a static failure scenario. In this context, we aim at minimizing
the number of probes to obtain failure identification. To face this problem, we
propose a progressive approach to failure localization based on stochastic
optimization, whose solution is the optimal sequence of monitoring paths to
probe.
  We address the complexity of the problem by proposing a greedy strategy in
two variants: one considers exact calculation of posterior probabilities of
node failures, given the observation, whereas the other approximates these
values by means of a novel failure centrality metric. Secondly, we adapt these
two strategies to a dynamic failure scenario where nodes states can change
throughout a monitoring period. By means of numerical experiments conducted on
real network topologies, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our
approach. Our performance evaluation evidences the superiority of our
algorithms with respect to state of the art solutions based on classic Boolean

examined using Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models. The observations
of the stealth CME at the Sun are compared with the magnetic field measured by

computation. Existing quantum circuit simulators do not address the common
traits of variational algorithms, namely: 1) their ability to work with noisy

such as the combined thermal and electrical history and the electrode type have
been selected in order to correlate the polarization mechanisms revealed by
TSDC with the charge profile measured by PEA in five different cases. Existing
deconvolution procedures for PEA have been improved as a means to enhance the
calibration of PEA signals in the case of thin samples. Samples where the
$\alpha$ dipolar relaxation or the $\rho$ space charge relaxation is activated
show a uniform polarization that manifests itself as image charge at the
electrodes. In the experiments where external charge carriers are injected into
the sample, the same poling procedure has been tested under different electrode
configurations. Charge profiles are qualitatively similar in all of them but
the depolarization currents show clearly different behavior. These differences
are explained, on the one hand, by the different blocking behavior of
vacuum-deposited aluminum electrodes with regards to electrodes with a thin air
gap and, on the other hand, by the distinct behavior of electrodes with an air
gap for both directions of the charge carriers. Numerical analysis of the
polarization of TSDC peaks and charge per unit area of charge profiles supports
this interpretation and confirms the relationship between both measurement
techniques. All in all, PEA in combination with TSDC turns out to be a useful
technique in the study of thermally poled electrets, either in the study of
relaxations or of external charge.

half-space coated by two hyperelastic layers when the composite structure is
subjected to a uniaxial compression. In the case of a half-space coated with a
{\it single} layer, it is known that when the shear modulus $\mu_f$ of the
layer is larger than the shear modulus $\mu_s$ of the half-space, a linear
analysis predicts the existence of a critical stretch and wave number, whereas
a weakly nonlinear analysis predicts the existence of a threshold value of the
modulus ratio $\mu_s/\mu_f\approx 0.57$ below which the buckling is
super-critical and above which the buckling is sub-critical. It is shown in
this paper that when another layer is added, a larger variety of behaviour can
be observed. For instance, buckling can occur at a preferred wavenumber
super-critically even if both layers are softer than the half-space although
the top layer would need to be harder than the bottom layer. When the shear
modulus of the bottom layer lies in a certain interval, the super-critical to
sub-critical transition can happen a number of times as the shear modulus of
the top layer is increased gradually. Thus, an extra layer imparts more
flexibility in producing wrinkling patterns with desired properties, and our
weakly nonlinear analysis provides a road map on the parameter regimes where
this can be achieved.

particles undergoing condensational and collisional growth, interacting with a
fluid flow and subject to chemical composition changes. It is intended to serve
as a building block for process-level as well as computational-fluid-dynamics
simulation systems involving representation of a continuous phase (air) and a
dispersed phase (aerosol), with PySDM being responsible for representation of
the dispersed phase. The PySDM package core is a Pythonic high-performance
implementation of the Super-Droplet Method (SDM) Monte-Carlo algorithm for
representing collisional growth, hence the name. PySDM has two alternative
parallel number-crunching backends available: multi-threaded CPU backend based
on Numba and GPU-resident backend built on top of ThrustRTC. The usage examples
are built on top of four simple atmospheric cloud modelling frameworks: box,
adiabatic parcel, single-column and 2D prescribed flow kinematic models. In
addition, the package ships with tutorial code depicting how PySDM can be used
from Julia and Matlab.

transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of
deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not
saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on
Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA

both linear and non-linear dependencies that could occur instantaneously or
after some delay(lagged dependence). Examples for studying dependence between

become vital to develop the capability to detect the objects in their

from other flying drones. The erratic movement of the source and target drones,
small size, arbitrary shape, large intensity variations, and occlusion make
this problem quite challenging. In this scenario, region-proposal based methods
are not able to capture sufficient discriminative foreground-background
information. Also, due to the extremely small size and complex motion of the
source and target drones, feature aggregation based methods are unable to
perform well. To handle this, instead of using region-proposal based methods,
we propose to use a two-stage segmentation-based approach employing
spatio-temporal attention cues. During the first stage, given the overlapping
frame regions, detailed contextual information is captured over convolution
feature maps using pyramid pooling. After that pixel and channel-wise attention
is enforced on the feature maps to ensure accurate drone localization. In the
second stage, first stage detections are verified and new probable drone
locations are explored. To discover new drone locations, motion boundaries are
used. This is followed by tracking candidate drone detections for a few frames,
cuboid formation, extraction of the 3D convolution feature map, and drones
detection within each cuboid. The proposed approach is evaluated on two
publicly available drone detection datasets and outperforms several competitive
baselines.

decomposition of the closest lenticular galaxy, NGC 3115, resulting in the
description of its stellar light into several main components: a bulge, a thin
disc, a thick disc and also evidence of a bar. We report the finding of central
bluer stellar populations in the bulge, as compared to the colour of the galaxy
outskirts, indicating either the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
and/or recent star formation activity. From the spectral energy distribution
results, we show that the galaxy has a low luminosity AGN component, but even
excluding the effect of the nuclear activity, the bulge is still bluer than the
outer-regions of the galaxy, revealing a recent episode of star formation.
Based on all of the derived properties, we propose a scenario for the formation
of NGC 3115 consisting of an initial gas-rich merger, followed by accretions
and feedback that quench the galaxy, until a recent encounter with the
companion KK084 that reignited the star formation in the bulge, provoked a core
displacement in NGC 3115 and generated spiral-like features. This result is
consistent with the two-phase formation scenario, proposed in previous studies

a co-moving entanglement entropy, and was argued to resolve the information
paradox for a black hole living in the cosmology. In this paper, we show that
the Dirichlet prescription leads to reasonable results, when applied to a
recently studied wedge holography set up with a gravitating bath. The nature of
the information paradox and its resolution in our Dirichlet problem have a
natural understanding in terms of the strength of gravity on the two branes and
at the anchoring location. By sliding the anchor to the defect, we demonstrate
that the limit where gravity decouples from the anchor is continuous -- in
other words, as far as island physics is considered, weak gravity on the anchor
is identical to no gravity. The weak and (moderately) strong gravity regions on
the brane are separated by a ""Dirichlet wall"". We find an intricate interplay
between various extremal surfaces, with an island coming to the rescue whenever
there is an information paradox. This is despite the presence of massless
gravitons in the spectrum. The overall physics is consistent with the slogan
that gravity becomes ""more holographic"", as it gets stronger. Our observations
strengthen the case that the conventional Page curve is indeed of significance,

decomposition of the conductivity tensors by identifying intra- and interband
contributions as well as symmetric and antisymmetric contributions under the
exchange of the current and the electric field directions. Using these
criteria, we find that the symmetric interband contribution of
$\sigma^{\alpha\beta}$ is connected to the quantum metric, whereas the
antisymmetric part involves the Berry curvature and captures the intrinsic
anomalous Hall effect. We include a phenomenological relaxation rate $\Gamma$
of arbitrary size to study the relevance of the interband contributions
systematically.
  Our conductivity formulas are applied to models and experiments of recent
interest. We identify typical scaling behaviors of the conductivities with
respect to $\Gamma$ in agreement with theoretical and experimental results.
Recent experiments on hole-doped cuprates under very high magnetic fields show
a drastic change of the Hall number when entering the pseudogap regime, which
is shown to be consistent with the onset of spiral magnetic order. We analyze
the experimental results with our formulas of the longitudinal and the Hall
conductivity and clarify the validity of the broadly used Boltzmann-like
conductivity formulas.

proposed for training neural networks with certifiable robustness guarantees.
Despite that state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including interval bound

standard neural network training, they usually use a long warmup schedule with
hundreds or thousands epochs to reach SOTA performance and are thus still
costly. In this paper, we identify two important issues in existing methods,
namely exploded bounds at initialization, and the imbalance in ReLU activation

difficult and unstable, and thereby long warmup schedules were needed in prior
works. To mitigate these issues and conduct faster certified training with
shorter warmup, we propose three improvements based on IBP training: 1) We
derive a new weight initialization method for IBP training; 2) We propose to
fully add Batch Normalization (BN) to each layer in the model, since we find BN
can reduce the imbalance in ReLU activation states; 3) We also design
regularization to explicitly tighten certified bounds and balance ReLU

synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the
two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our

3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to
the image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporating
such a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Current
approaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera pose
ranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-world
data, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our key
hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator
leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we
propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading
to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from
raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative

the effects of generic local or short-range electronic interactions in

quasiparticles display linear and biquadratic band touching, leading to
linearly vanishing and constant DOS. Consequently, the former system remains
stable for weak enough local interactions, and supports a variety of ordered
phases only beyond a critical strength of interactions. By contrast, ordered
phases can nucleate for sufficiently weak interactions in bilayer graphene. By
tuning the strength of all symmetry allowed local interactions, we construct
various cuts of the phase diagram at zero and finite temperature and chemical
doping. Typically, at zero doping insulating phases (such as
charge-density-wave, antiferromagnet, quantum anomalous and spin Hall
insulators) prevail at the lowest temperature, while gapless nematic or smectic
liquids stabilize at higher temperatures. On the other hand, at finite doping
the lowest temperature ordered phase is occupied by a superconductor. Besides
anchoring such an organizing principle among the candidate ordered phases, we
also establish a selection rule between them and the interaction channel
responsible for the breakdown of linear or biquadrtic chiral nodal Fermi
liquid. In addition, we also demonstrate the role of the normal state band
structure in selecting the pattern of symmetry breaking from a soup of
preselected incipient competing orders. As a direct consequence of the
selection rule, while an antiferromagnetic phase develops in undoped monolayer

condensation of a spin-singlet nematic (translational symmetry breaking
Kekul\'e) superconductor in doped monolayer (bilayer) graphene, when the on

two input images, is a key ingredient in state-of-the-art optical flow
approaches. When sampling for correspondences to build the cost volume, a large
neighborhood radius is required to deal with large displacements, introducing a
significant computational burden. To address this, a sequential strategy is
usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a
small radius suffices. However, such sequential approaches, instantiated by
either a pyramid structure over a deep neural network's feature hierarchy or by
a recurrent neural network, are slow due to the inherent need for sequential
processing of cost volumes. In this paper, we propose dilated cost volumes to
capture small and large displacements simultaneously, allowing optical flow
estimation without the need for the sequential estimation strategy. To process
the cost volume to get pixel-wise optical flow, existing approaches employ 2D
or separable 4D convolutions, which we show either suffer from high GPU memory
consumption, inferior accuracy, or large model size. Therefore, we propose
using 3D convolutions for cost volume filtering to address these issues. By
combining the dilated cost volumes and 3D convolutions, our proposed model

generates clusters that may be connected to others depending on their proximity

deep optical images of the Fornax Deep Survey, combined with public

radius of the galaxy cluster. Our search is complete down to magnitude m$_g$ =

as well as to resum the leading twist singular structure for both quark and
gluon jets, including transverse spin contributions, as required for
phenomenological applications. Finally, we briefly comment on the transverse
spin structure at higher twists, and show that to all orders in the twist
expansion the highest transverse spin contributions are universal between quark
and gluon jets, and are descendants of the leading twist transverse spin-2
operator, allowing their resummation into a simple two-dimensional Euclidean
conformal block. Due to the general applicability of our results to arbitrary
correlation functions of energy flow operators, we anticipate that they can be
widely applied to improving our understanding of jet substructure at the LHC.

from its kinematics is substantially lower than expected from LCDM cosmological
simulations. We use N-body simulations to examine whether this may be the
result of Galactic tides. We find that, despite improved proper motions from
the Gaia mission, the pericentric distance of Fornax remains poorly
constrained, mainly because its largest velocity component is roughly
anti-parallel to the solar motion. Translating Fornax's proper motion into a
Galactocentric velocity is thus sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed
distance: the observed distance uncertainty, $\pm 8\%$, implies pericentric
distances that vary between $r_{\rm peri}\sim 50$ and $r_{\rm peri}\sim 150$
kpc. Our simulations show that for $r_{\rm peri}$ in the lower range of that
estimate, a LCDM subhalo with maximum circular velocity $V_{\rm max}=40$ km
s$^{-1}$ (or virial mass $M_{200}\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$, as expected from
LCDM) would be tidally stripped to $V_{\rm max} \sim 23$ km s$^{-1}$ over $10$
Gyr. This would reduce the DM mass within the Fornax stellar half-mass radius
to about half its initial value, bringing it into agreement with observations.
Tidal stripping affects mainly Fornax's DM halo; its stellar component is
affected little, losing less than $5\%$ of its initial mass in the process. We
also explore the effect of Galactic tides on the dynamical friction decay times
of Fornax's population of globular clusters (GC) and find little evidence for
substantial changes, compared with models run in isolation. A population of GCs
with initial orbital radii between $1$ and $2$ kpc is consistent with the
present-day spatial distribution of Fornax GCs, despite assuming a cuspy halo.
Neither the DM content nor the spatial distribution of GCs seem inconsistent
with a simple model where Fornax inhabits a tidally-stripped cuspy cold DM
halo.

model of dynamical friction (DF) from collisionless particles, black holes can
effectively sink close to the galaxy center, provided that the black hole's
dynamical mass is at least twice that of the lowest mass resolution particles
in the simulation. Gas drag also plays a role in assisting the black holes'
orbital decay, but it is typically less effective than that from collisionless
particles, especially after the first billion years of the black hole's
evolution. DF from gas becomes less than $1\%$ of DF from collisionless

then refined to a final scene generation with an attention-based refinement
that can effectively select the most consistent set of geometry from the

transfer of coherent structures and local detail from train scene geometry. We
demonstrate our neural scene reconstruction with a database for the tasks of 3D

quantum technologies. Here, we discuss the approach to the continuum limit for
$U(1)$ gauge theories regularized via finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of
quantum spin-$S$ operators, known as quantum link models. For quantum
electrodynamics (QED) in one spatial dimension, we numerically demonstrate the
continuum limit by extrapolating the ground state energy, the scalar, and the
vector meson masses to large spin lengths $S$, large volume $N$, and vanishing
lattice spacing $a$. By exactly solving Gauss' law for arbitrary $S$, we obtain
a generalized PXP spin model and count the physical Hilbert space dimension
analytically. This allows us to quantify the required resources for reliable
extrapolations to the continuum limit on quantum devices. We use a functional
integral approach to relate the model with large values of half-integer spins
to the physics at topological angle $\Theta=\pi$. Our findings indicate that
quantum devices will in the foreseeable future be able to quantitatively probe
the QED regime with quantum link models.

We propose a scenario where dark matter in the Milky Way halo gets boosted as a

interaction can accelerate the dark-matter to semi-relativistic velocities, and
this flux, in turn, can scatter with the electrons in the detector, thereby
providing a much better fit to the data. We identify regions in the parameter

bounds on the dark-matter scattering cross-section, which are competitive with

recently identified by their colours. The so-called blue binaries are
unanimously members of the less red compositional class, and exhibit a 100%

classical region during Neptune's phases of outward migration. The presence of
these binary systems implies that the majority of objects that formed near the
cold classical region formed as binaries. Here we present new optical colour
measurements of cold classical KBOs from the Colours of the Outer Solar System

binaries and singles sample share the same colour distribution. From the
Anderson-Darling statistic, this probability is only a 0.3%, while it is only
0.002% when utilizing the difference of means statistic. We find a hint that
the blue binaries have inflated free inclinations compared to their red

training a super-network, training and evaluating sampled deep neural networks
(DNNs), and training the discovered DNN. Most of the existing efforts speed up
some steps at the cost of a significant slowdown of other steps or sacrificing
the support of non-differentiable search metrics. The unbalanced reduction in
the time spent per step limits the total search time reduction, and the
inability to support non-differentiable search metrics limits the performance
of discovered DNNs.
  In this paper, we present NetAdaptV2 with three innovations to better balance
the time spent for each step while supporting non-differentiable search
metrics. First, we propose channel-level bypass connections that merge network
depth and layer width into a single search dimension to reduce the time for
training and evaluating sampled DNNs. Second, ordered dropout is proposed to
train multiple DNNs in a single forward-backward pass to decrease the time for
training a super-network. Third, we propose the multi-layer coordinate descent
optimizer that considers the interplay of multiple layers in each iteration of
optimization to improve the performance of discovered DNNs while supporting
non-differentiable search metrics. With these innovations, NetAdaptV2 reduces
the total search time by up to $5.8\times$ on ImageNet and $2.4\times$ on NYU
Depth V2, respectively, and discovers DNNs with better
accuracy-latency/accuracy-MAC trade-offs than state-of-the-art NAS works.
Moreover, the discovered DNN outperforms NAS-discovered MobileNetV3 by 1.8%

horizon length $T$, a non-decreasing vector of knapsack sizes $(c_1, \ldots,

list of $n$ items. Each item is a triple $(r, q, d)$ where $r$ denotes the

where the capacity constraints are allowed to be violated by paying a penalty
that is linear in the violation. The goal is to maximize the total profit,

classification problems. Also, it is observed that success rates obtained with
DNNs are higher than those obtained with traditional neural networks. In
addition, one of the advantages of DNNs is that there is no need to spend an
extra effort to determine the features; the CNN automatically extracts the
features from the dataset during the training. Besides their benefits, the DNNs
have the following three major drawbacks among the others: (i) Researchers have
struggled with over-fitting and under-fitting issues in the training of DNNs,
(ii) determination of even a coarse structure for the DNN may take days, and
(iii) most of the time, the proposed network structure is too large to be too
bulky to be used in real time applications. We have modified the training and
structure of DNN to increase the classification performance, to decrease the
number of nodes in the structure, and to be used with less number of hyper
parameters. A minimum distance network (MDN) following the last layer of the
convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as the classifier instead of a fully
connected neural network (FCNN). In order to strengthen the training of the
CNN, we suggest employing Walsh function. We tested the performances of the
proposed DNN (named as DivFE) on the classification of ECG, EEG, heart sound,
detection pneumonia in X-ray chest images, detection of BGA solder defects, and
patterns of benchmark datasets (MNIST, IRIS, CIFAR10 and CIFAR20). In different

spatio-temporal models for traffic forecasting have drawn significant attention
in recent years. Most of the recent works employed graph neural networks(GNN)
with multiple layers to capture the spatial dependency. However, road junctions
with different hop-distance can carry distinct traffic information which should
be exploited separately but existing multi-layer GNNs are incompetent to
discriminate between their impact. Again, to capture the temporal
interrelationship, recurrent neural networks are common in state-of-the-art
approaches that often fail to capture long-range dependencies. Furthermore,
traffic data shows repeated patterns in a daily or weekly period which should
be addressed explicitly. To address these limitations, we have designed a
Simplified Spatio-temporal Traffic forecasting GNN(SST-GNN) that effectively
encodes the spatial dependency by separately aggregating different neighborhood
representations rather than with multiple layers and capture the temporal
dependency with a simple yet effective weighted spatio-temporal aggregation
mechanism. We capture the periodic traffic patterns by using a novel position
encoding scheme with historical and current data in two different models. With
extensive experimental analysis, we have shown that our model has significantly
outperformed the state-of-the-art models on three real-world traffic datasets

design patterns to promote software quality or as a possible cure for some
design anti-patterns. Thus, design patterns and design anti-patterns are
introduced, removed, and mutated from one another by developers.
  Many studies investigated the evolution of design patterns and design
anti-patterns and their impact on software development. However, they
investigated design patterns or design anti-patterns in isolation and did not
consider their mutations and the impact of these mutations on software quality.
Therefore, we report our study of bidirectional mutations between design

  We analyzed snapshots of seven Java software systems with diverse sizes,

coupled state and temporal constraints is notoriously challenging. An appealing
approach to effectively decouple the problem is to judiciously order the events
such that decisions can be made over sequences of tasks. As many problems
encountered in practice are over-constrained, we must instead find relaxed
solutions in which certain requirements are dropped. This motivates a
formulation of optimality with respect to the costs of relaxing constraints and
the problem of finding an optimal ordering under which this relaxing cost is
minimum. In this paper, we present Generalized Conflict-directed Ordering
(GCDO), a branch-and-bound ordering method that generates an optimal total
order of events by leveraging the generalized conflicts of both inconsistency
and suboptimality from sub-solvers for cost estimation and solution space
pruning. Due to its ability to reason over generalized conflicts, GCDO is much
more efficient in finding high-quality total orders than the previous
conflict-directed approach CDITO. We demonstrate this by benchmarking on
temporal network configuration problems, which involves managing networks over
time and makes necessary tradeoffs between network flows against CDITO and
Mixed Integer-Linear Programing (MILP). Our algorithm is able to solve two
orders of magnitude more benchmark problems to optimality and twice the
problems compared to CDITO and MILP within a runtime limit, respectively.

valuable analytical tool for identifying important flow structures and
energetic motions. The traditional approach abstracts the nonlinear terms as
forcing that is unstructured, in the sense that this forcing is not directly
tied to the underlying nonlinearity in the dynamics. This paper instead employs
a structured singular value-based approach that preserves certain input-output
properties of the nonlinear forcing function in an effort to recover the larger
range of key flow features identified through nonlinear analysis, experiments,
and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of transitional channel flows.
Application of this method to transitional plane Couette and plane Poiseuille
flows leads to not only the identification of the streamwise coherent
structures predicted through traditional input-output approaches, but also the
characterization of the oblique flow structures as those requiring the least
energy to induce transition in agreement with DNS studies, and nonlinear
optimal perturbation analysis. The proposed approach also captures the recently
observed oblique turbulent bands that have been linked to transition in
experiments and DNS with very large channel size. The ability to identify the
larger amplification of the streamwise varying structures predicted from DNS
and nonlinear analysis in both flow regimes suggests that the structured
approach allows one to maintain the nonlinear effects associated with weakening
of the lift-up mechanism, which is known to dominate the linear operator.
Capturing this key nonlinear effect enables the prediction of the wider range
of known transitional flow structures within the analytical input-output
modeling paradigm.

nebula in the Large Magellanic Clouds, based on a 100 ks Suzaku observation. We
measure the thermal and chemical properties of the hot plasma and
quantitatively confront them with the feedback expected from embedded massive
stars. We find that our spatially resolved measurements can be well reproduced
by a global modeling of the nebula with a log-normal temperature distribution
of the plasma emission measure and a log-normal foreground absorption
distribution. The metal abundances and total mass of the plasma are consistent
with the chemically enriched mass ejection expected from the central OB
association and a ~55% mass-loading from the ambient medium. The total thermal
energy of the plasma is smaller than what is expected from a simple superbubble
model, demonstrating that important channels of energy loss are not accounted
for. Our analysis indeed shows tentative evidence for a diffuse non-thermal
X-ray component, indicating that cosmic-ray acceleration needs to be considered
in such a young starburst region. Finally, we suggest that the log-normal
modeling may be suitable for the X-ray spectral analysis of other giant HII
regions, especially when spatially resolved spectroscopy is not practical.

to three-dimensional gravity on AdS$_3$ and higher spin gravity with gauge
group $SL(N,\mathbb{R})\times SL(N,\mathbb{R})$ in the diagonal gauge. We
present new sets of boundary conditions for the (higher spin) gravitational
theories on AdS$_3$, where the dynamics of the boundary degrees of freedom is
described by two independent left and right members of a hierarchy of
integrable equations. For the pure gravity case, the associated hierarchy
corresponds to the Gardner hierarchy, also known as the ""mixed KdV-mKdV"" one,
while for the case of higher spin gravity, they are identified with the
""modified Gelfand-Dickey"" hierarchies. The complete integrable structure of the
hierarchies, i.e., the phase space, the Poisson brackets and the infinite
number of commuting conserved charges, are directly obtained from the
asymptotic structure and the conserved surface integrals in the gravitational
theories. Consequently, the corresponding Miura transformation is recovered
from a purely geometric construction in the bulk. Black hole solutions that fit

more general thermodynamic ensembles called ""Generalized Gibbs Ensemble"" are

formulate Operational Quantum Theory) is time asymmetric. This is clear because
the conditions on allowed operations are time asymmetric. It is odd, though,
because Schoedinger's equation is time symmetric and probability theory does
not care about time direction. In this work we provide a time symmetric
framework for operational theories in general and for Quantum Theory in
particular.
  The clearest expression of the time asymmetry of standard Operational Quantum
Theory is that the deterministic effect is unique - meaning there is only one
way to ignore the future - while deterministic (i.e normalised) states are not
unique. In this paper, this time asymmetry is traced back to a time asymmetric
understanding of the most basic elements of an operational theory - namely the
operations (or boxes) out of which circuits are built. We modify this allowing
operations to have classical incomes as well as classical outcomes on these
operations. We establish a time symmetric operational framework for circuits
built out of operations. In particular, we demand that the probability
associated with a circuit is the same whether we calculate it forwards in time
or backwards in time. We do this by imposing various double properties. These
are properties wherein a forward in time and a backward in time version of the
same property are required. In this paper we provide a new causality condition
which we call double causality.

wave (mmW) communications using multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed. The use of multiple
AI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals
transmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage
particularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the
possibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an
intelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts
is a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic
return is proposed to maximize the expected bit rate and mitigate the risk of
mmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of
the risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem
of joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled
as an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent
environment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized
and distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP
and RISs. To directly find an optimal solution, the parametric functional-form
policies for these controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks
(RNNs). Simulation results show that the error between policies of the optimal
and the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the
achievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than
the variance of the risk-averse baseline.

solutions to autonomous overtaking are limited to simple and static scenarios.

simultaneously enforcing safety and minimizing intrusion onto the adjacent
lane. Furthermore, the method allows the overtaking to be aborted, enabling the
autonomous vehicle to merge back in the lane, if safety is compromised, because
of e.g. traffic in opposing direction appearing during the maneuver execution.
A finite state machine is used to select an appropriate maneuver at each time,
and a combination of safe and reachable sets is used to iteratively generate
intermediate reference targets based on the current maneuver. A nonlinear model
predictive controller then plans dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories to these intermediate reference targets. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the combination of intermediate reference generation and model
predictive control is able to handle multiple behaviors, including following a
lead vehicle, overtaking and aborting the overtake, within a single framework.

naturally and intuitively correct those mistakes through physical interaction.
In simple situations, one correction is sufficient to convey what the human
wants. But when humans are working with multiple robots or the robot is
performing an intricate task often the human must make several corrections to
fix the robot's behavior. Prior research assumes each of these physical
corrections are independent events, and learns from them one-at-a-time.
However, this misses out on crucial information: each of these interactions are
interconnected, and may only make sense if viewed together. Alternatively,
other work reasons over the final trajectory produced by all of the human's
corrections. But this method must wait until the end of the task to learn from
corrections, as opposed to inferring from the corrections in an online fashion.
In this paper we formalize an approach for learning from sequences of physical
corrections during the current task. To do this we introduce an auxiliary
reward that captures the human's trade-off between making corrections which
improve the robot's immediate reward and long-term performance. We evaluate the
resulting algorithm in remote and in-person human-robot experiments, and
compare to both independent and final baselines. Our results indicate that
users are best able to convey their objective when the robot reasons over their

the overall architecture of the real-time data infrastructure and identify
three scaling challenges that we need to continuously address for each

technologies for the key areas of the infrastructure. On top of those
open-source software, we add significant improvements and customizations to
make the open-source solutions fit in Uber's environment and bridge the gaps to
meet Uber's unique scale and requirements. We then highlight several important
use cases and show their real-time solutions and tradeoffs. Finally, we reflect
on the lessons we learned as we built, operated and scaled these systems.

$C^1$-continuous bicubic splines, whereas regular regions only involve $C^2$

refinement without propagating to unanticipated regions. Challenges lie in
refining transition regions where a mixed types of splines play a role.
THU-spline basis functions are globally $C^1$-continuous and are non-negative

inevitable to retain refinability of the spline functions defined using the

ray-like excitations in a planar slab of hyperbolic media. We demonstrate that
these rays have an approximately Lorentzian profile and that they propagate in
a zig-zagged manner. These rays acquire phase in a discrete fashion at every
internal reflection inside the slab and broaden at a rate which is proportional
to the rate of optical absorption. Moreover, based on this description, we
reveal a unique reflection mechnanism where destructive interefernce between
the different modes composing the ray can improve the strength of reflection at
an interface between a dielectric and a metalic substrate. This reflection
mechanism is highly asymmetric, occuring only when the ray is incident from the

strength of reflection is shown to be directly related to the width of the ray.

  We envision artificial intelligence systems that augment resources instead of

sociotechnical smart systems can help identify needs of older adults, the lack
of affordable research infrastructure and translation of findings into consumer

in the mechanical and optoelectronic properties of single-layer graphene,
aggregating new functionalities in carbon-based applications. Here, we carried
our fully atomistic reactive (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations to study
the self-folding and self-scrolling of edge-deformed graphene sheets. We
adopted initial armchair edge-scrolled graphene (AESG($\phi$,$\theta$))
structures with similar (or different) twist angles ($\phi$,$\theta$) in each
edge, mimicking the initial configuration that was experimentally developed to
form biscrolled sheets. Results showed that AESG(0,$2\pi$) and
AESG(2$\pi$,$2\pi$) evolved to single-folded and two-folded fully stacked
morphologies, respectively. As a general trend, for twist angles higher than
$2\pi$, the self-deformation process of AESG morphologies yields GNSs. Edge
twist angles lower than $\pi$ are not enough for triggering the
self-deformation processes. In the AESG(0,3$\pi$) and AESG(3$\pi$,3$\pi$)
cases, after a relaxation period, their morphology transition towards GNS
occurred rapidly. In the AESG(3$\pi$,3$\pi$) dynamics, a metastable biscroll
was formed by the interplay between the left- and right-sided partial scrolling
in forming a unique GNS. At high-temperature perturbations, the edge folding
and scrolling transitions to GNFs and GNSs occurred within the ultrafast
period. Remarkably, the AESG(2$\pi$,3$\pi$) evolved to a dual state that
combines folded and scrolled structures in a temperature-independent process.

minimized, is a holy grail for transportation authorities. However, SO routing
may discriminate against users who incur much larger travel times than others
to achieve high system efficiency, i.e., low total travel times. To address the
inherent unfairness of SO routing, we study the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem whose
goal is to minimize the total travel time while guaranteeing a ${\beta\geq 1}$
level of unfairness, which specifies the maximum possible ratio between the
travel times of different users with shared origins and destinations.
  To obtain feasible solutions to the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem while achieving
high system efficiency, we develop a new convex program, the Interpolated
Traffic Assignment Problem (I-TAP), which interpolates between a
fairness-promoting and an efficiency-promoting traffic-assignment objective. We
evaluate the efficacy of I-TAP through theoretical bounds on the total system
travel time and level of unfairness in terms of its interpolation parameter, as
well as present a numerical comparison between I-TAP and a state-of-the-art
algorithm on a range of transportation networks. The numerical results indicate
that our approach is faster by several orders of magnitude as compared to the
benchmark algorithm, while achieving higher system efficiency for all desirable
levels of unfairness. We further leverage the structure of I-TAP to develop two
pricing mechanisms to collectively enforce the I-TAP solution in the presence
of selfish homogeneous and heterogeneous users, respectively, that
independently choose routes to minimize their own travel costs. We mention that
this is the first study of pricing in the context of fair routing for general
road networks (as opposed to, e.g., parallel road networks).

three baseline models - LXMERT, HME-VideoQA and VisualBERT - and show that our
approaches can provide a slight improvement over the baselines. In specific, we
try to improve on the spatial awareness of the model and help the model
identify color using enhanced pre-training, reduce language dependence using
adversarial regularization, and improve counting using regression loss and
graph based deduplication. We further delve into an in-depth analysis on the
language bias in the ISVQA dataset and show how models trained on ISVQA
implicitly learn to associate language more strongly with the final answer.

adaptive interventions, play an increasingly important role in many health
domains. DTRs are motivated to address the unique and changing needs of
individuals by delivering the type of treatment needed, when needed, while
minimizing unnecessary treatment. Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision
rules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available
information about the individual's status and progress should be used in
practice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver. The
sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental
design widely used to empirically inform the development of DTRs. Sample size
planning resources for SMARTs have been developed for continuous, binary, and
survival outcomes. However, an important gap exists in sample size estimation
methodology for SMARTs with longitudinal count outcomes. Further, in many
health domains, count data are overdispersed - having variance greater than
their mean. We propose a Monte Carlo-based approach to sample size estimation
applicable to many types of longitudinal outcomes and provide a case study with
longitudinal overdispersed count outcomes. A SMART for engaging alcohol and
cocaine-dependent patients in treatment is used as motivation.

representation of unknown physical processes and closure parameterizations.
These hybrid models are suitable for situations where the mechanistic
description of dynamics of some variables is unknown, but reasonably accurate
observational data can be obtained for the evolution of the state of the
system. In this work, we propose machine learning to account for missing
physics and then data assimilation to correct the prediction. In particular, we
devise an effective methodology based on a recurrent neural network to model
the unknown dynamics. A long short-term memory (LSTM) based correction term is
added to the predictive model in order to take into account hidden physics.
Since LSTM introduces a black-box approach for the unknown part of the model,
we investigate whether the proposed hybrid neural-physical model can be further
corrected through a sequential data assimilation step. We apply this framework
to the weakly nonlinear Lorenz model that displays quasiperiodic oscillations,
the highly nonlinear Lorenz model, and two-scale Lorenz model. The hybrid
neural-physics model yields accurate results for the weakly nonlinear Lorenz
model with the predicted state close to the true Lorenz model trajectory. For
the highly nonlinear Lorenz model and the two-scale Lorenz model, the hybrid
neural-physics model deviates from the true state due to the accumulation of
prediction error from one time step to the next time step. The ensemble Kalman
filter approach takes into account the prediction error and updates the
diverged prediction using available observations in order to provide a more
accurate state estimate. The successful synergistic integration of neural
network and data assimilation for low-dimensional system shows the potential

offer significant potential benefits to both consumers and grid operators, but

privacy concerns. In this paper, we drastically reduce the local computational
requirements of advanced building control through a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based approach called Behavioral Cloning, which represents the MPC policy
as a neural network that can be locally implemented and quickly computed on a
low-cost programmable logic controller. While previous RL and approximate MPC
methods must be specifically trained for each building, our key improvement is
that our controller can generalize to many buildings, electricity rates, and
thermostat setpoint schedules without additional, effort-intensive retraining.
To provide this versatility, we have adapted the traditional Behavioral Cloning
approach through (1) a constraint-informed parameter grouping (CIPG) method
that provides a more efficient representation of the training data; (2) an
MPC-Guided training data generation method using the DAgger algorithm that
improves stability and constraint satisfaction; and (3) a new deep learning
model-structure called reverse-time recurrent neural networks (RT-RNN) that
allows future information to flow backward in time to more effectively
interpret the temporal information in disturbance predictions. The result is an
easy-to-deploy, generalized behavioral clone of MPC that can be implemented on

timescales are comparable to the operational timescales. In this study, we
employ a model NESS stochastic system which comprises of a colloidal
microparticle, optically trapped in a viscous fluid, externally driven by a
temporally correlated noise, and show that time-integrated observables such as
the entropic current, the work done on the system or the work dissipated by it,
follow the three Levy arcsine laws [1], in the large time limit. We discover
that cumulative distributions converge faster to arcsine distributions when it
is near equilibrium and the rate of entropy production is small, because in
that case the entropic current has weaker temporal autocorrelation. We study
this phenomenon changing the strength of the added noise or by perturbing our
system with a flow field produced by a microbubble at close proximity to the
trapped particle. We confirm our experimental findings with theoretical
simulations of the systems. Our work provides an interesting insight into the
NESS statistics of the meso-regime, where stochastic fluctuations play a
pivotal role.

rotation speed of the Galaxy and the corotation radius, the strongest Galactic
resonance. The sample of open clusters used here increases the last one from
Dias et al. (2019) used in the previous determination of the pattern speed by

determined, using improvements to isochrone fitting and including an updated
extinction polynomial for the Gaia DR2 photometric band-passes, and the
Galactic abundance gradient as a prior for metallicity. In addition to the
better age determinations, the catalog contains better positions in the
Galactic plane and better proper motions. This allow us to discuss not only the

the clusters's birthplaces, obtained by integration of the orbits for a time
equal to their age. The value of the rotation velocity of the arms ($28.5 \pm

clearance-time equality constraints that ensure safe separation and compress
the line-occupancy timespan. We assume the track is divided into sections by a
set of trackside signals at fixed locations. For each intermediate signal there
is a signal-location segment consisting of the two adjacent sections.
Successive trains are safely separated only if the leading train leaves each
signal-location segment before the following train enters. The fleet can be
safely separated by a complete set of clearance times and associated
clearance-time inequality constraints. The problem of finding optimal schedules
with safe separation has been solved for two trains but for larger fleets the
problem rapidly becomes intractable as the number of trains and signals
increases. The main difficulty is in distinguishing between active equality
constraints and inactive inequality constraints. The curse of dimensionality
means it is not feasible to check every different combination of active
constraints, optimize the corresponding prescribed times and calculate the
cost. Nevertheless we can formulate and solve an alternative problem with
active clearance-time equality constraints for successive trains on every
signal-location segment. We show that this problem can be formulated as an
unconstrained convex optimization and we propose a viable solution algorithm
that finds the optimal schedule and the associated optimal strategies for each
train. Finally we use our solution to find optimal schedules for a busy

the predictions of automated decision systems and are potentially a serious
threat for automated medical image analysis. Previous studies have shown that
it is possible to adversarially manipulate automated segmentations produced by
neural networks in a targeted manner in the white-box attack setting. In this
article, we studied the effectiveness of adversarial attacks in targeted
modification of segmentations of anatomical structures in chest X-rays.
Firstly, we experimented with using anatomically implausible shapes as targets
for adversarial manipulation. We showed that, by adding almost imperceptible
noise to the image, we can reliably force state-of-the-art neural networks to
segment the heart as a heart symbol instead of its real anatomical shape.
Moreover, such heart-shaping attack did not appear to require higher
adversarial noise level than an untargeted attack based the same attack method.
Secondly, we attempted to explore the limits of adversarial manipulation of
segmentations. For that, we assessed the effectiveness of shrinking and
enlarging segmentation contours for the three anatomical structures. We
observed that adversarially extending segmentations of structures into regions
with intensity and texture uncharacteristic for them presented a challenge to
our attacks, as well as, in some cases, changing segmentations in ways that
conflict with class adjacency priors learned by the target network.
Additionally, we evaluated performances of the untargeted attacks and targeted
heart attacks in the black-box attack scenario, using a surrogate network
trained on a different subset of images. In both cases, the attacks were
substantially less effective. We believe these findings bring novel insights
into the current capabilities and limits of adversarial attacks for semantic
segmentation.

to abbreviated-MOLLI (1$\pm$17ms vs. 31$\pm$34ms, P<0.01 for in native T1, and
0.1$\pm$1.3% vs. 1.9$\pm$2.5%, P<0.01 for ECV). The duration of T1 estimation
was approximately 2 ms per slice using MyoMapNet. Conclusion: MyoMapNet T1
mapping enables myocardial T1 quantification in 4-5 heartbeats with
near-instantaneous map estimation time with similar accuracy and precision as
MOLLI. Keywords: Myocardial T1 mapping, MOLLI, T1 reconstruction, Neural

strong spin-orbit coupling cannot be directly manipulated with microwaves due
to the locking of electron spin to its momentum. We show by contrast that a
resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonance (RDNMR) based technique can be
used to probe the helical nature of surface conducting states. In such
experiments, one applies a radio frequency (RF) field to reorient nuclear spins
that then couple to electronic spins by the hyperfine interaction. The spin of
the boundary electrons can thereby be modulated, resulting in changes in
conductance at nuclear resonance frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that the
conductivity is sensitive to the direction of the applied magnetic field with
respect to the helicity of the electrons. This dependence of the RDNMR signal
on angle probes the nature of the conductive edge or surface states. In the
case of 3D TI in the quantum Hall regime, we establish that the dominant
mechanism responsible for the conductance change in a RDNMR experiment is based
on the Overhauser field effect. Our findings indicate that the same physics
underlying the use of RDNMR to probe TI states also enables us to use RF
control of nuclear spins to coherently manipulate topologically protected
states which could be useful for a new generation of devices.

concentration, the resulting interaction is dominated by the repulsive
double-layer interaction which is fully characterized. The double-layer
interaction is suppressed when adding $0.22\,$M of salt to our sample, thus
leading to a purely attractive Casimir signal. When analyzing the experimental
data for the potential energy and force, we find good agreement with
theoretical results based on the scattering approach. At the distance range
probed experimentally, the interaction arises mainly from the unscreened
transverse magnetic contribution in the zero-frequency limit, with nonzero
Matsubara frequencies providing a negligible contribution. In contrast, such
unscreened contribution is not included by the standard theoretical model of
the Casimir interaction in electrolyte solutions, in which the zero-frequency
term is treated separately as an electrostatic fluctuational effect. As a
consequence, the resulting attraction is too weak in this standard model, by
approximately one order of magnitude, to explain the experimental data.
Overall, our experimental results shed light on the nature of the thermal
zero-frequency contribution and indicate that the Casimir attraction across
polar liquids has a longer range than previously predicted.

biases, resulting in their inability to perform well on minority groups. This
has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias.
However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study
protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test
many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned
specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved
evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to
ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate
seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and
hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a
new dataset called Biased MNIST that enables assessment of robustness to
multiple bias sources. We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering
(VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning
to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning
distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test
distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms
exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are
highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set. Based on our findings, we implore
the community to adopt more rigorous assessment of future bias mitigation
methods. All data, code, and results are publicly available at:

in basic plasma physics research. While the seemingly universal rate of an
order $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ is often reported in the low-$\beta$ regime, it is not
clear how reconnection rate scales with a higher plasma $\beta$. Due to the
complexity of the pressure tensor, the available reconnection rate model is
limited to the low plasma-$\beta$ regime, where the thermal pressure is
arguably negligible. However, the thermal pressure effect becomes important
when $\beta \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$. Using first-principle kinetic simulations,
we show that both the reconnection rate and outflow speed drop as $\beta$ gets
larger. A simple analytical framework is derived to take account of the
self-generated pressure anisotropy and pressure gradient in the force-balance

find that they accelerate the evaporation of the black hole, therefore disrupt
the entanglement between two universes. Furthermore, we observe that depending

crucial task in many fields, ranging from information retrieval, computer
vision, biology, chemistry and natural language processing. Yet subgraph
matching problem remains to be an NP-complete problem. This study proposes an
end-to-end learning-based approximate method for subgraph matching task, called
subgraph matching network (Sub-GMN). The proposed Sub-GMN firstly uses graph
representation learning to map nodes to node-level embedding. It then combines
metric learning and attention mechanisms to model the relationship between
matched nodes in the data graph and query graph. To test the performance of the
proposed method, we applied our method on two databases. We used two existing
methods, GNN and FGNN as baseline for comparison. Our experiment shows that, on
dataset 1, on average the accuracy of Sub-GMN are 12.21\% and 3.2\% higher than
that of GNN and FGNN respectively. On average running time Sub-GMN runs 20-40
times faster than FGNN. In addition, the average F1-score of Sub-GMN on all
experiments with dataset 2 reached 0.95, which demonstrates that Sub-GMN
outputs more correct node-to-node matches.
  Comparing with the previous GNNs-based methods for subgraph matching task,
our proposed Sub-GMN allows varying query and data graphes in the
test/application stage, while most previous GNNs-based methods can only find a

  Precoding/Combining and Self-Interference Cancellation Design",,,"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3069672",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems have been considered as one of the primary candidates for the fifth
generation (5G) and beyond 5G wireless communication networks to satisfy the
ever-increasing capacity demands. Full-duplex technology can further enhance
the advantages of mmWave massive MIMO systems. However, strong
self-interference (SI) is the major limiting factor in full-duplex technology.
Hence, this paper proposes a novel angular-based joint hybrid
precoding/combining (AB-JHPC) technique for the full-duplex mmWave massive-MIMO
systems. Our primary goals are listed as: (i) improving the self-interference
cancellation (SIC), (ii) increasing the intended signal power, (iii) decreasing
the channel estimation overhead, (iv) designing the massive MIMO systems with a
low number of RF chains. First, the RF-stage of AB-JHPC is developed via slow
time-varying angle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. A
joint transmit/receive RF beamformer design is proposed for covering
(excluding) the AoD/AoA support of intended (SI) channel. Second, the BB-stage
of AB-JHPC is constructed via the reduced-size effective intended channel.
After using the well-known singular value decomposition(SVD) approach at the
BB-stage, we also propose a new semi-blind minimum mean square error (S-MMSE)
technique to further suppress the residual SI power by using AoD/AoA
parameters. The numerical results demonstrate that the SI signal is remarkably
canceled via the proposed AB-JHPC technique. It is shown that AB-JHPC achieves
85.7 dB SIC and the total amount of SIC almost linearly increases via antenna
isolation techniques. We observe that the proposed full-duplex mmWave massive
MIMO systems double the achievable rate capacity compared to its half-duplex
counterpart as the antenna array size increases and the transmit/receive
antenna isolation improves.

pivotal importance. In practice, due to processing and feedback delays,
estimated CSI can be outdated, which can severely deteriorate the performance
of the communication system. Besides, to feedback estimated CSI, a strong
compression of the CSI, evaluated at the user equipment (UE), is performed to
reduce the over-the-air (OTA) overhead. Such compression strongly reduces the
precision of the estimated CSI, which ultimately impacts the performance of
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding. Motivated by such issues, we
present a novel scalable idea of reporting CSI in wireless networks, which is

based on the 7-point visual category checklist (7PC). The 7PC contains
intrinsic relationships between categories that can aid classification, such as
shared features, correlations, and the contributions of categories towards
diagnosis. Manual classification is subjective and prone to intra- and
interobserver variability. This presents an opportunity for automated methods
to improve diagnosis. Current state-of-the-art methods focus on a single image
modality and ignore information from the other, or do not fully leverage the
complementary information from both modalities. Further, there is not a method

address these issues by proposing a graph-based intercategory and intermodality

leverages intercategorical relations, intermodal relations, and prioritises the

to optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs), this only holds in the
presence of static environments. However, this assumption is very restrictive.
In many real-world problems like ride-sharing, traffic control, etc., we are
dealing with highly dynamic environments, where RL methods yield only
sub-optimal decisions. To mitigate this problem in highly dynamic environments,
we (1) adopt an online Dirichlet change point detection (ODCP) algorithm to

uncertain E-fields using the distributionally robust optimization (DRO)

({\it UDC}) problem as follows.
  {\it $k$-Colorable Discrete Unit Disk Cover ({\it $k$-CDUDC})}: Given a set
$P$ of $n$ points, and a set $D$ of $m$ unit disks (of radius=1), both lying in
the plane, and a parameter $k$, the objective is to compute a set $D'\subseteq
D$ such that every point in $P$ is covered by at least one disk in $D'$ and
there exists a function $\chi:D'\rightarrow C$ that assigns colors to disks in
$D'$ such that for any $d$ and $d'$ in $D'$ if $d\cap d'\neq\emptyset$, then
$\chi(d)\neq\chi(d')$, where $C$ denotes a set containing $k$ distinct colors.
  For the {\it $k$-CDUDC} problem, our proposed algorithms approximate the
number of colors used in the coloring if there exists a $k$-colorable cover. We
first propose a 4-approximation algorithm in $O(m^{7k}n\log k)$ time for this
problem and then show that the running time can be improved by a multiplicative
factor of $m^k$, where a positive integer $k$ denotes the cardinality of a
color-set. The previous best known result for the problem when $k=3$ is due to
the recent work of Biedl et al., (2021), who proposed a 2-approximation
algorithm in $O(m^{25}n)$ time. For $k=3$, our algorithm runs in $O(m^{18}n)$
time, faster than the previous best algorithm, but gives a 4-approximate
result. We then generalize our approach to exhibit a
$O((1+\lceil\frac{2}{\tau}\rceil)^2)$-approximation algorithm in
$O(m^{(\lfloor\frac{4\pi+8\tau+\tau^2}{\sqrt{12}}\rfloor)k}n\log k)$ time for a

models depend significantly on a reliable estimate of the wave breaker index r
(the breaker height-to-depth ratio), a free model parameter that essentially
controls the amount of breaking energy dissipation. While the previous studies
have suggested separate relationships between r and the offshore wave steepness
(s0) or the normalized local water depth (kh), the parameterization of r still
requires further investigation considering a wider variety of conditions and a
sounder physical basis. In this study, we use the field datasets of wave height
and the inverse modelling approach to reveal a composite dependence of r on
both s0 and kh. Specifically, the results show a positive dependence of r on kh
for larger s0, and a negative dependence of r on kh for smaller s0. Based on
such composite relationships, a new r formula is proposed, and its performance
is verified against the available datasets of wave height in three coasts and
14 laboratory tests. Implementation of this new formula in a parametric wave
model leads to the error reduction of wave height prediction by 10~24% (mean =
19%) relative to seven widely used models in literatures. In particular, a
remarkably higher model accuracy is obtained under wave conditions with small
offshore wave steepness, which is important for studying onshore sediment
transport and beach recovery. Two counteractive physical mechanisms for wave
nonlinearity effects, namely the breaking intensification mechanism and the
breaking resistance mechanism, are suggested to explain the opposite r-kh
relationships within different ranges of s0.

Kahan's method in time. Applying proper orthogonal decomposition with Galerkin

classical and quantum interferences between surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)
have been demonstrated. However, to actively control the SPP interference
within subcycle in time (usually less than several femtoseconds in the visible
range) is still missing, which hinders the ultimate manipulation of SPP
interference on ultrafast time scale. In this paper, the interference between
SPPs launched by a hole dimer, which was excited by a grazing incident free
electron beam without direct contact, was manipulated through both propagation
and initial phase difference control. Particularly, using cathodoluminescence
spectroscopy, the appearance of higher-order interference orders was obtained
through propagation phase control by increasing separation distances of the
dimer. Meanwhile, the peak-valley-peak evolution at a certain wavelength
through changing the accelerating voltages was observed, which originates from
the initial phase difference control of hole launched SPPs. In particular, the
time resolution of this kind of control is shown to be in the ultrafast
attosecond (as) region. Our work suggests that fast electron beams can be an
efficient tool to control polarition interference in subcycle temporal scale,

(DF^2) module by learning attention for discriminative feature from local to
global manner. In particular, the attention for a local feature is determined
locally, i.e., applying a learned transformation function on itself. Meanwhile,
to further mining the relationships between global features from person images,
we propose an Affinities Modeling (AM) module to obtain the optimal intra- and
inter-modality image matching. Specifically, AM employes intra-class
compactness and inter-class separability in the sample similarities as
supervised information to model the affinities between intra- and
inter-modality samples. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins on two widely used
cross-modality re-ID datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, respectively.

Previously, this challenge has been approached by unsupervised domain

from a target domain, UDA seeks for a deep representation that is both
discriminative and domain-invariant. While UDA focuses on the target domain, we
argue that the performance on both source and target domains matters, as in
practice which domain a test example comes from is unknown. In this paper we
extend UDA by proposing a new task called unsupervised domain expansion (UDE),
which aims to adapt a deep model for the target domain with its unlabeled data,
meanwhile maintaining the model's performance on the source domain. We propose
Knowledge Distillation Domain Expansion (KDDE) as a general method for the UDE
task. Its domain-adaptation module can be instantiated with any existing model.
We develop a knowledge distillation based learning mechanism, enabling KDDE to
optimize a single objective wherein the source and target domains are equally
treated. Extensive experiments on two major benchmarks, i.e., Office-Home and
DomainNet, show that KDDE compares favorably against four competitive
baselines, i.e., DDC, DANN, DAAN, and CDAN, for both UDA and UDE tasks. Our
study also reveals that the current UDA models improve their performance on the

polarization degree, this new method additionally takes into account the
coupling between photon helicities induced by some models. This coupling can
generate circular polarization as light propagates, even if there is no
circular polarization at the source. Combining significant detections of linear
polarization of light from extragalactic objects with the absence of the
detection of circular polarization in most measurements results in
significantly tighter constraints regarding LIV. The analysis was carried out
in the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME), an effective field
theory framework to describe the low-energy effects of an underlying

from a small set of archival circular and linear optical polarimetry
constraints and compare them to similar constraints derived in previous works
with far larger sample sizes and based on linear polarimetry only. The new
method yielded constraints that are an order of magnitude tighter even for our

constraining power from scarce circular data, we advocate for the need for
future extragalactic circular polarization surveys.

balls-and-bins model. We also reduce the dimension of the problem by
classifying banks according to different types, in an appropriate type space.
These types may be calibrated to real-world data by using machine learning
techniques. We then state various limit theorems regarding the final size of
default cascade over different types. In particular, under suitable assumptions
on the degree and threshold distributions, we show that the final size of
default cascade has asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations. We next state limit
theorems for different system-wide wealth aggregation functions and show how
the systemic risk measure, in a given stress test scenario, could be related to
the structure and heterogeneity of financial networks. We finally show how
these results could be used by a social planner to optimally target
interventions during a financial crisis, with a budget constraint and under

as the information on its environment. It is paramount to develop a prediction
model that can exploit the contextual information in both static and dynamic
environments surrounding the target agent and generate diverse trajectory
samples that are meaningful in a traffic context. We propose a novel prediction
model, referred to as the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network, which uses
the instance-level lane entities extracted from a semantic map to predict the
multi-modal future trajectories. For each lane candidate found in the
neighborhood of the target agent, LaPred extracts the joint features relating
the lane and the trajectories of the neighboring agents. Then, the features for
all lane candidates are fused with the attention weights learned through a
self-supervised learning task that identifies the lane candidate likely to be
followed by the target agent. Using the instance-level lane information, LaPred
can produce the trajectories compliant with the surroundings better than 2D
raster image-based methods and generate the diverse future trajectories given
multiple lane candidates. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes
dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaPred method
significantly outperforms the existing prediction models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks.

as all-digital radio spectrometer; ADRS) has been developed in which all
functionalities comprising a radio spectrometer including a sampler and Fourier
computing unit were implemented as a soft-core on a field-programmable gate
array (FPGA). A delay-line-based ramp-compare analog-to-digital converter
(ADC), one of completely digital ADC, was used, and two primary elements of the
ADC, an analog-to-time converter (ATC) and a time-to-digital converter (TDC),
were implemented on the FPGA. The sampling rate of the ADRS $f$ and the
quantization bit rate $n$ are limited by the relation, $\tau =
\frac{1}{2^{n}f}$, where $\tau$ is the latency of the delay element of the
delay-line. Given that the typical latency of the delay element implemented on
FPGAs is $\sim10$ ps, adoption of a low quantization bit rate, which satisfies
the requirements for radio astronomy, facilitates the realization of a high
sampling rate up to $\sim$100 GSa/s. In addition, as the proposed \ADRS does
not require a discrete ADC and can be implemented on mass-produced evaluation
boards, its fabrication cost is much lower than that of conventional
spectrometers. The ADRS prototype was fabricated with values of $f$ = 600 MSa/s
and $n$ = 6.6 using a PYNQ-Z1 evaluation board, with a $\tau$ of 16.7 ps. The
performance of the prototype, including its linearity and stability, was
measured, and a test observation was conducted using the Osaka Prefecture
University 1.85-m mm-submm telescope; this confirmed the potential application
of the prototype in authentic radio observations. With 10 times better cost
performance ($\sim$800 USD GHz$^{-1}$) than conventional radio spectrometers,
the prototype facilitates cost-effective coverage of intermediate frequency

trained versions, can get appealing results in different image signal
processing tasks. However, most if not all of these methods tend to apply a
single filter that is homogeneous over the entire image. This is also
particularly true when an encoder-decoder type deep architecture is trained for
the task. However, it is natural to view a camera image as heterogeneous, as
the color intensity and the artificial noise are distributed vastly different,
even across the two dimensional domain of a single image. Varied Moire ringing,
motion-blur, color-bleaching or lens based projection distortions can all
potentially lead to a heterogeneous image artifact filtering problem. In this
paper, we present a specific patch-based, local subspace deep neural network
that improves Camera ISP to be robust to heterogeneous artifacts (especially
image denoising). We call our three-fold deep trained model the Patch Subspace
Learning Autoencoder (PSL-AE). PSL-AE does not necessarily assume uniform image
distortion levels nor repeated nor similar artifact types within the image.
Rather, PSL-AE first diagnostically encodes patches extracted from noisy and
clean image pairs, with different artifact type and distortion levels, by
contrastive learning. Then, each image's patches are encoded into soft-clusters
in their appropriate latent sub-space, using a prior mixture model. Lastly, the
decoders of the PSL-AE are also trained in an unsupervised manner customized
for the image patches in each soft-cluster. Our experimental results
demonstrates the flexibility and performance that one can achieve through
improved heterogeneous filtering, both from synthesized artifacts but also
realistic SIDD image pairs.

present a way of using multiple Python interpreters within a single process to

to integrate existing performance-enhancing Python libraries. We evaluate our

the listeners head orientation and the spatial dimensions of an acoustic scene.
A exemplary modeling toolchain, including an acoustic rendering model, a

Results. We confirm that the effects of the photospheric composition and the

all of the six sources, we find that a H-poor photosphere and a large touchdown

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has recently drawn attention because of
the underlying topology. Topological phase transitions may arise when there
exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a
gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we consider the magnons in honeycomb
ferromagnets described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian containing both an
out-of-plane DMI and a Zeeman interaction. We demonstrate that the magnonic
system exhibits temperature (or magnetic field) driven topological phase
transitions due to magnon-magnon interactions. Specifically, when the
temperature increases, the magnonic energy gap at Dirac points closes and
reopens at a critical temperature, $T_c$. By showing that the Chern numbers of
the magnonic bands are distinct above and below $T_c$, we confirm that the
gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase
transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall
conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at $T_c$, which
can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature. Our theory

problem of giving high confidence responses for examples that are away from the
training data. This makes the neural networks very confident in their
prediction while making gross mistakes, thus limiting their reliability for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, space exploration,
etc. This paper introduces a novel neuron generalization that has the standard
dot-product-based neuron and the {\color{black} radial basis function (RBF)}
neuron as two extreme cases of a shape parameter. Using a rectified linear unit
(ReLU) as the activation function results in a novel neuron that has compact
support, which means its output is zero outside a bounded domain. To address
the difficulties in training the proposed neural network, it introduces a novel
training method that takes a pretrained standard neural network that is
fine-tuned while gradually increasing the shape parameter to the desired value.
The theoretical findings of the paper are a bound on the gradient of the
proposed neuron and a proof that a neural network with such neurons has the
universal approximation property. This means that the network can approximate
any continuous and integrable function with an arbitrary degree of accuracy.
The experimental findings on standard benchmark datasets show that the proposed
approach has smaller test errors than state-of-the-art competing methods and
outperforms the competing methods in detecting out-of-distribution samples on

interpret the LOI stars in these regions to be stars accreted from two massive
dwarf galaxies with low-inclination prograde and retrograde orbits, affected to
different extents by dynamical friction due to their different orbital
directions. In contrast, the majority of the HOI stars have $e > 0.9$, and
exhibit a globally symmetric distribution of rotational velocities ($V_{\rm
\phi}$) near zero, although there is evidence for a small retrograde motion for
these stars ($V_{\rm \phi}$ $\sim$ -15 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$) in the outer-halo

high-inclination orbit. We also find that the LOI and HOI stars on highly

engineering applications, from animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems to
plant vasculature to plumbing networks and chemical plants. Understanding how
network topology, connectivity, internal boundaries and other geometrical
aspects affect the global flow state is a challenging problem that depends on
complex fluid properties characterized by different length and time scales. The
study of flow in micro-scale networks focuses on low Reynolds numbers where
small volumes of fluids move at slow speeds. The flow physics at these scales
is governed by the Stokes equation, which is linear. This linearity property
allows for relatively simple theoretical and computational solutions that
greatly aid in the understanding, modeling and designing of micro-scale
networks.
  At larger scales and faster flow rates, macrofluidic networks are also
important but the flow physics is quite different. The underlying Navier-Stokes
equation is nonlinear, theoretical results are few, simulations are
challenging, and the mapping between geometry and desired flow objectives are
all much more complex. The phenomenology for such high-Reynolds-number or
inertially-dominated flows is well documented and well-studied: Flows are
retarded in thin boundary layers near solid surfaces; such flows are sensitive
to geometry and tend to separate from surfaces; and vortices, wakes, jets and
unsteadiness abound. The counter-intuitive nature of inertial flows is
exemplified by the breakdown of reversibility. This dissertation explores two
general ways of how rectified flows emerge in macrofluidic networks as a
consequence of irreversibility and unsteady effects: When branches or channels
of a network have asymmetric internal geometry and the second when a network
contains loops.

tasks. This two-stage training process inevitably raises questions about the
generalization ability of the pre-trained model, which is particularly
pronounced when a salient domain gap exists between source and target data

function u. The state z of the system consists of two functions: the water
level $\zeta$ along the top boundary, and its time derivative $\partial$$\zeta$
$\partial$t. We prove that the solution of the water waves system converges to
the solution of the one dimensional wave equation with Neumann boundary
control, when taking the shallowness limit. Our approach is based on a special
change of variables and a scattering semigroup, which provide the possiblity to
apply the Trotter-Kato approximation theorem. Moreover, we use a detailed

Dirichlet to Neumann and Neumann to Neumann operators introduced in [1].

we learn an embedding to discriminate each instance from the others. We show
that even when only trained with images, the learned feature representation is
robust to instance appearance variations, and is thus able to track objects
steadily across frames. We further enhance the tracking capability of the
embedding by learning correspondence from unlabeled videos in a self-supervised
manner. In addition, we integrate this module into single-stage instance
segmentation and pose estimation frameworks, which significantly reduce the
computational complexity of tracking compared to two-stage networks. We conduct

diagrams motivate more reliable thermodynamic models to be developed. The
Modified Quasichemical Model within the two-sublattice Quadruplet Approximation

motivations. However, the model still needs to be further improved in order to
have better thermodynamic predictions of arbitrary reciprocal solutions. The
present paper proposes a new and generic formalism to characterize the Gibbs
energy of the ternary reciprocal quadruplet within the framework of the MQMQA.
The new formalism circumvents the problem spawned from solving the singular
matrix of mass equations. Resultantly, energy landscapes of reciprocal
solutions can be better defined everywhere in reciprocal composition spaces.
With the current improvement, the MQMQA is believed to be one of the most
reliable thermodynamic models for various types of solutions with or without

Applying this method leaves a single pair of viable solutions, in both of which
the major anomaly is generated by a planetary-mass third body of the lens, and

of acoustic phonons can be characterized by a topological charge $\mathfrak{q}$
that is a property of three-band systems with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, where
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are the inversion and the time-reversal

$\mathfrak{q}$ the topological acoustic triple point (TATP). The topological
charge $\mathfrak{q}$ can equivalently be characterized by the skyrmion number
of the longitudinal mode, or by the Euler number of the transverse modes, and
this strongly constrains the nodal structure around the TATP. The TATP can also
be symmetry-protected at high-symmetry momenta in the band structure of phonons
and spinless electrons by the $O_h$ and the $T_h$ groups. The nontrivial
wavefunction texture around the TATP can induce anomalous thermal transport in
phononic systems and orbital Hall effect in electronic systems. Our theory
demonstrates that the gapless points associated with the Nambu-Goldstone

establish a resource theory of one-shot catalytic randomness in which
uncorrelatedness is consumed in catalysis of randomness. We do so by completely
characterizing bipartite unitary operators that can be used to implement
catalysis of randomness using partial transpose. By doing so, we find that
every catalytic channel is factorizable, and therefore there exists a unital
channel that is not catalytic. We define a family of catalytic entropies that
quantifies catalytically extractable entropy within a quantum state and show
how much degeneracy of quantum state can boost the catalytic entropy beyond its
ordinary entropy. Based on this, we demonstrate that a randomness source can be
actually exhausted after a certain amount of randomness is extracted. We apply
this theory to systems under conservation law that forbids superposition of
certain quantum states and find that non-maximally mixed states can yield the
maximal catalytic entropy. We discuss implications of this theory to various

short cycles to improve BP performance. This is important for nonbinary quantum
codes since they may have more short cycles compared to binary quantum codes.
Several computer simulations are provided to demonstrate these advantages. The
scalar-based strategy can also be used to improve the BP decoding of classical
linear codes over GF$(2^l)$ with many short cycles.

an iterative contrastive learning framework that requires no data annotations.
At each iteration, the proposed method takes the 1) localization results in
images predicted in the previous iteration, and 2) semantic relationships
inferred from the audio signals as the pseudo-labels. We then use the
pseudo-labels to learn the correlation between the visual and audio signals
sampled from the same video (intra-frame sampling) as well as the association
between those extracted across videos (inter-frame relation). Our iterative
strategy gradually encourages the localization of the sounding objects and
reduces the correlation between the non-sounding regions and the reference

proposed framework performs favorably against existing unsupervised and
weakly-supervised methods on the sound localization task.

from real-time tracking and practical applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel tracking framework built on top of a space-time memory network that is
competent to make full use of historical information related to the target for
better adapting to appearance variations during tracking. Specifically, a novel
memory mechanism is introduced, which stores the historical information of the
target to guide the tracker to focus on the most informative regions in the
current frame. Furthermore, the pixel-level similarity computation of the
memory network enables our tracker to generate much more accurate bounding
boxes of the target. Extensive experiments and comparisons with many
competitive trackers on challenging large-scale benchmarks, OTB-2015,
TrackingNet, GOT-10k, LaSOT, UAV123, and VOT2018, show that, without bells and
whistles, our tracker outperforms all previous state-of-the-art real-time
methods while running at 37 FPS. The code is available at

Equal spin triplet pairs (ESTPs), as in superfluid $^3$He, are of great

remain elusive. Recently, odd-parity ESTPs were predicted to arise in
(few-)monolayer superconducting NbSe$_2$, from the non-colinearity between the
out-of-plane Ising spin-orbit field (due to the lack of inversion symmetry in
monolayer NbSe$_2$) and an applied in-plane magnetic field. These ESTPs couple
to the singlet order parameter at finite field. Using van der Waals tunnel
junctions, we perform spectroscopy of superconducting NbSe$_2$ flakes, of 2--25
monolayer thickness, measuring the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) as a
function of applied in-plane magnetic field up to 33T. In flakes $\lesssim$ 15
monolayers thick the DOS has a single superconducting gap. In these thin
samples, the magnetic field acts primarily on the spin (vs orbital) degree of
freedom of the electrons, and superconductivity is further protected by the
Ising field. The superconducting energy gap, extracted from our tunnelling
spectra, decreases as a function of the applied magnetic field. However, in
bilayer NbSe$_2$, close to the critical field (up to 30T, much larger than the
Pauli limit), superconductivity appears to be more robust than expected from
Ising protection alone. Our data can be explained by the above-mentioned ESTPs.

assume perfect knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI) during the

that all clients operate at the maximum achievable rate to transmit model data.
In this paper, we fill these gaps by proposing a training process that takes
channel statistics as a bias to minimize the convergence time under imperfect
CSI. Numerical experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the
training time by neglecting model updates from clients that cannot sustain a
minimum predefined transmission rate. We also examine the trade-off between

groups, and in particular with the study of the notion of
$\mathscr{P}$-rectifiable measure.
  First, we show that in arbitrary Carnot groups the natural
\textit{infinitesimal} definition of rectifiabile measure, i.e., the definition
given in terms of the existence of \textit{flat} tangent measures, is
equivalent to the global definition given in terms of coverings with
intrinsically differentiable graphs, i.e., graphs with \textit{flat} Hausdorff
tangents. In general we do not have the latter equivalence if we ask the
covering to be made of intrinsically Lipschitz graphs.
  Second, we show a geometric area formula for the centered Hausdorff measure
restricted to intrinsically differentiable graphs in arbitrary Carnot groups.
The latter formula extends and strengthens other area formulae obtained in the
literature in the context of Carnot groups.
  As an application, our analysis allows us to prove the intrinsic
$C^1$-rectifiability of almost all the preimages of a large class of Lipschitz
functions between Carnot groups. In particular, from the latter result, we
obtain that any geodesic sphere in a Carnot group equipped with an arbitrary
left-invariant homogeneous distance is intrinsic $C^1$-rectifiable.

transform to bring out spectral features. Computing a wavelet transform is
lighter than computing 3D CNN. The spectral features extracted are then
connected to the 2D CNN which bring out the spatial features, thereby creating
a spatial-spectral feature vector for classification. Overall a better model is
achieved that can classify multi-resolution HSI data with high accuracy.

contact line motion on the complex wall is prescribed via slip velocity in the
momentum equation and static/dynamic contact angle condition for the order
parameter of the Cahn-Hilliard model. This combination requires accurate
computations of the normal and tangential gradients of the scalar order
parameter and of the components of the velocity. However, the present algorithm
requires the computation of averaging weights and other geometrical variables

droplet spreading over a sphere, showing that the proposed algorithm is capable

Eulerian feature of the algorithm facilitates the implementation and provides a
straight-forward and potentially highly scalable parallelisation. The employed
parallelisation of the underlying Navier-Stokes solver can be efficiently used

Internet of Everything (IoE) devices that are connected via multi-hop networks.
Because FL algorithms hardly converge the parameters of machine learning (ML)
models, this paper focuses on the convergence of ML models in function spaces.
Considering that the representative loss functions of ML tasks e.g, mean
squared error (MSE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, are convex
functionals, algorithms that directly update functions in function spaces could
converge to the optimal solution. The key concept of this paper is to tailor a
consensus-based optimization algorithm to work in the function space and
achieve the global optimum in a distributed manner. This paper first analyzes
the convergence of the proposed algorithm in a function space, which is
referred to as a meta-algorithm, and shows that the spectral graph theory can
be applied to the function space in a manner similar to that of numerical
vectors. Then, consensus-based multi-hop federated distillation (CMFD) is
developed for a neural network (NN) to implement the meta-algorithm. CMFD
leverages knowledge distillation to realize function aggregation among adjacent
devices without parameter averaging. An advantage of CMFD is that it works even
with different NN models among the distributed learners. Although CMFD does not
perfectly reflect the behavior of the meta-algorithm, the discussion of the
meta-algorithm's convergence property promotes an intuitive understanding of
CMFD, and simulation evaluations show that NN models converge using CMFD for
several tasks. The simulation results also show that CMFD achieves higher
accuracy than parameter aggregation for weakly connected networks, and CMFD is
more stable than parameter aggregation methods.

key problem of automatically arranging a piece music was extensively studied,
while relatively fewer systems tackled this challenge in the audio domain. In
this contribution, we propose CycleDRUMS, a novel method for generating drums

follow the beat, sound credible and can be directly mixed with the input bass.
We formulated this task as an unpaired image-to-image translation problem, and
we addressed it with CycleGAN, a well-established unsupervised style transfer
framework, originally designed for treating images. The choice to deploy raw
audio and mel-spectrograms enabled us to better represent how humans perceive
music, and to potentially draw sounds for new arrangements from the vast
collection of music recordings accumulated in the last century. In absence of
an objective way of evaluating the output of both generative adversarial
networks and music generative systems, we further defined a possible metric for
the proposed task, partially based on human (and expert) judgement. Finally, as
a comparison, we replicated our results with Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image
translation network, and we showed that our approach outperforms it.

facilitated realistic single-object image generation based on language input.
However, complex-scene generation (with various interactions among multiple
objects) still suffers from messy layouts and object distortions, due to
diverse configurations in layouts and appearances. Prior methods are mostly
object-driven and ignore their inter-relations that play a significant role in
complex-scene images. This work explores relationship-aware complex-scene image
generation, where multiple objects are inter-related as a scene graph. With the
help of relationships, we propose three major updates in the generation
framework. First, reasonable spatial layouts are inferred by jointly
considering the semantics and relationships among objects. Compared to standard
location regression, we show relative scales and distances serve a more
reliable target. Second, since the relations between objects significantly
influence an object's appearance, we design a relation-guided generator to
generate objects reflecting their relationships. Third, a novel scene graph
discriminator is proposed to guarantee the consistency between the generated
image and the input scene graph. Our method tends to synthesize plausible
layouts and objects, respecting the interplay of multiple objects in an image.
Experimental results on Visual Genome and HICO-DET datasets show that our
proposed method significantly outperforms prior arts in terms of IS and FID
metrics. Based on our user study and visual inspection, our method is more
effective in generating logical layout and appearance for complex-scenes.

the whole population of classical novae in the Galaxy. Individual novae are too
dim to be detectable in soft $\gamma$-rays, and the upper bounds on their flux
and ejecta mass uncertainties cover several orders of magnitude. Within the
framework of our hierarchical model, we can, nevertheless, infer tight upper
bounds on the $\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ ejecta masses, given all uncertainties from
individual objects as well as diffuse emission, of $<2.0 \times
10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (99.85th percentile). In the context of ONe
nucleosynthesis, the $\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ bounds are consistent with theoretical
expectations, and exclude that most ONe novae happen on white dwarfs with
masses around $1.35\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The upper bounds from
$\mathrm{^{7}Be}$ are uninformative. From the combined ejecta mass estimate of
$\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ and its $\beta^+$-decay, we infer a positron production rate
of $<5.5 \times 10^{42}\,\mathrm{e^+\,s^{-1}}$, which would make at most 10% of
the total annihilation rate in the Milky Way.

is crucial for the industrial adoption of 2D materials in optoelectronics. In
this work, the lateral growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) over an insulating
surface is demonstrated using electrochemical deposition. By fabricating a new
type of microelectrodes, MoS2 2D films grown from TiN electrodes across
opposite sides have been connected over an insulating substrate, hence, forming
a lateral device structure through only one lithography and deposition step.
Using a variety of characterization techniques, the growth rate of MoS2 has
been shown to be highly anisotropic with lateral to vertical growth ratios
exceeding 20-fold. Electronic and photo-response measurements on the device
structures demonstrate that the electrodeposited MoS2 layers behave like
semiconductors, confirming their potential for photodetection applications.
This lateral growth technique paves the way towards room temperature, scalable
and site-selective production of various transition metal dichalcogenides and
their lateral heterostructures for 2D materials-based fabricated devices.

mobile devices for practical learning tasks, where each device only has very
few training data. This is a commonly encountered situation in mobile computing
scenarios, where data is scarce and distributed while the tasks are distinct.
In this paper, we propose a federated few-shot learning (FedFSL) framework to
learn a few-shot classification model that can classify unseen data classes
with only a few labeled samples. With the federated learning strategy, FedFSL
can utilize many data sources while keeping data privacy and communication
efficiency. There are two technical challenges: 1) directly using the existing
federated learning approach may lead to misaligned decision boundaries produced
by client models, and 2) constraining the decision boundaries to be similar
over clients would overfit to training tasks but not adapt well to unseen
tasks. To address these issues, we propose to regularize local updates by
minimizing the divergence of client models. We also formulate the training in
an adversarial fashion and optimize the client models to produce a
discriminative feature space that can better represent unseen data samples. We
demonstrate the intuitions and conduct experiments to show our approaches
outperform baselines by more than 10% in learning vision tasks and 5% in

magnitude in a single flow configuration (e.g., inside the Knudsen layer it is
at the order of mean free path of gas molecules, while in the bulk region it is
at a much larger hydrodynamic scale). Therefore, efficient implicit numerical
method is urgently needed for time-dependent problems. However, the
integro-differential nature of gas kinetic equations poses a grand challenge,
as the gain part of the collision operator is non-invertible. Hence an
iterative solver is required in each time step, which usually takes a lot of
iterations in the (near) continuum flow regime where the Knudsen number is
small; worse still, the solution does not asymptotically preserve the fluid
dynamic limit when the spatial cell size is not refined enough. Inspired by our
general synthetic iteration scheme for steady-state solution of the Boltzmann
equation, we propose two numerical schemes to push the multiscale simulation of
unsteady rarefied gas flows to a new boundary, that is, the numerical solution
not only converges within dozens of iterations in each time step, but also
asymptotic preserves the Navier-Stokes-Fourier limit at coarse spatial grid,
even when the time step is large (e.g., in the extreme slow decay of
two-dimensional Taylor vortex, the time step is at the order of vortex decay
time). The properties of fast convergence and asymptotic preserving of the
proposed schemes are not only rigorously proven by the Fourier stability
analysis, but also demonstrated by solid numerical examples.

size law with the block size decreasing by a factor $\lambda \, > 1$ in each
subsequent generation. In the first part of the paper the number of coastal
points (in $D=1)$ or coastlines (in $D=2)$ is calculated, which are points or
lines that separate a region at ""sea level"" and an elevated region. We find
that this number possesses a non-universal character, implying a Euclidean
geometry below a threshold value $P_c$ of the deposition probability $P$, and a
fractal geometry above this value. Exactly at the threshold, the geometry is
logarithmic fractal. The number of coastlines in $D=2$ turns out to be exactly
twice the number of coastal points in $D=1$. We comment briefly on the surface
morphology and derive a roughness exponent $\alpha$. In the second part, we
study the percolation probability for a current in this model and two
extensions of it, in which both the scale factor and the deposition probability
can take on different values between generations. We find that the percolation
threshold $P_c$ is located at exactly the same value for the deposition
probability as the threshold probability of the number of coastal points. This
coincidence suggests that exactly at the onset of percolation for a conducting

handled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In
this paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position

temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as
identity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules
can make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors,
therefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for
association. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost
identity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention
modules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position
prediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong
robustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our proposed model over a wide range of existing methods on MOTChallenge

energies from human motions. A tradeoff between harvesting energy and keeping
the user's natural movements should be balanced via optimization techniques. In
previous studies, the hardware itself has been specialized in advance for a
single task like walking with constant speed on a flat. A key ingredient is
Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) to extend it applicable for multiple
tasks. CVT could continuously adjust its gear ratio to balance the tradeoff for
each task; however, such gear-ratio optimization problem remains open yet since
its optimal solution may depend on the user, motion, and environment.
Therefore, this paper focuses on a framework for data-driven optimization of a
gear ratio in a CVT-equipped biomechanical energy harvester. Since the data
collection requires a heavy burden on the user, we have to optimize the gear
ratio for each task in the shortest possible time. To this end, our framework
is designed sample-efficiently based on the fact that the user encounters
multiple tasks, which are with similarities with each other. Specifically, our
framework employs multi-task Bayesian optimization to reuse the optimization
results of the similar tasks previously optimized by finding their
similarities. Through experiments, we confirmed that, for each task, the
proposed framework could achieve the optimal gear ratio of around 50~\% faster
than one by random search, and that takes only around 20~minutes. Experimental
results also suggested that the optimization can be accelerated by actively
exploiting similarities with previously optimized tasks.

Self-Seeding (HLSS) that allows to improve the longitudinal coherence and
spectral power of a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL. This
concept was tested at FLASH in the range of 4.5 - 15 nm and at PAL XFEL at 1
nm. In this paper we present recent results from the European XFEL where we
successfully demonstrated harmonic lasing at 5.9 Angstrom and 2.8 Angstrom. In
the latter case we obtained both 3rd and 5th harmonic lasing and, for the first
time, operated a harmonic lasing cascade (5th-3rd-1st harmonics of the
undulator). These results pave the way for reaching very high photon energies,
up to 100 keV.

(RL), is expected to be applied for complex robotic tasks. Traditional RL
requires a policy to be optimized is state-dependent, that means, the policy is
a kind of feedback (FB) controllers. Due to the necessity of correct state
observation in such a FB controller, it is sensitive to sensing failures. To
alleviate this drawback of the FB controllers, feedback error learning
integrates one of them with a feedforward (FF) controller. RL can be improved
by dealing with the FB/FF policies, but to the best of our knowledge, a
methodology for learning them in a unified manner has not been developed. In
this paper, we propose a new optimization problem for optimizing both the FB/FF
policies simultaneously. Inspired by control as inference, the optimization
problem considers minimization/maximization of divergences between trajectory,
predicted by the composed policy and a stochastic dynamics model, and
optimal/non-optimal trajectories. By approximating the stochastic dynamics
model using variational method, we naturally derive a regularization between
the FB/FF policies. In numerical simulations and a robot experiment, we
verified that the proposed method can stably optimize the composed policy even
with the different learning law from the traditional RL. In addition, we
demonstrated that the FF policy is robust to the sensing failures and can hold
the optimal motion. Attached video is also uploaded on youtube:

evaluation, treatment and data comparisons over time, and clinical decision
support. The classification principles underlying these ontologies are guided
by the analysis of observable pathological similarities between disorders,
often based on anatomical or histological principles. Although, thanks to
recent advances in molecular biology, disease ontologies are slowly changing to
integrate the etiological and genetic origins of diseases, nosology still
reflects this ""reductionist"" perspective. Proximity relationships of disease
modules (hereafter DMs) in the human interactome network are now increasingly
used in diagnostics, to identify pathobiologically similar diseases and to
support drug repurposing and discovery. On the other hand, similarity relations
induced from structural proximity of DMs also have several limitations, such as
incomplete knowledge of disease-gene relationships and reliability of clinical
trials to assess their validity. The purpose of the study described in this
paper is to shed more light on disease similarities by analyzing the
relationship between categorical proximity of diseases in human-curated
ontologies and structural proximity of the related DM in the interactome.
Method: We propose a methodology (and related algorithms) to automatically
induce a hierarchical structure from proximity relations between DMs, and to
compare this structure with a human-curated disease taxonomy. Results: We
demonstrate that the proposed methodology allows to systematically analyze
commonalities and differences among structural and categorical similarity of
human diseases, help refine and extend human disease classification systems,
and identify promising network areas where new disease-gene interactions can be
discovered.

We investigate 16 different migration cases in a grounded theory interview

with two methods: (1) using the so-called geomagnetically quiet day (QD) to
calculate mean daily variations and (2) using the principal component analysis
(PCA) to decompose original series into main variability modes. The original
geomagnetic field series were obtained at the Coimbra Magnetic Observatory
(COI, Portugal) in 01.01.2007-31.12.2017. The data were analyzed separately for
each of 12 months. The geomagnetic field components X, Y and Z were analyzed
independently. The Sq and SD variations obtained with QD were compared with the
principal components from PCA (PCs, daily variation of the geomagnetic field of
different types) using the correlation analysis. In this study only the PCA
ability to extract daily variations similar to ones acquired using the standard
approach with QD was analyzed. The results for X, and Y and Z are essentially
different. The Sq variation is always filtered to the 1st PCA mode for Y and Z,
whereas the SD variation is filtered either to the 2nd or 3rd mode. For X the
Sq variation tends to be filtered to the 2nd mode, while the SD variation is
more often filtered to the 1st mode. The number of the PCs classified either as
Sq or SD follows seasonal and decadal variations of the geomagnetic activity.
The analysis showed that PCA can automatically extract the Sq variation from
the observations of Y and Z; however complementary analysis (for example, a
comparison to a reference curve) is needed to identify a PC corresponding to
the SD variation. For X component, the automatic extraction of the Sq or SD
variations is not possible, and the complementary analysis is always needed.

levels of organization. This scenario typically presents an evolutionary
conflict between the incentive of individuals to cheat and the collective
incentive to establish cooperation within a group. Generalizing previous work
on multilevel selection in evolutionary game theory, we consider a hyperbolic
PDE model of a group-structured population, in which members within a single
group compete with each other for individual-level replication; while the group
also competes against other groups for group-level replication. We derive a
threshold level of the relative strength of between-group competition such that
defectors take over the population below the threshold while cooperation
persists in the long-time population above the threshold. Under stronger
assumptions on the initial distribution of group compositions, we further prove
that the population converges to a steady state density supporting cooperation
for between-group selection strength above the threshold. We further establish
long-time bounds on the time-average of the collective payoff of the
population, showing that the long-run population cannot outperform the payoff
of a full-cooperator group even in the limit of infinitely-strong between-group
competition. When the group replication rate is maximized by an intermediate
level of within-group cooperation, individual-level selection casts a long
shadow on the dynamics of multilevel selection: no level of between-group
competition can erase the effects of the individual incentive to defect. We
further extend our model to study the case of multiple types of groups, showing
how the games that groups play can coevolve with the level of cooperation.

natural choice based on Taylor expansions, whereas the second is
derivative-free and relies on a multiprecision perturb-and-diagonalize
approach. In particular, the appropriate use of multiprecision guarantees
backward stability without affecting the efficiency in the generic case. This
makes the second approach more robust. The whole method has cubic complexity

harmonic heat flow and their formation patterns. After works of
Coron-Ghidaglia, Ding and Chen-Ding, one knows blow-up solutions under
smallness of initial energy for m>=3. soon later, 2 dimensional blowup
solutions were found by Chang-Ding-Ye. The first part of this paper is devoted
to construction of new examples of finite time blow-up solutions without
smallness conditions for 3<=m<7. In fact, when considering rotational symmetric
harmonic heat flow from B_1\subset R^m to S^m\subset R^{m+1}, we will prove
that the maximal solution blows up in finite time if b>\vartheta_m, and exists
for all time if 0<b<\pi/2. This result can be regarded as a generalization of
results of Chang-Ding-Ye nad Chang-Ding to higher dimensional case, which
relies on a completely different argument. The second part of the paper study
the rate of blow-up solutions. When M is a bounded domain in R^2 and consider
Dirichlet boundary condition on \partial M, Hamilton has obtained that the
blowup rate must be faster than (T-t)^{-1}. Under a similar setting, it was
later improved a litttle by Topping to (T-t)^{-1}|log(T-t)|. In this paper, we
will extend the results to all Riemmanian surfaces M and improve the rate of
Topping to (T-t)^{-1}a(|log(T-t)|) for any positive nondecreasing function
a(\tau) satisfying $\int^\infty_1\frac{d\tau}{a(\tau)}=+\infty$, which is
comparable to a recent result of Raphael-Schweyer for rotational symmetric
solutions. Turning to the higher dimensional case 3<=m<7, we will demonstrate a
completely different phenomenon by showing that all rotational symmetric
blow-up solutions can not be type II, which is different to the case m>=7 by
Bizon-Wasserman. Finally, we also present result of finite time type I blowup

attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output
prediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for
each prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual
information with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions
that have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify
all informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are
highlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis.
Moreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using
Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score
labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we
propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed
attribution/saliency maps. We evaluate our methods using both human-centric

degradations in real-world applications, previous methods rely on degradation
estimation to reconstruct the SR image. Nevertheless, degradation estimation
methods are usually time-consuming and may lead to SR failure due to large

various degradations in the representation space rather than explicit

Statistical Isotropy (SI) of the universe. For the analysis we use the $\alpha$
statistic that is devised from the contour Minkowski tensor, a tensorial
generalization of the scalar Minkowski functional, the contour length. In
essence, the $\alpha$ statistic captures the ellipticity of isofield contours
at any chosen threshold value of a smooth random field and provides a measure
of anisotropy. The SI of the observed convergence map is tested against the
suite of realistic simulations of the convergence map provided by the Planck
collaboration. We first carry out a global analysis using the full sky data

data is consistent with SI. Further we carry out a local search for departure
from SI in small patches of the sky using $\alpha$. This analysis reveals
several sky patches which exhibit deviations from simulations with statistical
significance higher than 95\% confidence level (CL). Our analysis indicates
that the source of the anomalous behaviour of most of the outlier patches is
inaccurate estimation of noise. We identify two outlier patches which exhibit
anomalous behaviour originating from departure from SI at higher than 95\% CL.
Most of the anomalous patches are found to be located roughly along the

generalization known as Minkowski tensors, we analyze the statistical
properties of one of the major foreground components, namely the Galactic
synchrotron given by the full sky 408 MHz Haslam map. We focus on understanding
the nature of non-Gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the cooler regions of
the map as a function of angular scale. We find that the overall level of the
non-Gaussian deviations does decrease as more high emission regions are masked
and as we go down to smaller scales, in agreement with the results obtained in
earlier works. However, they remain significantly high, of order 3.3$\sigma$,
at the smallest angular scales relevant for the Haslam map. We carry out a
detailed examination of the non-Gaussian nature using the generalized skewness
and kurtosis cumulants that arise in the perturbative expansion of Minkowski
functionals for weakly non-Gaussian fields. We find that the leading sources of
non-Gaussianity are the kurtosis terms which are considerably larger than the
skewness terms at all angular scales. Further, for the cooler regions of the
Haslam map, we find that the non-Gaussian deviations of the Minkowski
functionals can be well explained by the perturbative expansion up to
second-order (up to kurtosis terms), with first-order terms being sub-dominant.
Lastly, we test the statistical isotropy of the Haslam map and find that it
becomes increasingly more isotropic at smaller scales.

the introduction of an anisotropic stochastic term, which allows us to ensure

waves. Results: The energy and time signature for the neutrino-antineutrino
annihilation is compared with the observed isotropic energy for a short
gamma-ray burst. The misalignment angle evolves to align the star's tilt axis,
which can lead to the sudden increase or decrease of radio intensity from the
pulsar. The corresponding gravitational wave emission, both continuous and
burst, all lead towards multimessenger signals coming from the phase

  Models",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a widely deployed optimization procedure
throughout data-driven and simulation-driven disciplines, which has drawn a
substantial interest in understanding its global behavior across a broad class
of nonconvex problems and noise models. Recent analyses of SGD have made
noteworthy progress in this direction, and these analyses have innovated
important and insightful new strategies for understanding SGD. However, these
analyses often have imposed certain restrictions (e.g., convexity, global
Lipschitz continuity, uniform Holder continuity, expected smoothness, etc.)
that leave room for innovation. In this work, we address this gap by proving
that, for a rather general class of nonconvex functions and noise models, SGD's
iterates either diverge to infinity or converge to a stationary point with
probability one. By further restricting to globally Holder continuous functions
and the expected smoothness noise model, we prove that -- regardless of whether
the iterates diverge or remain finite -- the norm of the gradient function
evaluated at SGD's iterates converges to zero with probability one and in
expectation. As a result of our work, we broaden the scope of nonconvex
problems and noise models to which SGD can be applied with rigorous guarantees
of its global behavior.

for aggregating and processing visual, auditory, and lexical information for
many tasks related to human-generated data. Human language makes use of a large
and varying number of features, lexical and constructional items as well as
contextual and discourse-specific data of various types, which all interact to
represent various aspects of communicative information. Some of these features
are mostly local and useful for the organisation of e.g. argument structure of
a predication; others are persistent over the course of a discourse and
necessary for achieving a reasonable level of understanding of the content.
This paper describes a model for high-dimensional representation for utterance
and text level data including features such as constructions or contextual
data, based on a mathematically principled and behaviourally plausible approach
to representing linguistic information. The implementation of the
representation is a straightforward extension of Random Indexing models
previously used for lexical linguistic items. The paper shows how the
implemented model is able to represent a broad range of linguistic features in
a common integral framework of fixed dimensionality, which is computationally
habitable, and which is suitable as a bridge between symbolic representations
such as dependency analysis and continuous representations used e.g. in
classifiers or further machine-learning approaches. This is achieved with
operations on vectors that constitute a powerful computational algebra,
accompanied with an associative memory for the vectors. The paper provides a
technical overview of the framework and a worked through implemented example of
how it can be applied to various types of linguistic features.

different flavor-changing neutral current NSI parameters. Applying these two
scenarios to the COHERENT measurement, we derive limits on charged current NSI
and find that more data is required to compete with the existing limits.
Regarding CP-phases, we show how the limits on the NSI parameters depend
dramatically on the values of the phases. Accidentally, the same parameters
influencing coherent scattering also show up in neutrino oscillation
experiments. We find that COHERENT provides complementary constraints on the
set of NSI parameters that can explain the discrepancy in the best-fit value of
the standard CP-phase obtained by T2K and NO$\nu$A, while the significance with

indicate that the dependences of polariton wavelength on gap distance for HPhPs
in lower and upper Reststrahlen bands are opposite to each other. Most
interestingly, the tuning range of the polariton wavelengths for HPhPs in the
lower band, which exhibit in-plane hyperbolicities, is wider than that for the
HPhPs in the upper band of out-of-plane hyperbolicities. A polariton wavelength
elongation up to 160% and a reduction of damping rate up to 35% are obtained.
These findings can not only provide fundamental insights into manipulation of

trend of deploying object detectors on embedded systems where post-processing
steps such as non-maximum suppression can be a bottleneck, the impact of the
anchors used in the detection head is becoming increasingly more important. In
this work, we show that many anchors in the object detection head can be
removed without any loss in accuracy. With additional retraining, anchor
pruning can even lead to improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on SSD and MS

simultaneously increasing accuracy. Further experiments on RetinaNet and PASCAL

spectroscopic monitoring of the star in 2013-2020, we detected variations in
H-alpha and NaI D absorptions at radial velocities of infall (accretion) and
outflow (wind) with a period of about 22 days. The absorptions in the infalling

accompanied by a decrease of outflow, and vice versa. These flip-flop
oscillations retain phase over several years of observations. We suggest that
this may result from the MHD processes at the disk-magnetosphere boundary in
the propeller mode. Another possibility is that a massive planet modulates some
processes in the disc and provides the observed effects. The period, if
Keplerian, corresponds to a distance of 0.2 AU, which is close to the dust
sublimation radius in this star. The presence of the putative planet may be
confirmed by radial velocity measurements: expected amplitude is > 90 m/s if a

the search for cathode materials relies on experimental trial-and-error and a
traversing of existing computational/experimental databases. While these
methods have led to the discovery of several commercially-viable cathode
materials, the chemical space explored so far is limited and many phases will
have been overlooked, in particular those that are metastable. We describe a
computational framework for battery cathode exploration, based on ab initio
random structure searching (AIRSS), an approach that samples local minima on
the potential energy surface to identify new crystal structures. We show that,
by delimiting the search space using a number of constraints, including
chemically aware minimum interatomic separations, cell volumes, and space group
symmetries, AIRSS can efficiently predict both thermodynamically stable and
metastable cathode materials. Specifically, we investigate LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and
LixCuyFz to demonstrate the efficiency of the method by rediscovering the known
crystal structures of these cathode materials. The effect of parameters, such
as minimum separations and symmetries, on the efficiency of the sampling is
discussed in detail. The adaptation of the minimum interatomic distances, on a
species-pair basis, from low-energy optimized structures to efficiently capture
the local coordination environment of atoms, is explored. A family of novel
cathode materials based, on the transition-metal oxalates,is proposed. They
demonstrate superb energy density, oxygen-redox stability, and lithium
diffusion properties. This article serves both as an introduction to the
computational framework, and as a guide to battery cathode material discovery
using AIRSS.

elusive so far. Here, by employing superconducting transport measurements in

superconductivity in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. The central observations are
the substantial anomalous enhancement of the critical current by small magnetic
fields applied perpendicularly to the plane of electron motion, and the
asymmetric response with respect to the magnetic field direction. These
features have a unique trend in intensity and sign upon electrostatic gating
that, together with their dependence on temperature and nanowire dimensions,
cannot be accommodated within a scenario of canonical spin-singlet
superconductivity. We theoretically demonstrate that the hall-marks of the

findings establishes the occurrence of independent components of unconventional

makers that enable censorship-resistant decentralized exchange on public
blockchains. Arbitrage trades have been shown to align the prices reported by
CFMMs with those of external markets. These trades impose costs on Liquidity
Providers (LPs) who supply reserves to CFMMs. Trading fees have been proposed
as a mechanism for compensating LPs for arbitrage losses. However, large fees
reduce the accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to
deviate from desirable asset compositions. CFMM designers are therefore faced
with the problem of how to optimally select fees to attract liquidity. We
develop a framework for determining the value to LPs of supplying liquidity to
a CFMM with fees when the underlying process follows a general diffusion.
Focusing on a popular class of CFMMs which we call Geometric Mean Market Makers

functional theory, we calculate the effects of electron and hole doping, first

Al and Sc for hole doping). We find that, apart from a surprising increase in
polarization at small hole concentrations, both charge-carrier types decrease
the tendency towards ferroelectricity, with the strength of the polarization
suppression, which is different for electrons and holes, determined by the
detailed structure of the conduction and valence bands. Doping with impurity
atoms increases the complexity and allows us to identify three factors that
influence the ferroelectricity: structural effects arising largely from the
size of the impurity ion, electronic effects from the introduction of charge
carriers, and changes in unit-cell volume and shape. A competing balance
between these contributions can result in an increase or decrease in
ferroelectricity with doping.

that allows to quantify the anisotropy and componentiality of the flow at any
scale. Using this the bubbles are found to significantly enhance flow
anisotropy at all scales compared with the unladen case, and for some bubble
cases, very strong anisotropy persists down to the smallest flow scales. The
strongest anisotropy observed was for the cases involving small bubbles.
Concerning the inter-scale energy transfer, our results indicate that for the
bubble-laden cases, the energy transfer is from large to small scales, just as
for the unladen case. However, there is evidence of an upscale transfer when
considering the transfer of energy associated with particular components of the
velocity field. Although the direction of the energy transfer is the same with
and without the bubbles, the transfer is much stronger for the bubble-laden
cases, suggesting that the bubbles play a strong role in enhancing the activity
of the nonlinear term in the flow. The normalized forms of the fourth and
sixth-order structure functions are also considered, and reveal that the
introduction of bubbles into the flow strongly enhances intermittency in the
dissipation range, but suppresses it at larger scales. This strong enhancement
of the dissipation scale intermittency has significant implications for
understanding how the bubbles might modify the mixing properties of turbulent

With regularity conditions, it is shown that under the proposed regularization,

obey GMO relations which are linear in the baryon masses, whilst mesons as
bosons follow quadratic GMO relations. In this work, I challenge the
distinction of GMO relations for baryons and mesons and conclude that both
linear and quadratic GMO relations apply to both baryons and mesons in most
instances (exceptions are the pseudoscalar meson octet and the mass relations
following from heavy quark symmetry). I support this claim by presenting an
in-depth analysis of the GMO relations on a theoretical and experimental level.
On the theoretical side, two approaches to the derivation of the GMO relations
are given and isospin symmetry breaking, electromagnetic contributions, and
heavy quark symmetry are incorporated into the mass relations. Both linear and
quadratic mass relations are checked against experimentally determined hadron

networks, Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) adoption is gaining momentum. With a
full scale ZTA implementation, it is unlikely that adversaries will be able to
spread through the network starting from a compromised endpoint. However, the
already authenticated and authorised session of a compromised endpoint can be
leveraged to perform limited, though malicious, activities ultimately rendering
the endpoints the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively detect such attacks,
distributed collaborative intrusion detection systems with an attack
scenario-based approach have been developed. Nonetheless, Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs) have demonstrated their ability to bypass this approach with a
high success ratio. As a result, adversaries can pass undetected or potentially
alter the detection logging mechanisms to achieve a stealthy presence.
Recently, blockchain technology has demonstrated solid use cases in the cyber
security domain. In this paper, motivated by the convergence of ZTA and
blockchain-based intrusion detection and prevention, we examine how ZTA can be
augmented onto endpoints. Namely, we perform a state-of-the-art review of ZTA
models, real-world architectures with a focus on endpoints, and
blockchain-based intrusion detection systems. We discuss the potential of
blockchain's immutability fortifying the detection process and identify open
challenges as well as potential solutions and future directions.

Recent
work achieves promising performance by optimizing the Intersection over
Union~(IoU). However, IoU-based loss has the gradient vanish problem in the
case of low overlapping bounding boxes, and the model could easily ignore these
simple cases. In this paper, we propose Side Overlap~(SO) loss by maximizing
the side overlap of two bounding boxes, which puts more penalty for low
overlapping bounding box cases. Besides, to speed up the convergence, the
Corner Distance~(CD) is added into the objective function. Combining the Side
Overlap and Corner Distance, we get a new regression objective function,
\textit{Side and Corner Align Loss~(SCALoss)}. The SCALoss is well-correlated
with IoU loss, which also benefits the evaluation metric but produces more
penalty for low-overlapping cases. It can serve as a comprehensive similarity
measure, leading to better localization performance and faster convergence
speed. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and LVIS benchmarks show that SCALoss
can bring consistent improvement and outperform $\ell_n$ loss and IoU based
loss with popular object detectors such as YOLOV3, SSD, Faster-RCNN. Code is

Within the intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime characteristic of large
polarons, the approach takes into account on the same footing polaron formation
and polaron-polaron correlations which play a relevant role going from low to
high charge densities. Including fluctuations on top of the variational
approach, the electronic spectral function is calculated from the weak to the
intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime finding a peak-dip-hump line
shape. The spectra are characterized by a transfer of spectral weight from the
incoherent hump to the coherent peak with decreasing the electron-phonon
coupling constant or with increasing the particle density. Three different
density regimes stem out: the first, at low densities, where the features of a
single large polaron with a substantial incoherent spectral weight are not
modified by charge carrier interactions; a second one, at intermediate
densities, where the polaronic liquid shows a rapid crossover from incoherent
to coherent dynamics; the third one, at high densities, where screening effects
are so prominent that the system presents a conventional metallic phase. The
results obtained in the low to intermediate density regime turn out to be

Focusing on dynamics at formally infinite temperature, we particularly consider
the autocorrelation functions of local densities, where the time evolution is
governed either by the linear Schr\""odinger equation in the quantum case, or
the nonlinear Hamiltonian equations of motion in the case of classical
mechanics. While, in full generality, a quantitative agreement between quantum
and classical dynamics can therefore not be expected, our large-scale numerical
results for spin-$1/2$ systems with up to $N = 36$ lattice sites in fact defy
this expectation. Specifically, we observe a remarkably good agreement for all
geometries, which is best for the nonintegrable quantum models in quasi-one or
two dimensions, but still satisfactory in the case of integrable chains, at
least if transport properties are not dominated by the extensive number of
conservation laws. Our findings indicate that classical or semi-classical

To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without

parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in
the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location
restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact
the interpretation of parameters and can affect counterfactuals. Importantly,
with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions are
overidentifying and lead to biased estimators. Consequently, simply changing

reason about resource usage protocols, such as we might find in distributed and
concurrent programming, where the state of a communication channel changes
throughout program execution. As yet, however, there has not been a full-scale

new version of the dependently typed language Idris, with a new core language
based on QTT, supporting linear and dependent types. In this paper, we
introduce Idris 2, and describe how QTT has influenced its design. We give

are still limited to find a better description of spatial relationships between
traffic conditions due to: (1) ignoring the prior of the observed topology of
the road network; (2) neglecting the presence of negative spatial
relationships; and (3) lacking investigation on uncertainty of the graph
structure. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Graph Convolutional Network
(BGCN) framework to alleviate these issues. Under this framework, the graph
structure is viewed as a random realization from a parametric generative model,
and its posterior is inferred using the observed topology of the road network
and traffic data. Specifically, the parametric generative model is comprised of
two parts: (1) a constant adjacency matrix which discovers potential spatial
relationships from the observed physical connections between roads using a
Bayesian approach; (2) a learnable adjacency matrix that learns a global shared
spatial correlations from traffic data in an end-to-end fashion and can model
negative spatial correlations. The posterior of the graph structure is then
approximated by performing Monte Carlo dropout on the parametric graph
structure. We verify the effectiveness of our method on five real-world

the late-type target galaxy encounters an equally massive companion galaxy,
which has either a late or an early-type morphology, with the closest approach
distance of about 50 kpc, in prograde or retrograde sense. By examining the
time change of the circular velocity of the disk material of the target galaxy
from each case, we find that the target galaxy tends to lose the spin through
prograde collisions but hardly through retrograde collisions, regardless of the
companion galaxy type. The decrease of the spin results mainly from the
deflection of the orbit of the disk material by tidal disruption. Although
there is some disk material which gains the circular velocity through
hydrodynamic as well as gravitational interactions or by transferring material
from the companion galaxy, it turns out that the amount of the material is
generally insufficient to increase the overall galactic spin under the
conditions we set. It is found that the spin angular momentum of the target
galaxy disk decreases by 15 - 20% after a prograde collision. We conclude that
the accumulated effects of galaxy-galaxy interactions will play an important

Specifically, the ground-state energy, the correlation energy, the interaction

behavior of the PCF, SSF, and MD. The system evolves from two monowires of
density parameter $r_\text{s}$ to a single monowire of density parameter

Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid behavior with a power-law nature near

magnitude has been demonstrated at the spinel/perovskite {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3
interface compared to the paradigm perovskite/perovskite LaAlO3/SrTiO3. We
explore the fundamental physics behind this phenomenon from direct measurements
of the momentum-resolved electronic structure of this interface using resonant
soft-X-ray angle-resolved photoemission. We find an anomaly in orbital ordering
of the mobile electrons in {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 which depopulates electron
states in the top STO layer. This rearrangement of the mobile electron system
pushes the electron density away from the interface that reduces its overlap
with the interfacial defects and weakens the electron-phonon interaction, both
effects contributing to the mobility boost. A crystal-field analysis shows that
the band order alters owing to the symmetry breaking between the spinel

(non-buoyant and non-inertial particles or gaseous admixtures) is developed for
stably stratified turbulence. The physical background of the EFB turbulence
closures is based on the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic and
potential energies and turbulent fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, as well as
the turbulent flux of particles. The EFB turbulence closure is designed for
stratified geophysical flows from neutral to very stable stratification and it
implies that turbulence is maintained by the velocity shear at any
stratification. In a steady-state, expressions for the turbulent flux of
passive scalar and the anisotropic non-symmetric turbulent diffusion tensor are
derived, and universal flux Richardson number dependencies of the components of
this tensor are obtained. The diagonal component in the vertical direction of
the turbulent diffusion tensor is suppressed by strong stratification, while
the diagonal components in the horizontal directions are not suppressed, and
they are dominant in comparison with the other components of turbulent
diffusion tensor. This implies that any initially created strongly
inhomogeneous particle cloud is evolved into a thin pancake in horizontal plane
with very slow increase of its thickness in the vertical direction. The
turbulent Schmidt number increases linearly with the gradient Richardson
number. Considering the applications of these results to the atmospheric
boundary-layer turbulence, the theoretical relationships are derived which
allow to determine the turbulent diffusion tensor as a function of the vertical
coordinate measured in the units of the local Obukhov length scale. The
obtained relations are potentially useful in modelling applications of particle
dispersion in the atmospheric boundary-layer turbulence and free atmosphere
turbulence.

for large machine learning tasks. In this paper, we argue that existing PSs are
inefficient for tasks that exhibit non-uniform parameter access; their
performance may even fall behind that of single node baselines. We identify two
major sources of such non-uniform access: skew and sampling. Existing PSs are
ill-suited for managing skew because they uniformly apply the same parameter
management technique to all parameters. They are inefficient for sampling
because the PS is oblivious to the associated randomized accesses and cannot
exploit locality. To overcome these performance limitations, we introduce NuPS,
a novel PS architecture that (i) integrates multiple management techniques and
employs a suitable technique for each parameter and (ii) supports sampling
directly via suitable sampling primitives and sampling schemes that allow for a
controlled quality--efficiency trade-off. In our experimental study, NuPS
outperformed existing PSs by up to one order of magnitude and provided up to
linear scalability across multiple machine learning tasks.

vorticity (PV) structure, a phenomenon identified in observations, reanalysis
and some numerical simulations. Some recent modeling studies have proposed that
condensation of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the winter pole is a contributing
factor to maintaining the annulus through the release of latent heat. Dust and
topographic forcing are also known to be causes of internal and interannual
variability in the polar vortices. However, coupling between these factors
remains uncertain, and previous studies of their impact on vortex structure and
variability have been largely limited to a single Martian global climate model
(MGCM). Here, by further developing a novel MGCM, we decompose the relative
roles of latent heat and dust as drivers for the variability and structure of
the northern Martian polar vortex. We also consider how Martian topography
modifies the driving response. By also analyzing a reanalysis dataset we show
that there is significant dependence in the polar vortex structure and
variability on the observations assimilated. In both model and reanalysis, high
atmospheric dust loading (such as that seen during a global dust storm) can
disrupt the vortex, cause the destruction of PV in the low-mid altitudes (> 0.1
hPa), and significantly reduce spatial and temporal vortex variability. Through
our simulations, we find that the combination of dust and topography primarily
drives the eddy activity throughout the Martian year, and that although latent
heat release can produce an annular vortex, it has a relatively minor effect on
vortex variability.

The respective Petri net-based models are translated into the quadratic program

is demonstrated through the application of the program to a hydrogen-natural

demonstrate potential synergies or cascading network effects of policy across

  This work develops the first hetero-functional graph theory-based

conservation problem. In this work we consider shocks originating from
magnetized ejecta, extend the energy-conserving hydrodynamical model of Yan et
al. (2007) to the MHD limit by applying the magnetized jump conditions from
Zhang & Kobayashi (2005). Compared with the non-conservative models, our
Lorentz factor of the whole shocked region is larger by a factor
$\lesssim\sqrt{2}$. The total pressure of the forward shocked region is higher
than the reversed shocked region, in the relativistic regime with a factor of
about 3 in our interstellar medium (ISM) cases while ejecta magnetization
degree $\sigma<1$, and a factor of about 2.4 in the wind cases. For $\sigma\le
1$, the non-conservative model loses $32-42$% of its total energy for ISM
cases, and for wind cases $25-38$%, which happens specifically in the forward
shocked region, making the shock synchrotron emission from the forward shock
less luminous than expected. Once the energy conservation problem is fixed, the
late time light curves from the forward shock become nearly independent of the
ejecta magnetization. The reverse shocked region doesn't suffer from the energy
conservation problem since the changes of the Lorentz factor are recompensed by
the changes of the shocked particle number density. The early light curves from
the reverse shock are sensitive to the magnetization of the ejecta, thus are an
important probe of the magnetization degree.

exponent and confidently identify the mechanisms responsible for anomalous
diffusion. These tasks can be overwhelmingly difficult when only few short
trajectories are available, a situation that is common in the study of
non-equilibrium and living systems. Here, we present a data-driven method to
analyze single anomalous diffusion trajectories employing recurrent neural
networks, which we name RANDI. We show that our method can successfully infer
the anomalous exponent, identify the type of anomalous diffusion process, and
segment the trajectories of systems switching between different behaviors. We
benchmark our performance against the state-of-the art techniques for the study
of single short trajectories that participated in the Anomalous Diffusion
(AnDi) Challenge. Our method proved to be the most versatile method, being the
only one to consistently rank in the top 3 for all tasks proposed in the AnDi
Challenge.

of the regulator there is no inner horizon, saving this model from potential

  Food-Energy Production: The Light-Productivity-Factor Approach","9 pages",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Agrivoltaics (AV) is an emerging technology having symbiotic benefits for
food-energy-water needs of the growing world population and an inherent
resilience against climate vulnerabilities. An agrivoltaic system must optimize
sunlight-sharing between the solar panels and crops to maximize the food-energy
yields, subject to appropriate constraints. Given the emerging diversity of
monofacial and bifacial farms, the lack of a standardized crop-specific metric
(to evaluate the efficacy of the irradiance sharing) has made it difficult to
optimize and assess the performance of agrivoltaic systems. Here we introduce a
new metric, light productivity factor (LPF), that evaluates the effectiveness
of irradiance sharing for a given crop type and PV array design. The metric
allows us to identify optimal design parameters including the spatial PV array
density, panel orientation, and single axis tracking schemes specific to the
PAR needs of the crop. By definition, LPF equals 1 for PV-only or crop-only
systems. The AV systems enhances LPF between 1 and 2 depending on the shade
sensitivity of the crop, PV array configuration, and the season. While
traditional fixed-tilt systems increase LPF significantly above 1, we find LPF
is maximized at 2 for shade-tolerant crops with a solar farm based on single
axis sun tracking scheme. Among the fixed tilt systems, East-West faced
bifacial vertical solar farms is particularly promising because it produces
smallest variability in the seasonal yield for shade sensitive crops, while
providing LPF comparable to the standard North-South faced solar farms.
Additional benefits include reduced soiling and ease of movement of large-scale
combine-harvester and other farming equipment.

machine learning model and used to compare models and estimate their
usefulness. Recent work started to question the validity of many performance
metrics for this purpose in the context of software defect prediction.
  Objective: Within this study, we explore the relationship between performance
metrics and the cost saving potential of defect prediction models. We study
whether performance metrics are suitable proxies to evaluate the cost saving
capabilities and derive a theory for the relationship between performance
metrics and cost saving potential.
  Methods: We measure performance metrics and cost saving potential in defect
prediction experiments. We use a multinomial logit model, decision, and random
forest to model the relationship between the metrics and the cost savings.
  Results: We could not find a stable relationship between cost savings and
performance metrics. We attribute the lack of the relationship to the inability
of performance metrics to account for the property that a small proportion of
very large software artifacts are the main driver of the costs.
  Conclusion: Any defect prediction study interested in finding the best
prediction model, must consider cost savings directly, because no reasonable
claims regarding the economic benefits of defect prediction can be made
otherwise.

a crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for
prejudices caused by copyright infringement, violation of moral rights, or
torts. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism
and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not
equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright

symmetry class quantum graphs exhibit nongeneric features which originate from

(ECG) recordings are currently used to screen MI patients. However, manual
inspection of ECGs is time-consuming and prone to subjective bias. Machine
learning methods have been adopted for automated ECG diagnosis, but most
approaches require extraction of ECG beats or consider leads independently of
one another. We propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, DeepMI, to
classify MI from normal cases as well as identifying the time-occurrence of MI
(defined as acute, recent and old), using a collection of fusion strategies on
12 ECG leads at data-, feature-, and decision-level. In order to minimise
computational overhead, we employ transfer learning using existing computer
vision networks. Moreover, we use recurrent neural networks to encode the
longitudinal information inherent in ECGs. We validated DeepMI on a dataset
collected from 17,381 patients, in which over 323,000 samples were extracted
per ECG lead. We were able to classify normal cases as well as acute, recent

traditional outage detection methods, which rely on customers report and smart

generators and storages and the mesh structure in urban distribution grids can
continue supplying power after line outages. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven outage monitoring approach based on the stochastic time

flow analysis that the dependency of time-series voltage measurements exhibits
significant statistical changes after line outages. This makes the theory on
optimal change-point detection suitable to identify line outages. However,
existing change point detection methods require post-outage voltage
distribution, which is unknown in distribution systems. Therefore, we design a
maximum likelihood estimator to directly learn the distribution parameters from
voltage data. We prove that the estimated parameters-based detection also
achieves the optimal performance, making it extremely useful for fast
distribution grid outage identifications. Furthermore, since smart meters have
been widely installed in distribution grids and advanced infrastructure (e.g.,
PMU) has not widely been available, our approach only requires voltage
magnitude for quick outage identification. Simulation results show highly
accurate outage identification in eight distribution grids with 14
configurations with and without DERs using smart meter data.

the loss value of each sample with the current loss threshold. Samples with

science research. In this work, three of these approaches - content analysis,
social graph analysis and the use of Semantic Web technologies are examined. An
integrated set of system requirements is then developed that uses all three
approaches in one hybrid approach.
  To show the practicality of this hybrid approach, a usable prototype expert
finding system called ExpertQuest is developed using a modern functional
programming language (Clojure) to query social media data and Linked Data. This
system is evaluated and discussed. Finally, a discussion and conclusions are
presented which describe the benefits and shortcomings of the hybrid approach
and the technologies used in this work.

to the activation patterns experienced during past waking experiences. Replay
was first observed in biological neural networks during sleep, and it is now
thought to play a critical role in memory formation, retrieval, and
consolidation. Replay-like mechanisms have been incorporated into deep
artificial neural networks that learn over time to avoid catastrophic
forgetting of previous knowledge. Replay algorithms have been successfully used
in a wide range of deep learning methods within supervised, unsupervised, and
reinforcement learning paradigms. In this paper, we provide the first
comprehensive comparison between replay in the mammalian brain and replay in
artificial neural networks. We identify multiple aspects of biological replay
that are missing in deep learning systems and hypothesize how they could be
utilized to improve artificial neural networks.

  Uncontrolled Intersection",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To investigate the impact of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on urban congestion,
this study looks at their performance at road intersections. Intersection
performance has been studied across a range of traffic densities using a simple
MATLAB simulation of two intersecting 1-D flows of homogeneous automated
vehicles. This lacks the detail of more advanced simulations, but it enables
fast identification of fundamental behaviours. The results show that there are
distinct crossing regimes at low, medium and high densities. Furthermore, the
transitions between regimes can be predicted analytically and their performance
related to the fundamental model of 1-D traffic flow. These findings have the
potential to focus efforts on the development of improved decision-making rules
for emerging AVs.

embedded as a closed subgyrogroup of a Hausdorff path-connected and locally
path-connected topological gyrogroup $G^\bullet$.

of intriguing challenges in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). Among these, jets
are determinant in the air and water circulation around the Earth. In the last
fifty years, thanks to the development of more and more precise and extensive
observations, it has been possible to study in detail the atmospheric
formations of the giant-gas planets in the solar system. For those planets,
jets are the dominant large scale structure. Starting from the 70s, various
theories combining observations and mathematical models have been proposed in
order to describe their formation and stability. In this paper, we propose a
purely algebraic approach to describe the spontaneous formation of jets on a
spherical domain. Analysing the algebraic properties of the 2D Euler equations,
we give a characterization of the different jets' structures. The calculations
are performed starting from the discrete Zeitlin model of the Euler equations.
For this model, the classification of the jets' structures can be precisely
described in terms of reductive Lie algebras decomposition. The discrete
framework provides a simple tool for analysing both from a theoretical and and
a numerical perspective the jets' formation. Furthermore, it allows to extend
the results to the original Euler equations.
