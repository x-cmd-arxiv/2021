equations, considering the dynamics of falling the rigid rotating torus in an
ideal incompressible fluid, assuming additionally the dynamical symmetry of
rotation for the rotating body, I_1 = I_2. Fundamental law of angular momentum
conservation is used for the aforementioned solving procedure. The system of
Euler equations for dynamics of torus rotation is explored in regard to the
existence of an analytic way of presentation for the approximated solution
(where we consider the case of laminar flow at slow regime of torus rotation).
The second finding is associated with the fact that the Stokes boundary layer
phenomenon on the boundaries of the torus is also been assumed at formulation
of basic Kelvin&Kirchhoff equations (for which analytical expressions for the
components of fluid torque vector {T_2, T_3} were obtained earlier). The
results of calculations for the components of angular velocity should then be
used for full solving the momentum equation of Kelvin&Kirchhoff system.
Trajectories of motion can be divided into, preferably, 3 classes: zigzagging,
helical spiral motion, and the chaotic regime of oscillations.

For message-wise UEP, we compare the proposed autoencoder-based UEP codes with

present description tracks the momentum of the particle through a sequence of
frames in which the electric field vanishes, in the spirit of the original
Fermi scenario. It connects the sources of energy gain (or loss) to the
gradients of the velocity of the magnetic field lines, in particular the
acceleration and the shear of their velocity flow projected along the field
line direction, as well as their compression in the transverse plane. Those
velocity gradients are subject to strong intermittency: they are spatially
localized and their strengths obey power law distributions, as demonstrated
through direct measurements in the incompressible MHD simulation of the Johns
Hopkins University database. This intermittency impacts the acceleration
process in a significant way, which opens up prospects for a rich
phenomenology. In particular, the momentum distribution, which is here captured
through an analytical random walk model, displays extended power law tails with
soft-to-hard evolution in time, in general agreement with recent kinetic
numerical simulations. Extensions to this description and possible avenues of
exploration are discussed.

Although conventional matting formulation can be applied to all of the above

semantic classification of matting regions. Specifically, we consider and learn

to semantic trimap. The proposed semantic trimap can be obtained automatically
through patch structure analysis within trimap regions. Meanwhile, we learn a
multi-class discriminator to regularize the alpha prediction at semantic level,
and content-sensitive weights to balance different regularization losses.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method outperforms other

an evolution of the dust properties (i.e. composition, size, and shape). The
gas physics and chemistry are tightly connected to these dust properties and
are therefore affected by dust evolution and especially the nano-grain
depletion in the outer irradiated part of PDRs. We highlight the influence of
nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead nebula,
a prototypical PDR. We used a model for atomic and molecular gas in PDRs, the
Meudon PDR code, using diffuse ISM-like dust and Horsehead-like dust to study
the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry,
focusing on the impact on photoelectric heating and H2 formation and,
therefore, on the H2 gas lines. We find that nano-grain depletion in the
Horsehead strongly affects gas heating through the photoelectric effect and
thus the gas temperature and the H2 formation, hence the H -> H2 position.
Consequently, the first four pure rotational lines of H2 (e.g. 0-0 S(0), S(1),
S(2), and S(3)) vary by a factor of 2 to 14. The 0-0 S(3) line that is often
underestimated in models is underestimated even more when taking nano-grain
depletion into account due to the decrease in gas heating through the
photoelectric effect. This strongly suggests that our understanding of the
excitation of H2 and/or of heating processes in the Horsehead, and more
generally in PDRs, is still incomplete. Nano-grain depletion in the outer part
of the Horsehead has a strong influence on several gas tracers that will be
prominent in JWST observations of irradiated clouds. We therefore need to take
this depletion into account in order to improve our understanding of the
Horsehead, and more generally PDRs, and to contribute to the optimal scientific

interfaces gives rise to artifacts. Examples are phase and amplitude errors, as
well as staircase diffractions. Such errors can be reduced in two general ways.
In the first approach, the interface can be anti-aliased (i.e., with an
anti-aliased step-function, or a lowpass filter). Alternatively, the interface
may be replaced with an equivalent medium (i.e., using Schoenberg \& Muir (SM)
calculus or orthorhombic averaging). We test these strategies in acoustic,
elastic isotropic, and elastic anisotropic settings. Computed FD solutions are
compared to analytical solutions. We find that in acoustic media, anti-aliasing
methods lead to the smallest errors. Conversely, in elastic media, the SM
calculus provides the best accuracy. The downside of the SM calculus is that it
requires an anisotropic FD solver even to model an interface between two
isotropic materials. As a result, the computational cost increases compared to
when using isotropic FD solvers. However, since coarser grid spacings can be
used to represent the dipping interfaces, the two effects (an expensive FD
solver on a coarser FD grid) equal out. Hence, the SM calculus can provide an
efficient means to reduce errors, also in elastic isotropic media.

After six orbits with Parker Solar Probe (PSP), its dust impact rates are
consistent with at least three distinct populations: bound zodiacal dust grains
on elliptic orbits ($\alpha$-meteoroids), unbound $\beta$-meteoroids on
hyperbolic orbits, and a third population of impactors that may either be
direct observations of discrete meteoroid streams, or their collisional
byproducts (""$\beta$-streams""). $\beta$-streams of varying intensities are
expected to be produced by all meteoroid streams, particularly in the inner
solar system, and are a universal phenomenon in all exozodiacal disks. We find
the majority of collisional erosion of the zodiacal cloud occurs in the range
of $10-20$ solar radii and expect this region to also produce the majority of
pick-up ions due to dust in the inner solar system. A zodiacal erosion rate of
at least $\sim$100 kg s$^{-1}$ and flux of $\beta$-meteoroids at 1 au of

nanograins susceptible to electromagnetic forces with radii below $\sim$50 nm

working fluid, an ideal quasi-thermodynamic cycle has been established.
Particular stages of this cycle are described in terms of a condensed-matter
analogue of the false vacuum, when operating under negative-pressure. The cycle
is established between 37 degC and 15 degC under isochoric conditions.
Phase-change work is created in two-directions, positive expansion-work and
negative contraction-work. A large proportion of the expansion-work derives
from a cooling process where the fluid exhibits negative heat capacity. When
heat flux ceases, the fluid becomes unstable and heat capacity switches from
negative to positive, displaying a non-equivalence of ensembles phase-change.
  Whilst elements of the fluid behaviour can only be described by the
statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium systems, the calculated equations of
state for classical thermodynamics are confirmed to be accurate from the
experimental investigation. However, the classical thermodynamic calculations
for cycle-efficiency do not produce a symmetry of energy conservation. This
suggests that an additional form of energy, having long-range interaction and
distinct from heat and work input, is involved in the performance of the
quasi-thermodynamic cycle. The expansion of a negative-pressure fluid that
contains inclusion compounds appears responsible for this potential energy
interaction as an analogue of the false vacuum potential that can be explained
by application of the virial theorem.

metrics of observing strategies for multiple science cases in order to

extragalactic science applications of LSST's data, including but not limited to
cosmology, but there are few metrics available, and they are not
straightforwardly integrated with metrics of other cadence-dependent quantities
that may influence any given use case. We propose a metric for observing
strategy optimization based on the potentially recoverable mutual information
about redshift from a photometric sample under the constraints of a realistic
observing strategy. We demonstrate a tractable estimation of a variational
lower bound of this mutual information implemented in a public code using
conditional normalizing flows. By comparing the recoverable redshift
information across observing strategies, we can distinguish between those that
preclude robust redshift constraints and those whose data will preserve more
redshift information, to be generically utilized in a downstream analysis. We
recommend the use of this versatile metric to observing strategy optimization
for redshift-dependent extragalactic use cases, including but not limited to
cosmology, as well as any other science applications for which photometry may
be modeled from true parameter values beyond redshift.

prediction incredibly challenging: we cannot expect to make perfect predictions
all of the time. Instead, we look for specific states of the system that lead
to more predictable behavior than others, often termed ""forecasts of
opportunity"". When these opportunities are not present, scientists need
prediction systems that are capable of saying ""I don't know."" We introduce a
novel loss function, termed ""abstention loss"", that allows neural networks to
identify forecasts of opportunity for regression problems. The abstention loss
works by incorporating uncertainty in the network's prediction to identify the
more confident samples and abstain (say ""I don't know"") on the less confident
samples. The abstention loss is designed to determine the optimal abstention
fraction, or abstain on a user-defined fraction via a PID controller. Unlike
many methods for attaching uncertainty to neural network predictions
post-training, the abstention loss is applied during training to preferentially
learn from the more confident samples. The abstention loss is built upon a
standard computer science method. While the standard approach is itself a
simple yet powerful tool for incorporating uncertainty in regression problems,
we demonstrate that the abstention loss outperforms this more standard method
for the synthetic climate use cases explored here. The implementation of
proposed loss function is straightforward in most network architectures
designed for regression, as it only requires modification of the output layer

project. The deconvolved half-light radii of the 220GHz continuum sources are
between <60-350 pc (median 90pc). We associate these regions with the regions
emitting the bulk of the infrared luminosity. The good agreement, within a
factor of 2, between the 220GHz fluxes and the extrapolation of the infrared
gray-body, and the small synchrotron and free-free contributions support this
assumption. The cold molecular gas emission sizes, r_CO, are 60-700 pc and are
similar in advanced mergers and early interacting systems. On average, r_CO are
2.5 times larger than the continuum. We derive L_IR and cold molecular gas
surface densities: log Sigma(L_IR)=11.5-14.3 Lsun/kpc^2 and log
Sigma(H2)=2.9-4.2 Msun/pc^2. Assuming that the L_IR is produced by
star-formation, this corresponds to median Sigma(SFR)=2500 Msun/yr/kpc^2 which
would imply extremely short depletion times, <1-15 Myr, and unphysical SF
efficiencies >1 for 70% of the sample. Therefore, this favors the presence of
obscured AGN that could dominate the L_IR. We also classify the ULIRG nuclei in
two groups: (a) compact nuclei (r<130 pc) with high mid-IR excess emission
found in optically classified AGN; and (b) nuclei following a relation with
decreasing mid-IR excess for decreasing r. 60% of the interacting nuclei lie in
the low end (<130 pc) of this relation, while only 30% of the advanced mergers
do so, suggesting that in the early interaction phases the activity occurs in
more compact and obscured regions. About two thirds of the nuclei are above the
Eddington limit which is consistent with the detection of massive outflows in
local ULIRGs and the potential role of radiation pressure in the launching
process.

coupled only fluid-mechanically. We study the efficiency of the device in terms
of the total energy dissipation and find that by adding resonators, the
dissipation increases in a non trivial way. As expected, a large energy
attenuation is achieved when the wave and resonators are characterised by
similar frequencies. As the number of resonators is increased, the range of
attenuated frequencies also increases. The concept and results presented herein

cardiovascular disease, yet they are challenging to quantify with high

suffers from uncertainty, low resolution, and noise issues. Physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) provide a flexible deep learning framework to integrate
mathematical equations governing blood flow with measurement data. By
leveraging knowledge about the governing equations (herein, Navier-Stokes),
PINN overcomes the large data requirement in deep learning. In this study, it
was shown how PINN could be used to improve WSS quantification in diseased
arterial flows. Specifically, blood flow problems where the inlet and outlet
boundary conditions were not known were solved by assimilating very few
measurement points. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a common feature in
patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models. It was shown that PINN
could use sparse velocity measurements away from the wall to quantify WSS with
very high accuracy even without full knowledge of the boundary conditions.
Examples in idealized stenosis and aneurysm models were considered
demonstrating how partial knowledge about the flow physics could be combined
with partial measurements to obtain accurate near-wall blood flow data. The

model have a rich amount of the many-particle many-hole correlations, and the
QRPA can obtain the convergence of the result of calculation with respect to
the extension of the single-particle space. It is difficult for the shell model
to obtain the convergence of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME with respect to the
valence single-particle space. The many-body correlations of the QRPA are
insufficient depending on nuclei. We propose a new method to modify

projection of the positive Grassmannian $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k,n}$ into $Gr_{k,k+2}$

Introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes, it is not a polytope, and
has dimension $2k$. Nevertheless, there seem to be remarkable connections
between these two objects via T-duality, as was first noted by
Lukowski--Parisi--Williams (LPW). In this paper we use ideas from oriented
matroid theory, total positivity, and the geometry of the hypersimplex and
positroid polytopes to obtain a deeper understanding of the amplituhedron. We
show that the inequalities cutting out positroid polytopes -- images of
positroid cells of $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k+1,n}$ under the moment map -- translate into
sign conditions characterizing the T-dual Grasstopes -- images of positroid
cells of $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k,n}$ under $\tilde{Z}$. Moreover, we subdivide the
amplituhedron into chambers, just as the hypersimplex can be subdivided into
simplices, with both chambers and simplices enumerated by the Eulerian numbers.
We prove the main conjecture of (LPW): a collection of positroid polytopes is a
triangulation of $\Delta_{k+1, n}$ if and only if the collection of T-dual
Grasstopes is a triangulation of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ for all $Z$.

across physiological states and ensure a synchronized expression of genes in
cellular subsystems, critical for the coherent functioning of cells. Here we
address the questions whether it is possible to predict gene synchronization
from network structure alone. We have recently shown that synchronized gene
expression may be predicted from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks
(GRN) and described by the concept of symmetry fibrations. We showed that
symmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the
symmetries of their 'input trees', the set of paths in the network through
which signals can reach a gene. In idealized dynamic gene expression models,
all genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized models -
with gene input functions differencing between genes - predict symmetry
breaking and desynchronization.
  Results: To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some
of the fiber-induced coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene
fibrations for the gene regulatory networks of E. coli and B. subtilis and
confront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression
patterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression
dynamics. This shows that network structure alone provides useful information
about gene synchronization, and suggest that gene input functions within fibers
may be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to realize a coexpression
of genes.
  Conclusions: Thus, gene fibrations provides a sound conceptual tool to
describe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by
mechanistic details of gene expression.

of the analytical solution constructed by using tools of the complex function
theory and couple it continuously with the finite element solution in the
region far from singularity. In this way, crack propagation could be modelled
without using remeshing. Possible directions of crack growth can be calculated
through the minimization of the total energy composed of the potential energy
and the dissipated energy based on the energy release rate. Within this
setting, an analytical solution of a mixed boundary value problem based on
complex analysis and conformal mapping techniques is presented in a circular
region containing an arbitrary crack path. More precisely, the linear elastic
problem is transformed into a Riemann-Hilbert problem in the unit disk for
holomorphic functions. Utilising advantages of the analytical solution in the

respect to gain and bandwidth, among which nanophotonic lithium niobate is one
of the most promising candidates. Here, we combine quasi-phase matching with

with spectrally flowed sectors, and is closely related to an (ambi-)twistor

the degrees of freedom to a finite number of oscillators (string bits) in each

signals would advance applications in quantum information processing,

broadband, quantum limited, and directional. However, conventional
traveling-wave parametric amplifiers support broadband amplification at the
cost of increased added noise and are not genuinely directional due to
non-negligible nonlinear backward wave generation. In this work, we introduce a
new class of amplifiers which encode the information in the Floquet modes of
the system. Such Floquet mode amplifiers prevent information leakage and
overcome the trade-off between quantum efficiency (QE) and bandwidth.
Crucially, Floquet mode amplifiers strongly suppress the nonlinear
forward-backward wave coupling and are therefore genuinely directional and
readily integrable with qubits, clearing another major obstacle towards
broadband ideal quantum measurements. Furthermore, Floquet mode amplifiers are
insensitive to out-of-band impedance mismatch, which otherwise may lead to gain
ripples, parametric oscillations, and instability in conventional
traveling-wave parametric amplifiers. Finally, we show that a Floquet mode
Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier implementation can simultaneously
achieve $>\!20\,$dB gain and a QE of $\eta/\eta_{\mathrm{ideal}}\!> 99.9\%$ of

entropy obeys area-law scaling. In the interacting case, the continuous $O(2)$
symmetry is explicitly lowered to a discrete $C_4$ symmetry, giving rise to
volume-law entanglement entropy in the symmetry-broken phase due to the
enhanced linear free energy cost of domain walls compared to vortices. The
interacting transition is described by $C_4$ symmetry breaking. We also verify

from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using Disperse and the 3D spins of MaNGA
galaxies are estimated using the thin disk approximation with integral field
spectroscopy kinematics. Late-type spiral galaxies are found to have their
spins parallel to the closest filament's axis. The alignment signal is found to
be dominated by low-mass spirals. Spins of S0-type galaxies tend to be oriented
preferentially in perpendicular direction with respect to the filament's axis.
This orthogonal orientation is found to be dominated by S0s that show a notable
misalignment between their kinematic components of stellar and ionised gas
velocity fields and/or by low mass S0s with lower rotation support compared to
their high mass counterparts. Qualitatively similar results are obtained when
splitting galaxies based on the degree of ordered stellar rotation, such that
galaxies with high spin magnitude have their spin aligned, and those with low
spin magnitude in perpendicular direction to the filaments. In the context of
conditional tidal torque theory, these findings suggest that galaxies' spins
retain memory of their larger-scale environment. In agreement with measurements
from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, the measured signal at low
redshift is weak, yet statistically significant. The dependence of the
spin-filament orientation of galaxies on their stellar mass, morphology and
kinematics highlights the importance of sample selection to detect the signal.

applicable framework which yields p-values that are marginally valid but
mutually dependent for different test points. We prove these p-values are
positively dependent and enable exact false discovery rate control, although in
a relatively weak marginal sense. We then introduce a new method to compute
p-values that are both valid conditionally on the training data and independent
of each other for different test points; this paves the way to stronger type-I
error guarantees. Our results depart from classical conformal inference as we
leverage concentration inequalities rather than combinatorial arguments to
establish our finite-sample guarantees. Furthermore, our techniques also yield
a uniform confidence bound for the false positive rate of any outlier detection

trimethylsilylalanine (TMSAla). Incorporation of Sip and TMSAla respectively in
positions 10 and 13 of NT(8-13) combined with the Lys8-Lys9 reduced amine bond
(JMV5296) greatly prolonged the plasma half-life time over 20 hours. These
modifications also led to a 25-fold peptide selectivity toward NTS2. More
importantly, central delivery of JMV5296 was able to induce a strong
antinociceptive effect in acute (tail-flick), tonic (formalin), and chronic
inflammatory (CFA) pain models without inducing hypothermia. Altogether, these
results demonstrate that the chemically-modified NT(8-13) analog JMV5296
exhibits a better therapeutic profile and may thus represent a promising avenue
to guide the development of new stable NT agonists and improve pain management.

in most network architectures designed for classification as it only requires
the addition of an abstention class to the output layer and modification of the

resolution. Like most galaxies the GPs show a log-normal size distribution.
They also show a positive correlation between size and UV-continuum luminosity.
The slope of the size-continuum luminosity relation for GPs is consistent with
those of continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at low and high redshifts. A
distinctive feature of GPs is a very compact typical radius of 0.33 kpc with a
population spread (1$\sigma$) of 0.19 kpc. The peak of the size distribution
and the intercept of the size-luminosity relation of GPs are noticeably smaller
than those of continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts.
There are statistically significant anti-correlations found between the
circularized half-light radius ($r_{\rm cir,50}$), the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)), and the Ly$\alpha$ escape faction
($f^{Ly\alpha}_{esc}$), suggesting that small UV-continuum radii are crucial
for Ly$\alpha$ emission. GPs and high-redshift LAEs have similar sizes, once
spatial resolution effects are properly considered. Our results show that a
compact/small size is crucial for escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons, and that
Ly$\alpha$-emitters show constant characteristic size independent of their

By selecting stars with similar ages and masses, the Young Suns
Exoplanet Survey (YSES) aims to detect and characterize planetary-mass
companions to solar-type host stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus association. Our
survey is carried out with VLT/SPHERE with short exposure sequences on the
order of 5 min per star per filter. The subtraction of the stellar point spread
function (PSF) is based on reference star differential imaging (RDI) using the
other targets in the survey in combination with principal component analysis.
We report the discovery of YSES 2b, a planetary-mass companion to the K1 star
YSES 2 (TYC 8984-2245-1). The primary has a Gaia EDR3 distance of 110 pc, and
we derive a revised mass of $1.1\,M_\odot$ and an age of approximately 14 Myr.
We detect the companion in two observing epochs southwest of the star at a
position angle of 205$^\circ$ and with a separation of $\sim1.05''$, which
translates to a minimum physical separation of 115 au at the distance of the
system. We derive a photometric planet mass of
$6.3^{+1.6}_{-0.9}\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ using AMES-COND and AMES-dusty evolutionary
models; this mass corresponds to a mass ratio of $q=(0.5\pm0.1)$% with the
primary. This is the lowest mass ratio of a direct imaging planet around a
solar-type star to date. We discuss potential formation mechanisms and find
that the current position of the planet is compatible with formation by disk
gravitational instability, but its mass is lower than expected from numerical
simulations. Formation via core accretion must have occurred closer to the
star, yet we do not find evidence that supports the required outward migration,
such as via scattering off another undiscovered companion in the system. YSES
2b is an ideal target for follow-up observations to further the understanding
of the physical and chemical formation mechanisms of wide-orbit Jovian planets.

obtain a robust theory prediction for the corresponding radio lines. In this

shape and time-dependence. The principal physical effects are from refraction
in the plasma as well as from gravitation which together lead to substantial
lensing which varies over the pulse period. The time-dependence from the
co-rotation of the plasma with the pulsar distorts the frequencies leading to a
Doppler broadened signal whose width varies in time. For our predictions, we
trace curvilinear rays to the line of sight using the full set of equations
from Hamiltonian optics for a dispersive medium in curved spacetime. Thus, for
the first time, we describe the detailed shape of the line signal as well as
its time dependence, which is more pronounced compared to earlier results. Our

even when using exclusively information about the internal structure, galaxies
naturally cluster into two well-known categories from a purely data driven
perspective: rotating main-sequence disks and massive slow rotators, hence
confirming distinct assembly channels. Low-mass rotation-dominated quenched
galaxies appear only as a third cluster if information about the integrated
physical properties is preserved, suggesting a mixture of assembly processes
for these galaxies without any particular signature in their internal
kinematics that distinguishes them from the two main groups. The framework for
data exploration is publicly released with this publication, ready to be used

very steep spectrum, produced by one of the most powerful known jetted active
galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio plasma, ejected at nearly light speed from the
central AGN, have displaced the intra-cluster medium, leaving two pairs of
cavities observable in the X-ray, associated to two different outbursts, and
have distributed energy to the surrounding medium. In this work we have
performed for the first time a detailed, high-resolution spectral study of the
source at radio frequencies and investigated its duty cycle to be compared with
previous X-ray estimates. We have used new observations at 144 MHz produced
with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) together with archival data at higher
frequencies. At LOFAR frequency, the source presents two large outer radio
lobes, wider than at higher frequencies, and a smaller Intermediate lobe
located south-west of the core. A new inspection of X-ray data, allowed us to
identify an intermediate cavity, associated with that lobe, indicating the
presence of a further phase of jet activity. The radio lobes have a steep
spectrum even at LOFAR frequencies, reaching $\alpha_{144}^{610}=2.9$ in the
outer lobes and $\alpha_{144}^{610}=2.1$ in the Intermediate lobe. Fitting the
lobe spectra using a single injection model of particle ageing, we derived a
total age of the source between 170 and 106 Myr, in agreement with the buoyancy
and sound crossing time-scales derived from X-ray data. We then reconstructed
the duty cycle of the source. There were three phases of jet activity, with the
AGN being active for most of the time with only brief quiescent phases,
ensuring the repeated heating of the central gas. Finally, energetic estimates
revealed that a source of additional pressure support must be present to
sustain the bubbles against the pressure of the external medium.

as predicted by the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model.
We contrast these predictions with recent results from the VANDELS survey, that
allows us to expand the accessible redshift range for the stellar MZR up to
$z\sim3.5$. We complement our study by considering the evolution of the
gas-phase MZR in the same redshift range. We show that GAEA is able to
reproduce the observed evolution of the $z<3.5$ gas-phase MZR and $z<0.7$
stellar MZR, while it overpredicts the stellar metallicity at $z\sim3.5$.
Furthermore, GAEA also reproduces the so-called fundamental metallicity
relation (FMR) between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass and star formation
rate (SFR). In particular, the gas-phase FMR in GAEA is already in place at
$z\sim5$ and shows almost no evolution at lower redshift. GAEA predicts the
existence of a stellar FMR, that is, however, characterized by a relevant
redshift evolution, although its shape follows closely the gas-phase FMR. We
also report additional unsolved tensions between model and data: the overall
normalization of the predicted MZR agrees with observations only within
$\sim$0.1 dex; the largest discrepancies are seen at $z\sim3.5$ where models
tend to slightly overpredict observed metallicities; the slope of the predicted
MZR at fixed SFR is too steep below a few ${\rm M}_\odot\ {\rm yr}^{-1}$.
Finally, we provide model predictions for the evolution of the MZRs at higher
redshifts, that would be useful in the context of future surveys, like those

arithmetic reasoning. SciGen is therefore the first dataset that assesses the
arithmetic reasoning capabilities of generation models on complex input

of state-of-the-art data-to-text generation models on SciGen and evaluate the

transferred to fixing vulnerabilities. In the machine learning community, this
technique is called transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an approach
for repairing security vulnerabilities named VRepair which is based on transfer
learning. VRepair is first trained on a large bug fix corpus and is then tuned
on a vulnerability fix dataset, which is an order of magnitude smaller. In our
experiments, we show that a model trained only on a bug fix corpus can already
fix some vulnerabilities. Then, we demonstrate that transfer learning improves
the ability to repair vulnerable C functions. We also show that the transfer
learning model performs better than a model trained with a denoising task and
fine-tuned on the vulnerability fixing task. To sum up, this paper shows that

to calculate the full Fourier integral transform of a polygonal area as a sum

We thus extend our study of exponential infrared $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity to
examine the viability of the theory at the linear perturbation level,
evaluating the full CMB and matter power spectra. As the theory does not
introduce extra free parameters, it fits within the minimal six parameter space
of standard $\Lambda$CDM. Using Planck 2018 CMB (TT+TE+EE+lensing) alone, best
fits predict those parameters to be almost identical to $\Lambda$CDM, with
slightly smaller $\chi^2_{min}$. The resulting $H_0=72.24\pm 0.64$ km/s/Mpc,
which ""practically"" alleviates the tension with local measurements, due to late
time phantom behaviour. Inclusion of BAO data however reduces $H_0$, reflecting
furthermore systematic deviations from data that are also present in supernova
distances and the growth rate of structure (increasing the apparent tension in
the latter case). As the theory, unlike other viable $f(T)$ models, does not
reduce to $\Lambda$CDM through extra free parameters, those conclusions are
generic; applying to any modified gravity or dynamical dark energy with phantom
behaviour. With best fit parameters, the present scenario produces a CMB
spectrum almost identical to $\Lambda$CDM, with slight deviation at
low-multipole $\ell < 30$, where cosmic variance is large. The matter power
spectrum is also quite close to $\Lambda$CDM; with percent level scale free
modifications affecting modes significantly smaller than the horizon, arising
primarily from modified background evolution. More significant deviations
appear on larger scales, and may in principle distinguish modified gravity
scenarios of the type studied here from dynamical dark energy.

challenge in many machine learning applications. Batch active learning is a
popular approach to address this, in which batches of unlabeled data points are
selected for annotation, while an underlying learning algorithm gets
subsequently updated. Increasingly larger batches are particularly appealing in
settings where data can be annotated in parallel, and model training is
computationally expensive. A key challenge here is scale - typical active
learning methods rely on diversity techniques, which select a diverse set of
data points to annotate, from an unlabeled pool. In this work, we introduce
Active Data Shapley (ADS) -- a filtering layer for batch active learning that
significantly increases the efficiency of active learning by pre-selecting,
using a linear time computation, the highest-value points from an unlabeled
dataset. Using the notion of the Shapley value of data, our method estimates
the value of unlabeled data points with regards to the prediction task at hand.
We show that ADS is particularly effective when the pool of unlabeled data
exhibits real-world caveats: noise, heterogeneity, and domain shift. We run
experiments demonstrating that when ADS is used to pre-select the
highest-ranking portion of an unlabeled dataset, the efficiency of
state-of-the-art batch active learning methods increases by an average factor
of 6x, while preserving performance effectiveness.

activation maps. CPS further improves the memory savings of CPO by compressing
the index positions of neighboring NZEs. In both algorithms, channels/regions
of the activation maps with all zeros are skipped. Then, CPO/CPS performs
convolution via Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMv) done on their sparse
representations. Experimental results conducted on CPUs show that average
per-layer time savings reach up to 63% and Compression Ratio (CR) up to 26x
with respect to im2col. In some layers, our average per layer CPO/CPS time
savings are better by 28% and CR is better by 9.2x than the parallel
implementation of MEC. For a given CNN's inference, we offline select for each
convolution layer the best convolutional algorithm in terms of time between
either CPO or CPS and im2col. Our algorithms were selected up to 56% of the
non-pointwise convolutional layers. Our offline selections yield CNN inference
time savings up to 9% and CR up to 10x.

now observing the impact of the flare on the emission from the extended outflow

compact (r<50 pc). In terms of the nature of the flare event, we speculate that
the properties of the F01004-2237 flare may be the result of a tidal disruption

(abrupt, large-amplitude reversals in the radial magnetic field, which exhibit
Alfv\'enic correlations) we examine the dynamics of large-amplitude Alfv\'en
waves in the expanding solar wind. We develop an analytic model which makes
several predictions: switchbacks should preferentially occur in regions where
the solar wind plasma has undergone a greater expansion, the switchback
fraction at radii comparable to PSP should be an increasing function of radius,
and switchbacks should have their gradients preferentially perpendicular to the
mean magnetic field direction. The expansion of the plasma generates small
compressive components as part of the wave's nonlinear evolution: these are
maximized when the normalized fluctuation amplitude is comparable to
$\sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the propagation direction and
the mean magnetic field. These compressive components steepen the primary
Alfv\'enic waveform, keeping the solution in a state of nearly constant
magnetic field strength as its normalized amplitude $\delta B/B$ grows due to
expansion. The small fluctuations in the magnetic-field-strength are minimized
at a particular $\theta$-dependent value of $\beta$, usually of order unity,
and the density and magnetic-field-strength fluctuations can be correlated or
anticorrelated depending on $\beta$ and $\theta$. Example solutions of our
dynamical equation are presented; some do indeed form magnetic-field reversals.
Our predictions appear to match some previously unexplained phenomena in
observations and numerical simulations, providing evidence that the observed
switchbacks result from the nonlinear evolution of the initially

savings for low-voltage operation as well as low-precision quantization, but
also improves security of DNN accelerators. In contrast to related work, our
approach generalizes across operating voltages and accelerators and does not
require hardware changes. Moreover, we present a novel adversarial bit error
attack and are able to obtain robustness against both targeted and untargeted

efficiency by introducing new coding tools at the cost of an increased encoding
time-complexity. The Coding Tree Unit (CTU) is the main building block used in
HEVC. In the HEVC standard, frames are divided into CTUs with the predetermined
size of up to 64x64 pixels. Each CTU is then divided recursively into a number
of equally sized square areas, known as Coding Units (CUs). Although this
diversity of frame partitioning increases encoding efficiency, it also causes
an increase in the time complexity due to the increased number of ways to find
the optimal partitioning. To address this complexity, numerous algorithms have
been proposed to eliminate unnecessary searches during partitioning CTUs by
exploiting the correlation in the video. In this paper, existing CTU depth
decision algorithms for HEVC are surveyed. These algorithms are categorized
into two groups, namely statistics and machine learning approaches. Statistics
approaches are further subdivided into neighboring and inherent approaches.
Neighboring approaches exploit the similarity between adjacent CTUs to limit
the depth range of the current CTU, while inherent approaches use only the
available information within the current CTU. Machine learning approaches try
to extract and exploit similarities implicitly. Traditional methods like
support vector machines or random forests use manually selected features, while
recently proposed deep learning methods extract features during training.
Finally, this paper discusses extending these methods to more recent video
coding formats such as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and AOMedia Video 1(AV1).

Despite this inexact integration, we prove that the DG method converges with
order $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1/2})$, which is the same rate as in the case of exact
integration. Consequently, specialized quadrature rules that accurately
integrate the non-smooth numerical fluxes are not required for high-order
accuracy. These results are numerically corroborated on examples of linear
advection and discrete ordinates transport equations.

feature from the standpoint of ultrafast spintronics. Yet generating highly
polarized spin currents at room temperature remains a fundamental challenge for
antiferromagnets. We propose a spin circular photogalvanic effect (spin-CPGE),
in which circularly polarized light can produce a spin current without net
charge current at room temperature, through an ""injection-current-like""
mechanism in parity-time(PT)-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators. We
demonstrate this effect by first-principles simulations of bilayer CrI3 and
room-temperature AFM hematite. Our calculations show that the spin-CPGE is
significant, and the magnitude of spin photo-current is comparable with the
widely observed charge photocurrent in ferroelectric materials. Interestingly,
this spin photocurrent is not sensitive to spin-orbit interactions, which were
regarded as fundamental mechanisms for generating spin current. Given the fast
response of light-matter interactions, large energy scale, and insensitivity to
spin-orbit interactions, our work gives hope to realizing a fast-dynamic and
temperature-robust pure spin current in a wide range of PT-symmetric AFM
materials, including weak-relativistic magnetic insulators and topological
axion insulators.

pathways between an exposure and outcome, and a mediator that lies in between.
Causal mediation analysis provides a principled approach for such studies.
Although many applications involve longitudinal data, the existing causal
mediation models are not directly applicable to settings where the mediators
are measured on irregular time grids. In this paper, we propose a causal
mediation model that accommodates longitudinal mediators on arbitrary time
grids and survival outcomes simultaneously. We take a functional data analysis
perspective and view longitudinal mediators as realizations of underlying
smooth stochastic processes. We define causal estimands of direct and indirect
effects accordingly and provide corresponding identification assumptions. We
employ a functional principal component analysis approach to estimate the
mediator process, and propose a Cox hazard model for the survival outcome that
flexibly adjusts the mediator process. We then derive a g-computation formula
to express the causal estimands using the model coefficients. The proposed
method is applied to a longitudinal data set from the Amboseli Baboon Research
Project to investigate the causal relationships between early adversity, adult
physiological stress responses, and survival among wild female baboons. We find
that adversity experienced in early life has a significant direct effect on
females' life expectancy and survival probability, but find little evidence
that these effects were mediated by markers of the stress response in
adulthood. We further developed a sensitivity analysis method to assess the
impact of potential violation to the key assumption of sequential ignorability.

studies of the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) around the heliosphere.
The primary population of ISN helium atoms has, until now, been assumed to
reflect the pristine VLISM conditions at the heliopause. Consequently, the
atoms observed at 1 au by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) were used
to determine the VLISM temperature and velocity relative to the Sun, without
accounting for elastic collisions with other species outside the heliopause.
Here, we evaluate the effect of these collisions on the primary ISN helium
population. We follow trajectories of helium atoms and track their collisions
with slowed plasma and interstellar hydrogen atoms ahead of the heliopause.
Atoms typically collide a few times in the outer heliosheath, and only ~1.5% of
the atoms are not scattered at all. We use calculated differential cross
sections to randomly choose scattering angles in these collisions. We estimate
that the resulting primary ISN helium atoms at the heliopause are slowed down
by ~0.45 km/s and heated by ~1100 K compared to the pristine VLISM. The
resulting velocity distribution is asymmetric and shows an extended tail in the
antisunward direction. Accounting for this change in the parameters derived
from IBEX observations gives the Sun's relative speed of 25.85 km/s and
temperature of 6400 K in the pristine VLISM. Finally, this paper serves as a
source of the differential cross sections for elastic collisions with helium
atoms.

We report the detection of CH3OH in a disk around a young, luminous A-type star

has likely inherited COMs rich ice from an earlier cold dark cloud phase. This
is strong evidence that at least some of the organic material survives the disk
formation process and can then be incorporated into forming planets, moons and
comets. Therefore, crucial pre-biotic chemical evolution already takes place in
dark star-forming clouds.

transformation (a complex canonical transformation in the classical case) that
relates two different forms of dynamics in the sense of Dirac. Namely, it maps
the asymptotically free form into the harmonically confined form of dynamics
associated with the $\mathfrak{so}(2,1)\cong \mathfrak{sl}(2,{\mathbb R})$
conformal symmetry. However, as the transformation relates the non-Hermitian
operator $i\hat{D}$, where $\hat{D}$ is the generator of dilations, with the
compact Hermitian generator $\hat{\mathcal{J}}_0$ of the
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,{\mathbb R})$ algebra, the CBT generator can be associated
with a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric metric. In this work we review the applications
of this transformation for one- and two-dimensional systems, as well as for
systems on a cosmic string background, and for a conformally extended charged
particle in the field of Dirac monopole. We also compare and unify the CBT with
the Darboux transformation. The latter is used to construct
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric solutions of the equations of the KdV hierarchy with
the properties of extreme waves. As a new result, by using a modified CBT we
relate the one-dimensional $\mathcal{PT}$-regularized asymptotically free
conformal mechanics model with the $\mathcal{PT}$-regularized version of the de
Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan system.

is the discovery of tunable coupling between spins and other microscopic
degrees of freedom. We present evidence for interlayer magnetophononic coupling
in the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4. Employing magneto-Raman
spectroscopy, we observe anomalies in phonon scattering intensities across
magnetic field-driven phase transitions, despite the absence of discernible
static structural changes. This behavior is a consequence of a magnetophononic
wave-mixing process that allows for the excitation of zone-boundary phonons
that are otherwise 'forbidden' by momentum conservation. Our microscopic model
based on density functional theory calculations reveals that this phenomenon
can be attributed to phonons modulating the interlayer exchange coupling.
Moreover, signatures of magnetophononic coupling are also observed in the time
domain through the ultrafast excitation and detection of coherent phonons
across magnetic transitions. In light of the intimate connection between
magnetism and topology in MnBi2Te4, the magnetophononic coupling represents an
important step towards coherent on-demand manipulation of magnetic topological

thermodynamic structure of the intracluster gas of the final merger remnant. In
particular, we study how core entropy is generated during the merging and the
stability properties of the initial cool-core profile against disruption. To
this end, we consider a range of initial mass ratio and impact parameters.
Final entropy profiles of our adiabatic merging simulations are in good accord
with previous findings (ZuHone 2011), with cool-cores being disrupted for all
of the initial merging setups. For equal-mass off-axis mergers, we find that a
significant contribution to the final primary core entropy is due to
hydrodynamic instabilities generated by rotational motions, which are induced
by tidal torques during the first pericenter passage. In radiative simulations,
cool-cores are more resilient against heating processes; nonetheless, they are
able to maintain their integrity only in the case of off-axis mergers with very
unequal masses. We suggest that these results are robust against changes in the
gas physical modeling, in particular to the inclusion of AGN thermal feedback.
  Our findings support the view that the observed core cluster morphology
emerges naturally in a merging cluster context, and conclude that the merging
angular momentum is a key parameter in shaping the thermodynamical properties

paper, being the basic unit of academic research, is merely how problems in the
publication and research ecosystem manifest; but is not itself responsible for
them. Not only will simply replacing or augmenting papers with different
formats not fix existing problems; when used as a band-aid without systemic
changes, will likely exacerbate the existing inequities. In this work, we argue
that the root cause of hindrances in the accessibility of machine learning
research lies not in the paper workflow but within the misaligned incentives
behind the publishing and research processes. We discuss these problems and
argue that the paper is the optimal workflow. We also highlight some potential
solutions for the incentivization problems.

of a response variable that employs an underlying multiple regression framework
to enhance the accuracy of density estimates through the incorporation of
auxiliary information. Suppose we have a sample consisting of $N$ complete case
observations of a response variable and an associated set of covariates, along
with an additional sample consisting of $M$ observations of the covariates
only. We show that the mean square error of the multiple regression-enhanced
convolution estimator converges as $O(N^{-1})$ towards zero, and moreover, for
a large fixed $N$, that the mean square error converges as $O(M^{-4/5})$
towards an $O(N^{-1})$ constant. This is the first time that the convergence of
a convolution estimator with respect to the amount of additional covariate
information has been established. In contrast to convolution estimators based
on the Nadaraya-Watson estimator for a nonlinear regression model, the multiple
regression-enhanced convolution estimator proposed in this paper does not
suffer from the curse of dimensionality. It is particularly useful for
scenarios in which one wants to estimate the density of a response variable
that is challenging to measure, while being in possession of a large amount of
additional covariate information. In fact, an application of this type from the
field of ophthalmology motivated our work in this paper.

neural networks in distributed clusters. A critical factor in determining the
training throughput and model accuracy is the choice of the parameter
synchronization protocol. For example, while Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)
often achieves better converged accuracy, the corresponding training throughput
can be negatively impacted by stragglers. In contrast, Asynchronous Parallel
(ASP) can have higher throughput, but its convergence and accuracy can be
impacted by stale gradients. To improve the performance of synchronization
protocol, recent work often focuses on designing new protocols with a heavy
reliance on hard-to-tune hyper-parameters. In this paper, we design a hybrid
synchronization approach that exploits the benefits of both BSP and ASP, i.e.,
reducing training time while simultaneously maintaining the converged accuracy.
Based on extensive empirical profiling, we devise a collection of adaptive
policies that determine how and when to switch between synchronization
protocols. Our policies include both offline ones that target recurring jobs
and online ones for handling transient stragglers. We implement the proposed
policies in a prototype system, called Sync-Switch, on top of TensorFlow, and
evaluate the training performance with popular deep learning models and
datasets. Our experiments show that Sync-Switch achieves up to 5.13X throughput
speedup and similar converged accuracy when comparing to BSP. Further, we
observe that Sync-Switch achieves 3.8% higher converged accuracy with just
1.23X the training time compared to training with ASP. Moreover, Sync-Switch
can be used in settings when training with ASP leads to divergence errors.
Sync-Switch achieves all of these benefits with very low overhead, e.g., the
framework overhead can be as low as 1.7% of the total training time.

find that the tracking information plays an essential role and improves motion

higher-derivative color-weights -- indeed, it is the mixing of kinematics with
non-adjoint-type color-weights (like the permutation-invariant d^4) which
permits description via adjoint double-copy. Here we find that such ideas
clarify the predictions of local five-point higher-dimensional operators as
well. We demonstrate how a single scalar building block can be combined with

increasingly sensitive to spectral phase, yet measuring the spectral phase of a
laser pulse is nontrivial. While direct measurements of the spectral phase
cannot be done using square-integrable detectors, phase information can be
reconstructed by measuring the spectral response of a nonlinear optical effect.
We introduce a new deep learning approach using the generalized nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation and self-phase modulation, a $\chi_3$ nonlinearity
occurring from material propagation. By training a neural network on numerical
simulations of pulses propagating in a known material, the features of spectral
change can be use to reconstruct the spectral phase. The technique is also
sensitive to the local fluence of the pulse, enabling the full temporal
intensity profile to be calculated. We demonstrate our method on a simulated
large bandwidth pulse undergoing moderate material dispersion, and an
experimentally produced broadband spectrum with substantial material
dispersion. Error rates are low, even when modest amounts of noise introduced.
With a single plate of glass and an optical spectrometer, single shot phase and

due to its potential applications. It can be applied in many areas, from
national security (e.g., airport security, jurisprudence, and law enforcement)
to real-life applications (e.g., business and computer vision). However, some
critical problems still exist and are worth more investigation. One of the
significant challenges in the deception detection tasks is the data scarcity
problem. Until now, only one multi-modal benchmark open dataset for human
deception detection has been released, which contains 121 video clips for
deception detection (i.e., 61 for deceptive class and 60 for truthful class).
Such an amount of data is hard to drive deep neural network-based methods.
Hence, those existing models often suffer from overfitting problems and low
generalization ability. Moreover, the ground truth data contains some unusable
frames for many factors. However, most of the literature did not pay attention
to these problems. Therefore, in this paper, we design a series of data
preprocessing methods to deal with the aforementioned problem first. Then, we
propose a multi-modal deception detection framework to construct our novel
emotional state-based feature and use the open toolkit openSMILE to extract the
features from the audio modality. We also design a voting scheme to combine the
emotional states information obtained from visual and audio modalities.
Finally, we can determine the novel emotion state transformation feature with
our self-designed algorithms. In the experiment, we conduct the critical
analysis and comparison of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art
multi-modal deception detection methods. The experimental results show that the
overall performance of multi-modal deception detection has a significant
improvement in the accuracy from 87.77% to 92.78% and the ROC-AUC from 0.9221

provides a metric for the predictability of nonlinear motions in a given

map, the main resonances and their asymmetric stop-band widths can be
identified. When applied to particle transportation in a storage ring, as
particle motion becomes more chaotic, its surrogate model prediction accuracy
decreases correspondingly. Therefore, the prediction accuracy, acting as a
chaos indicator, can be used directly as the objective for nonlinear beam
dynamics optimization. This method provides a different perspective on
nonlinear beam dynamics and an efficient method for nonlinear lattice
optimization. Applications in dynamic aperture optimization are demonstrated as
real world examples.

anisotropies on small angular scales. Vector modes produced by loops dominate
over those produced by long strings for large multipole moments $\ell$. The
contribution of loops to the CMB anisotropies generated by cosmic string

image-to-text datasets but fail to generate texts that are useful in practice.
We argue that to close this gap, it is vital to distinguish descriptions from
captions based on their distinct communicative roles. Descriptions focus on
visual features and are meant to replace an image (often to increase
accessibility), whereas captions appear alongside an image to supply additional
information. To motivate this distinction and help people put it into practice,
we introduce the publicly available Wikipedia-based dataset Concadia consisting
of 96,918 images with corresponding English-language descriptions, captions,
and surrounding context. Using insights from Concadia, models trained on it,
and a preregistered human-subjects experiment with human- and model-generated
texts, we characterize the commonalities and differences between descriptions
and captions. In addition, we show that, for generating both descriptions and
captions, it is useful to augment image-to-text models with representations of
the textual context in which the image appeared.

to compute charges, which are otherwise not integrable. Yet there is a catch.
There is a clear prescription for how to evaluate the new bracket for any such
charge, but little is known how to extend the bracket to the entire phase
space. This is a problem, because not every gravitational observable is also a
charge. In this paper, we propose such an extension. The basic idea is to
remove the radiative data from the covariant phase space. This requires
second-class constraints. Given a few basic assumptions, we show that the
resulting Dirac bracket on the constraint surface is nothing but the BT
bracket. A heuristic argument is given to show that the resulting constraint
surface can only contain gravitational edge modes.

radial drift of protoplanetary dust, and pile it up in rings and crescents.
ALMA observations of the HD135344B disc revealed two rings in the thermal
continuum stemming from ~mm-sized dust. At higher frequencies the inner ring is
brighter relative to the outer ring, which is also shaped as a crescent rather
than a full ring. In near-IR scattered light images, the disc is modulated by a
2-armed grand-design spiral originating inside the ALMA inner ring. Such
structures may be induced by a massive companion evacuating the central cavity,
and by a giant planet in the gap separating both rings, that channels the
accretion of small dust and gas through its filamentary wakes while stopping
the larger dust from crossing the gap. Here we present ALMA observations in the
J=(2-1)CO isotopologue lines and in the adjacent continuum, with up to 12km
baselines. Angular resolutions of 0.03"" reveal the tentative detection of a
filament connecting both rings, and which coincides with a local discontinuity
in the pitch angle of the IR spiral, proposed previously as the location of the
protoplanet driving this spiral. Line diagnostics suggest that turbulence, or
superposed velocity components, is particularly strong in the spirals. The
12CO(2-1) 3-D rotation curve points at stellocentric accretion at radii within
the inner dust ring, with a radial velocity of up to ~6%+-0.5% Keplerian, which
corresponds to an excessively large accretion rate of ~2E-6M_sun/yr if all of
the CO layer follows the 12CO(2-1) kinematics. This suggests that only the
surface layers of the disc are undergoing accretion, and that the line
broadening is due to superposed laminar flows.

autonomous units metabolize free energy and create order at different length
scales as they proliferate and migrate collectively. One such example is
bacterial biofilms, which are surface-attached aggregates of bacterial cells
embedded in an extracellular matrix. However, how bacterial growth coordinates
with cell-surface interactions to create distinctive, long-range order in
biofilms remains elusive. Here we report a collective cell reorientation
cascade in growing Vibrio cholerae biofilms, leading to a differentially
ordered, spatiotemporally coupled core-rim structure reminiscent of a blooming
aster. Cell verticalization in the core generates differential growth that
drives radial alignment of the cells in the rim, while the radially aligned rim
in turn generates compressive stresses that expand the verticalized core. Such
self-patterning disappears in adhesion-less mutants but can be restored through
opto-manipulation of growth. Agent-based simulations and two-phase active
nematic modeling reveal the strong interdependence of the driving forces for
the differential ordering. Our findings provide insight into the collective

data picturing an object of a given category (e.g. a car), and has to
reconstruct the pose and shape of the object despite intra-class variability
(i.e. different car models have different shapes). We consider an active shape
model, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential
CAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard
formulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex
optimization. Our first contribution is to provide the first certifiably
optimal solver for pose and shape estimation. In particular, we show that
rotation estimation can be decoupled from the estimation of the object
translation and shape, and we demonstrate that (i) the optimal object rotation
can be computed via a tight (small-size) semidefinite relaxation, and (ii) the
translation and shape parameters can be computed in closed-form given the
rotation. Our second contribution is to add an outlier rejection layer to our
solver, hence making it robust to a large number of misdetections. Towards this
goal, we wrap our optimal solver in a robust estimation scheme based on
graduated non-convexity. To further enhance robustness to outliers, we also
develop the first graph-theoretic formulation to prune outliers in
category-level perception, which removes outliers via convex hull and maximum
clique computations; the resulting approach is robust to 70%-90% outliers. Our
third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing
an ablation study on a simulated dataset and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we

rotation rates. The physical origin of such magnetic field bends, the
conditions for their survival across the interplanetary space, and their
relation to solar wind rotation are yet to be clearly understood. We traced
measured solar wind flows from the spacecraft position down to the surface of
the Sun to identify their potential source regions and used a global MHD model
of the corona and solar wind to relate them to the rotational state of the low
solar corona. We identified regions of the solar corona for which solar wind
speed and rotational shear are important and long-lived, that can be favourable
to the development of magnetic deflections and to their propagation across
extended heights in the solar wind. We show that coronal rotation is highly
structured and that enhanced flow shear develops near the boundaries between
coronal holes and streamers, around and above pseudo-streamers, even when such
boundaries are aligned with the direction of solar rotation. A large fraction
of the switchbacks identified by PSP map back to these regions, both in terms
of instantaneous magnetic field connectivity and of the trajectories of wind
streams that reach the spacecraft. These regions of strong shears are likely to
leave an imprint on the solar wind over large distances and to increase the
transverse speed variability in the slow solar wind. The simulations and
connectivity analysis suggest they can be a source of the switchbacks and

test this idea, we construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for both simulated
and observed stars in the Solar neighborhood, using measured velocities and
iron abundances (i.e., an augmented Toomre diagram) as the distributions to be
decomposed. We compare results for the Gaia-APOGEE DR16 crossmatch catalog of
the Solar neighborhood with those from a suite of synthetic Gaia-APOGEE
crossmatches constructed from FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass
galaxies. We find that in both the synthetic and real data, the best-fit GMM
uses five independent components, some of whose properties resemble the
standard populations predicted by galaxy formation theory. Two components can
be identified unambiguously as the thin disk and another as the halo. However,
instead of a single counterpart to the thick disk, there are three intermediate
components with different age and alpha abundance distributions (although these
data are not used to construct the model). We use decompositions of the
synthetic data to show that the classified components indeed correspond to
stars with different origins. By analogy with the simulated data, we show that
our mixture model of the real Gaia-APOGEE crossmatch distinguishes the
following components: (1) a classic thin disk of young stars on circular orbits
(46%), (2) thin disk stars heated by interactions with satellites (22%), (3, 4)
two components representing the velocity asymmetry of the alpha-enhanced thick
disk (27%), and (5) a stellar halo consistent with early, massive accretion
(4%).

transverse coherence. This is due largely to the process of optical guiding by
which the radiation is both refractively guided by the bunched electron beam

effects may be summarized by an effective index of refraction, which has been
used in the past to study the transverse dynamics of the FEL process with
significant simplifications and approximations, but never fully

second-order in the lateral displacement from the nominal electron beam axis.
This is made possible by casting the FEL equations in the language of optical
fibers with an appropriately chosen refractive index. We demonstrate that this
approach is both fast and highly accurate, indicating that the most important
FEL dynamics are inherently second-order. In its full form our method can

consistency by flipping answers that significantly clash with others. Second, a

viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and
enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the
energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive
low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and
energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the
received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information
decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF
components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel
modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on
pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of
the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's
nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the
information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the
position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the
information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for
IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we
have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping
a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT
receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was
carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and
contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental
results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to
enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with

components to SiN photonic integrated circuits (PICs), but are difficult to

the high-index III-V gain materials. The recent demonstration of multilayer
heterogeneous integration provides a practical solution and enabled the
first-generation of lasers fully integrated with SiN waveguides. However a
laser with high device yield and high output power at telecommunication
wavelengths, where photonics applications are clustered, is still missing,
hindered by large mode transition loss, nonoptimized cavity design, and a
complicated fabrication process. Here, we report high-performance lasers on SiN
with tens of milliwatts output through the SiN waveguide and sub-kHz
fundamental linewidth, addressing all of the aforementioned issues. We also
show Hertz-level linewidth lasers are achievable with the developed integration

milestone towards a fully-integrated low-noise silicon nitride photonics

Nevertheless, the learning approach outperforms a strong manually designed

recently due to their controllable scattering elements that are able to direct
electromagnetic waves into desirable directions. Although RISs share some
similarities with relays, the two have fundamental differences impacting their
performance. To harness the benefits of both relaying and RISs, a multi-user
communication system is proposed in this paper wherein a relay and an RIS
cooperate to improve performance in terms of energy efficiency. Using singular
value decomposition (SVD), semidefinite programming (SDP), and function
approximations, we propose different solutions for optimizing the beamforming
matrices at the base-station (BS), the relay, and the phase shifts at the RIS
to minimize the total transmit power subject to quality-of-service (QoS)
constraints. The problem is solved in different cases when the relay operates
in half-duplex and full-duplex modes and when the reflecting elements have
continuous and discrete phase shifts. Simulation results are provided to
compare the performance of the system with and without the RIS or the relay in
both full-duplex and half-duplex modes, under different optimization solutions.
Generally, the results show that the system with full-duplex relay and RIS
cooperation outperforms all the other scenarios, and the contribution of
full-duplex relay is higher than that of the RIS. However, an RIS performs
better than a half-duplex relay when the required QoS is high. The results also
show that increasing the number of RIS reflecting elements improves performance
better in the presence of a relay than in its absence.

information retrieval and semantic search. It is particularly challenging when
the TKG is updated frequently. The model has to adapt to changes in the TKG for
efficient training and inference while preserving its performance on historical
knowledge. Recent work approaches TKG completion (TKGC) by augmenting the
encoder-decoder framework with a time-aware encoding function. However, naively
fine-tuning the model at every time step using these methods does not address
the problems of 1) catastrophic forgetting, 2) the model's inability to
identify the change of facts (e.g., the change of the political affiliation and
end of a marriage), and 3) the lack of training efficiency. To address these
challenges, we present the Time-aware Incremental Embedding (TIE) framework,
which combines TKG representation learning, experience replay, and temporal
regularization. We introduce a set of metrics that characterizes the
intransigence of the model and propose a constraint that associates the deleted
facts with negative labels. Experimental results on Wikidata12k and YAGO11k

about ten times and improves on the proposed metrics compared to vanilla
full-batch training. It comes without a significant loss in performance for any

of layers [$M+N$ with $M$ the layer number of the bottom few-layer graphene

hole side. The touched bands of FLGs around the Fermi level are split by the
moir\'{e} coupling through the electron-hole asymmetry in low-energy bands of
FLGs and by the vertical hopping between next-nearest layers. The full
structural relaxation leads to global gaps that completely isolate a flat band.
For TMLG with given $M$ and $N$, the highest magnitude of Chern numbers ($|C|$)
of the separable flat bands reaches $M+N-1$ and can be hosted by certain
isolated bands. The $|C|=9$ occurs in the isolated flat valence band of several
configurations with 10 layers. Such high $|C|$ originates from the lifting of
the band-state degeneracy in the weak regime of moir\'{e} coupling or from the
topological phase transitions induced by the strong moir\'{e} coupling.
Moreover, large orbital magnetic moments arise in isolated flat bands with high

high-statistics $p_t$ spectrum data from 5 TeV and 13 TeV $p$-$p$ collisions.
Particle data for each energy were partitioned into event classes based on the
total yields within two disjoint pseudorapidity $\eta$ intervals denoted by
acronyms V0M and SPD. For each energy the spectra resulting from the two
selection methods were then compared to a minimum-bias INEL $> 0$ average over
the entire event population. The nominal goal was determination of the role of
jets in high-multiplicity $p$-$p$ collisions and especially the jet
contribution to the low-$p_t$ parts of spectra. A related motivation was
response to recent claims of ""collective"" behavior and other nominal indicators
of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in small collision systems. In the
present study a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in
$p$-$p$ collisions is applied to the ALICE spectrum data. As in previous TCM
studies of a variety of A-B collision systems the jet and nonjet contributions
to $p$-$p$ spectra are accurately separated over the entire $p_t$ acceptance.
Distinction is maintained among spectrum normalizations, jet contributions to
spectra and systematic biases resulting from V0M and SPD event selection. The
statistical significance of data-model differences is established. The effect
of {\em spherocity} (azimuthal asymmetry measure nominally sensitive to jet
production) on ensemble-mean $p_t$ vs event multiplicity $n_{ch}$ is
investigated and found to have little relation to jet production. The general

The challenges in satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions in meshfree and

development of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for the solution of
partial differential equations. We introduce geometry-aware trial functions in
artifical neural networks to improve the training in deep learning for partial
differential equations. To this end, we use concepts from constructive solid
geometry (R-functions) and generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value
potential fields) to construct $\phi$, an approximate distance function to the
boundary of a domain. To exactly impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions, the trial function is taken as $\phi$ multiplied by the PINN
approximation, and its generalization via transfinite interpolation is used to
a priori satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential), Neumann (natural), and
Robin boundary conditions on complex geometries. In doing so, we eliminate
modeling error associated with the satisfaction of boundary conditions in a
collocation method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met pointwise in
a Ritz method. We present numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear
boundary-value problems over domains with affine and curved boundaries.
Benchmark problems in 1D for linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, and beam
bending; and in 2D for the Poisson equation, biharmonic equation, and the
nonlinear Eikonal equation are considered. The approach extends to higher
dimensions, and we showcase its use by solving a Poisson problem with
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions over the 4D hypercube. This study
provides a pathway for meshfree analysis to be conducted on the exact geometry

Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification

point sources, but also actual observables, images that form in the focal plane
of an imaging telescope positioned in the image plane. Perturbations of the
monopole gravitational field of the Sun are dominated by the solar quadrupole
moment, which results in forming an astroid caustic on the image plane.
Consequently, an imaging telescope placed inside the astroid caustic observes
four bright spots, forming the well-known pattern of an Einstein cross. The
relative intensities and positions of these spots change as the telescope is
moved in the image plane, with spots merging into bright arcs when the
telescope approaches the caustic boundary. Outside the astroid caustic, only
two spots remain and the observed pattern eventually becomes indistinguishable

optical axis. We present results from extensive numerical simulations, forming
the basis of our ongoing study of prospective exoplanet imaging with the SGL.

contextualized representations. Our results reveal that words of high and low
frequency differ significantly with respect to their representational geometry.
Such differences introduce distortions: when compared to human judgments, point
estimates of embedding similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) can over- or
under-estimate the semantic similarity of two words, depending on the frequency
of those words in the training data. This has downstream societal implications:
BERT-Base has more trouble differentiating between South American and African

persist when using BERT-Multilingual, suggesting that they cannot be easily
fixed with additional data, which in turn introduces new distortions.

neural networks, which need a large amount of data and heavy computations for
training the models. In this letter, a novel non-learning depth completion
method is proposed by exploiting the local surface geometry that is enhanced by
an outlier removal algorithm. The proposed surface geometry model is inspired
by the observation that most pixels with unknown depth have a nearby LiDAR
point. Therefore, it is assumed those pixels share the same surface with the
nearest LiDAR point, and their respective depth can be estimated as the nearest
LiDAR depth value plus a residual error. The residual error is calculated by
using a derived equation with several physical parameters as input, including
the known camera intrinsic parameters, estimated normal vector, and offset
distance on the image plane. The proposed method is further enhanced by an
outlier removal algorithm that is designed to remove incorrectly mapped LiDAR
points from occluded regions. On KITTI dataset, the proposed solution achieves
the best error performance among all existing non-learning methods and is
comparable to the best self-supervised learning method and some supervised
learning methods. Moreover, since outlier points from occluded regions is a
commonly existing problem, the proposed outlier removal algorithm is a general
preprocessing step that is applicable to many robotic systems with both camera
and LiDAR sensors.

Unfortunately, either these methods yield a biased posterior belief or it is

identically vanishes in the linear response regime due to the constraint of
time-reversal symmetry on the distribution of Berry curvature, a nonlinear Hall
effect can emerge in the second-order response regime if the inversion symmetry
is broken to allow a nonzero Berry curvature dipole (BCD) on the Fermi surface.
In this work, we study the nonlinear Hall effect of the BCD origin in
two-dimensional doped insulators and semimetals belonging to the symmetry class
AI which has spinless time-reversal symmetry. Despite that the class AI does
not host any strong topological insulator phase in two dimensions, we find that
they can still be classified as topologically obstructed insulators and trivial
insulators if putting certain constraint on the Hamiltonians. When the
insulator gets closer to the phase boundary of the two distinct phases, we find
that the BCDs will become more prominent if the doping level is located near
the band edge. Moreover, when the insulator undergoes a phase transition
between the two distinct phases, we find that the BCDs will dramatically change
their signs. For the semimetals without inversion symmetry, we find that the
BCDs will sharply reverse their signs when the doping level crosses the Dirac
points. With the shift of the locations of Dirac points in energy, the critical
doping level at which the BCDs sharply reverse their signs will accordingly
change. Our study reveals that class AI materials can also have interesting
geometrical and topological properties, and remarkable nonlinear Hall effect
can also appear in this class of materials even though the spin-orbit coupling
is negligible. Our findings broaden the scope of materials to study the
nonlinear Hall effect and provide new perspectives for the application of this

  Classification","11 pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-domain sentiment classification deals with the scenario where labeled
data exists for multiple domains but insufficient for training effective
sentiment classifiers that work across domains. Thus, fully exploiting
sentiment knowledge shared across domains is crucial for real world
applications. While many existing works try to extract domain-invariant
features in high-dimensional space, such models fail to explicitly distinguish
between shared and private features at text-level, which to some extent lacks
interpretablity. Based on the assumption that removing domain-related tokens
from texts would help improve their domain-invariance, we instead first
transform original sentences to be domain-agnostic. To this end, we propose the
BertMasker network which explicitly masks domain-related words from texts,
learns domain-invariant sentiment features from these domain-agnostic texts,
and uses those masked words to form domain-aware sentence representations.
Empirical experiments on a well-adopted multiple domain sentiment
classification dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on
both multi-domain sentiment classification and cross-domain settings, by
increasing the accuracy by 0.94% and 1.8% respectively. Further analysis on
masking proves that removing those domain-related and sentiment irrelevant
tokens decreases texts' domain distinction, resulting in the performance
degradation of a BERT-based domain classifier by over 12%.

Dragan, Jacob Steinhardt","Agnostic learning with unknown utilities","30 pages; published as a conference paper at ITCS 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional learning approaches for classification implicitly assume that
each mistake has the same cost. In many real-world problems though, the utility
of a decision depends on the underlying context $x$ and decision $y$. However,
directly incorporating these utilities into the learning objective is often
infeasible since these can be quite complex and difficult for humans to
specify.
  We formally study this as agnostic learning with unknown utilities: given a
dataset $S = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ where each data point $x_i \sim
\mathcal{D}$, the objective of the learner is to output a function $f$ in some
class of decision functions $\mathcal{F}$ with small excess risk. This risk
measures the performance of the output predictor $f$ with respect to the best
predictor in the class $\mathcal{F}$ on the unknown underlying utility $u^*$.
This utility $u^*$ is not assumed to have any specific structure. This raises
an interesting question whether learning is even possible in our setup, given
that obtaining a generalizable estimate of utility $u^*$ might not be possible
from finitely many samples. Surprisingly, we show that estimating the utilities
of only the sampled points~$S$ suffices to learn a decision function which
generalizes well.
  We study mechanisms for eliciting information which allow a learner to
estimate the utilities $u^*$ on the set $S$. We introduce a family of
elicitation mechanisms by generalizing comparisons, called the $k$-comparison
oracle, which enables the learner to ask for comparisons across $k$ different
inputs $x$ at once. We show that the excess risk in our agnostic learning
framework decreases at a rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{k} \right)$. This result
brings out an interesting accuracy-elicitation trade-off -- as the order $k$ of
the oracle increases, the comparative queries become harder to elicit from
humans but allow for more accurate learning.

present there are no defined mechanisms in place for a subscriber of one mobile
network operator (MNO) to use the services of a WiFi provider. Cellular and
Data Service providers also have no standardized procedures to securely
interact with each other, and to allow their subscribers to use third party
services on a pay-as-you-go basis. This paper proposes a blockchain-based
offloading framework that allows a subscriber of a mobile operator to
temporarily use another MNO or WiFi provider's higher speed network. Smart
contracts allow diverse entities such as MNOs, Brokers and WiFi Providers to
automatically execute mutual agreements to enable the utilization of third
party infrastructure in a secure and controlled manner. To test the proposed
framework, the offloading of a subscriber from 3G/4G/4G-LTE/5G networks to a
fixed broadband WiFi network was carried out and the results analyzed. The
offloading framework was implemented using the ns-3 network simulator, and the
Ethereum blockchain smart contract features were used for the settlement of
invoices.

counting where $T$ is the number of triangles in the graph and $n$ the number

matrix multiplication in time $\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$. Is it possible to get a
negative dependency on the number of triangles $T$ while retaining the
$n^\omega$ dependency on $n$? We answer this question positively by providing
an algorithm which runs in time $O\big(\frac{n^\omega}{T^{\omega - 2}}\big)
\cdot \text{poly}(n^{o(1)}/\epsilon)$. This is optimal in the sense that as
long as the exponent of $T$ is independent of $n, T$, it cannot be improved
while retaining the dependency on $n$; this as follows from the lower bound of
Eden and Rosenbaum [APPROX/RANDOM 2018]. Our algorithm improves upon the state
of the art when $T = \omega(1)$ and $T = o(n)$.
  We also consider the problem of approximate triangle counting in sparse
graphs, parameterizing by the number of edges $m$. The best known algorithm
runs in time $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{m^{3/2}}{T}\big)$ [Eden et al., SIAM Journal

counting that runs in time $\tilde{O}(m^{2\omega/(\omega + 1)})$. We again get
an algorithm that retains the exponent of $m$ while running faster on graphs
with larger number of triangles. Specifically, our algorithm runs in time
$O\Big(\frac{m^{2\omega/(\omega+1)}}{ T^{2(\omega-1)/(\omega+1)}}\Big) \cdot
\text{poly}(n^{o(1)}/\epsilon)$. This is again optimal in the sense that if the

the problem of \textsc{Budgeted Influence Maximization} (\emph{BIM Problem} in

influenced nodes. Existing Studies on this problem do not consider the

between two users always depends upon the context (e.g., sports, politics,

\textsc{Tag\mbox{-}Based Budgeted Influence Maximization problem} (\emph{TBIM
Problem} in short), where along with the other inputs, a tag set (each of them
is also associated with a selection cost) is given, each edge of the network
has the tag specific influence probability, and here the goal is to select
influential users as well as influential tags within the allocated budget to
maximize the influence. Considering the fact that real-world campaigns targeted
in nature, we also study the \textsc{Earned Benefit Maximization} Problem in

we are given a subset of the nodes as target users, and each one of them is
associated with a benefit value that can be earned by influencing them.
Considering the fact that different tag has different popularity across the
communities of the same network, we propose three methodologies that work based
on \emph{effective marginal influence gain computation}. The proposed
methodologies have been analyzed for their time and space requirements.

top is crucial for accessing edge localized modes (ELMs) suppression in
tokamaks. Since radial location of rotation zero-crossing plays a key role in
determining the threshold for field penetration of RMP, plasma response may be
different in low input torque plasmas. In this work, the linear MHD code MARS-F
is applied to reveal the dependence of plasma response to RMP on rotation
zero-crossing by a scan of rotation profiles based on an EAST equilibrium. It
is shown that the plasma response is enhanced when zero-crossing occurs near
rational surfaces. The dependence of plasma response on the location of
rotation zero-crossing is well fitted by a double Gaussian, indicating two
effects in this enhancement. One is induced by rotation screening effect shown
as a wide base (with a width around 10-20 krad/s), and the other is related to
resistive singular layer effect characterized by a localized peak (with a width
around 3-4 krad/s). The width of the peak scales with the resistive singular
layer width. The plasma displacement suggests the response is tearing like when
zero-crossing is within the singular layer, while it is kink like when
zero-crossing is far from the layer. The enhancement of magnetic islands width
at the peak is only around a factor of two, when the absolute value of local
rotation is not larger than 10-20 krad/s. It is further confirmed in a modeling
of plasma response in an EAST ELM suppression discharge. Though there is a
zero-crossing in $E\times B$ rotation but not in electron perpendicular
rotation, no significant difference in plasma response is obtained using these
two rotation profiles. This suggests that the rotation near pedestal top should
not be far away from zero but may not be necessary to have zero-crossing for
accessing ELM suppression.

to secure safety and improve spectrum efficiency. However, spectrum anomaly
detection faces many difficulties, especially in unauthorized frequency bands.
For example, the composition of unauthorized frequency bands is very complex
and the abnormal usage patterns are unknown in prior. In this paper, a noise
attention method is proposed for unsupervised spectrum anomaly detection in
unauthorized bands. First of all, we theoretically prove that the anomalies in
unauthorized bands will raise the noise floor of spectrogram after VAE
reconstruction. Then, we introduce a novel anomaly metric named as noise
attention score to more effectively capture spectrum anomaly. The effectiveness
of the proposed method is experimentally verified in 2.4 GHz ISM band.
Leveraging the noise attention score, the AUC metric of anomaly detection is
increased by 0.193. The proposed method is beneficial to reliably detecting
abnormal spectrum while keeping low false alarm rate.

the foveal region of the eye. In current clinical practice, the ophthalmologist
manually detects potential presence of such GA based on fundus autofluorescence
(FAF) images, and hence diagnoses the disease, when relevant. However, in view
of the general scarcity of ophthalmologists relative to the large number of
subjects seeking eyecare, especially in remote regions, it becomes imperative
to develop methods to direct expert time and effort to medically significant
cases. Further, subjects from either disadvantaged background or remote
localities, who face considerable economic/physical barrier in consulting
trained ophthalmologists, tend to seek medical attention only after being
reasonably certain that an adverse condition exists. To serve the interest of
both the ophthalmologist and the potential patient, we plan a screening step,
where healthy and diseased eyes are algorithmically differentiated with limited
input from only optometrists who are relatively more abundant in number.
Specifically, an early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid is
placed by an optometrist on each FAF image, based on which sectoral statistics
are automatically collected. Using such statistics as features, healthy and
diseased eyes are proposed to be classified by training an algorithm using
available medical records. In this connection, we demonstrate the efficacy of
support vector machines (SVM). Specifically, we consider SVM with linear as

performance of both variants. Among those, we recommend the latter in view of
its slight superiority in terms of classification accuracy (90.55% at a

Properly responding to various linguistic expressions, including polysemous

are not included in the action-description paired datasets by using pre-trained
word embeddings. However, the word embeddings trained under the distributional

using the robot's sensory-motor experiences. We extend a bidirectional

layers that retrofit the word embeddings. By training the retrofit layer and
the bidirectional translation model alternately, our proposed model is able to
transform the pre-trained word embeddings to adapt to a paired

computational costs associated to this technique, allowing to estimate the
power spectra up to higher multipoles than previous implementations. In
particular, for a resolution of $N_\mathrm{side}=64$, $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}=192$
and a typical Galactic mask, the number of operations can be reduced by
approximately a factor of 1000 in a full analysis including intensity and
polarization with respect to an efficient direct implementation of the method.
In addition, if one is interested in studying only polarization, it is possible
to obtain the power spectra of the E and B modes with a further reduction of
computational resources without degrading the results. We also show that for
experiments observing a small fraction of the sky, the Fisher matrix becomes
singular and, in this case, the standard QML can not be applied. To solve this
problem, we have developed a binned version of the method that is unbiased and
of minimum variance. We also test the robustness of the QML estimator when the
assumed fiducial model differs from that of the sky and show the performance of
an iterative approach. Finally, we present a comparison of the results obtained

calculation to show that the second derivative of the defining function of a
centrally symmetric domain at the endpoints of a bouncing ball orbit is a
spectral invariant. This is also true for up/down symmetric domains, removing
an assumption from the proof in that case.

$\ell^0$ defined in analogy with the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN).
Moreover, the first convolutional layer is equipped with lateral connections
defined as a propagation driven by a learned connectivity kernel, in analogy
with the horizontal connectivity of the primary visual cortex (V1). The layer
$\ell^0$ shows a rotational symmetric pattern well approximated by a Laplacian
of Gaussian (LoG), which is a well-known model of the receptive profiles of LGN

Gabor functions, in agreement with well-established models for the profiles of
simple cells in V1. We study the learned lateral connectivity kernel of this

consistency, CycleGAN requires two generators and two discriminators to enforce
cycle consistency, demanding significant GPU resources and technical skills for
training. A recent proposal of tunable CycleGAN with Adaptive Instance
Normalization (AdaIN) alleviates the problem in part by using a single
generator. However, two discriminators and an additional AdaIN code generator
are still required for training. To solve this problem, here we present a novel
cycle-free Cycle-GAN architecture, which consists of a single generator and a
discriminator but still guarantees cycle consistency. The main innovation comes
from the observation that the use of an invertible generator automatically
fulfills the cycle consistency condition and eliminates the additional
discriminator in the CycleGAN formulation. To make the invertible generator
more effective, our network is implemented in the wavelet residual domain.
Extensive experiments using various levels of low-dose CT images confirm that
our method can significantly improve denoising performance using only 10% of
learnable parameters and faster training time compared to the conventional
CycleGAN.

various deep Click-Through Rate (CTR) models are deployed in the commercial
systems by industrial companies. To achieve better performance, it is necessary
to train the deep CTR models on huge volume of training data efficiently, which
makes speeding up the training process an essential problem. Different from the
models with dense training data, the training data for CTR models is usually
high-dimensional and sparse. To transform the high-dimensional sparse input
into low-dimensional dense real-value vectors, almost all deep CTR models adopt
the embedding layer, which easily reaches hundreds of GB or even TB. Since a
single GPU cannot afford to accommodate all the embedding parameters, when
performing distributed training, it is not reasonable to conduct the
data-parallelism only. Therefore, existing distributed training platforms for
recommendation adopt model-parallelism. Specifically, they use CPU (Host)
memory of servers to maintain and update the embedding parameters and utilize
GPU worker to conduct forward and backward computations. Unfortunately, these
platforms suffer from two bottlenecks: (1) the latency of pull \& push
operations between Host and GPU; (2) parameters update and synchronization in
the CPU servers. To address such bottlenecks, in this paper, we propose the
ScaleFreeCTR: a MixCache-based distributed training system for CTR models.
Specifically, in SFCTR, we also store huge embedding table in CPU but utilize
GPU instead of CPU to conduct embedding synchronization efficiently. To reduce
the latency of data transfer between both GPU-Host and GPU-GPU, the MixCache
mechanism and Virtual Sparse Id operation are proposed. Comprehensive
experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of SFCTR.

conditions under which the environment model could produce the expectation of

when the environment is stochastic and non-stationary, and the model is
approximate, such as when it is learned using function approximation. In these
cases a full distribution model may be impractical and a sample model may be
either more expensive computationally or of high variance. Wan et al.
considered only planning for prediction to evaluate a fixed policy. In this
paper, we treat the control case - planning to improve and find a good
approximate policy. We prove that planning with an expectation model must
update a state-value function, not an action-value function as previously
suggested (e.g., Sorg & Singh, 2010). This opens the question of how planning
influences action selections. We consider three strategies for this and present

these algorithms in computational experiments. Our algorithms and experiments

can serve as the smoking gun evidence for Kondo physics in the cold atom

the Fermi surface is suppressed by Zeeman energy and the conductivity becomes
more and more symmetric. Our results can be verified in the current

accurate tiny vessel segmentation in fundus images is critical. Promising
results for accurate vessel segmentation have been known. However, their

study retinal vessel segmentation by incorporating tiny vessel segmentation
into our framework for the overall accurate vessel segmentation. To achieve
this, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which divides
vessel segmentation into two separate objectives. Specifically, we consider the
overall accurate vessel segmentation and tiny vessel segmentation as two
individual objectives. Then, by exploiting the objective-dependent
(homoscedastic) uncertainty, we enable the network to learn both objectives
simultaneously. Further, to improve the individual objectives, we propose: (a)
a vessel weight map based auxiliary loss for enhancing tiny vessel connectivity
(i.e., improving tiny vessel segmentation), and (b) an enhanced encoder-decoder
architecture for improved localization (i.e., for accurate vessel
segmentation). Using 3 public retinal vessel segmentation datasets (CHASE_DB1,

segmenting tiny vessels (8.3% average improvement in sensitivity) while
achieving better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)

to leak information. Most existing cache channels exploit the timing difference
between cache hits and cache misses. However, we introduce a new and broader
classification of cache covert channel attacks: Hit+Miss, Hit+Hit, and
Miss+Miss. We highlight that cache misses for cache lines in different states
may have more significant time differences, and these can be used as timing
channels. Based on this classification, we propose a new stable and stealthy
Miss+Miss cache channel. Write-back caches are widely deployed in modern
processors. This paper presents in detail a way in which replacement latency
differences can be used to construct timing-based channels (called WB channels)
to leak information in a write-back cache. Any modification to a cache line by
a sender will set it to the dirty state, and the receiver can observe this
through measuring the latency of replacing this cache set. We also demonstrate
how senders could exploit a different number of dirty cache lines in a cache
set to improve transmission bandwidth with symbols encoding multiple bits. The
peak transmission bandwidths of the WB channels in commercial systems can vary
between 1300 and 4400~kbps per cache set in a hyper-threaded setting without
shared memory between the sender and the receiver. In contrast to most existing
cache channels, which always target specific memory addresses, the new WB
channels focus on the cache set and cache line states, making it difficult for
the channel to be disturbed by other processes on the core, and they can still
work in a cache using a random replacement policy. We also analyzed the
stealthiness of WB channels from the perspective of the number of cache loads
and cache miss rates. We discuss and evaluate possible defenses. The paper

of neutrons, protons and leptons threaded by a magnetar-strength magnetic field
$10^{14}$--$10^{17}$ G, where quantum electrodynamical effects and Landau
quantization of fermions are important. Stability is determined using the
Friedman--Schutz formalism for the canonical energy of fluid perturbations,
which we calculate for a magnetizable fluid with $H\neq B$. Using this and the
Euler--Heisenberg--Fermi--Dirac Lagrangian for a strongly magnetized fluid of
Landau-quantized charged fermions, we calculate the local stability criteria
for a fluid slab as a stand-in for a segment of a neutron star core, accounting
for magnetic and composition gradient buoyancy. The slab is threaded by a field
orthogonal to the gravitational field, the Cartesian analogy to a toroidal
field. We find that, for sufficiently strong fields $B\gtrsim10^{15}$ G, the
magnetized fluid is unstable to a magnetosonic-type instability with growth
times of order $10^{-3}$ s. The instability is triggered by sharp changes in
the second-order field derivative of the Euler--Heisenberg--Fermi--Dirac
Lagrangian which occur where additional Landau levels start being populated.
These sharp changes are divergent at zero temperature, but are finite for
nonzero temperature, so realistic neutron star core temperatures $5\times10^7$

the formation of magnetic domains as predicted by Blandford and Hernquist

decay rates of the solution as well as its all--order spatial derivatives from
one--order to the highest--order, which are the same as those of the

well--chosen initial data, we also show the lower bounds on the decay rates.
Therefore, our time decay rates are optimal. Third, we give the explicit
influences of the electric field on the qualitative behaviors of solutions,
which are totally new as compared to the results for the compressible unipolar

Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of these sources in quiescent states were

modeled the SEDs using one-zone leptonic synchrotron and inverse-Compton
emission scenario from broken power-law electron energy distribution inside a
spherical plasma blob, relativistically moving down a conical jet. The model
takes into account inverse-Compton scattering of externally and locally
originated seed photons in the jet. The big blue bumps visible in quiescent
state SEDs helped to estimate the accretion disk luminosities and central black
hole masses. We found a correlation between the magnetic field inside the
emission region and the ratio of emission region distance to disk luminosity,
which implies that the magnetic field decreases with an increase in emission
region distance and decrease in disk luminosity, suggesting a disk-jet
connection. The high-energy index of the electron distribution was also found
to be correlated with observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity as $\gamma$-rays are
produced by high-energy particles. In most cases, kinetic power carried by
electrons can account for jet radiation power as jets become radiatively
inefficient during quiescent states.

languages for both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or
human feedback for each component of modular systems or for data-hungry
end-to-end systems is expensive and tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches
to multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer

effectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the
lack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language

parallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can
inspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list

$S_{g} \times S^{1}$. We introduce basic notions for knots in $S_{g} \times
S^{1}$, for example, diagrams, moves for diagrams and so on. For knots in
$S_{g} \times S^{1}$ technically we lose over/under information, but we will
have information how many times the knot rotates along $S^{1}$. We will discuss
the geometric meaning of the rotating information and how to construct

analytically this probability $P(R)$ for a spherical region of radius $R$ in
the case of $N$ noninteracting fermions in their ground state in a
$d$-dimensional trapping potential. Using a connection to the Laguerre-Wishart
ensembles of random matrices, we show that, for large $N$ and in the bulk of
the Fermi gas, $P(R)$ is described by a universal scaling function of $k_F R$,
for which we obtain an exact formula ($k_F$ being the local Fermi wave-vector).
It exhibits a super exponential tail $P(R)\propto e^{- \kappa_d (k_F R)^{d+1}}$
where $\kappa_d$ is a universal amplitude, in good agreement with existing
numerical simulations. When $R$ is of the order of the radius of the Fermi gas,
the hole probability is described by a large deviation form which is not
universal and which we compute exactly for the harmonic potential. Similar
results also hold in momentum space.

extracts patch-level basis from the LR input, and the other branch infers
pixel-wise variational distributions with respect to the sparse coefficients.
By repeatedly sampling coefficients, we could obtain infinite sparse

using a nearest-neighbor lookup in the embedding space. We tackle the problem
of correctly identifying the closest place by correlating the candidates' power
spectra, obtaining a confidence value per prospect. Our estimate for the
correct place corresponds then to the candidate with the highest confidence. We
evaluate our proposal w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches in place recognition
using real-world data acquired using different sensors. Our approach can
achieve a recall that is up to 10% and 5% higher than for a LiDAR- and
vision-based system, respectively, when the sensor setup differs between model
training and deployment. Additionally, our place selection can correctly
identify up to 95% matches from the candidate set.

other forms of extreme behavior in nonlinear dissipative partial differential
equations are affected by stochastic excitations. To address this question we
consider the 1D fractional Burgers equation with additive colored noise as a
model problem. This system is interesting, because in the deterministic setting
it exhibits finite-time blow-up or a globally well-posed behavior depending on
the value of the fractional dissipation exponent. The problem is studied by
performing a series of accurate numerical computations combining
spectrally-accurate spatial discretization with a Monte-Carlo approach. First,
we carefully document the singularity formation in the deterministic system in
the supercritical regime where the blow-up time is shown to be a decreasing
function of the fractional dissipation exponent. Our main result for the
stochastic problem is that there is no evidence for the noise to regularize the
evolution by suppressing blow-up in the supercritical regime, or for the noise
to trigger blow-up in the subcritical regime. However, as the noise amplitude
becomes large, the blow-up times in the supercritical regime are shown to
exhibit an increasingly non-Gaussian behavior. Analogous observations are also
made for the maximum attained values of the enstrophy and the times when the
maxima occur in the subcritical regime.

of an effective immune response against the tumour, resulting in better
survival. In this study, our aim is to explore the prognostic significance of
tumour-associated stroma infiltrating lymphocytes (TASILs) in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through an AI based automated method. A deep
learning based automated method was employed to segment tumour, stroma and
lymphocytes in digitally scanned whole slide images of HNSCC tissue slides. The
spatial patterns of lymphocytes and tumour-associated stroma were digitally
quantified to compute the TASIL-score. Finally, prognostic significance of the
TASIL-score for disease-specific and disease-free survival was investigated
with the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Three different cohorts of
Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained tissue slides of HNSCC cases (n=537 in
total) were studied, including publicly available TCGA head and neck cancer
cases. The TASIL-score carries prognostic significance (p=0.002) for
disease-specific survival of HNSCC patients. The TASIL-score also shows a
better separation between low- and high-risk patients as compared to the manual
TIL scoring by pathologists for both disease-specific and disease-free
survival. A positive correlation of TASIL-score with molecular estimates of
CD8+ T cells was also found, which is in line with existing findings. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study to automate the quantification
of TASIL from routine H&E slides of head and neck cancer. Our TASIL-score based
findings are aligned with the clinical knowledge with the added advantages of
objectivity, reproducibility and strong prognostic value. A comprehensive
evaluation on large multicentric cohorts is required before the proposed
digital score can be adopted in clinical practice.

fundamentally in the theory of relativity, which has caused a lot of confusion
in the community; a typical example is the Gordon metric tensor, which was
developed almost a century ago, and has been widely used to describe the
equivalent gravitational effect of moving media on light propagation,
predicting a novel physics of optical black hole. In this paper, it is shown
that under Lorentz transformation, a covariant tensor satisfies three rules:
(1) the tensor keeps invariant in mathematical form in all inertial frames; (2)
all elements of the tensor have the same physical definitions in all frames;
(3) the tensor expression in one inertial frame does not include any physical
quantities defined in other frames. The three rules constitute a criterion for
testing the covariance of physical laws, required by Einstein's principle of
relativity. Gordon metric does not satisfy Rule (3), and its covariance cannot
be identified before a general refractive index is defined. Finally, it is also
shown as well that in the relativistic quantum mechanics, the Lorentz
covariance of Dirac wave equation is not compatible with Einstein's mass-energy
equivalence.

prediction. Although molecular dynamics can predict affinity with high accuracy
at present, it is not suitable for large-scale virtual screening. The existing
affinity prediction and evaluation functions based on deep learning mostly rely
on experimentally-determined conformations. Results: We build a predictive
model of protein-ligand affinity through the ResNet neural network with added
attention mechanism. The resulting ResAtom-Score model achieves Pearson's
correlation coefficient R = 0.833 on the CASF-2016 benchmark test set. At the
same time, we evaluated the performance of a variety of existing scoring
functions in combination with ResAtom-Score in the absence of
experimentally-determined conformations. The results show that the use of
{\Delta}VinaRF20 in combination with ResAtom-Score can achieve affinity
prediction close to scoring functions in the presence of
experimentally-determined conformations. These results suggest that ResAtom
system may be used for in silico screening of small molecule ligands with
target proteins in the future. Availability: https://github.com/wyji001/ResAtom

power transfer applications. For such systems, their wireless power receiver
part typically involves a DC-DC converter with front-stage full-bridge diode
rectifier, to process the high-frequency transmitted AC power into a DC output
voltage for the load. It is recently reported that the current source nature of
the series-series compensation will introduce right-half-plane (RHP) zeros into
the small-signal transfer functions of the DC-DC converter of the wireless
power receiver, which will severely affect the stability and dynamic response
of the system. To resolve this issue, in this paper, it is proposed to adopt a
different rectifier configuration for the system such that the input current to
the DC-DC converter becomes controllable to eliminate the presence of RHP zeros
of the small-signal transfer functions of the system. This rectifier can be
applied to different wireless power receivers using the buck, buck-boost, or
boost converters. As compared with the original wireless power receivers, the
modified ones feature minimum-phase characteristics and hence ease the design
of compensator. Theoretical and experimental results are provided. The
comparative experimental results verify the elimination of the RHP zero,
improved dynamic responses of reference tracking and against load disturbances,
and a larger stability margin.
