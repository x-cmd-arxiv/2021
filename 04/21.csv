Jagtap, George Em Karniadakis","Parallel Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Domain Decomposition","23 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop a distributed framework for the physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) based on two recent extensions, namely conservative PINNs (cPINNs) and
extended PINNs (XPINNs), which employ domain decomposition in space and in
time-space, respectively. This domain decomposition endows cPINNs and XPINNs
with several advantages over the vanilla PINNs, such as parallelization
capacity, large representation capacity, efficient hyperparameter tuning, and
is particularly effective for multi-scale and multi-physics problems. Here, we
present a parallel algorithm for cPINNs and XPINNs constructed with a hybrid
programming model described by MPI $+$ X, where X $\in
\{\text{CPUs},~\text{GPUs}\}$. The main advantage of cPINN and XPINN over the
more classical data and model parallel approaches is the flexibility of
optimizing all hyperparameters of each neural network separately in each
subdomain. We compare the performance of distributed cPINNs and XPINNs for
various forward problems, using both weak and strong scalings. Our results
indicate that for space domain decomposition, cPINNs are more efficient in
terms of communication cost but XPINNs provide greater flexibility as they can
also handle time-domain decomposition for any differential equations, and can
deal with any arbitrarily shaped complex subdomains. To this end, we also
present an application of the parallel XPINN method for solving an inverse
diffusion problem with variable conductivity on the United States map, using
ten regions as subdomains.

  risk assessment: a UK Biobank study","28 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading causes of
death worldwide. Predictive scores providing personalised risk of developing
CVD are increasingly used in clinical practice. Most scores, however, utilise a
homogenous set of features and require the presence of a physician.
  Objective: The aim was to develop a new risk model (DiCAVA) using statistical
and machine learning techniques that could be applied in a remote setting. A
secondary goal was to identify new patient-centric variables that could be
incorporated into CVD risk assessments.
  Methods: Across 466,052 participants, Cox proportional hazards (CPH) and
DeepSurv models were trained using 608 variables derived from the UK Biobank to
investigate the 10-year risk of developing a CVD. Data-driven feature selection
reduced the number of features to 47, after which reduced models were trained.
Both models were compared to the Framingham score.
  Results: The reduced CPH model achieved a c-index of 0.7443, whereas DeepSurv
achieved a c-index of 0.7446. Both CPH and DeepSurv were superior in
determining the CVD risk compared to Framingham score. Minimal difference was
observed when cholesterol and blood pressure were excluded from the models
(CPH: 0.741, DeepSurv: 0.739). The models show very good calibration and
discrimination on the test data.
  Conclusion: We developed a cardiovascular risk model that has very good
predictive capacity and encompasses new variables. The score could be
incorporated into clinical practice and utilised in a remote setting, without
the need of including cholesterol. Future studies will focus on external
validation across heterogeneous samples.

entities unite to form more complex individuals. Such transitions have
profoundly shaped natural evolutionary history and occur in two forms:
fraternal transitions involve lower-level entities that are kin (e.g.,
transitions to multicellularity or to eusocial colonies), while egalitarian

The necessary conditions and evolutionary mechanisms for these transitions to
arise continue to be fruitful targets of scientific interest. Here, we examine
a range of fraternal transitions in populations of open-ended self-replicating

groups by selectively adjoining or expelling daughter cells. The capability to
recognize kin-group membership enabled preferential communication and
cooperation between cells. We repeatedly observed group-level traits that are

of labor, resource sharing within kin groups, resource investment in offspring
groups, asymmetrical behaviors mediated by messaging, morphological patterning,
and adaptive apoptosis. We report eight case studies from replicates where
transitions occurred and explore the diverse range of adaptive evolved

  Proteins are the main actors in cells, they are the building blocks, act as
enzymes and antibodies. The production of proteins is mediated by transcription
factors. In some cases, a protein acts as its own transcription factor, this is
called autoregulation. It is known that autorepression speeds up the response
and that autoactivation can lead to multiple stable equilibria. In this thesis,
we study the effects of the combination of activation and repression in
autoregulation, as a case study we investigate the possible dynamics of the
leucine responsive protein B of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (Ss-LrpB),
a protein that regulates itself in a unique and non-monotonic way via three
binding boxes. We examine for which conditions this type of network leads to
oscillations or bistability.
  In the second part, much larger biological systems are considered. Ecological
systems, among which the human gut microbiome, are characterized by
heavy-tailed abundance profiles. We study how these distributions can arise
from population-based models by adding saturation effects and linear noise.
Moreover, we examine different characteristics of experimental time series of
microbial communities, such as the noise color and neutrality of the
biodiversity, and look at the influence of the parameters on these
characteristics. With the first research topic we want to lay a foundation for
the understanding of non-monotonic gene regulation and take the first steps
toward synthetic biology in archaea. In the second part of the thesis, we
investigate experimental time series from complex ecosystems and seek
theoretical models reproducing all observed characteristics in view of building

their relatedness in both semantic and entities with the help of knowledge

a machine learning model to estimate a risk score based on patient vital

over a multi-access channel based on the algorithm of stochastic gradient
descent to learn the dominant feature space of a distributed dataset at

design lies in exploiting channel noise to accelerate the descent in the region
around each saddle point encountered by gradient descent, thereby increasing
the convergence speed of over-the-air PCA. The idea is materialized by
proposing a power-control scheme which detects the type of descent region and

achieve a faster convergence rate than in the case without power control.

spirit and practice of human-subjects ethics in NLP research. We enumerate
common scenarios where crowdworkers performing NLP tasks are at risk of harm.
We thus recommend that researchers evaluate these risks by considering the

that the optimal lattice quantizer is one of the classical lattices, or there
is good evidence for this. In contrast, more than two decades ago, convincing
numerical studies showed that in dimension $9$, a non-classical lattice is
optimal. The structure and properties of this lattice depend upon a real
parameter $a>0$, whose value was only known approximately. Here, we give a full
description of this one-parameter family of lattices and their Voronoi cells,
and calculate their (scalar and tensor) second moments analytically as a
function of $a$. The value of $a$ which minimizes $G$ is an algebraic number,
defined by the root of a $9$th order polynomial, with $a \approx 0.573223794$.
For this value of $a$, the covariance matrix (second moment tensor) is
proportional to the identity, consistent with a theorem of Zamir and Feder for
optimal quantizers. The structure of the Voronoi cell depends upon $a$, and
undergoes phase transitions at $a^2 = 1/2$, $1$ and $2$, where its geometry
changes abruptly. At each transition, the analytic formula for the second
moment changes in a very simple way. Our methods can be used for arbitrary
one-parameter families of layered lattices, and may thus provide a useful tool
to identify optimal quantizers in other dimensions as well.

to synchronise their periodic beats. The origin of synchronisation is a
combination of long-range hydrodynamic interactions with physical mechanisms
allowing the phases of these biological oscillators to evolve. Two of such
mechanisms have been identified by previous work, the elastic compliance of the
periodic orbit or oscillations driven by phase-dependent biological forcing. To
help uncover the physical mechanism for hydrodynamic synchronisation most
essential overall in biology, we theoretically investigate the effect of strong
confinement on the effectiveness of hydrodynamic synchronisation. We use
minimal models where appendages are modelled as rigid spheres forced to move
along circular trajectories near a rigid surface. Strong confinement is
modelled by adding a second nearby surface, parallel to the first one, where
the distance between the surfaces is much smaller than the typical distance
between the cilia. We calculate separately the impact of confinement on the
synchronisation dynamics of the elastic compliance and the force modulation
mechanisms and compare our results to the case with no confinement. Applying
our results to the biologically-relevant situation of nodal cilia, we show that
force modulation is a mechanism that leads to phase-locked states under strong
confinement that are very similar to those without confinement as a difference
with the elastic compliance mechanism. Our results point therefore to the
robustness of force modulation for synchronisation, an important feature for
biological dynamics that suggests it could be the most essential physical
mechanism overall in arrays of nodal cilia. We further examine the distinct
situation of primary cilia and show in that case that the difference in
robustness of the mechanisms is not as pronounced but still favours the force
modulation.

highly complex excitation dynamics in any TLS, in particular when the driving

motion and impulsive LZ transitions are equally important, leading to an

amplitude of these apparent non-GR polarizations is suppressed by a factor
$R_s\lambda/b^2$ with respect to the amplitude of the GR-like tensor modes. We
estimate the probability to develop these extra polarization modes for a nearly
monochromatic GW in the Pulsar Timing Arrays band traveling through a

field at given halo mass, i.e. the secondary bias. We find that the secondary
bias is the secondary effect of the correlations of halo properties with the
linear density estimated at the same comoving scale. Using the linear density
on different scales, we find two types of correlations. The internal
correlation, which reflects the correlation of halo properties with the mean
linear over-density $\delta_{\rm L}$ within the halo Lagrangian radius $R_{\rm
L}$, is positive for both $z_{\rm f}$ and $v_{\rm max}/v_{\rm 200}$, and
negative for $\lambda$. The external correlation, which describes the
correlation of halo properties with linear overdensity at $R>R_{\rm L}$ for
given $\delta_{\rm L}$, shows trends opposite to the internal correlation. Both
of the external and internal correlations depend only weakly on halo mass,
indicating a similar origin for halos of different masses. Our findings offer a
transparent perspective on the origin of the secondary bias. The secondary bias
can be largely explained by the competition of the external and internal
correlations together with the correlation of the linear density field on
different scales. These two types of correlations combined can establish the
complex halo-mass dependence of the secondary bias observed in the simulations.

raised the question about their nature and origin. One of the competing
theories of their origin is the interchange reconnection in the solar corona.
In this scenario, switchbacks are generated at the reconnection site between
open and closed magnetic fields, and are either advected by an upflow or
propagate as waves into the solar wind. In this paper we test the wave
hypothesis, numerically modelling the propagation of a switchback, modelled as
an embedded Alfv\'en wave packet of constant magnetic field magnitude, through
the gravitationally stratified solar corona with different degrees of
background magnetic field expansion. While switchbacks propagating in a uniform
medium with no gravity are relatively stable, as reported previously, we find
that gravitational stratification together with the expansion of the magnetic
field act in multiple ways to deform the switchbacks. These include WKB
effects, which depend on the degree of magnetic field expansion, and also
finite-amplitude effects, such as the symmetry breaking between nonlinear
advection and the Lorentz force. In a straight or radially expanding magnetic
field the propagating switchbacks unfold into waves that cause minimal magnetic
field deflections, while a super-radially expanding magnetic field aids in
maintaining strong deflections. Other important effects are the mass uplift the
propagating switchbacks induce and the reconnection and drainage of plasmoids
contained within the switchbacks. In the Appendix, we examine a series of
setups with different switchback configurations and parameters, which broaden
the scope of our study.

powerful at modeling long-range dependencies. Currently, the transformer is
making revolutionary progress in various vision tasks, leading to significant
performance improvements compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN)

the contributions of transformers for accurate and reliable salient object
detection. For the former, we apply transformer to a deterministic model, and
explain that the effective structure modeling and global context modeling
abilities lead to its superior performance compared with the CNN based
frameworks. For the latter, we observe that both CNN and transformer based
frameworks suffer greatly from the over-confidence issue, where the models tend
to generate wrong predictions with high confidence. To estimate the reliability
degree of both CNN- and transformer-based frameworks, we further present a
latent variable model, namely inferential generative adversarial network
(iGAN), based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). The stochastic
attribute of the latent variable makes it convenient to estimate the predictive
uncertainty, serving as an auxiliary output to evaluate the reliability of
model prediction. Different from the conventional GAN, which defines the
distribution of the latent variable as fixed standard normal distribution
$\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})$, the proposed iGAN infers the latent variable by
gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), namely Langevin dynamics,
leading to an input-dependent latent variable model. We apply our proposed iGAN
to both fully and weakly supervised salient object detection, and explain that
iGAN within the transformer framework leads to both accurate and reliable
salient object detection.

may lead to results that do not generalize in more realistic settings.
Specifically, we show that selection bias during data collection leads to
undesired artifacts in the datasets. In addition, while most systems train and
predict at the level of individual articles, overlapping article sources in the
training and evaluation data can provide a strong confounding factor that
models can exploit. In the presence of this confounding factor, the models can
achieve good performance by directly memorizing the site-label mapping instead
of modeling the real task of unreliable news detection. We observed a
significant drop (>10%) in accuracy for all models tested in a clean split with
no train/test source overlap. Using the observations and experimental results,
we provide practical suggestions on how to create more reliable datasets for

Another basic property of a body is its ability to absorb incoming light,

equals these two properties at thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e.,
$\varepsilon$=$\alpha$. The generalized Planck's equation extends Kirchhof's

efficiency (QE) is a material property, defined out of equilibrium, describing
the statistics of absorption followed by emission of a photon. Both emissivity
and QE depend on the interplay between radiative and non-radiative rates. Here
we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a prime equation for emissivity
as a material property in and out of equilibrium in the form of
$\varepsilon$=$\alpha$(1-QE), which at equilibrium is reduced to Kirchhoff's

offers an exciting opportunity to investigate the interplay of correlations,
topology, and superconductivity in kagome metals. The low energy physics of
these materials is dominated by an unusual charge density wave phase, but
little is understood about the true nature of the order parameter. In this
work, we use a combination of ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy and
first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate the
charge density wave order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We find that the charge density
wave is the result of a simultaneous condensation of three optical phonon modes
at one $M$ and two $L$ points. This distortion can be described as
tri-hexagonal ordering with an interlayer modulation along the $c$ axis. It
breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry of the crystal and may offer a natural
explanation for reports of uniaxial order at lower temperatures in this
material family.

(M3C). This task requires an AI to comprehend given steps of multimodal
instructions and then answer questions. Compared to vanilla machine
comprehension tasks where an AI is required only to understand a textual input,
procedural M3C is more challenging as the AI needs to comprehend both the
temporal and causal factors along with multimodal inputs. Recently Yagcioglu et
al. [35] introduced RecipeQA dataset to evaluate M3C. Our first contribution is
the introduction of two new M3C datasets- WoodworkQA and DecorationQA with 16K
and 10K instructional procedures, respectively. We then evaluate M3C using a
textual cloze style question-answering task and highlight an inherent bias in
the question answer generation method from [35] that enables a naive baseline
to cheat by learning from only answer choices. This naive baseline performs
similar to a popular method used in question answering- Impatient Reader [6]
that uses attention over both the context and the query. We hypothesized that
this naturally occurring bias present in the dataset affects even the best
performing model. We verify our proposed hypothesis and propose an algorithm
capable of modifying the given dataset to remove the bias elements. Finally, we
report our performance on the debiased dataset with several strong baselines.
We observe that the performance of all methods falls by a margin of 8% - 16%
after correcting for the bias. We hope these datasets and the analysis will
provide valuable benchmarks and encourage further research in this area.

avoided due to selection instability, lack of regularization, and difficulties

perspective. Given any Bayesian predictive model $\mathcal{M}$, we extract a
family of near-optimal subsets of variables for linear prediction or
classification. This strategy deemphasizes the role of a single ""best"" subset
and instead advances the broader perspective that often many subsets are highly
competitive. The acceptable family of subsets offers a new pathway for model
interpretation and is neatly summarized by key members such as the smallest
acceptable subset, along with new (co-) variable importance metrics based on
whether variables (co-) appear in all, some, or no acceptable subsets. More
broadly, we apply Bayesian decision analysis to derive the optimal linear
coefficients for any subset of variables. These coefficients inherit both
regularization and predictive uncertainty quantification via $\mathcal{M}$. For
both simulated and real data, the proposed approach exhibits better prediction,
interval estimation, and variable selection than competing Bayesian and
frequentist selection methods. These tools are applied to a large education

insights into the combination of environmental, socioeconomic, and demographic
factors that predict educational outcomes, and identifies over 200 distinct

undecidable already in the non-equivariant setting.

learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural
relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network
(VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In
particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled
probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes
complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other
path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded
distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path
during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design
point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit
relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the
coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud
dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders
partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms
state-of-theart methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks.
Notably, VRCNet shows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point

varieties in languages have critical impact on learning a comprehension model.
While prior work usually treats each sentence and attends it to an object
separately, we focus on learning a referring expression comprehension model
that considers the property in synonymous sentences. To this end, we develop an
end-to-end trainable framework to learn contrastive features on the image and
object instance levels, where features extracted from synonymous sentences to
describe the same object should be closer to each other after mapping to the
visual domain. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed
algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our method
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, since
the varieties in expressions become larger across datasets when they describe

generated from the Millennium Simulation with the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic

set of observational constraints, such as magnitude limits and uncertainties in
magnitudes and photometric redshifts (photo-zs), to produce realistic
simulations of photometric surveys. We show that photo-zs obtained with PCcones
are more accurate than those obtained directly with the Millennium Simulation,
mostly due to the difference in how apparent magnitudes are computed. We apply
PCcones in the determination of the expected accuracy of protocluster detection
using photo-zs in the $z=1-3$ range in the wide-layer of HSC-SSP and the
10-year LSST forecast. With our technique, we expect to recover only $\sim38\%$

redshifts to improve detection. We also compare our mocks of the Deep CFHTLS at

with luminosity-weighted simple-stellar-population (SSP) age. In contrast, the
structural observables surface mass density, rotation-to-dispersion ratio,
S\'ersic index and projected shape all show little or no significant
correlation. We connect the FP residuals to the empirical relation between age
(or stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_\star$) and surface mass density, the
best predictor of SSP age amongst parameters based on FP observables. We show
that the FP residuals (anti-)correlate with the residuals of the relation
between surface density and $\Upsilon_\star$. This correlation implies that
part of the FP scatter is due to the broad age and $\Upsilon_\star$
distribution at any given surface mass density. Using virial mass and
$\Upsilon_\star$ we construct a simulated FP and compare it to the observed FP.
We find that, while the empirical relations between observed stellar population
relations and FP observables are responsible for most (75%) of the FP scatter,
on their own they do not explain the observed tilt of the FP away from the
virial plane.

model out of a large pool of trial models based on different assumed mass
distributions represents the true structure of an observed galaxy best. We show
that the traditional approach to judge models solely by their goodness-of-fit
can lead to substantial biases in estimated galaxy properties caused by varying
model flexibilities. We demonstrate how the flexibility of the models can be
estimated using bootstrap iterations and present a model selection framework
that removes these biases by taking the variable flexibility into account in
the model evaluation. We extend the model selection approach to optimize the
degree of regularisation directly from the data. Altogether, this leads to a
significant improvement of the constraining power of the modeling technique. We
show with simulations that one can reconstruct the mass, anisotropy and viewing
angle of an axisymmetric galaxy with a few percent accuracy from realistic
observational data with fully resolved line-of-sight velocity distributions
(LOSVDs). In a first application, we reproduce a photometric estimate of the
inclination of the disk galaxy NGC 3368 to within 5 degree accuracy from
kinematic data that cover only a few sphere-of-influence radii around the

as a function of impact parameter around galaxies. The averaged CP2D spectrum
of all galaxies shows clear signatures of Ly$\alpha$ resonant scattering by

of azimuthal angle with respect to their major axes. The extended Ly$\alpha$
emission along the galaxy principal axes are statistically indistinguishable,
with residual asymmetry of $\le$ 2% ($\sim 2 \sigma$) of the integrated

is dominated by outflows in all directions within 30 kpc. Meanwhile, we find
that the blueshifted component of Ly$\alpha$ emission is marginally stronger

can discriminate between modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian
gravity. HVSs are ejected from the Galactic center on radial trajectories with
a null tangential velocity component in the reference frame of the Galaxy. They
acquire tangential components due to the nonspherical components of the
Galactic gravitational potential. Axisymmetric potentials only affect the
latitudinal components, $v_\theta$, and non-null azimuthal components,
$v_\phi$, originate from non-axisymmetric matter distributions. For HVSs with
sufficiently high ejection speed, $v_\phi$ is proportionate to the deviation of
the gravitational potential from axial symmetry. The ejection velocity
threshold is $\sim$ 750 km/s for 4 $M_{\odot}$ stars and increases with
decreasing HVS mass. We determine the upper limit of $v_\phi$ as a function of
the galactocentric distance for these high-speed HVSs if QUMOND, the
quasi-linear formulation of MOND, is the correct theory of gravity and either
the triaxial Galactic bulge or a nonspherical hot gaseous halo is the primary
source of $v_\phi$. In Newtonian gravity, the HVSs within 60 kpc of the
Galactic center may easily have $v_\phi$ values higher than the QUMOND upper
limit if the dark matter (DM) halo is triaxial or if the DM halo and the
baryonic components are axisymmetric but their two axes of symmetry are
misaligned. Therefore, even a limited sample of high-speed HVSs could
distinguish between QUMOND and the DM model. This test is currently limited by
(i) the lack of a proper procedure to assess the HVS nature of a star in the
model to be constrained; and (ii) the present uncertainties on $v_\phi$, which
are a factor of $\sim 10$ too large. A proper procedure to assess the HVS

band structures with engineered physical properties. Specifically, moir\'e
structures with Fermi surface flat bands - a synthetic environment for the
realization of correlated phases - have moir\'e unit cells containing thousands
of atoms and tantalizingly complex bands structures. In this paper we show that
statistical principles go a long way in explaining universal physical
properties of these systems. Our approach builds on three conceptual elements:
the presence of quantum chaos caused by the effective irregularity of the
atomic configurations on short length scales, Anderson localization in momentum
space, and the presence of approximate crystalline symmetries. Which of these
principles dominates depends on material parameters such as the extension of
the Fermi surface or the strength of the moir\'e lattice potential. The
phenomenological consequences of this competition are predictions for the
characteristic group velocity of moir\'e bands, a primary indicator for their
average flatness. In addition to these generic features, we identify structures
outside the statistical context, notably almost flat bands close to the extrema
of the unperturbed spectra, and the celebrated zero energy `magic angle' flat
bands, where the latter require exceptionally fine tuned material parameters.

evolution of dense cores in weakly-ionized molecular clouds. Linear analyses
show that the evolutionary times and fragmentation scales are significantly
greater than the hydrodynamic (Jeans) values even for clouds with mildly
supercritical mass-to-flux ratio. We utilize values of fragmentation scales and
growth times that correspond to typical ionization fractions within a molecular
cloud, and apply to the context of the observed estimated lifetime of
prestellar cores as well as the observed number of such embedded cores forming
in a parent clump. By varying a single parameter, the mass-to-flux ratio, over
the range of observationally measured densities, we fit the range of estimated
prestellar core lifetimes ($\sim 0.1$ to a few Myr) identified with Herschel as
well as the number of embedded cores formed in a parent clump measured in
Perseus with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). Our model suggests that the
prestellar cores are formed with a transcritical mass-to-flux ratio and higher
densities correspond to somewhat higher mass-to-flux ratio but the normalized
mass-to-flux ratio $\mu$ remains in the range $1 \lesssim \mu \lesssim 2$. Our
best-fit model exhibits $B \propto n^{0.43}$ for prestellar cores, due to
partial flux-freezing as a consequence of ambipolar diffusion.

traditionally perform poorly on the data sets having a significant
orientational disorder, that is, having multiple copies of the same or similar
object in arbitrary orientation in the image plane. Similarly, while clustering
methods are well suited for classification into discrete classes and manifold
learning and variational autoencoders methods can disentangle representations
of the data, the combined problem is ill-suited to a classical non-supervised
learning paradigm. Here we introduce a joint rotationally (and translationally)
invariant variational autoencoder (j-trVAE) that is ideally suited to the
solution of such a problem. The performance of this method is validated on
several synthetic data sets and extended to high-resolution imaging data of
electron and scanning probe microscopy. We show that latent space behaviors
directly comport to the known physics of ferroelectric materials and quantum
systems. We further note that the engineering of the latent space structure via
imposed topological structure or directed graph relationship allows for
applications in topological discovery and causal physical learning.

the gravitino mass goes to zero, a tower of KK states as well as emergent
strings becomes tensionless. This conjecture may be motivated from the Weak
Gravity Conjecture as applied to strings and membranes and implies in turn the
AdS Distance Conjecture. We test this proposal in classical 4d type IIA
orientifold vacua in which one obtains a range of values $\tfrac13 \le \delta
\le 1$. The parameter $\delta$ is related to the scale decoupling exponent in
AdS vacua and to the $\alpha$ exponent in the Swampland Distance Conjecture for
the type IIA complex structure. We present a general analysis of the gravitino
mass in the limits of moduli space in terms of limiting Mixed Hodge Structures

obtain general lower bounds $\delta\, \geq \, \frac{1}{3}, \, \frac{1}{4}$ for
Calabi--Yau threefolds and fourfolds, respectively. The conjecture has
important phenomenological implications. In particular we argue that low-energy
supersymmetry of order 1 TeV is only obtained if there is a tower of KK states

in weakly-compressible homogeneous shear turbulence (HST). The study is
conducted by varying three dimensionless physical parameters: the initial gas
temperature over the critical temperature $T_{g,0}/T_c$, the initial droplet
diameter over the Kolmogorov scale $d_0/\eta$ and the surface tension, i.e. the
shear-based Weber number, $We_{\mathcal{S}}$. For the smallest
$We_{\mathcal{S}}$, we first discuss the impact on the evaporation rate of the
three thermodynamic models employed to evaluate the gas thermophysical
properties: a constant property model and two variable-properties approaches
where either the gas density or all the gas properties are allowed to vary.
Taking this last approach as reference, the model assuming constant gas
properties and evaluated with the ""1/3"" rule, is shown to predict the
evaporation rate better than the model where the only variable property is the
gas density. Moreover, we observe that the well-known Fr\""ossling/Ranz-Marshall
correlation underpredicts the Sherwood number at low temperatures,
$T_{g,0}/T_c=0.75$. Next, we show that the ratio between the actual evaporation
rate in turbulence and the one computed in stagnant condition is always much
higher than one for weakly deformable droplets: it decreases with $T_{g,0}/T_c$
without approaching unity at the highest $T_{g,0}/T_c$ considered. This
suggests an evaporation enhancement due to turbulence also in conditions
typical of combustion applications. Finally, we examine the overall evaporation
rate and the local interfacial mass-flux at higher $We_{\mathcal{S}}$, showing
a positive correlation between evaporation rate and interfacial curvature,
especially at the lowest $T_{g,0}/T_c$.

contributions from isocurvature modes to the CMB bispectra using a modified
version of the second-order Boltzmann solver SONG. We investigate the ability
of current and future CMB experiments to constrain these modes with
observations of the bispectrum. Our results show that the enhancement due to
single isocurvature modes mixed with the adiabatic mode is negligible for the
parameter ranges currently allowed by the most recent Planck results. However,
we find that a large compensated isocurvature mode can produce a detectable

non-observation of this contribution in searches for the lensing bispectrum
from Planck allows us to place a new constraint on the relative amplitude of

extreme of those scenarios ($f_{\rm CIP}=16.5$) at 2 to 3-$\sigma$

of social choice functions on strict preferences domains if the range has no
more than three elements. We extend this result and at the same time simplify
it. Our analysis points out the role of individual strategy-proofness in
deriving the preference reversal property, giving back to the latter its
original individual nature (cfr. Eliaz, 2004).
  Moreover, we show that the difficulties Berga and Moreno highlighted relaxing
the assumption on the cardinality of the range, disappear under a proper
assumption on the domain. We introduce the concept of complete sets of
preferences and show that individual strategy-proofness is sufficient to obtain
the preference reversal property when the agents' feasible set of orderings is
complete. This covers interesting cases like single peaked preferences, rich
domains admitting regular social choice functions, and universal domains. The
fact that we use individual rather than group strategy-proofness, allows to get
immediately some of the known, and some new, equivalences between individual

Herschel/HIFI observations in the submm lines of 12CO in nine pPNe and nine PNe

us to identify and measure the different nebular components in the line
profiles. The comparison with large velocity gradient (LVG) model predictions
was used to estimate the physical conditions of the warm gas in the nebulae,
such as excitation conditions, temperature, and density. We found high kinetic
temperatures for the fast winds of pPNe, typically reaching between 75 K and
200 K. In contrast, the high-velocity gas in the sampled PNe is colder, with
characteristic temperatures between 25 K and 75 K, and it is found in a lower
excitation state. We interpret this correlation of the kinetic temperature and
excitation state of fast outflows with the amount of time elapsed since their
acceleration (probably driven by shocks) as a consequence of the cooling that

for settling oblate and prolate spheroids in a stratified fluid. We present the
results for the Reynolds number, $Re$, in the range $80-250$ and the Richardson
number, $Ri$, in the range $0-10$. We find that both the oblate and prolate
spheroids reorient to the edge-wise and partially edge-wise orientations,
respectively, as they settle in a stratified fluid completely different from
the steady-state broad-side on orientation observed in a homogeneous fluid. We
observe that reorientation instabilities emerge when the velocity magnitude of
the spheroids fall below a particular threshold. We also report the enhancement
of the drag on the particle from stratification. The torque due to buoyancy
effects tries to orient the spheroid in an edge-wise orientation while the
hydrodynamic torque tries to orient it to a broad-side on orientation. Below
the velocity threshold, the buoyancy torque dominates; resulting in the onset
of reorientation instability. Finally, the asymmetry in the distribution of the
baroclinic vorticity generation term around the spheroids explains the onset of
the reorientation instability.

The IODE is integrated in time using a multi-step implicit method based on

us to represent ten spin-orbitals on five qubits of an IBM Quantum processor to
compute the ground state energy of the water molecule in the most accurate
simulation to date. We discuss conditions for applicability of classical
entanglement forging and present a roadmap for scaling to larger problems.

one is interested in model selection. Two common approaches to solve this

model averaging. Instead, we select a subset of the combined parameter space
associated with the models. Specifically, a model averaging perspective is used
to increase the parameter space, and a model selection criterion is used to
select a subset of this expanded parameter space. We account for the
variability of the criterion by adapting Yekutieli (2012)'s method to Bayesian
model averaging (BMA). Yekutieli (2012)'s method treats model selection as a
truncation problem. We truncate the joint support of the data and the parameter
space to only include small values of the covariance penalized error (CPE)
criterion. The CPE is a general expression that contains several information
criteria as special cases. Simulation results show that as long as the
truncated set does not have near zero probability, we tend to obtain lower mean
squared error than BMA. Additional theoretical results are provided that
provide the foundation for these observations. We apply our approach to a

previous surveys of Seyferts conducted by ALMA and allows us to study the gas
feeding and feedback cycle in a combined sample of 19 Seyferts. We used ALMA to
obtain new images of the emission of molecular gas and dust using the CO(3-2)
and HCO+(4-3) lines as well as their underlying continuum emission at 870
microns with high spatial resolutions (0.1'' ~ 7 - 13 pc) in the CND of 10
nearby (D < 28 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. Our new ALMA observations detect 870
micron continuum and CO line emission from spatially resolved disks located
around the AGN in all the sources. The bulk of the continuum flux can be
accounted for by thermal emission from dust in the majority of the targets. For
most of the sources the disks show a preponderant orientation perpendicular to
the AGN wind axes, as expected for dusty molecular tori. The median diameters
and molecular gas masses of the tori are ~ 42 pc, and ~ 6 x 10**5 Msun,
respectively. We find a positive correlation between the line-of-sight gas
column densities responsible for the absorption of X-rays and the molecular gas
column densities derived from CO towards the AGN in our sources. The radial
distributions of molecular gas in the CND of our combined sample show signs of
nuclear-scale molecular gas deficits. We also detect molecular outflows in the
sources that show the most extreme nuclear-scale gas deficits in our sample.
These observations find for the first time supporting evidence that the imprint
of AGN feedback is more extreme in higher luminosity and/or higher Eddington
ratio Seyfert galaxies.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2009.09497",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continual learning from data streams is among the most important topics in
contemporary machine learning. One of the biggest challenges in this domain
lies in creating algorithms that can continuously adapt to arriving data.
However, previously learned knowledge may become outdated, as streams evolve
over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and must be detected to
facilitate efficient adaptation of the learning model. While there exists a
plethora of drift detectors, all of them assume that we are dealing with
roughly balanced classes. In the case of imbalanced data streams, those
detectors will be biased towards the majority classes, ignoring changes
happening in the minority ones. Furthermore, class imbalance may evolve over
time and classes may change their roles (majority becoming minority and vice
versa). This is especially challenging in the multi-class setting, where
relationships among classes become complex. In this paper, we propose a
detailed taxonomy of challenges posed by concept drift in multi-class
imbalanced data streams, as well as a novel trainable concept drift detector
based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine. It is capable of monitoring multiple
classes at once and using reconstruction error to detect changes in each of
them independently. Our detector utilizes a skew-insensitive loss function that
allows it to handle multiple imbalanced distributions. Due to its trainable
nature, it is capable of following changes in a stream and evolving class
roles, as well as it can deal with local concept drift occurring in minority
classes. Extensive experimental study on multi-class drifting data streams,
enriched with a detailed analysis of the impact of local drifts and changing
imbalance ratios, confirms the high efficacy of our approach.

integration of radars into surveillance systems. Metamaterial-based
invisibility cloaking, which was considered a promising solution, did not yet
succeed in delivering reliable performance against real radar systems, mainly
due to its narrow operational bandwidth. Here we propose an approach, which
addresses the issue from a signal-processing standpoint and, as a result, is
capable of coping with the vast majority of unclassified radar systems by
exploiting vulnerabilities in their design. In particular, we demonstrate
complete concealment of a 0.25 square meter moving metal plate from an
investigating radar system, operating in a broad frequency range approaching
20% bandwidth around the carrier of 1.5GHz. The key element of the radar
countermeasure is a temporally modulated coating. This auxiliary structure is
designed to dynamically and controllably adjust the reflected phase of the
impinging radar signal, which acquires a user-defined Doppler shift. A special
case of interest is imposing a frequency shift that compensates for the real
Doppler signatures originating from the motion of the target. In this case the
radar will consider the target static, even though it is moving. As a result,
the reflected echo will be discarded by the clutter removal filter, which is an
inherent part of any modern radar system that is designed to operate in real
conditions. This signal-processing loophole allows rendering the target
invisible to the radar even though it scatters electromagnetic radiation. This
application claims the benefit of patent number 273995, filed on April 16 2020.

one, taking advantage of the representation of such model as a special
reduction of a 2 x 2 matrix NLS system. Specifically, we study in detail the
case in which solutions tend to a non-zero background at space infinities.
First we derive a compact representation for the multi-soliton solutions in the
system using the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). We introduce the notion of
canonical form of a solution, corresponding to the case when the background is
proportional to the identity. We show that solutions for which the asymptotic
behavior at infinity is not proportional to the identity, referred to as being
in non-canonical form, can be reduced to canonical form by unitary
transformations that preserve the symmetric nature of the solution (physically
corresponding to complex rotations of the quantization axes). Then we give a
complete characterization of the two families of one-soliton solutions arising
in this problem, corresponding to ferromagnetic and to polar states of the
system, and we discuss how the physical parameters of the solitons for each
family are related to the spectral data in the IST. We also show that any
ferromagnetic one-soliton solution in canonical form can be reduced to a single
dark soliton of the scalar NLS equation, and any polar one-soliton solution in
canonical form is unitarily equivalent to a pair of oppositely polarized
displaced scalar dark solitons up to a rotation of the quantization axes.
Finally, we discuss two-soliton interactions and we present a complete
classification of the possible scenarios that can arise depending on whether
either soliton is of ferromagnetic or polar type.

lines. To find the most characteristic spectra, we classified the spectra in
each wavelength using the machine learning technique k-means. We found that in
the upflow region the Doppler velocities of the coronal lines are strongly
correlated, but the transition region and coronal lines show no correlation.
However, their fluxes are strongly correlated. The upflow region has lower
density and lower temperature than the AR core. In the upflow region, the
Doppler and non-thermal velocity show a strong correlation in the coronal
lines, but the correlation is not seen in the AR core. At the boundary between
the upflow region and the AR core, the upflow region shows an increase in the
coronal non-thermal velocity, the emission obtained from the DEM, and the
domination of the redshifted regions in the chromosphere. The obtained results
suggest that at least three parallel mechanisms generate the plasma upflow: (1)
the reconnection between closed loops and open magnetic field lines in the
lower corona or upper chromosphere; (2) the reconnection between the

automated data collection from construction projects, the problem of
inter-disciplinary semantic data sharing and exchanges between construction and
robotic domains has attracted construction stakeholders' attention.
Cross-domain data translation requires detailed specifications especially when
it comes to semantic data translation. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
Geographic Information System (GIS) are the two technologies to capture and
store construction data for indoor structure and outdoor environment
respectively. In the absence of a standard format for data exchanges between
the construction and robotic domains, the tools of both industries are yet to
be integrated in a coherent deployment infrastructure. Hence, the semantics of
BIM-GIS cannot be automatically integrated by any robotic platform. To enable
semantic data transfer across domains, semantic web technology has been widely
used in multidisciplinary areas for interoperability. We exploit it to pave the
way to a smarter, quicker and more precise robot navigation on job-sites. This
paper develops a semantic web ontology integrating robot navigation and data
collection to convey the meanings from BIM-GIS to the robot. The proposed
Building Information Robotic System (BIRS) provides construction data that are
semantically transferred to the robotic platform and can be used by the robot
navigation software stack on construction sites. To reach this objective, we
first need to bridge the knowledge representation between construction and
robotic domains. Then, we develop a semantic database to integrate with Robot
Operating System (ROS) which can communicate with the robot and the navigation
system in order to provide the robot with semantic building data at each step
of data collection. Finally, the proposed system is validated through a case
study.

Our aim is to verify the time behavior of the nonextensive braking index $q$

older cluster. As a result, the $q$-index is calculated over time

have revealed the existence of a family of Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) attractors
that is nonlinearly self-sustained by viscoelasticity [Shekar et al., J.Fluid
Mech. 893, A3 (2020)]. Here, we describe the evolution of this branch in
parameter space and its connections to the Newtonian TS attractor and to
elastoinertial turbulence (EIT). At Reynolds number $Re=3000$, there is a
solution branch with TS-wave structure but which is not connected to the
Newtonian solution branch. At fixed Weissenberg number, $Wi$ and increasing
Reynolds number from 3000-10000, this attractor goes from displaying a
striation of weak polymer stretch localized at the critical layer to an
extended sheet of very large polymer stretch. We show that this transition is
directly tied to the strength of the TS critical layer fluctuations and can be
attributed to a coil-stretch transition when the local Weissenberg number at
the hyperbolic stagnation point of the Kelvin cat's eye structure of the TS
wave exceeds $\frac{1}{2}$. At $Re=10000$, unlike $3000$, the Newtonian TS
attractor evolves continuously into the EIT state as $Wi$ is increased from
zero to about $13$. We describe how the structure of the flow and stress fields
changes, highlighting in particular a ""sheet-shedding"" process by which the

causes frustration of expectations and financial waste. Predicting students at
risk is not enough to avoid student dropout. Usually, an appropriate aid action
must be discovered and applied in the proper time for each student. To tackle
this sequential decision-making problem, we propose a decision support method
to the selection of aid actions for students using offline reinforcement
learning to support decision-makers effectively avoid student dropout.
Additionally, a discretization of student's state space applying two different
clustering methods is evaluated. Our experiments using logged data of real
students shows, through off-policy evaluation, that the method should achieve
roughly 1.0 to 1.5 times as much cumulative reward as the logged policy. So, it
is feasible to help decision-makers apply appropriate aid actions and,
possibly, reduce student dropout.

elusiveness of narrow resonances of new physics in direct experimental
searches. Motivated by the latter, we consider the linear dilaton model with a
continuum spectrum of KK modes. It is provided by a critical exponential bulk
potential for the scalar field stabilizing the distance, between the UV
boundary at $y=0$ and a naked (good) singularity at $y=y_s$, in proper
coordinates, which corresponds in conformal coordinates to $z_s\to\infty$. The
cutoff $M_s$ in this theory is an intermediate scale $M_s\simeq 10^{-5}M_{\rm
Pl}$ and the warped factor solves the hierarchy between $M_s$ and the TeV,
while the hierarchy between $M_{\rm Pl}$ and $M_s$ has to be solved by a
(Little) String Theory with coupling $g_s\simeq 10^{-5}$. The Standard Model is
localized on a 4D IR brane. The graviton and radion Green's and spectral
functions have a continuum of states with a TeV mass gap, and isolated poles
consisting on the 4D graviton and the light radion/dilaton. We construct the
effective field theory below the mass gap where the continua of KK modes are
integrated out, generating a set of dimension eight operators which contribute
to low energy electroweak precision observables, and high energy violation of
unitarity in vector boson scattering processes. The radion mass depends on the
stabilizing UV brane potential and its wave function is localized toward the IR
which enhances its coupling with the SM fields.

capabilities of human operators to defend networks. A fundamental problem that
hinders the generalization of successful AI approaches -- i.e., beating humans
at playing games -- is that network defense cannot be defined as a single game
with a fixed set of rules. Our position is that network defense is better
characterized as a collection of games with uncertain and possibly drifting
rules. Hence, we propose to define network defense tasks as distributions of
network environments, to: (i) enable research to apply modern AI techniques,
such as unsupervised curriculum learning and reinforcement learning for network
defense; and, (ii) facilitate the design of well-defined challenges that can be
used to compare approaches for autonomous cyberdefense.
  To demonstrate that an approach for autonomous network defense is practical
it is important to be able to reason about the boundaries of its applicability.
Hence, we need to be able to define network defense tasks that capture sets of
adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); quality of service
(QoS) requirements; and TTPs available to defenders. Furthermore, the
abstractions to define these tasks must be extensible; must be backed by
well-defined semantics that allow us to reason about distributions of
environments; and should enable the generation of data and experiences from
which an agent can learn.
  Our approach named Network Environment Design for Autonomous Cyberdefense
inspired the architecture of FARLAND, a Framework for Advanced Reinforcement
Learning for Autonomous Network Defense, which we use at MITRE to develop RL
network defenders that perform blue actions from the MITRE Shield matrix
against attackers with TTPs that drift from MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.

to manipulate digital assets. Since bugs in smart contracts may lead to
substantial financial losses, there is considerable interest in formally
proving their correctness. However, the specification and verification of smart
contracts faces challenges that do not arise in other application domains.
Smart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial
outside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses
can (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to
manipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely
requires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not
fully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or
expressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and
offering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract
performs.
  In this paper, we present a novel specification methodology tailored to the
domain of smart contracts. Our specification constructs and associated
reasoning technique are the first to enable: (1) sound and precise reasoning in
the presence of unverified code and arbitrary re-entrancy, (2) modular
reasoning about collaborating smart contracts, and (3) domain-specific
specifications based on resources and resource transfers, which allow
expressing a contract's behavior in intuitive and concise ways and exclude
typical errors by default. We have implemented our approach in 2vyper, an
SMT-based automated verification tool for Ethereum smart contracts written in
the Vyper language, and demonstrated its effectiveness in succinctly capturing
and verifying strong correctness guarantees for real-world contracts.

the community of computer vision bringing high impact in real applications. For
instance, SBIR brings an increased benefit to eCommerce search engines because
it allows users to formulate a query just by drawing what they need to buy.
However, current methods showing high precision in retrieval work in a high
dimensional space, which negatively affects aspects like memory consumption and
time processing. Although some authors have also proposed compact
representations, these drastically degrade the performance in a low dimension.
Therefore in this work, we present different results of evaluating methods for
producing compact embeddings in the context of sketch-based image retrieval.
Our main interest is in strategies aiming to keep the local structure of the
original space. The recent unsupervised local-topology preserving dimension
reduction method UMAP fits our requirements and shows outstanding performance,
improving even the precision achieved by SOTA methods. We evaluate six methods
in two different datasets. We use Flickr15K and eCommerce datasets; the latter
is another contribution of this work. We show that UMAP allows us to have
feature vectors of 16 bytes improving precision by more than 35%.

confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts and feasible

scholarly (social) and topical (cognitive) communities -- two facets of
knowledge production studies here that contribute towards the evolution of
knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectory -- associated
with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife
trade. We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive
diversity growth is an indicator of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the
comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around each wicked problem.
Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive
dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses
the stability of knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness
associated with conceptual and solution uncertainty. As such, our results
identify wildlife trade as a wicked problem that may be difficult to address

  Marginal Price",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the context of nonlinear prices, the empirical evidence suggests that the
consumers have cognitive biases represented in a limited understanding of
nonlinear price structures, and they respond to some alternative perceptions of
the marginal prices. In particular, consumers usually make choices based more
on the average than the marginal prices, which can result in a suboptimal
behavior. Taking the misspecification in the marginal price as exogenous, this
document analyzes how is the optimal quadratic price scheme for a monopolist
and the optimal quadratic price scheme that maximizes welfare when there is a
continuum of representative consumers with an arbitrary perception of the
marginal price. Under simple preferences and costs functional forms and very
straightforward hypotheses, the results suggest that the bias in the marginal
price doesn't affect the maximum welfare attainable with quadratic price
schemes, and it has a negligible effect over the efficiency cost caused by the
monopolist, so the misspecification in the marginal price is not relevant for
welfare increasing policies. However, almost always the misspecification in the
marginal price is beneficial for the monopolist. An interesting result is that
under these functional forms, more misspecification in the marginal price is
beneficial for both the consumers and the monopolist if the level of bias is
low, so not always is socially optima to have educated consumers about the real
marginal price. Finally, the document shows that the bias in the marginal price
has a negative effect on reduction of aggregate consumption using two-tier
increasing tariffs, which are commonly used for reduction of aggregate
consumption.

planes simultaneously using a magnetic field generated by a discharge current
through the plasma. A beam size of 5--10 $\mu$m can be achieved within a short
distance using a focusing gradient on the order of 100 T/m. The active plasma
lens is therefore an attractive element for plasma wakefield acceleration,
because an ultra-small size of the witness electron beam is required for
injection into the plasma wakefield to minimize emittance growth and to enhance
the capturing efficiency. When the drive beam and witness electron beam
co-propagate through the active plasma lens, interactions between the drive and
witness beams, and the plasma must be considered. In this paper, through
particle-in-cell simulations, we discuss the possibility of using an active
plasma lens for the final focusing of the electron beam for the AWAKE RUN 2
experiments. It is confirmed that the amplitude of the plasma wakefield excited
by proton bunches remains the same even after propagation through the active
plasma lens. The emittance of the witness electron beam increases rapidly in
the plasma density ramp regions of the lens. Nevertheless, when the witness
electron beam has a charge of 100 pC, emittance of 10 mm mrad, and bunch length
of 60 $\mu$m, its emittance growth is not significant along the active plasma

be strongly dependent on the RMS beam size, plasma density, and multiple

methodological addition of epidemically relevant data from nearby locations as
predictors (features). A novel framework is presented for windowing incidence
data and computing time-shifted correlation-based metrics to quantify feature
relevance. The framework ranks incidence data of adjacent locations around a
target location by combining the correlation metric with two other metrics:
spatial distance and local prevalence. Recurrent neural network-based
prediction models achieve up to 33.6% accuracy improvement on average using the
proposed method compared to using training data from the target location only.
These models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) values as low as 0.128 on [0,1]
normalized incidence data for a municipality with the highest dengue prevalence
in Brazil's Espirito Santo. When predicting cases aggregated over geographical
ecoregions, the models achieved accuracy improvements up to 16.5%, using only
6.5% of incidence data from ranked feature sets. The paper also includes two
techniques for windowing time series data: fixed-sized windows and outbreak
detection windows. Both of these techniques perform comparably, while the
window detection method uses less data for computations. The framework
presented in this paper is application-independent, and it could improve the

have been predicted to occur in three dimensional magnetic nanostructures.
However, the fabrication of such structures is often challenging due to the
specific shapes required, such as magnetic tubes and spirals. Furthermore, the
materials currently used to assemble these structures are predominantly
magnetic metals that do not allow to study the magnetic response of the system
separately from the electronic one. In the field of spintronics, the
prototypical material used for such experiments is the ferrimagnetic insulator
yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG). YIG is one of the best
materials especially for magnonic studies due to its low Gilbert damping. Here,
we report the first successful fabrication of YIG thin films via atomic layer
deposition. To that end we utilize a supercycle approach based on the
combination of sub-nanometer thin layers of the binary systems Fe$_2$O$_3$ and
Y$_2$O$_3$ in the correct atomic ratio on Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ substrates with a
subsequent annealing step. Our process is robust against typical growth-related
deviations, ensuring a good reproducibility. The ALD-YIG thin films exhibit a
good crystalline quality as well as magnetic properties comparable to other
deposition techniques. One of the outstanding characteristics of atomic layer
deposition is its ability to conformally coat arbitrarily-shaped substrates.
ALD hence is the ideal deposition technique to grant an extensive freedom in
choosing the shape of the magnetic system. The atomic layer deposition of YIG
enables the fabrication of novel three dimensional magnetic nanostructures,
which in turn can be utilized for experimentally investigating the phenomena
predicted in those structures.

logic is a promising fit for peripheral IO logic in active matrix displays. In
this paper, we design and implement a ternary 1-3 line decoder and a ternary
2-9 line decoder which are used to program a seven segment LED display. SPICE
simulations are conducted in a 50-nm process, and the decoders are synthesized
on an Altera Cyclone IV field-programmable gate array (FPGA) development board
which implements a ternary memristor model designed in Quartus II. We compare
our hardware results to a binary coded decimal (BCD)-to-seven segment display
decoder, and show our memristor-CMOS approach reduces the total IO power
consumption by a factor of approximately 6 times at a maximum synthesizable
frequency of 293.77MHz. Although the speed is approximately half of the native
built-in BCD-to-seven decoder, the comparatively slow refresh rates of typical
microdisplays indicate this to be a tolerable trade-off, which promotes data
density over speed.

demonstrate how unsupervised learning is possible in the absence of a direct

also propose several metrics to measure the geometric fitness of two 3D faces

results reveal that two important feature classes (ela_level and ela_meta)

dimensionality reduction framework that computes features in a reduced

classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is

can at the same time align their direction of movement and synchronize their

We present an experimental investigation of the collective motion of the
nematode Turbatrix aceti that self-propel by body undulation. We discover that
these nematodes can synchronize their body oscillations, forming striking
traveling metachronal waves, which produces strong fluid flows. We uncover that
the location and strength of this collective state can be controlled through
the shape of the confining structure; in our case the contact angle of a
droplet. This opens a way for producing controlled work such as on-demand flows
or displacement of objects. We illustrate this by showing that the force
generated by this state is sufficient to change the physics of evaporation of
fluid droplets, by counteracting the surface-tension force, which allow us to
estimate its strength. The relatively large size and ease of culture make
Turbatrix aceti a promising model organism for experimental investigation of
swarming and oscillating active matter capable of producing controllable work.

mimics user behaviors of asking for unstated information. The generated CQs can
serve as a sanity check or proofreading to help e-commerce merchant to identify
potential missing information before advertising their product, and improve

calibration of two-component two-dimensional (2C-2D) particle image velocimetry
(PIV) and three-component two-dimensional (3C-2D) stereoscopic PIV (SPIV)
systems. These techniques generally involve the use of a calibration target
that is assumed to be at the exact centre of the laser sheet within the field
of view (FOV), which in practice is very difficult to achieve. In 3C-2D SPIV,
several methods offer different correction schemes based on the computation of
a disparity map, which are aimed at correcting errors produced due to this
misalignment. These techniques adjust the calibration of individual cameras to
reduce the disparity error, but in doing so can create unintended errors in the
measurement position and/or the velocity measurements, such as introducing a
bias in the measured three-component (3-C) displacements. This paper introduces
a novel method to ensure accurate alignment of the laser sheet with the
calibration target so that the uncertainty in displacement measurements is less
than or equal to the uncertainty inherent to the PIV and hence, no correction
scheme is required. The proposed method has been validated with a simple
experiment in which true displacements are given to a particle container
(illuminated by an aligned laser sheet) and the measured 3C displacements are
compared with the given true displacements. An uncertainty of less than 7.6
micrometres (equivalent to 0.114 pixels) in the measured 3C displacements
demonstrates the effectiveness of the new alignment method and eliminates the
need for any ad hoc post-correction scheme.

the traditional image warping task, specifically when the input is enlarged, as
a spatially-varying SR problem. We also propose several novel formulations,
including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct
visually favorable results in the transformation process. Compared with
previous methods, we do not constrain the SR model on a regular grid but allow
numerous possible deformations for flexible and diverse image editing.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies justify the necessity and

self-interaction correction (SIC). The dianionic Cu-based molecule was proposed
to be a promising qubit candidate. Self-interaction error within approximate
DFT functionals renders severe delocalization of electron and spin densities
arising from 3$d$ orbitals. The FLO-SIC method relies on optimization of
Fermi-L\""owdin orbital descriptors (FODs) with which localized occupied
orbitals are constructed to create the SIC potentials. Starting with many
initial sets of FODs, we employ a frozen-density loop algorithm within the
FLO-SIC method to study the Cu-based molecule. We find that the electronic
structure of the molecule remains unchanged despite somewhat different final
FOD configurations. In the dianionic state (spin $S=1/2$), FLO-SIC spin density
originates from the Cu $d$ and S $p$ orbitals with an approximate ratio of 2:1,
in quantitative agreement with multireference calculations, while in the case
of SIC-free DFT, the orbital ratio is reversed. Overall, FLO-SIC lowers the
energies of the occupied orbitals and in particular the 3$d$ orbitals
unhybridized with the ligands significantly, which substantially increases the
energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) compared to SIC-free DFT results. The
FLO-SIC HOMO-LUMO gap of the dianionic state is larger than that of the
monoionic state, which is consistent with experiment. Our results suggest a
positive outlook of the FLO-SIC method in the description of magnetic exchange

enables an accurate alignment benefiting from the strong inference ability of
the state-of-the-art attention-based encoder-decoder models, which cannot be

essentially continuously in time. Such data units are best described as taking
values in a space of functions. Subject units carrying the observations may
have intrinsic relations among themselves, and are best described by the nodes
of a large graph. It is often sensible to think that the underlying signals in
these functional observations vary smoothly over the graph, in that neighboring
nodes have similar underlying signals. This qualitative information allows
borrowing of strength over neighboring nodes and consequently leads to more
accurate inference. In this paper, we consider a model with Gaussian functional
observations and adopt a Bayesian approach to smoothing over the nodes of the
graph. We characterize the minimax rate of estimation in terms of the
regularity of the signals and their variation across nodes quantified in terms
of the graph Laplacian. We show that an appropriate prior constructed from the
graph Laplacian can attain the minimax bound, while using a mixture prior, the
minimax rate up to a logarithmic factor can be attained simultaneously for all
possible values of functional and graphical smoothness. We also show that in
the fixed smoothness setting, an optimal sized credible region has arbitrarily
high frequentist coverage. A simulation experiment demonstrates that the method
performs better than potential competing methods like the random forest. The
method is also applied to a dataset on daily temperatures measured at several

complexity of sequence classification tasks, using a novel extension of the
theory of Boolean function sensitivity. The sensitivity of a function, given a
distribution over input sequences, quantifies the number of disjoint subsets of
the input sequence that can each be individually changed to change the output.
We argue that standard sequence classification methods are biased towards
learning low-sensitivity functions, so that tasks requiring high sensitivity
are more difficult. To that end, we show analytically that simple lexical
classifiers can only express functions of bounded sensitivity, and we show
empirically that low-sensitivity functions are easier to learn for LSTMs. We
then estimate sensitivity on 15 NLP tasks, finding that sensitivity is higher
on challenging tasks collected in GLUE than on simple text classification
tasks, and that sensitivity predicts the performance both of simple lexical
classifiers and of vanilla BiLSTMs without pretrained contextualized
embeddings. Within a task, sensitivity predicts which inputs are hard for such
simple models. Our results suggest that the success of massively pretrained
contextual representations stems in part because they provide representations
from which information can be extracted by low-sensitivity decoders.

regularization works surprisingly well in practice, its theoretical convergence
-- whether convergence of the PnP iterates is guaranteed and if they minimize
some objective function -- is not completely understood even for simple linear
denoisers such as nonlocal means. In particular, while there are works where
either iterate or objective convergence is established separately, a
simultaneous guarantee on iterate and objective convergence is not available

convergence for a special class of linear denoisers. Notably, unlike existing
works where the focus is on symmetric denoisers, our analysis covers
non-symmetric denoisers such as nonlocal means and almost any convex

galaxies. To understand what determines the structure and star formation rate
(SFR; $\dot{M}_{\rm SF}$) of nuclear rings, we run semi-global, hydrodynamic
simulations of nuclear rings subject to constant mass inflow rates
$\dot{M}_{\rm in}$. We adopt the TIGRESS framework of Kim \& Ostriker to handle
radiative heating and cooling, star formation, and related supernova (SN)
feedback. We find that the SN feedback is never strong enough to destroy the
ring or quench star formation everywhere in the ring. Under the constant
$\dot{M}_{\rm in}$, the ring star formation is very steady and persistent, with
the SFR exhibiting only mild temporal fluctuations. The ring SFR is tightly
correlated with the inflow rate as $\dot{M}_{\rm SF}\approx 0.8\dot{M}_{\rm
in}$, for a range of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}=0.125-8\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Within
the ring, vertical dynamical equilibrium is maintained, with the midplane
pressure (powered by SN feedback) balancing the weight of the overlying gas.
The SFR surface density is correlated nearly linearly with the midplane
pressure, as predicted by the pressure-regulated, feedback-modulated star
formation theory. Based on our results, we argue that the ring SFR is causally
controlled by $\dot{M}_\text{in}$, while the ring gas mass adapts to the SFR to
maintain the vertical dynamical equilibrium under the gravitational field

energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely
activated DNNs can consume <1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without
sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic
location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free
energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the
same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are
trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can
be ~1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented
accelerators inside them can be ~2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf
systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce
the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X. These large factors also make
retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we
believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy
consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more
transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce

has been widely explored. However, reasoning over Temporal KG (TKG) that
predicts facts in the future is still far from resolved. The key to predict
future facts is to thoroughly understand the historical facts. A TKG is
actually a sequence of KGs corresponding to different timestamps, where all
concurrent facts in each KG exhibit structural dependencies and temporally
adjacent facts carry informative sequential patterns. To capture these
properties effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel Recurrent Evolution
network based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN), called RE-GCN, which learns
the evolutional representations of entities and relations at each timestamp by
modeling the KG sequence recurrently. Specifically, for the evolution unit, a
relation-aware GCN is leveraged to capture the structural dependencies within
the KG at each timestamp. In order to capture the sequential patterns of all
facts in parallel, the historical KG sequence is modeled auto-regressively by
the gate recurrent components. Moreover, the static properties of entities such
as entity types, are also incorporated via a static graph constraint component
to obtain better entity representations. Fact prediction at future timestamps
can then be realized based on the evolutional entity and relation
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RE-GCN model
obtains substantial performance and efficiency improvement for the temporal
reasoning tasks on six benchmark datasets. Especially, it achieves up to
11.46\% improvement in MRR for entity prediction with up to 82 times speedup

the Universe is accelerating. In the standard model of cosmology, this
accelerated expansion is attributed to a dark energy in the form of a
cosmological constant. It is conceivable, however, for the dark energy to
exhibit mild dynamics (so that its energy density changes with time rather than
having a constant value), or for the accelerated expansion of the Universe to
be caused by some mechanism other than dark energy. In this work I will
investigate both of these possibilities by using observational data to place
constraints on the parameters of simple models of dynamical dark energy as well
as cosmological models without dark energy. I find that these data favor the
standard model while leaving some room for dynamical dark energy.
  The standard model also holds that the Universe is flat on large spatial
scales. The same observational data used to test dark energy dynamics can be
used to constrain the large-scale curvature of the Universe, and these data

not suitable for large-scale applications. In this paper, we revisit the use of
documents as semantic representations. We argue that documents like Wikipedia
pages contain rich visual information, which however can easily be buried by
the vast amount of non-visual sentences. To address this issue, we propose a
semi-automatic mechanism for visual sentence extraction that leverages the
document section headers and the clustering structure of visual sentences. The
extracted visual sentences, after a novel weighting scheme to distinguish
similar classes, essentially form semantic representations like visual
attributes but need much less human effort. On the ImageNet dataset with over
10,000 unseen classes, our representations lead to a 64% relative improvement

cause multiple test case failures, making it difficult to allocate resources
for debugging and to use automated debugging techniques. Clustering algorithms
have been applied to group the test failures according to their root causes,
but their accuracy can often be lacking due to the inherent limits in the
distance metrics for test cases. We introduce a new test distance metric based
on hypergraphs and evaluate their accuracy using multi-fault benchmarks that we
have built on top of Defects4J and SIR. Results show that our technique,
Hybiscus, can automatically achieve perfect clustering (i.e., the same number
of clusters as the ground truth number of root causes, with all failing tests
with the same root cause grouped together) for 418 out of 605 test runs with

incredible robustness of the quantized Hall conductivity to disorder. That
robustness arises from the fact that in the topological band gap, transport can
occur only along the edges modes, which are immune to scattering. However, for
sufficiently strong disorder, the band gap closes and the system becomes
topologically trivial as all states become localized, such that all transport
vanishes -- in accordance with Anderson localization. It therefore came as a
surprise when it was suggested that, for a two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall
topological system, the opposite could occur. In so-called topological Anderson
insulators, the emergence of protected edge states and quantized transport is
caused by the introduction of disorder. However, to date, the observation of
the topological Anderson insulator phase has been elusive. In this article, we
report the first experimental demonstration of a topological Anderson
insulator. We do that in a photonic implementation: an array of helical,
evanescently-coupled waveguides in a detuned honeycomb geometry. Under proper
conditions, adding on-site disorder, in the form of random variations in the
refractive index contrast defining the waveguides, drives the system from a
trivial phase into a topological state.

normal estimation has once again become a concern. By introducing the neural
networks to classic methods based on problem-specific knowledge, the
adaptability of the normal estimation algorithm to noise and scale has been
greatly improved. However, the compatibility between neural networks and the
traditional methods has not been considered. Similar to the principle of
Occam's razor, that is, the simpler is better. We observe that a more
simplified process of surface fitting can significantly improve the accuracy of
the normal estimation. In this paper, two simple-yet-effective strategies are
proposed to address the compatibility between the neural networks and surface
fitting process to improve normal estimation. Firstly, a dynamic top-k
selection strategy is introduced to better focus on the most critical points of
a given patch, and the points selected by our learning method tend to fit a
surface by way of a simple tangent plane, which can dramatically improve the
normal estimation results of patches with sharp corners or complex patterns.
Then, we propose a point update strategy before local surface fitting, which
smooths the sharp boundary of the patch to simplify the surface fitting
process, significantly reducing the fitting distortion and improving the
accuracy of the predicted point normal. The experiments analyze the
effectiveness of our proposed strategies and demonstrate that our method
achieves SOTA results with the advantage of higher estimation accuracy over
most existed approaches.

luminosity in both optical and X-ray bands during the outburst periods. We
present extensive photometry in X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical bands, as well
as densely-cadenced optical spectra, covering the phase from the beginning of
optical outburst to $\sim$550 days. During the rebrightening process, the
optical emission preceded the X-ray by 20.80 $\pm$ 2.85 days. The spectra are
characterized by blue continua and emission features of Balmer series, He I, He
II lines and broad Bowen blend. The pseudo equivalent width (pEW) of emission
lines are found to show anticorrelations with the X-ray flux measured at
comparable phases, which is due to the increased suppression by the optical
continuum. At around the X-ray peak, the full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of
H$_{\beta}$ and He II $\lambda$4686 tend to stabilize at 19.4 Angstrom and 21.8
Angstrom, which corresponds to the line forming region at a radius of 1.7 and
1.3 R_sun within the disk. We further analyzed the absolute fluxes of the lines
and found that the fluxes of H$_{\beta}$ and He II $\lambda$4686 show positive
correlations with the X-ray flux, favoring that the irradiation model is
responsible for the optical emission. However, the fact that X-ray emission
experiences a dramatic flux drop at t$\sim$200 days after the outburst, while
the optical flux only shows little variations suggests that additional energy
such as viscous energy may contribute to the optical radiation in addition to
the X-ray irradiation.

the pair-wise Heisenberg exchange in transition-metal trilayers based on
density functional theory calculations. We show that these terms can play an
important role in magnetic trilayers composed of a single hexagonal Fe or Co
atomic layer sandwiched between $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal layers. We study
the dependence of the biquadratic and the three-site and four-site four spin
interaction on the band filling of the $4d$ and $5d$ layers as well as the
stacking sequence, i.e. fcc vs. hcp stacking. Our calculations reveal
relatively small higher-order interactions for Co based trilayers. For Fe based
trilayers with a Rh or Ir layer the higher-order terms can be on the same order
of magnitude as pair-wise Heisenberg exchange. The trends obtained for
freestanding trilayers are used to understand the higher-order interactions in
ultrathin film systems on surfaces that are experimentally accessible. It is
shown that hcp Rh/Fe/Ir(111) and hcp-Rh/Fe/Rh(111) exhibit the largest values
for the biquadratic and the three-site four spin interaction of all systems
under study. We further demonstrate that the three-site four spin interaction
is responsible for the experimentally observed change of the magnetic ground
state of Rh/Fe/Ir(111) from a spin spiral (single-Q) for fcc-Rh to a 2Q state
for hcp-Rh. We find similar trends for Rh/Fe/Rh(111), i.e. replacing the Ir
surface by the isoelectronic Rh surface. For Rh/Co/Ir(111), we obtain a
negative value for the four-site four spin interaction which will lead to a
reduced stability of magnetic skyrmions which are metastable in this film at
zero magnetic field. In contrast, for Pd/Fe/Ir(111), the four-site four spin
interaction is positive which leads to an enhanced stability of skyrmions.

challenging. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can
improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be
compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on
sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Previous formal models
for authorization do not fully address the security implications of permitting
trust relationships to change, which limits their ability to reason about
authority that derives from dynamic computation. Our goal is an approach to
constructing dynamic authorization mechanisms that do not violate

  The Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC) is a simple, expressive model
for reasoning about dynamic authorization as well as an information flow
control language for securely implementing various authorization mechanisms.
FLAC combines the insights of two previous models: it extends the Dependency
Core Calculus with features made possible by the Flow-Limited Authorization
Model. FLAC provides strong end-to-end information security guarantees even for
programs that incorporate and implement rich dynamic authorization mechanisms.
These guarantees include noninterference and robust declassification, which
prevent attackers from influencing information disclosures in unauthorized
ways. We prove these security properties formally for all FLAC programs and

and practical applications, is attracting increasing attention in recent years.
In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to construct arbitrary
synthetic dimensions, or N-boson synthetic lattices, using multiple bosons on
one-dimensional lattices. We show that a one-dimensional lattice hosting N
indistinguishable bosons can be mapped to a single boson on a N-dimensional
lattice with high symmetry. Band structure analyses on this N-dimensional
lattice can then be mathematically performed to predict the existence of exotic
eigenstates and the motion of N-boson wavepackets. As illustrative examples, we
demonstrate the edge states in two-boson Su-Schrieffer-Heeger synthetic
lattices without interactions, interface states in two-boson
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger synthetic lattices with interactions, and weakly-bound
triplon states in three-boson tight-binding synthetic lattices with
interactions. The interface states and weakly-bound triplon states have not
been thoroughly understood in previous literatures. Our proposed theoretical
framework hence provides a novel perspective to explore the multi-boson
dynamics on lattices with boson-boson interactions, and opens up a future
avenue in the fields of multi-boson manipulation in quantum engineering.

extensive training data samples, while still achieving the overarching goal of
DRL, i.e to guide a battery-limited UAV on an efficient data harvesting

limited knowledge of wireless node locations. The key idea consists in using a
small subset of nodes as anchors (i.e. with known location) and learning a
model of the propagation environment while implicitly estimating the positions
of regular nodes. Interaction with the model allows us to train a deep
Q-network (DQN) to approximate the optimal UAV control policy. We show that in

fashion. Consensus algorithms have attracted much research attention in recent
years due to their simple execution, robustness to topology changes, and
distributed philosophy. These algorithms are extensively utilized for
synchronization, resource allocation, and security in IoT networks. Performance
of the distributed consensus algorithms can be effectively quantified by the
Convergence Time, Network Coherence, Maximum Communication Time-Delay. In this
work, we model the IoT network as a q-triangular r-regular ring network as
q-triangular topologies exhibit both small-world and scale-free features.
Scale-free and small-world topologies widely applied for modelling IoT as these
topologies are effectively resilient to random attacks. In this paper, we
derive explicit expressions for all eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix for

campaigns collected via two different methods for document-level evaluation.
Our analysis shows that a document-centric approach to evaluation where the
annotator is presented with the entire document context on a screen leads to
higher quality segment and document level assessments. It improves the
correlation between segment and document scores and increases inter-annotator
agreement for document scores but is considerably more time consuming for
annotators.

materials, which often exhibit very good metallic conductivity and are thus of
great interest for applications in, e.g., flexible electronics,
electrocatalysis, and electromagnetic interference shielding. However,
surprisingly little is known about the fermiology of MXenes, i.e, the shape and
size of their Fermi-surfaces, and its effect on the material properties. One
reason for this may be that MXene surfaces are almost always covered by a
mixture of functional groups, and studying Fermi-surfaces of disordered systems
is cumbersome. Here, we study fermiology of four common Ti-based MXenes as a
function of the surface functional group composition. We first calculate the
effective band structures of systems with explicit mixed surfaces and observe
gradual evolution in the filling of the Ti-d band and resulting shift of
Fermi-level. We then demonstrate that these band structures can be closely
approximated by using pseudohydrogenated surfaces, and also compare favorably
to the experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. By
modifying the pseudohydrogen charge we then proceed to plot Fermi-surfaces for
all systems and extract their properties, such as the Fermi-surface area and
average Fermi-velocity. These are in turn used to evaluate the electrical
conductivity with the relaxation time fitted to experimentally measured
conductivities.

renewable electricity generation from sources such as photovoltaics (PV) and
wind as well as load demands has recently gained attention. Normalizing flow
density models are particularly well suited for this task due to the training
through direct log-likelihood maximization. However, research from the field of
image generation has shown that standard normalizing flows can only learn
smeared-out versions of manifold distributions. Previous works on normalizing
flow-based scenario generation do not address this issue, and the smeared-out
distributions result in the sampling of noisy time series. In this paper, we
exploit the isometry of the principal component analysis (PCA), which sets up
the normalizing flow in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining the direct
and computationally efficient likelihood maximization. We train the resulting
principal component flow (PCF) on data of PV and wind power generation as well
as load demand in Germany in the years 2013 to 2015. The results of this
investigation show that the PCF preserves critical features of the original
distributions, such as the probability density and frequency behavior of the
time series. The application of the PCF is, however, not limited to renewable
power generation but rather extends to any data set, time series, or otherwise,
which can be efficiently reduced using PCA.

involves monomer belonging to about 2-3 chains. Clusters with monomers

performance in human pose estimation, these networks often have a large number
of parameters and computations, leading to the slow inference speed. For this
issue, an effective solution is knowledge distillation, which transfers
knowledge from a large pre-trained network (teacher) to a small network
(student). However, there are some defects in the existing approaches: (I) Only
a single teacher is adopted, neglecting the potential that a student can learn
from multiple teachers. (II) The human segmentation mask can be regarded as
additional prior information to restrict the location of keypoints, which is
never utilized. (III) A student with a small number of parameters cannot fully
imitate heatmaps provided by datasets and teachers. (IV) There exists noise in
heatmaps generated by teachers, which causes model degradation. To overcome
these defects, we propose an orderly dual-teacher knowledge distillation (ODKD)
framework, which consists of two teachers with different capabilities.
Specifically, the weaker one (primary teacher, PT) is used to teach keypoints
information, the stronger one (senior teacher, ST) is utilized to transfer
segmentation and keypoints information by adding the human segmentation mask.
Taking dual-teacher together, an orderly learning strategy is proposed to
promote knowledge absorbability. Moreover, we employ a binarization operation
which further improves the learning ability of the student and reduces noise in
heatmaps. Experimental results on COCO and OCHuman keypoints datasets show that
our proposed ODKD can improve the performance of different lightweight models
by a large margin, and HRNet-W16 equipped with ODKD achieves state-of-the-art
performance for lightweight human pose estimation.

enhancing the probability of successfully detecting an object. Three combining
rules are considered, namely the \textit{OR}, the \textit{Majority} and the
\textit{AND} rule. In real-world network scenarios, the locations of the BSs
are spatially correlated, exhibiting a repulsive behavior. Therefore, we model
the spatial distribution of the BSs as a $\beta$-Ginibre point process
($\beta$-GPP), which can characterize the repulsion among the BSs. By using
stochastic geometry tools, analytical expressions for the detection performance
of $\beta$-GPP-based FD-JCAS systems are expressed for each of the considered
combining rule. Furthermore, by considering temporal interference correlation,
we evaluate the probability of successfully detecting an object over two
different time slots. Our results demonstrate that our proposed technique can
significantly improve the detection performance when compared to the

poured attention to link prediction to fill in missing facts for a long time.
However, they mainly focus on link prediction on binary relational data, where
facts are usually represented as triples in the form of (head entity, relation,
tail entity). In practice, n-ary relational facts are also ubiquitous. When
encountering such facts, existing studies usually decompose them into triples
by introducing a multitude of auxiliary virtual entities and additional
triples. These conversions result in the complexity of carrying out link
prediction on n-ary relational data. It has even proven that they may cause
loss of structure information. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we
represent each n-ary relational fact as a set of its role and role-value pairs.
We then propose a method called NaLP to conduct link prediction on n-ary

outside the setting of regular images, we are often confronted with a different
situation. In computational pathology, digitised tissue sections are extremely
large images, whose dimensions quickly exceed 250'000x250'000 pixels, where
relevant objects, such as tumour cells or lymphocytes can quickly number in the
millions. Annotating them all is practically impossible and annotating sparsely
a few, out of many more, is the only possibility. Unfortunately, learning from
sparse annotations, or sparse-shot learning, clashes with standard supervised
learning because what is not annotated is treated as a negative. However,
assigning negative labels to what are true positives leads to confusion in the
gradients and biased learning. To this end, we present exclusive cross-entropy,
which slows down the biased learning by examining the second-order loss
derivatives in order to drop the loss terms corresponding to likely biased
terms. Experiments on nine datasets and two different localisation tasks,

on the principle ""\emph{replicate a job as soon as the system detects it as a
\emph{straggler}}"". This is called job \emph{speculation}. Recent works have
analyzed {replication} on arrival, which we refer to as \emph{replication}.
Replication is motivated by its implementation in Google's BigTable. However,
systems such as Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce implement speculative job
execution. The performance and optimization of speculative job execution is not
well understood. To this end, we propose a queueing network model for load
balancing where each server can speculate on the execution time of a job.
Specifically, each job is initially assigned to a single server by a frontend
dispatcher. Then, when its execution begins, the server sets a timeout. If the
job completes before the timeout, it leaves the network, otherwise the job is
terminated and relaunched or resumed at another server where it will complete.
We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of
speculative queueing networks with heterogeneous servers, general job sizes and
scheduling disciplines. We find that speculation can increase the stability
region of the network when compared with standard load balancing models and
replication schemes. We provide general conditions under which timeouts
increase the size of the stability region and derive a formula for the optimal
speculation time, i.e., the timeout that minimizes the load induced through
speculation. We compare speculation with redundant-$d$ and
redundant-to-idle-queue-$d$ rules under an $S\& X$ model. For light loaded
systems, redundancy schemes provide better response times. However, for
moderate to heavy loadings, redundancy schemes can lose capacity and have
markedly worse response times when compared with a speculative scheme.

environmental change from the viewpoint of the phylogenies of the living
individuals. We aim to understand better how the past traits of their ancestors
are shaped by the adaptation to the varying environment. The individuals are
characterized by a one-dimensional trait. The dynamics -- births and deaths --
depend on a time-changing mortality rate that shifts the optimal trait to the
right at constant speed. The population size is regulated by a nonlinear
non-local logistic competition term. The macroscopic behaviour can be described
by a PDE that admits a unique positive stationary solution. In the stationary
regime, the population can persist, but with a lag in the trait distribution
due to the environmental change. For the microscopic (individual-based)
stochastic process, the evolution of the lineages can be traced back using the
historical process, that is, a measure-valued process on the set of continuous
real functions of time. Assuming stationarity of the trait distribution, we
describe the limiting distribution, in large populations, of the path of an
individual drawn at random at a given time $T$. Freezing the non-linearity due
to competition allows the use of a many-to-one identity together with
Feynman-Kac's formula. This path, in reversed time, remains close to a simple
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It shows how the lagged bulk of the present
population stems from ancestors once optimal in trait but still in the tail of
the trait distribution in which they lived.

velocity dispersion as a function of metallicity, we clearly see that the NSD
is kinematically cool and that the velocity dispersion decreases with
increasing metallicity contrary to the inner Bulge sample of APOGEE ($\rm |b| <
4^{o}$). Using molecular gas tracers ($\rm H_{2}CO$, CO(4-3)) of the Central
Molecular Zone (CMZ) we find an astonishing agreement between the gas rotation

unusual symmetries and are relevant for low-energy switching technologies.
However, owing to the light weight of oxygen atoms and localized effects of
their vacancies, the atomic-scale electrical and mechanical influence of oxygen
vacancies has remained elusive. Here, stable individual oxygen vacancies were
found and engineered in situ at domain walls of seminal titanate perovskite
ferroics. The atomic-scale strain, electric-field, charge and dipole-moment
distribution around these vacancies were characterized by combining advanced
transmission electron microscopy and first-principle methodologies. 3-5 %
tensile strain was observed at the immediate surrounding unit cells of the
vacancies. The dipole-moment distribution around the vacancy was found to be an
alternating head-to-head $-$ tail-to-tail $-$ head-to-head structure, giving
rise to a quasi-linear quadrupole topology. Reduction of the nearby Ti ion as
well as enhanced charging and electric-field concentration near the vacancy
confirmed the quadrupole structure and illustrated its local effects on the
electrical and structural properties. Significant intra-band states were found
in the unit cell of the vacancies, proposing a meaningful domain-wall
conductivity. Oxygen-vacancy engineering and controllable quadrupoles that
enable pre-determining both atomic-scale and global functional properties offer

graph classes with interesting algorithmic properties. Most notably, every
problem definable in first-order logic can be solved in linear time on bounded
expansion graph classes. First-order interpretations and transductions of
sparse graph classes lead to more general, dense graph classes that seem to
inherit many of the nice algorithmic properties of their sparse counterparts.
In this paper, we show that one can encode graphs from a class with
structurally bounded expansion via lacon-, shrub- and parity-decompositions
from a class with bounded expansion. These decompositions are useful for
lifting properties from sparse to structurally sparse graph classes.

studies. Recently, unsupervised registration models have shown good
performance, but they often require a large-scale training dataset and long
training times. Therefore, in real world application where only dozens to
hundreds of image pairs are available, existing models cannot be practically
used. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised
registration model which is integrated with a gradient-based meta learning
framework. In particular, we train a meta learner which finds an initialization
point of parameters by utilizing a variety of existing registration datasets.
To quickly adapt to various tasks, the meta learner was updated to get close to
the center of parameters which are fine-tuned for each registration task.
Thereby, our model can adapt to unseen domain tasks via a short fine-tuning
process and perform accurate registration. To verify the superiority of our
model, we train the model for various 2D medical image registration tasks such
as retinal choroid Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), CT organs,
and brain MRI scans and test on registration of retinal OCTA Superficial
Capillary Plexus (SCP). In our experiments, the proposed model obtained
significantly improved performance in terms of accuracy and training time
compared to other registration models.

over-shining for a few seconds all other $\gamma$-ray sky sources. Their
emission is produced within narrowly collimated relativistic jets launched
after the core-collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact binaries.
THESEUS will open a new window for the use of GRBs as cosmological tools by
securing a statistically significant sample of high-$z$ GRBs, as well as by
providing a large number of GRBs at low-intermediate redshifts extending the
current samples to low luminosities. The wide energy band and unprecedented
sensitivity of the Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) and X-Gamma rays Imaging
Spectrometer (XGIS) instruments provide us a new route to unveil the nature of
the prompt emission. For the first time, a full characterisation of the prompt
emission spectrum from 0.3 keV to 10 MeV with unprecedented large count
statistics will be possible revealing the signatures of synchrotron emission.
SXI spectra, extending down to 0.3 keV, will constrain the local metal
absorption and, for the brightest events, the progenitors' ejecta composition.
Investigation of the nature of the internal energy dissipation mechanisms will
be obtained through the systematic study with XGIS of the sub-second
variability unexplored so far over such a wide energy range. THESEUS will
follow the spectral evolution of the prompt emission down to the soft X-ray
band during the early steep decay and through the plateau phase with the unique
ability of extending above 10 keV the spectral study of these early afterglow

design of neural network architectures. Differentiable neural architecture
search (DARTS) is a promising NAS approach that dramatically increases search

where the search often leads to detrimental architectures. Many recent works
try to address this issue of DARTS by identifying indicators for early
stopping, regularising the search objective to reduce the dominance of some
operations, or changing the parameterisation of the search problem. In this
work, we hypothesise that performance collapses can arise from poor local
optima around typical initial architectures and weights. We address this issue
by developing a more global optimisation scheme that is able to better explore
the space without changing the DARTS problem formulation. Our experiments show
that our changes in the search algorithm allow the discovery of architectures
with both better test performance and fewer parameters.

we demonstrate that the selected sentence reflects the style of reports
concisely identifying to whom, when, where, and what happened. We propose that
such a summary is beneficial in combination with the first sentence of an

Hot subdwarfs experienced strong mass loss on the Red Giant Branch
(RGB) and are now hot and small He-burning objects. Aims. In this project we
aim to perform a transit survey in all available light curves of hot subdwarfs
from space-based telescopes (Kepler, K2, TESS, and CHEOPS), with our
custom-made pipeline SHERLOCK, in order to determine the occurrence rate of
planets around these stars, as a function of orbital period and planetary
radius. Methods. In this first paper, we perform injection-and-recovery tests
of synthetic transits for a selection of representative Kepler, K2 and TESS
light curves, to determine which transiting bodies, in terms of object radius
and orbital period, we will be able to detect with our tools. We also provide
such estimates for CHEOPS data, which we analyze with the pycheops package.
Results. Transiting objects with a radius $\lesssim$ 1.0 $R_{\Earth}$ can be
detected in most of Kepler, K2 and CHEOPS targets for the shortest orbital
periods (1 d and below), reaching values as small as $\sim$0.3 $R_{\Earth}$ in
the best cases. Reaching sub-Earth-sized bodies is achieved only for the
brightest TESS targets, and the ones observed during a significant number of
sectors. We also give a series of representative results for farther and bigger
planets, for which the performances strongly depend on the target magnitude,
the length and the quality of the data. Conclusions. The TESS sample will
provide the most important statistics for the global aim of measuring the
planet occurrence rate around hot subdwarfs. The Kepler, K2 and CHEOPS data
will allow us to search for planetary remnants, i.e. very close and small
(possibly disintegrating) objects, which would have partly survived the
engulfment in their red giant host.

The nitrogen reservoir in planetary systems is a long standing
problem. Part of the N-bearing molecules is probably incorporated into the ice
bulk during the cold phases of the stellar evolution, and may be gradually
released into the gas phase when the ice is heated, such as in active comets.
The chemical nature of the N-reservoir should greatly influence how, when and
in what form N returns to the gas phase, or is incorporated into the refractory
material forming planetary bodies.
  Aims. We present the study the thermal desorption of two ammonium salts:
ammonium formate and ammonium acetate from a gold surface and from a water ice
substrate.
  Methods. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments and Fourier transform
infrared reflection spectroscopy were conducted to investigate the desorption
behavior of ammonium salts.
  Results. Ammonium salts are semi-volatile species releasing neutral species
as major components upon desorption, that is ammonia and the corresponding
organic acid (HCOOH and CH3COOH), at temperatures higher than the temperature
of thermal desorption of water ice. Their desorption follows a first-order
Wigner-Polanyi law. We find the first order kinetic parameters A = 7.7 $\pm$
0.6 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ s$^{-1}$ and E$_{bind}$ = 68.9 $\pm$ 0.1 kJ~mol$^{-1}$
for ammonium formate and A = 3.0 $\pm$ 0.4 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ s$^{-1}$ and
E$_{bind}$ = 83.0 $\pm$ 0.2 kJ~mol$^{-1}$ for ammonium acetate. The presence of
a water ice substrate does not influence the desorption kinetics. Ammonia
molecules locked in salts desorb as neutral molecules at temperatures much
higher than previously expected that are usually attributed to refractory
materials.
  Conclusions. Ammonia snow-line has a smaller radius than the water snow-line.
As a result, the NH3/H2O ratio content in solar system bodies can be a hint as
to where they formed and subsequently migrated.

applications. Fuzz testing is one of the effective techniques to detect
vulnerabilities in general. Greybox fuzzers such as AFL automatically generate
a sequence of test inputs for a given program using a fitness-guided search
process. A recently proposed approach in the literature introduced a
buffer-overrun specific fitness metric called ""headroom"", which tracks how
close each generated test input comes to exposing the vulnerabilities. That
approach showed good initial promise, but is somewhat imprecise and expensive
due to its reliance on conservative points-to analysis. Inspired by the
approach above, in this paper we propose a new ground-up approach for detecting
buffer-overrun vulnerabilities. This approach uses an extended version of ASAN
(Address Sanitizer) that runs in parallel with the fuzzer, and reports back to
the fuzzer test inputs that happen to come closer to exposing buffer-overrun
vulnerabilities. The ASAN-style instrumentation is precise as it has no
dependence on points-to analysis. We describe in this paper our approach, as
well as an implementation and evaluation of the approach.

I$ and time-reversal $\cal T$ symmetries, are fundamental in understanding and
characterizing magneto-electric materials. However, the detection of these
magneto-electric multipoles is often not straightforward as they remain
""hidden"" in conventional experiments in part since many magneto-electrics
exhibit combined $\cal IT$ symmetry. In the present work, we show that the
anti-symmetric Compton profile is a unique signature for all the
magneto-electric multipoles, since the asymmetric magnetization density of the
magneto-electric multipoles couples to space via spin-orbit coupling, resulting
in an anti-symmetric Compton profile. We develop the key physics of the
anti-symmetric Compton scattering using symmetry analysis and demonstrate it
using explicit first-principles calculations for two well-known representative
materials with magneto-electric multipoles, insulating LiNiPO$_4$ and metallic
Mn$_2$Au. Our work emphasizes the crucial roles of the orientation of the spin
moments, the spin-orbit coupling, and the band structure in generating the
anti-symmetric Compton profile in magneto-electric materials.

estimation of the physical flow parameters, such as the Keplerian disk rate,
sub-Keplerian halo rate, properties of the so-called {\it{Compton cloud}},

standardized ratio of emitted to observed photon flux in TCAF which does not
include X-ray emission from jets. In the presence of jets, this ratio changes
and this deviation is used to obtain the estimation of X-ray contribution from
the jets. Nature of the jet is found to be compact during low luminous hard
state and discrete or blobby during high luminous intermediate states. We find
a correlation between the radio (5.5 GHz) and X-ray ($2.5-25$ keV) fluxes from
different components. The radio ($F_R$) and jet X-ray ($F_{ouf}$) fluxes are
found to be correlated within the acceptable range of the standard correlation

Moreover, we present an essential refined attention block (RAB) which could
explore useful cues in HR space for reconstructing fine-detailed HR image.

untrimmed videos are more common in real-life scenes. Untrimmed videos have
redundant and diverse clips containing contextual information, so sampling
dense clips is essential. Recently, some works attempt to train a generic model
to select the N most representative clips. However, it is difficult to model
the complex relations from intra-class clips and inter-class videos within a
single model and fixed selected number, and the entanglement of multiple
relations is also hard to explain. Thus, instead of ""only look once"", we argue
""divide and conquer"" strategy will be more suitable in untrimmed VAR. Inspired
by the speed reading mechanism, we propose a simple yet effective clip-level
solution based on skim-scan techniques. Specifically, the proposed Skim-Scan
framework first skims the entire video and drops those uninformative and
misleading clips. For the remaining clips, it scans clips with diverse features
gradually to drop redundant clips but cover essential content. The above
strategies can adaptively select the necessary clips according to the
difficulty of the different videos. To trade off the computational complexity
and performance, we observe the similar statistical expression between
lightweight and heavy networks, thus it supports us to explore the combination
of them. Comprehensive experiments are performed on ActivityNet and mini-FCVID
datasets, and results demonstrate that our solution surpasses the
state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

on low-dimensional error metrics, for example average distance between

comparison of models, but do not provide clearly interpretable information on
how close to human behavior the models actually come, for example in terms of
higher-level behavior phenomena that are known to be present in human driving.
We study highway driving as an example scenario, and introduce metrics to
quantitatively demonstrate the presence, in a naturalistic dataset, of two
familiar behavioral phenomena: (1) The kinematics-dependent contest, between
on-highway and on-ramp vehicles, of who passes the merging point first. (2)
Courtesy lane changes away from the outermost lane, to leave space for a
merging vehicle. Applying the exact same metrics to the output of a
state-of-the-art machine-learned model, we show that the model is capable of
reproducing the former phenomenon, but not the latter. We argue that this type
of behavioral analysis provides information that is not available from
conventional model-fitting metrics, and that it may be useful to analyze (and
possibly fit) models also based on these types of behavioral criteria.

conditions and tilt the background magnetic field to be oblique to the
transition region. Halberstadt & Goedbloed (1993, 1995); Goedbloed& Halberstadt
(1994); Arregui et al. (2003) show that line-tied boundary conditions cause
their resonant absorption models to produce steep boundary layers/evanescent
fast waves. We aim to study the importance of the boundary layers and assess
their significance in a solar context. We calculate the solutions in a model
where we impose line-tied boundary conditions and compare this with a model
where we include the chromosphere instead. Results are calculated analytically
and then verified numerically. We show that line-tied boundary conditions can
cause the model to overestimate the boundary layers' amplitude significantly.
If the fast waves can propagate in the chromosphere, then the line-tied model
accurately predicts the boundary layers' amplitude. However, if the fast waves
are evanescent, then the boundary layers' size is reduced significantly, and
the line-tied model overestimates their amplitude. This leads to the
counter-intuitive result that the length scales tangential to the transition
region can play an essential role in determining line-tied boundary conditions'
validity. The results suggest that line-tied boundary conditions can cause the
model to generate unphysically large boundary layers. However, researchers may
wish to continue to use them in their models for their simplicity and ability
to significantly reduce computation time if they understand and are aware of
their flaws.

(in the sense of [20], [30]) if and only if the locally convex space $C_{p}(X)$
is distinguished. Continuing this research, we investigate whether the class
$\Delta$ of $\Delta$-spaces is invariant under the basic topological
operations.
  We prove that if $X \in \Delta$ and $\varphi:X \to Y$ is a continuous
surjection such that $\varphi(F)$ is an $F_{\sigma}$-set in $Y$ for every
closed set $F \subset X$, then also $Y\in \Delta$. As a consequence, if $X$ is
a countable union of closed subspaces $X_i$ such that each $X_i\in \Delta$,
then also $X\in \Delta$.
  In particular, $\sigma$-product of any family of scattered Eberlein compact
spaces is a $\Delta$-space and the product of a $\Delta$-space with a countable
space is a $\Delta$-space. Our results give answers to several open problems
posed in \cite{KL}.
  Let $T:C_p(X) \longrightarrow C_p(Y)$ be a continuous linear surjection. We
observe that $T$ admits an extension to a linear continuous operator
$\widehat{T}$ from $R^X$ onto $R^Y$ and deduce that $Y$ is a $\Delta$-space
whenever $X$ is.
  Similarly, assuming that $X$ and $Y$ are metrizable spaces, we show that $Y$
is a $Q$-set whenever $X$ is.
  Making use of obtained results, we provide a very short proof for the claim
that every compact $\Delta$-space has countable tightness. As a consequence,
under Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) every compact $\Delta$-space is sequential.

performance on tail classes. Existing methods usually modify the classification
loss to increase the learning focus on tail classes, which unexpectedly
sacrifice the performance on head classes. In fact, this scheme leads to a
contradiction between the two goals of long-tailed learning, i.e., learning
generalizable representations and facilitating learning for tail classes. In
this work, we explore knowledge distillation in long-tailed scenarios and
propose a novel distillation framework, named Balanced Knowledge Distillation
(BKD), to disentangle the contradiction between the two goals and achieve both
simultaneously. Specifically, given a vanilla teacher model, we train the
student model by minimizing the combination of an instance-balanced
classification loss and a class-balanced distillation loss. The former benefits
from the sample diversity and learns generalizable representation, while the
latter considers the class priors and facilitates learning mainly for tail
classes. The student model trained with BKD obtains significant performance
gain even compared with its teacher model. We conduct extensive experiments on
several long-tailed benchmark datasets and demonstrate that the proposed BKD is
an effective knowledge distillation framework in long-tailed scenarios, as well
as a new state-of-the-art method for long-tailed learning. Code is available at

generated from the enhanced HCNN, a binary contrast-based autotuned

patterns of interest are clustered within the probability map of the identified
features. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks on
the surface of roads, bridges or pavements. An extensive comparison with

one of four stable pairs: in-line and in-tandem, both parallel and
anti-parallel. When in these stable pairs, swimmers were coordinated, swum
together, and generated fluid flows as one. We compared the stable pairs'
speeds, swim direction and fluid flows to those of the single swimmer. The
in-line stable pairs behaved much like the single swimmer transitioning from
puller-like to pusher-like stroke-averaged flow fields. In contrast, for the
in-tandem pairs we discovered differences in the swim direction transition, as
well as the stroke-averaged fluid flow directions. Notably, the in-tandem V
pair switched its swim direction at a higher $\text{Re}$ than the single
swimmer while the in-tandem orbiting pair switched at a lower $\text{Re}$. We
also studied a system of 122 swimmers and found the collective behavior
transitioned from in-line network-like connections to small, transient
in-tandem clusters as the Reynolds number increased, consistent with the
in-line to in-tandem pairwise behavior. Details in the collective behavior
involved the formation of triples and other many-body hydrodynamic interactions
that were not captured by either pair or single swimmer behavior. Our findings
demonstrate the richness and complexity of the collective behavior of

firstly on the MNIST test set, showing that state-of-the-art lossless
compression is possible using a small variational autoencoder (VAE) model. We
then make use of a novel empirical insight, that fully convolutional generative
models, trained on small images, are able to generalize to images of arbitrary
size, and extend BB-ANS to hierarchical latent variable models, enabling
state-of-the-art lossless compression of full-size colour images from the
ImageNet dataset. We describe 'Craystack', a modular software framework which
we have developed for rapid prototyping of compression using deep generative
models.

lightweight, information-lossless, and memory-saving during back-propagation.
However, applying invertible models to remove noise is challenging because the
input is noisy, and the reversed output is clean, following two different
distributions. We propose an invertible denoising network, InvDN, to address
this challenge. InvDN transforms the noisy input into a low-resolution clean
image and a latent representation containing noise. To discard noise and
restore the clean image, InvDN replaces the noisy latent representation with
another one sampled from a prior distribution during reversion. The denoising
performance of InvDN is better than all the existing competitive models,
achieving a new state-of-the-art result for the SIDD dataset while enjoying
less run time. Moreover, the size of InvDN is far smaller, only having 4.2% of
the number of parameters compared to the most recently proposed DANet. Further,
via manipulating the noisy latent representation, InvDN is also able to
generate noise more similar to the original one. Our code is available at:

dilution, on the spin dynamics in the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice. The
ground state of this model is a canonical quantum spin liquid with spin
fractionalization into two types of quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana fermions
and localized fluxes. Using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we
calculate the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor, the
magnetic susceptibility, and the NMR relaxation rate. In the dynamical spin
structure factor, we find that the two types of disorder affect seriously the
low-energy peak dominantly originating from the flux excitations, rather than
the high-energy continuum from the Majorana excitations, in a different way:
The bond randomness softens the peak to the lower energy with broadening,
whereas the site dilution smears the peak and in addition develops the other
sharp peaks inside the spin gap including the zero energy. We show that the
zero-energy spin excitations, which originate from the Majorana zero modes
induced around the site vacancies, survive up to the temperature comparable to
the energy scale of the Kitaev interaction. For the bond randomness, the
low-temperature susceptibility does not show any qualitative change against the
weak disorder, but it changes to divergent behavior while increasing the
strength of disorder. Similar distinct behaviors for the weak and strong
disorder are observed also in the NMR relaxation rate; an exponential decay
changes into a power-law decay. In contrast, for the site dilution, we find no
such crossover; divergent behavior in the susceptibility and a power-law decay
in the NMR relaxation rate appear immediately with the introduction of the site
dilution. We discuss the relevance of our results to experiments for the Kitaev
candidate materials with disorders.

their beliefs about your own intentions. If you signal a turn, another driver

explicitly planning a set of conditional actions that depend on the stochastic

and are then used to test and improve the radiation reaction (and waveform) of
an effective-one-body (EOB) model. Eccentricity is incorporated into EOB by
replacing the quasi-circular Newtonian (or leading-order) prefactors in the
EOB-factorized multipolar waveform (and fluxes) with their generic
counterparts. The comparison between numerical and analytical quantities is
carried out over a large portion of the parameter space, notably for orbits
close to the separatrix and with high eccentricities. The analytical model
agrees to $\sim 1\%$ with the numerical data for orbits with moderate
eccentricities ($e\lesssim 0.3$) and moderate spins ($\hat{a}\lesssim 0.5$),
although this increases up to $\sim 33\%$ for large, positive, black hole spins

eccentricities, the new EOB fluxes can be used to drive the dynamics through
the nonadiabatic transition from eccentric inspiral to plunge, merger and
ringdown, thus providing accurate an description of the merger. We also show
that the same technique can be applied to hyperbolic encounters. In general,
our approach to radiation reaction for eccentric inspirals should be seen as a

capable of producing slow and stopped light with improved performance when
compared with a static Moir\'e grating. A Moir\'e grating superimposes two
grating periods which creates a narrow slow light resonance between two band
gaps. A Moir\'e grating can be made dynamic by varying its coupling strength in
time. By increasing the coupling strength the reduction in group velocity in
the slow light resonance can be improved by many orders of magnitude while
still maintaining the wide bandwidth of the initial, weak grating. We show that
for a pulse propagating through the grating this is a consequence of altering
the pulse spectrum and therefore the grating can also perform bandwidth
modulation. Finally we present a possible realization of the system via an
electro-optic grating by applying a quasi-static electric field to a poled
$\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear medium.

in photothermal radiometry enabling super resolution (SR) imaging. Photothermal
imaging is a well-known technique in active thermography for nondestructive
inspection of defects in materials such as metals or composites. A grand
challenge of active thermography is to overcome the spatial resolution
limitation imposed by heat diffusion in order to accurately resolve each
defect. The photothermal SR approach enables to extract high-frequency spatial
components based on the deconvolution with the thermal point spread function.
However, stable deconvolution can only be achieved by using the sparse
structure of defect patterns, which often requires tedious, hand-crafted tuning
of hyperparameters and results in computationally intensive algorithms. On this
account, Photothermal-SR-Net is proposed in this paper, which performs
deconvolution by deep unfolding considering the underlying physics. This
enables to super resolve 2D thermal images for nondestructive testing with a
substantially improved convergence rate. Since defects appear sparsely in
materials, Photothermal-SR-Net applies trained block-sparsity thresholding to
the acquired thermal images in each convolutional layer. The performance of the
proposed approach is evaluated and discussed using various deep unfolding and
thresholding approaches applied to 2D thermal images. Subsequently, studies are
conducted on how to increase the reconstruction quality and the computational
performance of Photothermal-SR-Net is evaluated. Thereby, it was found that the
computing time for creating high-resolution images could be significantly
reduced without decreasing the reconstruction quality by using pixel binning as
a preprocessing step.

in water, ice Ih melts on compression. On further increase in pressure the
liquid water transforms into a high density metastable glassy state,
characterized by a rapid approach to zero diffusion coefficient and an absence
of any crystalline order in the static structure factor. The vitrification is
found to occur even at high temperatures (T > 250 K). We study this glass
transition process at four temperatures (80 K, 250 K, 300 K and 320 K). The
transition pressure increases with increase in temperature, as expected.
Interestingly, we find that the total entropy of the system exhibits a sharp
crossover near the glass transition pressure where the diffusion of water goes
to zero. The diffusion coefficient shows an exponential dependence on the
properly defined excess entropy. In an interesting result not reported before,
we find a pressure induced realignment of water molecules resulting in two well
separated peaks in the O-O-O angle distribution among neighbouring molecules.
The difference between the positions of these two peaks undergoes a sharp
change at the vitrification pressure suggesting that it can serve as an
appropriate order parameter to detect the glass transition point.

work well on good-conditioned clean makeup images, but transferring makeup that
exhibits shadow and occlusion is not satisfying. To alleviate it, we propose a
novel makeup transfer method, called 3D-Aware Shadow and Occlusion Robust GAN
(SOGAN). Given the source and the reference faces, we first fit a 3D face model
and then disentangle the faces into shape and texture. In the texture branch,
we map the texture to the UV space and design a UV texture generator to
transfer the makeup. Since human faces are symmetrical in the UV space, we can
conveniently remove the undesired shadow and occlusion from the reference image
by carefully designing a Flip Attention Module (FAM). After obtaining cleaner
makeup features from the reference image, a Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is
introduced to perform accurate makeup transfer. The qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our SOGAN not only achieves superior
results in shadow and occlusion situations but also performs well in large pose
and expression variations.

forward a new graph learning abstraction named NN-TGAR to bridge the gap
between graph processing and graph deep learning. A distributed graph engine is
proposed to conduct the stochastic gradient descent optimization with a
hybrid-parallel execution, and a new cluster-batched training strategy is
supported. We evaluate GraphTheta using several datasets with network sizes
ranging from small-, modest- to large-scale. Experimental results show that
GraphTheta can scale well to 1,024 workers for training an in-house developed
GNN on an industry-scale Alipay dataset of 1.4 billion nodes and 4.1 billion
attributed edges, with a cluster of CPU virtual machines (dockers) of small
memory each (5$\sim$12GB). Moreover, GraphTheta can outperform DistDGL by up to

scattering in low frequency resonant micro-structured layered media with
viscoelastic constituent layers is presented. The band structure of the
infinitely periodic systems and scattering off a finite thickness slab of such
media are determined using the transfer matrix method. A consistent dynamic
field homogenization approach is applied, in which the micro-scale field
equations are integrated and the overall macro-scale quantities are defined to
be compatible with these integral forms. A reduced set of constitutive tensors
is presented for general asymmetric repeating unit cells (RUC), utilizing the
proposed homogenized macro-scale quantities combined with Onsager's principle
and presumed material form of elastodynamic reciprocity. This set can be
further restricted by studying the form of the dispersion equation leading to a
unique constitutive tensor. It is shown that for an asymmetric RUC, the full
constitutive tensor are required to match the scattering and band structure of
the micro-structured media, but all the off-diagonal parameters vanish for a
symmetric RUC. Therefore, it is possible to create an equivalent homogenized
representation with a uniquely determined diagonal constitutive tensor for a
symmetric RUC, though, as is the case also with asymmetric RUCs, all non-zero
components will be wave-vector dependent. Numerical examples are presented to
demonstrate the application and consistency of the proposed method. All the
diagonal terms are converging to their appropriate Voigt or Reuss averages at
the long-wavelength limit for all wave directions. The wave-vector dependent
nature of the off-diagonal coupling constants can still be observed even in
this limit. The conditions for lossy or lossless systems are presented and are
shown to impose weak requirements on overall constitutive tensors.

based on individual characteristics, has attracted increasing attention
recently in many fields, such as education, economics, and medicine. Current
ODR methods usually require the primary outcome of interest in samples for
assessing treatment effects, namely the experimental sample. However, in many
studies, treatments may have a long-term effect, and as such the primary
outcome of interest cannot be observed in the experimental sample due to the
limited duration of experiments, which makes the estimation of ODR impossible.
This paper is inspired to address this challenge by making use of an auxiliary
sample to facilitate the estimation of ODR in the experimental sample. We
propose an auGmented inverse propensity weighted Experimental and Auxiliary
sample-based decision Rule (GEAR) by maximizing the augmented inverse
propensity weighted value estimator over a class of decision rules using the
experimental sample, with the primary outcome being imputed based on the
auxiliary sample. The asymptotic properties of the proposed GEAR estimators and
their associated value estimators are established. Simulation studies are
conducted to demonstrate its empirical validity with a real AIDS application.

magnetic fields of NSs could be the fossil remnants of magnetic fields of their
progenitors. This work is dedicated to study this hypothesis. First, we gather
all modern precise measurements of surface magnetic fields in O, B and A stars.
Second, we estimate parameters for log-normal distribution of magnetic fields

0.09$ for strongly magnetised and $\mu_B = 0.14\pm 0.5$ $\log_{10}$ (G),

fields and magnetars represent 10 per cent of all young NSs and run population
synthesis. We found that it is impossible to simultaneously reproduce pulsars

of $2.1$ under the Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation. Mock LAEs created
by assigning Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width ($EW_\text{Ly$\alpha$}^\text{obs}$)
values to O3Es with an empirical relation also show similar, anisotropic CCFs
if we use only objects with higher $EW_\text{Ly$\alpha$}^\text{obs}$ than a
certain threshold. These results indicate that galaxies on the far side of a
dense region are more difficult to be detected (""hidden"") in Ly$\alpha$ because
Ly$\alpha$ emission toward us is absorbed by dense neutral hydrogen. If the
same region is viewed from a different direction, a different set of LAEs will
be selected as if galaxies are playing hide-and-seek using HI gas. Care is
needed when using LAEs to search for overdensities.

isothermal C-shock by Gu & Chen to 2D perpendicular and oblique C-shocks in the
typical environment of star-forming clouds. Simplified dispersion relations are
derived for the unstable modes. We find that the mode property of the drag
instability generally depends on the ratio of the transverse (normal to the
shock flow) to longitudinal (along the shock flow) wavenumber. For the
transversely large-scale mode, the growth rate and wave frequency of the drag
instability in a 2D shock resemble those in a 1D shock. For the transversely
small-scale mode, the drag instability is characterized by an unstable mode
coupled with an acoustic mode primarily along the transverse direction. When
the shock is perpendicular or less oblique, there exists a slowly propagating
mode, which can potentially grow into a nonlinear regime and contribute to the
maximum growth of the instability. In contrast, when the shock is more oblique,
this slowly propagating unstable mode disappears, and the maximum growth of the
drag instability is likely contributed from the transversely large-scale mode
(i.e., almost 1D mode). In all cases that we consider, the magnitude of the
density perturbations is significantly larger than that of the velocity and
magnetic field perturbations, implying that the density enhancement governs the
dynamics in the linear regime of the instability. A few issues in the linear

acquire new knowledge given new classes, while maintaining the knowledge
already learned for old classes. Saving a subset of training samples of
previously seen classes in the memory and replaying them during new training
phases is proven to be an efficient and effective way to fulfil this aim. It is
evident that the larger number of exemplars the model inherits the better
performance it can achieve. However, finding a trade-off between the model
performance and the number of samples to save for each class is still an open
problem for replay-based incremental learning and is increasingly desirable for
real-life applications. In this paper, we approach this open problem by tapping
into a two-step compression approach. The first step is a lossy compression, we
propose to encode input images and save their discrete latent representations
in the form of codes that are learned using a hierarchical Vector Quantised
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). In the second step, we further compress codes
losslessly by learning a hierarchical latent variable model with bits-back
asymmetric numeral systems (BB-ANS). To compensate for the information lost in
the first step compression, we introduce an Information Back (IB) mechanism
that utilizes real exemplars for a contrastive learning loss to regularize the
training of a classifier. By maintaining all seen exemplars' representations in
the format of `codes', Discrete Representation Replay (DRR) outperforms the
state-of-art method on CIFAR-100 by a margin of 4% accuracy with a much less
memory cost required for saving samples. Incorporated with IB and saving a
small set of old raw exemplars as well, the accuracy of DRR can be further
improved by 2% accuracy.

in the trophosphere that are balanced with respect to both acoustic and
internal gravity waves. Within this framework, effects of (turbulent) friction
near the ground are usually represented by Ekman Layer theory. The troposphere
covers roughly the lowest ten kilometers of the atmosphere while Ekman layer
heights are typically just a few hundred meters. However, this two-layer
asymptotic theory does not explicitly account for substantial changes of the
potential temperature stratification due to diabatic heating associated with
cloud formation or with radiative and turbulent heat fluxes, which, in the
middle latitudes, can be particularly important in about the lowest three
kilometers. To address this deficiency, this paper extends the classical
QG-Ekman layer model by introducing an intermediate, dynamically and
thermodynamically active layer, called the ""diabatic layer"" (DL) from here on.
The flow in this layer is also in acoustic, hydrostatic, and geostrophic
balance but, in contrast to QG flow, variations of potential temperature are
not restricted to small deviations from a stable and time independent
background stratification. Instead, within the diabatic layer, diabatic
processes are allowed to affect the leading-order stratification. As a
consequence, the diabatic layer modifies the pressure field at the top of the
Ekman layer, and with it the intensity of Ekman pumping seen by the
quasi-geostrophic bulk flow. The result is the proposed extended
quasi-geostrophic three-layer QG-DL-Ekman model for mid-latitude (dry and
moist) dynamics.

of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, are estimated to solve
a particular minimax problem. This minimax problem typically has a multitude of
solutions and the focus of this paper are the statistical properties of these
solutions. We address two key issues for the generator and discriminator
network parameters, consistent estimation and confidence sets. We first show
that the set of solutions to the sample GAN problem is a (Hausdorff) consistent
estimator of the set of solutions to the corresponding population GAN problem.
We then devise a computationally intensive procedure to form confidence sets
and show that these sets contain the population GAN solutions with the desired
coverage probability. The assumptions employed in our results are weak and hold
in many practical GAN applications. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
provides the first results on statistical inference for GANs in the empirically
relevant case of multiple solutions.

updating the translated image, we force similar outputs from the two branches.
When such requirements are met, differences between the two images can

we propose a source-free image translation method that generates source-style

accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as universal
models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major disadvantage of
neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret
and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their
results often elude human interpretation. In mechanics, the new and active
field of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this
disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical
knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural
networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions could be explained.
However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters
remain mysterious.
  Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step
towards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on
mechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence
approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their
high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis
decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows
the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is
supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the
best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of
three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,
elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can
help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize
new materials.

discovering terradynamic principles of multi-legged locomotor transitions,
using simplified model systems representing distinct challenges in complex

across diverse model systems, by modelling locomotor-terrain interaction using
a potential energy landscape approach. The animal and robots' stereotyped

are stochastic, destabilizing, barrier-crossing transitions on the landscape.
They can be induced by feed-forward self-propulsion and are facilitated by

important technical challenge in deep learning, because of its potential to
reduce the expensive annotation required for semantic segmentation. Prior
zero-label semantic segmentation works approach this task by learning
visual-semantic embeddings or generative models. However, they are prone to
overfitting on the seen classes because there is no training signal for them.
In this paper, we study the challenging generalized zero-label semantic
segmentation task where the model has to segment both seen and unseen classes
at test time. We assume that pixels of unseen classes could be present in the
training images but without being annotated. Our idea is to capture the latent
information on unseen classes by supervising the model with self-produced
pseudo-labels for unlabeled pixels. We propose a consistency regularizer to
filter out noisy pseudo-labels by taking the intersections of the pseudo-labels
generated from different augmentations of the same image. Our framework
generates pseudo-labels and then retrain the model with human-annotated and
pseudo-labelled data. This procedure is repeated for several iterations. As a
result, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art on PascalVOC12 and
COCO-stuff datasets in the challenging generalized zero-label semantic

enable the cost-effective production of complex shaped, high strength aluminium

efforts focus on the development of advanced material models for finite element

require forming process expertise and are unsuitable for early-stage design
explorations. To address these limitations, this study presents a novel
application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based surrogate as a means
of rapid manufacturing feasibility assessment for components to be formed using
the HFQ process. A diverse dataset containing variations in component geometry,
blank shapes, and processing parameters, together with corresponding physical
fields is generated and used to train the model. The results show that near
indistinguishable full field predictions are obtained in real time from the
model when compared with HFQ simulations. This technique provides an invaluable

any pair of cryptocurrencies. The direct exchange rate of two tokens may not

up arbitrage possibilities with trading through different cryptocurrencies
cyclically. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on cyclic

optimal trading strategies of cyclic transactions. We further examine
exploitable arbitrage opportunities and the market size of cyclic arbitrages
with transaction-level data of Uniswap V2. We find that traders have executed
292,606 cyclic arbitrages over eleven months and exploited more than 138
million USD in revenue. However, the revenue of the most profitable unexploited
opportunity is persistently higher than 1 ETH (4,000 USD), which indicates that
DEX markets may not be efficient enough. By analyzing how traders implement
cyclic arbitrages, we find that traders can utilize smart contracts to issue
atomic transactions and the atomic implementations could mitigate users'
financial loss in cyclic arbitrage from the price impact.

  proceedings",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Motivation: The activity of the adaptive immune system is governed by T-cells
and their specific T-cell receptors (TCR), which selectively recognize foreign
antigens. Recent advances in experimental techniques have enabled sequencing of
TCRs and their antigenic targets (epitopes), allowing to research the missing
link between TCR sequence and epitope binding specificity. Scarcity of data and
a large sequence space make this task challenging, and to date only models
limited to a small set of epitopes have achieved good performance. Here, we
establish a k-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier as a strong baseline and then
propose TITAN (Tcr epITope bimodal Attention Networks), a bimodal neural
network that explicitly encodes both TCR sequences and epitopes to enable the
independent study of generalization capabilities to unseen TCRs and/or
epitopes. Results: By encoding epitopes at the atomic level with SMILES
sequences, we leverage transfer learning and data augmentation to enrich the
input data space and boost performance. TITAN achieves high performance in the
prediction of specificity of unseen TCRs (ROC-AUC 0.87 in 10-fold CV) and
surpasses the results of the current state-of-the-art (ImRex) by a large
margin. Notably, our Levenshtein-distance-based K-NN classifier also exhibits
competitive performance on unseen TCRs. While the generalization to unseen
epitopes remains challenging, we report two major breakthroughs. First, by
dissecting the attention heatmaps, we demonstrate that the sparsity of
available epitope data favors an implicit treatment of epitopes as classes.
This may be a general problem that limits unseen epitope performance for
sufficiently complex models. Second, we show that TITAN nevertheless exhibits
significantly improved performance on unseen epitopes and is capable of
focusing attention on chemically meaningful molecular structures.

accurately predicting students' responses to future questions by summarizing
their knowledge states, has been widely studied for decades as it is considered
a fundamental task towards adaptive online learning. Among all the proposed KT
methods, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and its variants are by far the most
effective ones due to the high flexibility of the neural network. However, DKT
often ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills,
reasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to
the lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for
adaptive learning. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we proposed
Leveled Attentive KNowledge TrAcing (LANA), which firstly uses a novel
student-related features extractor (SRFE) to distill students' unique inherent
properties from their respective interactive sequences. Secondly, the pivot
module was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural
network on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the
performance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response
Theory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by
their ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign
different encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module
reconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning
specialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved. Extensive
experiments conducted on two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrated that
our proposed LANA improves the AUC score by at least 1.00% (i.e. EdNet 1.46%
