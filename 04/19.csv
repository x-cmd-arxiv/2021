of labelled training data to solve computer vision problems. The recent rise of
deep learning algorithms for recognising image content has led to the emergence
of many ad-hoc labelling tools. With this survey, we capture and systematise
the commonalities as well as the distinctions between existing image labelling
software. We perform a structured literature review to compile the underlying
concepts and features of image labelling software such as annotation
expressiveness and degree of automation. We structure the manual labelling task
by its organisation of work, user interface design options, and user support
techniques to derive a systematisation schema for this survey. Applying it to
available software and the body of literature, enabled us to uncover several
application archetypes and key domains such as image retrieval or instance
identification in healthcare or television.

vision, such as object tracking and recognition, security, military, and
biomedical image analysis. This review presents the application of
convolutional neural networks in one of the fields of dentistry - orthodontics.
Advances in medical imaging technologies and methods allow CNNs to be used in
orthodontics to shorten the planning time of orthodontic treatment, including
an automatic search of landmarks on cephalometric X-ray images, tooth
segmentation on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images or digital models,
and classification of defects on X-Ray panoramic images. In this work, we
describe the current methods, the architectures of deep convolutional neural
networks used, and their implementations, together with a comparison of the
results achieved by them. The promising results and visualizations of the
described studies show that the use of methods based on convolutional neural
networks allows for the improvement of computer-based orthodontic treatment
planning, both by reducing the examination time and, in many cases, by
performing the analysis much more accurately than a manual orthodontist does.

finite-size scaling of excited level crossings and order parameters. Together
with previous results on candidate models for deconfined quantum criticality

where the deconfined quantum-critical point separates a line of first-order
transitions and a gapless spin liquid phase. The frustrated Shastry-Sutherland
model is close to the critical point but slightly inside the spin liquid phase,

elucidate the unique dynamics of giant molecules, or generally speaking,
3-dimensional architectured polymers. When constituted by more than the
critical number around 200 beads, soft-clusters cannot diffuse or relax far
above their glass transition temperature, although relaxation can happen on the
level of beads. Each soft-cluster can only rotate in the cage formed by
neighboring soft-clusters. Such a non-diffusing state would transform to the
liquid state at exceptionally high temperature, e.g. 10 times the glass
transition temperature. Agreeing with experiments, 3D hierarchies lead to
unique dynamics, especially their divergent relaxation times with the number of
beads. These unique dynamics are in sharp contrast with 1-dimensional
chain-like polymers. We name such a special state as 'cooperative glass',
because of the 'cooperation' of the 3D-connected beads. The design of
soft-clusters may also resemble cooperative rearranging regions where
cooperativeness is contributed by low temperature, thus offer further insights
into the glass problem.

Many deep learning based methods have shown their superb performance in
handling homogeneous dehazing problems. However, we observe that even if a
carefully designed convolutional neural network (CNN) can perform well on
large-scaled dehazing benchmarks, the network usually fails on the
non-homogeneous dehazing datasets introduced by NTIRE challenges. The reasons
are mainly in two folds. Firstly, due to its non-homogeneous nature, the
non-uniformly distributed haze is harder to be removed than the homogeneous
haze. Secondly, the research challenge only provides limited data (there are
only 25 training pairs in NH-Haze 2021 dataset). Thus, learning the mapping
from the domain of hazy images to that of clear ones based on very limited data
is extremely hard. To this end, we propose a simple but effective approach for
non-homogeneous dehazing via ensemble learning. To be specific, we introduce a
two-branch neural network to separately deal with the aforementioned problems
and then map their distinct features by a learnable fusion tail. We show
extensive experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed

composition and the prebiotic molecular content. Dust traps are of particular
importance as pebble growth and transport are crucial for setting the chemistry

60 au radius provides a unique laboratory for studying chemistry in
pebble-concentrated environments in warm Herbig disks with low gas-to-dust
ratios down to 0.01. We use deep ALMA Band~7 line observations to search the
IRS~48 disk for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH line emission, the first steps of complex
organic chemistry. We report the detection of 7 H$_2$CO and 6 CH$_3$OH lines
with energy levels between 17 and 260 K. The line emission shows a crescent
morphology, similar to the dust continuum, suggesting that the icy pebbles play
an important role in the delivery of these molecules. Rotational diagrams and
line ratios indicate that both molecules originate from warm molecular regions
in the disk with temperatures $>$100 K and column densities $\sim10^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$ or a fractional abundance of $\sim10^{-8}$ and with
H$_2$CO/CH$_3$OH$\sim$0.2, indicative of ice chemistry. Based on arguments from
a physical-chemical model with low gas-to-dust ratios, we propose a scenario
where the dust trap provides a huge icy grain reservoir in the disk midplane or
an `ice trap', which can result in high gas-phase abundances of warm COMs
through efficient vertical mixing. This is the first time that complex organic
molecules have been clearly linked to the presence of a dust trap. These
results demonstrate the importance of including dust evolution and vertical
transport in chemical disk models, as icy dust concentrations provide important
reservoirs for complex organic chemistry in disks.

the first case of prominent SO2 emission detected from a protoplanetary disk.
The molecular emissions of both molecules is spatially correlated with the

the edge of the dust cavity and that the bulk of the ice reservoir is
coincident with the millimetre dust grains. Depending on the partition of
elemental sulphur between refractory and volatile materials the observed
molecules can account for 15-100% of the total sulphur budget in the disk. In
strong contrast to previous results, we constrain the C/O ratio from the CS/SO

multimodal inputs. More importantly, our method supports open-world scenarios,
including both image and text, without any re-training, fine-tuning, or

image generation and manipulation based on the superior characteristics of a

first strategy is to train a text encoder to obtain latent codes that align
with the hierarchically semantic of the aforementioned pretrained GAN model.
The second strategy is to directly optimize the latent codes in the latent
space of the pretrained GAN model with guidance from a pretrained language

inverted from a given image, which provides inherent supports for both image
generation and manipulation from multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or

training on limited data can easily lead to over-fitting problem. To tackle
these two issues, we introduce a novel dehazing network using 2D discrete

to deal with the aforementioned problems. By utilizing wavelet transform in DWT

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recommendation systems are often evaluated based on user's interactions that
were collected from an existing, already deployed recommendation system. In
this situation, users only provide feedback on the exposed items and they may
not leave feedback on other items since they have not been exposed to them by
the deployed system. As a result, the collected feedback dataset that is used
to evaluate a new model is influenced by the deployed system, as a form of
closed loop feedback. In this paper, we show that the typical offline
evaluation of recommender systems suffers from the so-called Simpson's paradox.
Simpson's paradox is the name given to a phenomenon observed when a significant
trend appears in several different sub-populations of observational data but
disappears or is even reversed when these sub-populations are combined
together. Our in-depth experiments based on stratified sampling reveal that a
very small minority of items that are frequently exposed by the deployed system
plays a confounding factor in the offline evaluation of recommendation systems.
In addition, we propose a novel evaluation methodology that takes into account
the confounder, i.e the deployed system's characteristics. Using the relative
comparison of many recommendation models as in the typical offline evaluation
of recommender systems, and based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient,
we show that our proposed evaluation methodology exhibits statistically
significant improvements of 14% and 40% on the examined open loop datasets

deformations in the simplest model of one-dimensional lattice displaying the
non-Hermitian skin effect, namely the Hatano-Nelson model with unidirectional
hopping, under on-site potential uncorrelated disorder in complex energy plane.
While the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions (OBC) exactly
reproduces the distribution of on-site potential disorder, the energy spectrum
under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) undergoes spectral deformations, from
one or more closed loops in the fully delocalized phase, with no overlap with
the OBC spectrum, to a mixed spectrum (closed loops and some OBC energies) in
the mobility edge phase, to a complete collapse toward the OBC spectrum in the
bulk localized phase. Such transitions are observed as the strength of disorder
is increased. Depending on the kind of disorder, different interesting
behaviors are found. In particular, for continuous disorder with a radial
distribution in complex energy plane it is shown that in the delocalized phase
the energy spectrum under PBC is locked and fully insensitive to disorder,
while transition to the bulk localized phase is signaled by the change of a
topological winding number. When the disorder is described by a discrete
distribution, the bulk localization transition never occurs, while topological
phase transitions associated to PBC energy spectral splittings can be observed.

quantum systems with discrete energy spectrum the Heisenberg time $t_H =2\pi
\hbar/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the mean level spacing (inverse energy
level density), is an important time scale. The classical transport time scale
$t_T$ (diffusion time) in relation to the Heisenberg time scale $t_H$ (their
ratio is the parameter $\alpha=t_H/t_T$) determines the degree of localization
of the chaotic eigenstates, whose measure $A$ is based on the information
entropy. The localization of chaotic eigenstates is reflected also in the
fractional power-law repulsion between the nearest energy levels in the sense
that the probability density (level spacing distribution) to find successive
levels on a distance $S$ goes like $\propto S^\beta$ for small $S$, where
$0\leq\beta\leq1$, and $\beta=1$ corresponds to completely extended states. We

variety of experiments ranging from optics to electronic transport. Its
characterization remains challenging due to complex multi band behavior. We
investigate the conduction band of dual-gated three-layer MoS$_2$ by means of
magnetotransport experiments. The total carrier density is tuned by voltages
applied between MoS$_2$ and both top and bottom gate electrodes. For
asymmetrically biased top and bottom gates, electrons accumulate in the layer
closest to the positively biased electrode. In this way, the three-layer
MoS$_2$ can be tuned to behave electronically like a monolayer. In contrast,
applying a positive voltage on both gates leads to the occupation of all three
layers. Our analysis of the Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations originating from
different bands lets us attribute the corresponding carrier densities in the
top and bottom layers. We find a twofold Landau level degeneracy for each band,
suggesting that the minima of the conduction band lie at the $\pm K$ points of
the first Brillouin zone. This is in contrast to band structure calculations
for zero layer asymmetry, which report minima at the $Q$ points. Even though
the interlayer tunnel coupling seems to leave the low-energy conduction band
unaffected, we observe scattering of electrons between the outermost layers for
zero layer asymmetry. The middle layer remains decoupled due to the spin-valley
symmetry, which is inverted for neighboring layers. When the bands of the
outermost layers are energetically in resonance, interlayer scattering takes
place, leading to an enhanced resistance and to magneto-interband oscillations.

of preposition senses suitable for use in natural language processing
applications. In the project, prepositions in the FrameNet corpus are
disambiguated using a sense inventory from a current dictionary, guided by a
comprehensive treatment of preposition meaning. The methodology provides a
framework for identifying and characterizing semantic roles, a gold standard
corpus of instances for further analysis, and an account of semantic role
alternation patterns. By adhering to this methodology, it is hoped that a
comprehensive and improved characterization of preposition behavior (semantic
role identification, and syntactic and semantic properties of the preposition
complement and attachment point) will be developed. The databases generated in
the project are publicly available for further use by researchers and
application developers.

surrounding a large regular island with almost no further substructure, being
entirely covered by invariant tori. The boundary between the chaotic sea and
the regular island is smooth, except for a few points. The classical transport

localization of the chaotic eigenstates is rather weak. The quantum states are
characterized by the following {\em universal} properties of mixed-type systems

The regular eigenenergies obey the Poissonian statistics, while the chaotic

  Embeddings",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unstructured text provides decision-makers with a rich data source in many
domains, ranging from product reviews in retailing to nursing notes in
healthcare. To leverage this information, words are typically translated into
word embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words
-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.
However, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data
can be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new
domain, e.g., the word ""positive"" typically has positive sentiment, but often
has negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is
tested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number
of domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive
two-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can
achieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with
substantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings
are altered between domains. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We
empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art fine-tuning heuristics from natural language processing.

reformulating the thresholds through intermediate variables, which can be
obtained by clustering multi-dimensional data from the received signals, and by
using the K-means clustering algorithm. In addition to estimating the
thresholds, we show that the transmitted bits can be retrieved from the
clustered data. To reduce clustering errors, we propose iterative clustering
methods from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional data, which are shown to
reduce the BER. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of

generated with excess power levels it experiences relaxation oscillations in
its intensity and timing. On the other hand, when a soliton is generated in an
unstable state-of-polarization, it either decays in intensity until it
disappears, or its temporal width decreases until it explodes into several
solitons and then it disappears. We also found that when two solitons are
simultaneously generated close to each other, they attract each other until
they collide and merge into a single soliton. Although, these two solitons are
generated with different states-of-polarization, they shift their
state-of-polarization closer to each other until the polarization coincides
when they collide. We support our findings by numerical calculations of a

high tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio at ~0.28 eV for $n$ = 2 and 0.34
eV for $n$ > 2, which are slightly higher than the Fermi energy. The observed
shifting of this high TMR ratio originates from the transmission of electrons
through the surface states of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital of Ni atoms at interfaces
which are hybridized with the $p_z$-orbital of N atoms. In the case of $n$ > 2,
the proximity effect causes an evanescent wave, contributing to decreasing
transmission probability but increasing the TMR ratio. However, TMR ratio, as
well as transmission probability, was found to be increased, by replacing the
unhybridized hBN layer of the Ni/3hBN/Ni MTJ with graphene, thus becoming
Ni/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni. A TMR ratio as high as ~1200% was observed at an energy of
0.34 eV, which is higher than the Fermi energy. Furthermore, a design is
proposed for a device based on a new reading mechanism using the high TMR
observed just above the Fermi energy level.

optimal in the presence of non-tradable income risk in a stochastic volatility

optimization problem. We find it is the (random) contributions that induce the
optimal path exhibiting a glide path structure, both in the constant and

modeling non-linear relationships in regression data with potential hidden
graph-structured interactions between the high-dimensional predictors, within
the mixture of experts modeling framework. In order to deal with such a complex
situation, we investigate a block-diagonal localized mixture of polynomial
experts (BLoMPE) regression model, which is constructed upon an inverse
regression and block-diagonal structures of the Gaussian expert covariance
matrices. We introduce a penalized maximum likelihood selection criterion to
estimate the unknown conditional density of the regression model. This model
selection criterion allows us to handle the challenging problem of inferring
the number of mixture components, the degree of polynomial mean functions, and
the hidden block-diagonal structures of the covariance matrices, which reduces
the number of parameters to be estimated and leads to a trade-off between
complexity and sparsity in the model. In particular, we provide a strong
theoretical guarantee: a finite-sample oracle inequality satisfied by the
penalized maximum likelihood estimator with a Jensen-Kullback-Leibler type
loss, to support the introduced non-asymptotic model selection criterion. The
penalty shape of this criterion depends on the complexity of the considered
random subcollection of BLoMPE models, including the relevant graph structures,
the degree of polynomial mean functions, and the number of mixture components.

developed to predict drug response as a function of tumor and drug features.
However, most algorithm development efforts have relied on cross validation
within a single study to assess model accuracy. While an essential first step,
cross validation within a biological data set typically provides an overly
optimistic estimate of the prediction performance on independent test sets. To
provide a more rigorous assessment of model generalizability between different
studies, we use machine learning to analyze five publicly available cell
line-based data sets: NCI60, CTRP, GDSC, CCLE and gCSI. Based on observed
experimental variability across studies, we explore estimates of prediction
upper bounds. We report performance results of a variety of machine learning
models, with a multitasking deep neural network achieving the best cross-study
generalizability. By multiple measures, models trained on CTRP yield the most
accurate predictions on the remaining testing data, and gCSI is the most
predictable among the cell line data sets included in this study. With these
experiments and further simulations on partial data, two lessons emerge: (1)
differences in viability assays can limit model generalizability across
studies, and (2) drug diversity, more than tumor diversity, is crucial for
raising model generalizability in preclinical screening.

mechanisms as an understudied research problem and a key missing piece in the

  Symposium in The New York Academy of Sciences",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep models have improved state-of-the-art for both supervised and
unsupervised learning. For example, deep embedded clustering (DEC) has greatly
improved the unsupervised clustering performance, by using stacked autoencoders
for representation learning. However, one weakness of deep modeling is that the
local neighborhood structure in the original space is not necessarily preserved
in the latent space. To preserve local geometry, various methods have been
proposed in the supervised and semi-supervised learning literature (e.g.,
spectral clustering and label propagation) using graph Laplacian
regularization. In this paper, we combine the strength of deep representation
learning with measure propagation (MP), a KL-divergence based graph
regularization method originally used in the semi-supervised scenario. The main
assumption of MP is that if two data points are close in the original space,
they are likely to belong to the same class, measured by KL-divergence of class
membership distribution. By taking the same assumption in the unsupervised
learning scenario, we propose our Deep Embedded Clustering Aided by Measure
Propagation (DECAMP) model. We evaluate DECAMP on short text clustering tasks.
On three public datasets, DECAMP performs competitively with other
state-of-the-art baselines, including baselines using additional data to
generate word embeddings used in the clustering process. As an example, on the
Stackoverflow dataset, DECAMP achieved a clustering accuracy of 79%, which is
about 5% higher than all existing baselines. These empirical results suggest
that DECAMP is a very effective method for unsupervised learning.

in the frames of the Keldysh theory whose validity is limited to small photon

time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations, which are free of
these limitations, enable to gain insight into non-equilibrium dynamics of the
electronic structure. Here we apply the TDDFT to investigate photoionization of
silicon crystal by ultrashort laser pulses in a wide range of laser wavelengths
and intensities and compare the results with predictions of the Keldysh theory.
Photoionization rates derived from the simulations considerably exceed the data
obtained with the Keldysh theory within the validity range of the latter.
Possible reasons of the discrepancy are discussed and we provide fundamental
data on the photoionization rates beyond the limits of the Keldysh theory. By
investigating the features of the Stark shift as a function of photon energy

Yang-Mills theories in the context of gauge-fixed calculations. The method is
based on a background-field generalisation of the Landau gauge (to which it
reduces at vanishing temperature) with a given, center-symmetric background.
This is to be contrasted with most implementations of background field methods
in gauge theories, where one uses a variable, self-consistent background. Our
proposal is a bona fide gauge fixing that can easily be implemented on the
lattice and in continuum approaches. The resulting gauge-fixed action
explicitly exhibits the center symmetry of the nonzero temperature theory that
controls the confinement-deconfinement transition. We show that, in that gauge,
the electric susceptibility diverges at a second order transition [e.g., in the
SU(2) theory], so that the gluon propagator is a clear probe of the transition.
We implement our proposal in the perturbative Curci-Ferrari model, known for
its successful description of various infrared aspects of Yang-Mills theories,
including the confinement-deconfinement transition. Our one-loop calculation
confirms our general expectation for the susceptibility while providing
transition temperatures in excellent agreement with the SU(2) and SU(3) lattice
values. Finally, the Polyakov loops above the transition show a more moderate
rise, in contrast to previous implementations of the Curci-Ferrari model using
a self-consistent background, and our SU(3) result agrees quite well with
lattice results in the range $[0,2T_c]$.

efficient querying of large document collections. While there are a number of
possible organizations, document-ordered indexes are the most common, since
they are amenable to various query types, support index updates, and allow for
efficient dynamic pruning operations. One disadvantage with document-ordered
indexes is that high-scoring documents can be distributed across the document
identifier space, meaning that index traversal algorithms that terminate early
might put search effectiveness at risk. The alternative is impact-ordered
indexes, which primarily support top-k disjunctions, but also allow for anytime
query processing, where the search can be terminated at any time, with search
quality improving as processing latency increases. Anytime query processing can
be used to effectively reduce high-percentile tail latency which is essential
for operational scenarios in which a service level agreement (SLA) imposes
response time requirements. In this work, we show how document-ordered indexes
can be organized such that they can be queried in an anytime fashion, enabling
strict latency control with effective early termination. Our experiments show
that processing document-ordered topical segments selected by a simple score

opportunity to observe the planet's atmosphere filtering starlight. The
fraction of occulted stellar flux is roughly proportional to the optically
thick area of the planet, the extent of which depends on the opacity of the
planet's gaseous envelope at the observed wavelengths. Chemical species, haze,
and clouds are now routinely detected in exoplanet atmospheres through rather
small features in transmission spectra, i.e., collections of planet-to-star
area ratios across multiple spectral bins and/or photometric bands.
Technological advances have led to a shrinking of the error bars down to a few
tens of parts per million (ppm) per spectral point for the brightest targets.
The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is anticipated to deliver
transmission spectra with precision down to 10 ppm. The increasing precision of
measurements requires a reassessment of the approximations hitherto adopted in
astrophysical models, including transit light curve models. Recently, it has
been shown that neglecting the planet's thermal emission can introduce
significant biases in the transit depth measured with the JWST/Mid-InfraRed
Instrument, integrated between 5 and 12 $\mu$m. In this paper, we take a step
forward by analyzing the effects of the approximation on transmission spectra

yields a discrete word called a trace, which is amenable to established formal
methods for path checking. The original continuous-time trajectory is shown to
satisfy the specification if and only if its trace does. General topological
conditions on the sample points are derived that ensure a trace is recorded for
arbitrary continuous paths, given arbitrary region descriptions. Using
techniques from computer algebra, a trace generation algorithm is developed to
satisfy these conditions when the path and region boundaries are defined by
polynomials. The proposed PolyTrace algorithm has polynomial complexity in the
number of atomic propositions, and is guaranteed to produce a trace of any

common type of method that can mitigate the impact of label noise can be viewed
as supervised robust methods; one can simply replace the CCE loss with a loss

those with higher loss values. Recently, another type of method using
semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed, which augments these
supervised robust methods to exploit (possibly) noisy samples more effectively.
Although supervised robust methods perform well across different data types,
they have been shown to be inferior to the SSL methods on image classification
tasks under label noise. Therefore, it remains to be seen that whether these
supervised robust methods can also perform well if they can utilize the
unlabeled samples more effectively. In this paper, we show that by initializing
supervised robust methods using representations learned through contrastive

some of the trends in sensitivity are fairly general, the exact nature of

transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets

which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs,
commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents
an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human
faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are
forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same
problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately
identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a

networks. The performance of deep neural networks is undermined by the fact
that these algorithms have poorly calibrated measures of uncertainty. This
restricts their application in high risk domains such as computer aided
diagnosis and autonomous vehicle navigation. Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL)
offers a promising method for representing uncertainty in neural network.
However, BDL requires a separate set of parameters to store the mean and
standard deviation of model weights to learn a distribution. This results in a
prohibitive 2-fold increase in the number of model parameters. To address this
problem we present a method for performing BDL, namely Kernel Seed Networks
(KSN), which does not require a 2-fold increase in the number of parameters.
KSNs use 1x1 Convolution operations to learn a compressed latent space
representation of the parameter distribution. In this paper we show how this
allows KSNs to outperform conventional BDL methods while reducing the number of
required parameters by up to a factor of 6.6.

method (MFV) and Meshless Finite Mass method (MFM), we have performed a number
of simulations of the Jeans test and compared the results with both the
expected analytic solution and results from the more standard Lagrangian
approach: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We find that the different
schemes converge to the analytic solution when the diameter of a fluid element
is smaller than a quarter of the Jeans wavelength, $\lambda_\mathrm{J}$. Among
the three schemes, SPH/MFV shows the fastest/slowest convergence to the
analytic solution. Unlike the well-known behaviour of Eulerian schemes, none of
the Lagrangian schemes investigated displays artificial fragmentation when the
perturbation wavelength, $\lambda$, is shorter than $\lambda_\mathrm{J}$, even
at low numerical resolution. For larger wavelengths ($\lambda >
\lambda_\mathrm{J}$) the growth of the perturbation is delayed when it is not
well resolved. Furthermore, with poor resolution, the fragmentation seen with
the MFV scheme proceeds very differently compared to the converged solution.
All these results suggest that, when unresolved, the ratio of the magnitude of
hydrodynamic force to that of self-gravity at the sub-resolution scale is the
largest/smallest in MFV/SPH, the reasons for which we discussed in detail.
These tests are repeated to investigate the effect of kernels of higher-order
than the fiducial cubic spline. Our results indicate that the standard
deviation of the kernel is a more appropriate definition of the size of a fluid
element than its compact support radius.

proper mechanical model. In this context, this study proposes an accurate
methodology for the mechanical-probabilistic modelling of RC structures
subjected to reinforcements' corrosion. To this purpose, an improved damage
approach is proposed to define the limit states for the probabilistic
modelling, considering three main degradation phenomena: concrete cracking,
rebar yielding, and rebar corrosion caused either by chlorides or carbonation
process. The stochastic analysis is evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulation
method due to the computational efficiency of the LDMC. The proposed
mechanical-probabilistic methodology is implemented in a computational
framework and applied to the analysis of a simply supported RC beam, and a 2D
RC frame. Curves illustrate the probability of failure over a service life of
50 years. Moreover, the proposed model allows drawing the probability of
failure map and then identify the critical failure path for progressive
collapse analysis. Collapse path changes caused by the corrosion phenomena are

function generating single particle dynamics. Systems with higher complexity
often exhibit topological constraints, which are independent of the Hamiltonian
and may affect the shape of the distribution function as well. Here, we study a
further source of heterogeneity, the curvature of spacetime arising from the
general theory of relativity. The present construction relies on three
assumptions: first, the statistical ensemble is made of particles obeying
geodesic equations, which define the phase space of the system. Next, the
metric coefficients are time-symmetric, implying that, if thermodynamic
equilibrium is achieved, all physical observables are independent of coordinate
time. Finally, ergodicity is enforced with respect to proper time, so that
ambiguity in the choice of a time variable for the statistical ensemble is
removed. Under these hypothesis, we derive the distribution function of
thermodynamic equilibrium, and verify that it reduces to the Boltzmann
distribution in the classical limit. We further show that spacetime curvature
affects physical observables, even far from the source of the metric. Two
examples are analyzed: an ideal gas in Schwarzschild spacetime and a charged
gas in Kerr-Newman spacetime. In the Schwarzschild case, conservation of
macroscopic constraints, such as angular momentum, combined with relativistic
distortion of the distribution function can produce configurations with
decreasing density and growing azimuthal rotation velocity far from the event
horizon of the central mass. In the Kerr-Newman case, it is found that kinetic
energy associated with azimuthal rotations is an increasing function of the
radial coordinate, and it eventually approaches a constant value corresponding
to classical equipartition, even though spatial particle density decreases.

trained on supervised completion tasks and applied on a testing shape, the
network is optimized from scratch on the single testing shape, to fully adapt
to the shape and complete the missing data using contextual guidance from the
known regions. The ability to complete missing data by an untrained neural
network is usually referred to as the deep prior. In this paper, we interpret
the deep prior from a neural tangent kernel (NTK) perspective and show that the
completed shape patches by the trained CNN are naturally similar to existing
patches, as they are proximate in the kernel feature space induced by NTK. The
interpretation allows us to design more efficient network structures and
learning mechanisms for the shape completion and reconstruction task. Being
more aware of structural regularities than both traditional and other

large missing regions with plausible shapes and complements supervised
learning-based methods that use database priors by requiring no extra training
data set and showing flexible adaptation to a particular shape instance.

spinning jumps requires systematic approaches across hardware design, motion
planning, and control. In this paper, we present a new humanoid robot design,
an actuator-aware kino-dynamic motion planner, and a landing controller as part
of a practical system design for highly dynamic motion control of the humanoid
robot. To achieve the impulsive motions, we develop two new proprioceptive
actuators and experimentally evaluate their performance using our
custom-designed dynamometer. The actuator's torque, velocity, and power limits
are reflected in our kino-dynamic motion planner by approximating the
configuration-dependent reaction force limits and in our dynamics simulator by
including actuator dynamics along with the robot's full-body dynamics. For the
landing control, we effectively integrate model-predictive control and
whole-body impulse control by connecting them in a dynamically consistent way
to accomplish both the long-time horizon optimal control and high-bandwidth
full-body dynamics-based feedback. Actuators' torque output over the entire
motion are validated based on the velocity-torque model including battery
voltage droop and back-EMF voltage. With the carefully designed hardware and
control framework, we successfully demonstrate dynamic behaviors such as back
flips, front flips, and spinning jumps in our realistic dynamics simulation.

present friction changes the position of the sonic state into downstream, which
is called chooking. Our goal in this paper is to investigate this phenomena
mathematically. From the mathematical point of view, the friction is different
from normal frictions and difficult to treat with. In spite of its physical
importance, the friction has not received much attention until now. For the
case without friction, the global existence of a solution was obtained by
author. However, for the case with the friction, there are only restrictive
results. The most difficult point is to obtain the bounded estimate of

analyse the statistical properties of the benign traffic in three of the more
recent and relevant NIDS datasets, (CIC, UNSW, ...). As a comparison, we
consider two datasets obtained from real-world production networks, one from a
university network and one from a medium size Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Our results show that the two real-world datasets are quite similar among
themselves in regards to most of the considered statistical features. Equally,
the three synthetic datasets are also relatively similar within their group.
However, and most importantly, our results show a distinct difference of most
of the considered statistical features between the three synthetic datasets and
the two real-world datasets. Since ML relies on the basic assumption of
training and test datasets being sampled from the same distribution, this
raises the question of how well the performance results of ML-classifiers
trained on the considered synthetic datasets can translate and generalise to
real-world networks. We believe this is an interesting and relevant question

to extend few-shot learning strategies to continual learning scenarios. We draw

interdependently updates a pair of fast / slow weights for continual learning

computer vision community. As a common practice, most previous works use
manually annotated 3D box labels, where the annotating process is expensive. In
this paper, we find that the precisely and carefully annotated labels may be
unnecessary in monocular 3D detection, which is an interesting and
counterintuitive finding. Using rough labels that are randomly disturbed, the
detector can achieve very close accuracy compared to the one using the
ground-truth labels. We delve into this underlying mechanism and then
empirically find that: concerning the label accuracy, the 3D location part in
the label is preferred compared to other parts of labels. Motivated by the
conclusions above and considering the precise LiDAR 3D measurement, we propose
a simple and effective framework, dubbed LiDAR point cloud guided monocular 3D
object detection (LPCG). This framework is capable of either reducing the
annotation costs or considerably boosting the detection accuracy without
introducing extra annotation costs. Specifically, It generates pseudo labels
from unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Thanks to accurate LiDAR 3D measurements in
3D space, such pseudo labels can replace manually annotated labels in the
training of monocular 3D detectors, since their 3D location information is
precise. LPCG can be applied into any monocular 3D detector to fully use
massive unlabeled data in a self-driving system. As a result, in KITTI
benchmark, we take the first place on both monocular 3D and BEV
(bird's-eye-view) detection with a significant margin. In Waymo benchmark, our
method using 10% labeled data achieves comparable accuracy to the baseline
detector using 100% labeled data. The codes are released at

recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal

further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure

To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware

learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item

methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three

the sensitivity of deep neural networks under label noise under common loss
functions. Losses that are theoretically robust to label noise, however, often
makes training difficult. Consequently, several recently proposed methods, such
as Meta-Weight-Net (MW-Net), use a small number of unbiased, clean samples to
learn a weighting function that downweights samples that are likely to have
corrupted labels under the meta-learning framework. However, obtaining such a
set of clean samples is not always feasible in practice. In this paper, we
analytically show that one can easily train MW-Net without access to clean
samples simply by using a loss function that is robust to label noise, such as
mean absolute error, as the meta objective to train the weighting network. We
experimentally show that our method beats all existing methods that do not use
clean samples and performs on-par with methods that use gold samples on
benchmark datasets across various noise types and noise rates.

the mechanical behavior of lightweight materials for offshore structures.
Exposure to seawater and cold temperatures are known to degrade the mechanical
properties of several materials, thus, compromising the safety of personnel and
structures. This study aims to investigate the low-velocity impact behavior of
woven carbon/vinyl ester sandwich composites with PVC foam core at low
temperatures for marine applications. The tests were performed in a drop tower
impact system with an in-built environmental chamber. Impact responses, such as
the contact force, displacement and absorbed energy, at four impact energies of
7.5 J, 15 J, 30 J, and 60 J were determined at four in-situ temperatures of 25
C, 0 C, -25 C and -50 C. Results showed that temperature has a significant
influence on the dynamic impact behavior of sandwich composites. The sandwich
composites were rendered stiff and brittle as the temperature decreased, which
has a detrimental effect on their residual strength and durability. For
example, at 60 J for all temperatures, the samples experienced perforation of
the top facing and core, and the back facing exhibited varying extent of
damage. At -25 C and -50 C, the sandwich composite samples were almost
completely perforated. At all impact energies, the sandwich composites were
rendered stiff and brittle as the temperature decreased, which has a
detrimental effect on their residual strength and durability.

unsupervised model for SRL. To decompose the task as two argument related
subtasks, identification and clustering, we propose a pipeline that
correspondingly consists of two neural modules. First, we train a neural model
on two syntax-aware statistically developed rules. The neural model gets the
relevance signal for each token in a sentence, to feed into a BiLSTM, and then
an adversarial layer for noise-adding and classifying simultaneously, thus
enabling the model to learn the semantic structure of a sentence. Then we
propose another neural model for argument role clustering, which is done
through clustering the learned argument embeddings biased towards their
dependency relations. Experiments on CoNLL-2009 English dataset demonstrate
that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline in terms of

the usage of autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection based on
reconstruction loss to show their capabilities, but also their limitations. As
a particle physics benchmark scenario, we study the tagging of top jet images
in a background of QCD jet images. Although we reproduce the positive results
from the literature, we show that the standard autoencoder setup cannot be
considered as a model-independent anomaly tagger by inverting the task: due to
the sparsity and the specific structure of the jet images, the autoencoder
fails to tag QCD jets if it is trained on top jets even in a semi-supervised
setup. Since the same autoencoder architecture can be a good tagger for a
specific example of an anomaly and a bad tagger for a different example, we
suggest improved performance measures for the task of model-independent anomaly
detection. We also improve the capability of the autoencoder to learn
non-trivial features of the jet images, such that it is able to achieve both
top jet tagging and the inverse task of QCD jet tagging with the same setup.
However, we want to stress that a truly model-independent and powerful
autoencoder-based unsupervised jet tagger still needs to be developed.

high penetrating ability, and thus forecasting these >=2 MeV electron levels
has significant meaning to all space sectors. Here we update the latest
development of the predictive model for MeV electrons inside the Earth's outer
radiation belt. The new version, called PreMevE-2E, focuses on forecasting
ultra-relativistic electron flux distributions across the outer radiation belt,
with no need of in-situ measurements except for at the geosynchronous (GEO)
orbit. Model inputs include precipitating electrons observed in
low-Earth-orbits by NOAA satellites, upstream solar wind conditions (speeds and
densities) from solar wind monitors, as well as ultra-relativistic electrons
measured by one Los Alamos GEO satellite. We evaluated a total of 32 supervised
machine learning models that fall into four different classes of linear and

by using groups of top-performing models. All models are individually trained,
validated, and tested by in-situ electron data from NASA's Van Allen Probes

individual models overs L-shells, and this PreMevE-2E model provides reliable

are emerging as a powerful technique for computational imaging. They have shown
superior quality for reconstructing fine textures from badly-distorted images
and have potential to bring next-generation cameras and displays to our daily
life. However, CNNs demand intensive computing power for generating
high-resolution videos and defy conventional sparsity techniques when rendering
dense details. Therefore, finding new possibilities in regular sparsity is
crucial to enable large-scale deployment of CNN-based computational imaging.
  In this paper, we consider a fundamental but yet well-explored approach --
algebraic sparsity -- for energy-efficient CNN acceleration. We propose to
build CNN models based on ring algebra that defines multiplication, addition,
and non-linearity for n-tuples properly. Then the essential sparsity will
immediately follow, e.g. n-times reduction for the number of real-valued
weights. We define and unify several variants of ring algebras into a modeling
framework, RingCNN, and make comparisons in terms of image quality and hardware
complexity. On top of that, we further devise a novel ring algebra which
minimizes complexity with component-wise product and achieves the best quality
using directional ReLU. Finally, we implement an accelerator, eRingCNN, in two
settings, n=2 and 4 (50% and 75% sparsity), with 40 nm technology to support
advanced denoising and super-resolution at up to 4K UHD 30 fps. Layout results
show that they can deliver equivalent 41 TOPS using 3.76 W and 2.22 W,
respectively. Compared to the real-valued counterpart, our ring convolution
engines for n=2 achieve 2.00x energy efficiency and 2.08x area efficiency with
similar or even better image quality. With n=4, the efficiency gains of energy

Here, a word $u=u_1\cdots u_n$ is called a scattered factor of $w$ if $u$ is
obtained from $w$ by deleting parts of $w$, i.e. there exists (possibly empty)
words $v_1,\dots,v_{n+1}$ with $w=v_1u_1v_2\cdots v_nu_nv_{n+1}$. In this work,
we prove two problems, left open in the aforementioned paper, namely a
generalisation of one of their main theorems to arbitrary alphabets and a
slight modification of another theorem such that we characterise the circular
universality by the universality. On the way, we present deep insights into the
behaviour of the remainder of the so called arch factorisation by Hebrard when
repetitions of words are considered.

percussive nature of its timbre, and the contrasting harmonic frequency ranges

rhythmic cycle (theka) in order to mark the salient positions. An analysis of
the loudness dynamics and timing deviations at various cycle positions is an
important part of musicological studies on the expressivity in tabla
accompaniment. To achieve this at a corpus-level, and not restrict it to the
few recordings that manual annotation can afford, it is helpful to have access
to an automatic tabla transcription system. Although a few systems have been
built by training models on labeled tabla strokes, the achieved accuracy does
not necessarily carry over to unseen instruments. In this article, we report
our work towards building an instrument-independent stroke classification
system for accompaniment tabla based on the more easily available tabla solo
audio tracks. We present acoustic features that capture the distinctive
characteristics of tabla strokes and build an automatic system to predict the
label as one of a reduced, but musicologically motivated, target set of four
stroke categories. To address the lack of sufficient labeled training data, we
turn to common data augmentation methods and find the use of pitch-shifting
based augmentation to be most promising. We then analyse the important features
and highlight the problem of their instrument-dependence while motivating the
use of more task-specific data augmentation strategies to improve the diversity

ability to better image two common features that are observed in Earth's
seismic velocity structure: sharp changes in velocities that correspond to
material boundaries, such as the Conrad and Moho discontinuities; and gradual
changes in velocity that are associated with pressure and temperature
distributions in the crust and mantle. We employ different penalty terms in the
vertical and horizontal directions to refine the earthquake tomography. We
utilize a vertical-direction (depth) penalty that takes the form of the l1-sum
of the l2-norms of the second-order differences of the horizontal units in the
vertical direction. This penalty is intended to represent sharp velocity
changes caused by discontinuities by creating a piecewise linear depth profile
of seismic velocity. We set a horizontal-direction penalty term on the basis of
the l2-norm to express gradual velocity tendencies in the horizontal direction,
which has been often used in conventional tomography methods. We use a
synthetic data set to demonstrate that our method provides significant
improvements over velocity structures estimated using conventional methods by
obtaining stable estimates of both steep and gradual changes in velocity.
Furthermore, we apply our proposed method to real seismic data in central Japan

separately measure functional connectivity through fMRI imaging and the
underlying white matter wiring through diffusion imaging. Previous studies have
shown that structural edges in brain networks improve the inference of
functional edges and vice versa. In this paper, we investigate the idea of
coupled networks through an optimization framework by focusing on interactions
between structural edges and functional edges of brain networks. We consider
both types of edges as observed instances of random variables that represent
different underlying network processes. The proposed framework does not depend
on Gaussian assumptions and achieves a more robust performance on general data

leads to a cleaner way of applying network constraints but also provides a more
scalable solution when network connectivity is sparse. We validate our method

Nevertheless, due to the shot noise of the coherent state, the corresponding

order to circumvent this problem, we theoretically propose an alternative

Consequently, when comparing with the previous imaging scheme (using

brain injury risk estimation models are not equally accurate across the variety
of impacts that patients may undergo and the characteristics of different types
of impacts are not well studied. We investigated the spectral characteristics
of different head impact types with kinematics classification. Methods: Data
was analyzed from 3,262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, American
football, mixed martial arts, and publicly available car crash data. A random
forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular
velocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football, car crash,
mixed martial arts). To test the classifier robustness, another 271
lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards.
Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models
were built for brain strain. Results: The classifier reached a median accuracy
of 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. The most
important features in the classification included both low-frequency and
high-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity
features. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectral
densities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral
densities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in the
low-frequency range). The type-specific regression showed a generally higher
R^2-value than baseline models without classification. Conclusion: The
machine-learning-based classifier enables a better understanding of the impact
kinematics spectral density in different sports, and it can be applied to
evaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field data

measurements of the traffic data could exhibit a diverse set of patterns under
different traffic situations. In addition, the existing works assume that all
road segments can employ the same sampling frequency of traffic states, which
is impractical. In this paper, we propose new measurements to model the spatial

Heterogeneous Spatial Correlation (HSC) model to capture the spatial
correlation based on a specific measurement, where the traffic data of varying
road segments can be heterogeneous (i.e. obtained with different sampling
frequency). We propose a Multi-fold Correlation Attention Network (MCAN), which
relies on the HSC model to explore multi-fold spatial correlations and leverage
LSTM networks to capture multi-fold temporal correlations to provide
discriminating features in order to achieve accurate traffic prediction. The

transfer (WPT) systems, where the energy harvester (EH) node is equipped with
multiple nonlinear rectennas. We characterize the optimal transmit strategy by
the optimal distribution of the transmit symbol vector that maximizes the
average harvested power at the EH subject to a constraint on the power budget
of the transmitter. We show that the optimal transmit strategy employs scalar
unit-norm input symbols with arbitrary phase and two beamforming vectors, which
are determined as solutions of a non-convex optimization problem. To solve this
problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a two-dimensional grid
search, semidefinite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. Our
simulation results reveal that the proposed MIMO WPT design significantly
outperforms two baseline schemes based on a linear EH model and a single
beamforming vector, respectively. Finally, we show that the average harvested
power grows linearly with the number of rectennas at the EH node and saturates
for a large number of TX antennas.

Similarly, rule-based dialogue systems require extensive writing and
maintenance of rules and do not scale either. End-to-End dialogue systems, on
the other hand, do not require module-specific annotations but need a large
amount of data for training. To overcome these problems, in this demo, we
present Alexa Conversations, a new approach for building goal-oriented dialogue
systems that is scalable, extensible as well as data efficient. The components
of this system are trained in a data-driven manner, but instead of collecting
annotated conversations for training, we generate them using a novel dialogue
simulator based on a few seed dialogues and specifications of APIs and entities
provided by the developer. Our approach provides out-of-the-box support for
natural conversational phenomena like entity sharing across turns or users
changing their mind during conversation without requiring developers to provide
any such dialogue flows. We exemplify our approach using a simple pizza
ordering task and showcase its value in reducing the developer burden for
creating a robust experience. Finally, we evaluate our system using a typical

studies. The analysis of such data is often complicated due to informative
cluster size, a situation where the outcomes under study are associated with
the size of the cluster. In addition, cause of failure is frequently
incompletely observed in real-world settings. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no methodology for population-averaged analysis with clustered
competing risks data with informative cluster size and missing causes of
failure. To address this problem, we consider the semiparametric marginal
proportional cause-specific hazards model and propose a maximum partial
pseudolikelihood estimator under a missing at random assumption. To make the
latter assumption more plausible in practice, we allow for auxiliary variables
that may be related to the probability of missingness. The proposed method does
not impose assumptions regarding the within-cluster dependence and allows for
informative cluster size. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators
for both regression coefficients and infinite-dimensional parameters, such as
the marginal cumulative incidence functions, are rigorously established.
Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs well and that methods
that ignore the within-cluster dependence and the informative cluster size lead
to invalid inferences. The proposed method is applied to competing risks data
from a large multicenter HIV study in sub-Saharan Africa where a significant
portion of causes of failure is missing.

such descriptors, including pore-size functions and the critical pore radius
$\delta_c$, for four different models: maximally random jammed sphere packings,
overlapping spheres, equilibrium hard spheres, and inherent structures of the
quantizer energy. For precise estimates of the percolation thresholds, we use a
strict relation of the void percolation around sphere configurations to
weighted bond percolation on the corresponding Voronoi networks. We use the
Newman-Ziff algorithm to determine the percolation threshold using universal
properties of the cluster size distribution. Often, $\delta_c$ is used as the
key characteristic length scale that determines the fluid permeability $k$. A
recent study [Torquato. Adv. Wat. Resour. 140, 103565 (2020)] suggested for
porous media with a well-connected pore space an alternative estimate of $k$
based on the second moment of the pore size $\langle\delta^2\rangle$. Here, we
confirm that, for all porosities and all models considered, $\delta_c^2$ is to
a good approximation proportional to $\langle\delta^2\rangle$. However, unlike
$\langle\delta^2\rangle$, the permeability estimate based on $\delta_c^2$ does
not predict the correct ranking of $k$ for our models. Thus, we confirm
$\langle\delta^2\rangle$ to be a promising candidate for convenient and
reliable estimates of $k$ for porous media with a well-connected pore space.
Moreover, we compare the fluid permeability of our models with varying degrees
of order, as measured by the $\tau$ order metric. We find that (effectively)
hyperuniform models tend to have lower values of $k$ than their nonhyperuniform
counterparts. Our findings could facilitate the design of porous media with
desirable transport properties via targeted pore statistics.

improvements in the order of 2 [bit-per-channel-use] per user equipment when
using regularized zero-forcing (RZF). In addition, when including the impact of
power consumption in cell-free Massive MIMO with RZF, allocating low values of
mixed ADC bit resolutions across the BS antennas can increase the energy
efficiency up to 30% compared to equal ADC bit allocation.

typically condensed into a compact body - the nucleoid. This compaction
influences the localization and dynamics of many cellular processes including
transcription, translation, and cell division. Here, we develop a model that
takes into account steric interactions among the components of the Escherichia
coli transcriptional-translational machinery (TTM) and out-of-equilibrium
effects of mRNA transcription, translation, and degradation, in order to
explain many observed features of the nucleoid. We show that steric effects,
due to the different molecular shapes of the TTM components, are sufficient to
drive equilibrium phase separation of the DNA, explaining the formation and
size of the nucleoid. In addition, we show that the observed positioning of the
nucleoid at midcell is due to the out-of-equilibrium process of messenger RNA
(mRNA) synthesis and degradation: mRNAs apply a pressure on both sides of the
nucleoid, localizing it to midcell. We demonstrate that, as the cell grows, the
production of these mRNAs is responsible for the nucleoid splitting into two
lobes, and for their well-known positioning to 1/4 and 3/4 positions on the
long cell axis. Finally, our model quantitatively accounts for the observed
expansion of the nucleoid when the pool of cytoplasmic mRNAs is depleted.
Overall, our study suggests that steric interactions and out-of-equilibrium
effects of the TTM are key drivers of the internal spatial organization of
bacterial cells.

Regions (SFRs) are fainter than expected in CO isotopologue emission. Disks not
detected in 13CO line emission are also faint and often unresolved in the
continuum emission at an angular resolution of around 0.2 arcseconds. Focusing
on the Lupus SFR, the aim of this work is to investigate whether the population
of CO-faint disks comprises radially extended and low mass disks - as commonly
assumed so far - or if it is of intrinsically radially compact disks, an
interpretation that we propose in this paper. The latter scenario was already
proposed for individual sources or small samples of disks, while this work
targets a large population of disks in a single SFR for which statistical
arguments can be made. A new grid of physical-chemical models of compact disks
has been run with DALI in order to cover a region of the parameter space that
had not been explored before with this code. Such models have been compared
with 12CO and 13CO ALMA observations of faint disks in Lupus. Disks that are
not detected in 13CO emission and with faint or undetected 12CO emission are
consistent with compact disk models. For radially compact disk, the emission of
CO isotopologues is mostly optically thick and it scales with the surface area:
i.e., it is fainter for smaller objects. The fraction of compact disks is
potentially between roughly 50% and 60% of the entire Lupus sample. Deeper
observations of 12CO and 13CO at a moderate angular resolution will allow us to
distinguish whether faint disks are intrinsically compact, or if they are
extended but faint, without the need of resolving them. If the fainter end of
the disk population observed by ALMA disk surveys is consistent with such
objects being very compact, this will either create a tension with viscous
spreading or require MHD winds or external processes to truncate the disks.

natural variations that are usually only known at certain locations. Therefore,
we explore a material-oriented approach to digital twins with a particle
representation of the granular media. In digital form, the material is treated
as pseudo-particles, each representing a large collection of real particles of
various sizes, shapes and, mineral properties. Movements and changes in the
state of the material are determined by the combined data from control systems,
sensors, vehicle telematics, and simulation models at locations where no real
sensors can see. The particle-based representation enables material tracking
along the chain of processes. Each digital particle can act as a carrier of
observational data generated by the equipment as it interacts with the real
material. This makes it possible to better learn material properties from
process observations, and to predict the effect on downstream processes. We
test the technique on a mining simulator and demonstrate analysis that can be
performed using data from cross-system material tracking.

network (CNN) to regress a density map, requiring point-level annotations.
However, annotating each person with a point is an expensive and laborious
process. During the testing phase, the point-level annotations are not
considered to evaluate the counting accuracy, which means the point-level
annotations are redundant. Hence, it is desirable to develop weakly-supervised
counting methods that just rely on count-level annotations, a more economical
way of labeling. Current weakly-supervised counting methods adopt the CNN to
regress a total count of the crowd by an image-to-count paradigm. However,
having limited receptive fields for context modeling is an intrinsic limitation
of these weakly-supervised CNN-based methods. These methods thus cannot achieve
satisfactory performance, with limited applications in the real world. The
transformer is a popular sequence-to-sequence prediction model in natural
language processing (NLP), which contains a global receptive field. In this
paper, we propose TransCrowd, which reformulates the weakly-supervised crowd
counting problem from the perspective of sequence-to-count based on
transformers. We observe that the proposed TransCrowd can effectively extract
the semantic crowd information by using the self-attention mechanism of
transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a
pure transformer for crowd counting research. Experiments on five benchmark

our model on our specific real-world dataset for this use-case. Baselined
against a previous solution, consisting of a Mask R-CNN model and suitable
post-processing steps, TetraPackNet achieves superior results (9% higher in
accuracy) in the sub-task of four-corner based transport unit side detection.

attention from the community, recent research argue that its performance will
suffer a cliff fall when the model size decreases. The current method mainly
relies on contrastive learning to train the network and in this work, we
propose a simple yet effective Distilled Contrastive Learning (DisCo) to ease
the issue by a large margin. Specifically, we find the final embedding obtained
by the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and
propose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacher's
knowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the
student to be consistent with that of the teacher. In addition, in the
experiment, we find that there exists a phenomenon termed Distilling BottleNeck
and present to enlarge the embedding dimension to alleviate this problem. Our
method does not introduce any extra parameter to lightweight models during
deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art on all lightweight models. Particularly, when
ResNet-101/ResNet-50 is used as teacher to teach EfficientNet-B0, the linear
result of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet is very close to ResNet-101/ResNet-50,
but the number of parameters of EfficientNet-B0 is only 9.4\%/16.3\% of
ResNet-101/ResNet-50. Code is available at https://github.

high-frequencies, and in particular cases with wide frequency bands. We present
a spatially adaptive progressive encoding (SAPE) scheme for input signals of
MLP networks, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies
without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific
preprocessing. SAPE gradually unmasks signal components with increasing
frequencies as a function of time and space. The progressive exposure of
frequencies is monitored by a feedback loop throughout the neural optimization
process, allowing changes to propagate at different rates among local spatial
portions of the signal space. We demonstrate the advantage of SAPE on a variety
of domains and applications, including regression of low dimensional signals
and images, representation learning of occupancy networks, and a geometric task
of mesh transfer between 3D shapes.

between charge and spin degrees of freedom is still a challenge in the field of

utilized to read out the information stored by various magnetic structures,
which usually originates from atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the
application of AMR in antiferromagnet-based spintronics is still hindered by
rather small AMR value. Here, we discover a colossal AMR effect during the
field-induced metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) in a nearly Dirac material
EuMnSb$_2$ with an antiferromagnetic order of Eu$^{2+}$ moments. The colossal
AMR reaches to an unprecedented value of 1.84$\times$10$^6$% at 2 K, which is
four orders of magnitude larger than previously reported values in
antiferromagnets. Based on density functional theory calculations, a Dirac-like
band structure, which is strongly dependent on SOC, is confirmed around Y point
and dominates the overall transport properties in the present sample with
predominant electron-type carriers. Moreover, it is also revealed that the
indirect band gap around Fermi level is dependent on the magnetic structure of
Eu$^{2+}$ moments, which leads to the field-induced MIT and plays a key role on
the colossal AMR effect. Finally, our present work suggests that the similar
antiferromagnetic topological materials as EuMnSb$_2$, in which Dirac-like
fermions is strongly modulated by SOC and antiferromagnetism, would be a
fertile ground to explore applicably appreciated AMR effect.

fundamental problems in robotics and computer vision. However, the presence of
outliers, sometimes even occupying the great majority of the putative
correspondences, can make many existing algorithms either fail or have very
high computational cost. In this paper, we present RANSIC (RANdom Sampling with
Invariant Compatibility), a fast and highly robust method applicable to both
problems based on a new paradigm combining random sampling with invariance and
compatibility. Generally, RANSIC starts with randomly selecting small subsets
from the correspondence set, then seeks potential inliers as graph vertices
from the random subsets through the compatibility tests of invariants
established in each problem, and eventually returns the eligible inliers when
there exists at least one K-degree vertex (K is automatically updated depending
on the problem) and the residual errors satisfy a certain termination condition
at the same time. In multiple synthetic and real experiments, we demonstrate
that RANSIC is fast for use, robust against over 95% outliers, and also able to
recall approximately 100% inliers, outperforming other state-of-the-art solvers
for both the rotation search and the point cloud registration problems.

regularizers with complementary properties to stabilize the training and

levofloxacin as antibacterial agent. These 3D platforms exhibit controlled and
pH-dependent levofloxacin release, sustained over time at physiological pH

different interaction rate between diverse levofloxacin species and the silica

destroy the bacterial biofilm without cytotoxic effects on human osteoblasts

under-investigated research topic that aims to learn a model of good
performance using unlabeled samples and a few labeled samples in the target
domain, with the help of labeled samples from a source domain. Several SSDA
methods have been proposed recently, which however fail to fully exploit the
value of the few labeled target samples. In this paper, we propose Enhanced
Categorical Alignment and Consistency Learning (ECACL), a holistic SSDA
framework that incorporates multiple mutually complementary domain alignment
techniques. ECACL includes two categorical domain alignment techniques that
achieve class-level alignment, a strong data augmentation based technique that
enhances the model's generalizability and a consistency learning based
technique that forces the model to be robust with image perturbations. These
techniques are applied on one or multiple of the three inputs (labeled source,
unlabeled target, and labeled target) and align the domains from different
perspectives. ECACL unifies them together and achieves fairly comprehensive
domain alignments that are much better than the existing methods: For example,
ECACL raises the state-of-the-art accuracy from 68.4 to 81.1 on VisDA2017 and
from 45.5 to 53.4 on DomainNet for the 1-shot setting. Our code is available at

important privacy features of Online Social Networks (OSNs) as they allow users
to restrict the audience of their publications. Nevertheless, creating and
maintaining custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average OSNs
users since it normally requires assessing the trustworthiness of a large
number of contacts. In principle, community detection algorithms can be
leveraged to support the generation of ACLs by mapping a set of examples (i.e.
contacts labelled as untrusted) to the emerging communities inside the user's
ego-network. However, unlike users' access-control preferences, traditional
community-detection algorithms do not take the homophily characteristics of
such communities into account (i.e. attributes shared among members).
Consequently, this strategy may lead to inaccurate ACL configurations and
privacy breaches under certain homophily scenarios. This work investigates the
use of community-detection algorithms for the automatic generation of ACLs in
OSNs. Particularly, it analyses the performance of the aforementioned approach
under different homophily conditions through a simulation model. Furthermore,
since private information may reach the scope of untrusted recipients through
the re-sharing affordances of OSNs, information diffusion processes are also
modelled and taken explicitly into account. Altogether, the removal of
gatekeeper nodes is further explored as a strategy to counteract unwanted data
dissemination.

Twitter, allowing investigations of changes in interest over time. This study
analysed English-language Covid-19 tweets mentioning cures, treatments, or
vaccines from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2021, seeking trends and international
differences. The results have methodological limitations but show a tendency
for countries with a lower human development index score to tweet more about
cures, although they were a minor topic for all countries. Vaccines were
discussed about as much as treatments until July 2020, when they generated more
interest because of developments in Russia. The November 2020 Pfizer-BioNTech
preliminary Phase 3 trials results generated an immediate and sustained sharp
increase, however, followed by a continuing roughly linear increase in interest
for vaccines until at least April 2021. Against this background, national
deviations from the average were triggered by country-specific news about
cures, treatments or vaccines. Nevertheless, interest in vaccines in all
countries increased in parallel to some extent, despite substantial
international differences in national regulatory approval and availability. The
results also highlight that unsubstantiated claims about alternative medicine
remedies gained traction in several countries, apparently posing a threat to
public health.

soundings over tropical oceans and applies it to sounding data from the EUREC4A
field campaign, which took place south and east of Barbados in January-February
2020. The proposed method exploits the fact that the air in a cold pool is
denser than the air above it. It leads us to define cold pool soundings as
those for which the mixed-layer height is smaller than 400 m. We first test
this criterion by verifying its consistency with surface temperature and
precipitation in a realistic high-resolution simulation over the western
tropical Atlantic. Applying it to EUREC4A data, we then identify 7% of EUREC4A
dropsondes and radiosondes as cold pool soundings. In two selected case
studies, we find that cold pools soundings coincide with mesoscale cloud arcs
and temperature drops in the surface time series. Statistics for the entire
campaign further characterize the signature of cold pools in temperature,
humidity and wind profiles. In the presence of wind shear, we show in
particular that the spreading of cold pools is favored downshear, suggesting
downward momentum transport by unsaturated downdrafts. These results support
the robustness of our simple method in different environmental conditions and
illustrate the new insights it offers for the characterization of cold pools
and their environment.

To quantify
the degree of this Fock space localization, the multifractal dimension $D_q$ is
employed; it has been claimed that $D_q$ shows a jump from the delocalized
value $D_q=1$ in the ETH phase (ETH: eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) to a
smaller value $0<D_q<1$ at the ETH-MBL transition, yet exhibiting a conspicuous
discrepancy from the fully localized value $D_q=0$, which indicate that
multifractality remains inside the MBL phase. Here, to better quantify the
situation we employ, instead of the commonly used computational basis, the
one-particle density matrix (OPDM) and use its eigenstates (natural orbitals)
as a Fock state basis for representing many-body eigenstates $|\psi\rangle$ of
the system. Using this basis, we compute $D_q$ and other indices quantifying
the Fock space localization, such as the local purity $S$, which is derived
from the occupation spectrum $\{n_\alpha\}$ (eigenvalues of the OPDM). We
highlight the statistical distribution of Hamming distance $x_{\mu\nu}$
occurring in the pair-wise coefficients $|a_\mu|^2|a_\nu|^2$ in $S$, and
compare this with a related quantity considered in the literature.

symbiotic radio (SR) system architecture consisting of a transmitter, an IRS,

Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely,
commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for
decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate
(BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active
beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a
minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a
penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where
semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts
are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods,
respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method,
successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to
develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally
optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to
achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.

current density as low as 1.68(3.27) MAcm-2. The spin-orbit field value
increases with decrease of beta-W layer thickness, which affirms that epitaxial
surface states are responsible for the extraordinary large efficiency. SOT
induced energy efficient in-plane magnetization switching in large 20x100 um2

supported by results from micromagnetic simulations. The observed giant SOT

further clarify the nature of density-wave-like transition in these kagome

measurements on the CsV3Sb5 single crystal. A first-order phase transition
associated with orbital ordering is revealed by observing a sudden splitting of
orbital shift in 51V NMR spectrum at the structural transition temperature Ts ~
94 K. In contrast, the quadrupole splitting from a charge-density-wave (CDW)
order on 51V NMR spectrum only appears gradually below Ts with a typical
second-order transition behavior, suggesting that the CDW order is a secondary
electronic order. Moreover, combined with 133Cs NMR spectrum, the present
result also confirms a three-dimensional structural modulation with a 2ax2ax2c
period. Above Ts, the temperature-dependent Knight shift and nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) further indicate the existence of
remarkable magnetic fluctuations from vanadium 3d orbitals, which are
suppressed due to orbital ordering below Ts. The present results strongly

owners and solve data privacy issues, federated learning is receiving wide
attention. Using the edge server as an intermediary can effectively collect
sensor data, perform local model training, and upload model parameters for
global aggregation. So this paper proposes a new framework for resource
allocation in a hierarchical network supported by edge computing. In this
framework, we minimize the weighted sum of system cost and learning cost by
optimizing bandwidth, computing frequency, power allocation and subcarrier
assignment. To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem, we
first decouple the bandwidth optimization problem(P1) from the whole problem
and obtain a closed-form solution. The remaining computational frequency,
power, and subcarrier joint optimization problem(P2) can be further decomposed
into two sub-problems: latency and computational frequency optimization
problem(P3) and transmission power and subcarrier optimization problem(P4). P3
is a convex optimization problem that is easy to solve. In the joint
optimization problem(P4), the optimal power under each subcarrier selection can
be obtained first through the successive convex approximation(SCA) algorithm.
Substituting the optimal power value obtained back to P4, the subproblem can be
regarded as an assignment problem, so the Hungarian algorithm can be
effectively used to solve it. The solution of problem P2 is accomplished by
solving P3 and P4 iteratively. To verify the performance of the algorithm, we
compare the proposed algorithm with five algorithms; namely Equal bandwidth
allocation, Learning cost guaranteed, Greedy subcarrier allocation, System cost
guaranteed and Time-biased algorithm. Numerical results show the significant
performance gain and the robustness of the proposed algorithm in the face of
parameter changes.

Smart contracts, in a nutshell, are digitally executed contracts wherein some
parties execute a common goal. The main problem with most of the current smart
contracts is that there is no privacy for a party's input to the contract from
either the blockchain or the other parties. Our research builds on the Hawk
project that provides transaction privacy along with support for smart
contracts. However, Hawk relies on a special trusted party known as a manager,
which must be trusted not to leak each party's input to the smart contract. In
this paper, we present a practical private smart contract protocol that
replaces the manager with an MPC protocol such that the function to be executed
by the MPC protocol is relatively lightweight, involving little overhead added
to the smart contract function, and uses practical sigma protocols and
homomorphic commitments to prove to the blockchain that the sum of the incoming

  the frozen-training SpaRTA algorithm of [1].
  Corrections for the Reynolds stress tensor and the production of transported
turbulent quantities of a baseline linear eddy viscosity model (LEVM) are
expressed as functions of tensor polynomials selected from a library of
candidate functions. The CFD-driven training consists in solving a blackbox
optimization problem in which the fitness of candidate EARSM models is
evaluated by running RANS simulations. Unlike the frozen-training approach, the
proposed methodology is not restricted to data sets for which full fields of
high-fidelity data are available. However, the solution of a high-dimensional
expensive blackbox function optimization problem is required. Several steps are
then undertaken to reduce the associated computational burden. First, a
sensitivity analysis is used to identify the most influential terms and to
reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Afterwards, the Constrained
Optimization using Response Surface (CORS) algorithm, which approximates the
black-box cost function using a response surface constructed from a limited
number of CFD solves, is used to find the optimal model parameters. Model
discovery and cross-validation is performed for three configurations of 2D
turbulent separated flows in channels of variable section using different sets
of training data to show the flexibility of the method. The discovered models
are then applied to the prediction of an unseen 2D separated flow with higher
Reynolds number and different geometry. The predictions for the new case are
shown to be not only more accurate than the baseline LEVM, but also of a

Preprocessing based defenses could largely remove adversarial noise by
processing inputs. However, they are typically affected by the error
amplification effect, especially in the front of continuously evolving attacks.
To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to remove adversarial noise by
implementing a self-supervised adversarial training mechanism in a class
activation feature space. To be specific, we first maximize the disruptions to
class activation features of natural examples to craft adversarial examples.
Then, we train a denoising model to minimize the distances between the
adversarial examples and the natural examples in the class activation feature
space. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method could significantly
enhance adversarial robustness in comparison to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, especially against unseen adversarial attacks and adaptive attacks.

protection methods have been proposed. However, most of the existing
watermarking methods focus on verifying the copyright of the model, which do
not support the authentication and management of users' fingerprints, thus can
not satisfy the requirements of commercial copyright protection. In addition,
the query modification attack which was proposed recently can invalidate most
of the existing backdoor-based watermarking methods. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a method to protect the intellectual
properties of DNN models by using an additional class and steganographic
images. Specifically, we use a set of watermark key samples to embed an
additional class into the DNN, so that the watermarked DNN will classify the
watermark key sample as the predefined additional class in the copyright
verification stage. We adopt the least significant bit (LSB) image
steganography to embed users' fingerprints into watermark key images. Each user
will be assigned with a unique fingerprint image so that the user's identity
can be authenticated later. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed
method can protect the copyright of DNN models effectively. On Fashion-MNIST

and 100% fingerprint authentication success rate. In addition, the proposed
method is demonstrated to be robust to the model fine-tuning attack, model
pruning attack, and the query modification attack. Compared with three existing
watermarking methods (the logo-based, noise-based, and adversarial frontier
stitching watermarking methods), the proposed method has better performance on
watermark accuracy and robustness against the query modification attack.

micro pension programme is one of the safety nets for poor people. To become
eligible for this benefit, each person must have an income that is less than a
quarter of the Brazilian minimum monthly wage and be either over 65 or
considered disabled. That minimum income corresponds to approximately $2$
dollars per day. This paper analyses quantitatively some aspects of this
programme in the Public Pension System of Brazil. We look for the impact of
some particular economic variables on the number of people receiving the
benefit, and seek if that impact significantly differs among the 27 Brazilian
Federal Units. We search for heterogeneity. We perform regression and spatial
cluster analysis for detection of geographical grouping. We use a database that
includes the entire population that receives the benefit. Afterwards, we
calculate the amount that the system spends with the beneficiaries, estimate
values \textit{per capita} and the weight of each UF, searching for
heterogeneity reflected on the amount spent \textit{per capita}. In this latter

geometry of the space in which it exists and the forces it experiences. We
explore by experiments and theoretical analysis, the morphological phase-space
of a filament confined to the surface of a spherical bubble. The morphology is
controlled by varying bending stiffness and weight of the filament, and its
length relative to the bubble radius. When the dominant considerations are
geometry of confinement and elastic energy, the filament lies along a geodesic
and when gravitational energy becomes significant, a bifurcation occurs, with a
part of the filament occupying a longitude and the rest along a curve
approximated by a latitude. Far beyond the transition, when the filament is
much longer than the diameter, it coils around the selected latitudinal region.
A simple model with filament shape as a composite of two arcs captures the
transition well and for better quantitative agreement with the subcritical
nature of bifurcation, we study the morphology by numerical energy
minimization. Our analysis of filament's morphological space spanned by a
geometric parameter, and one that compares elastic energy with body forces, may
provide guidance for packing slender structures on complex surfaces.

propositional intuitionistic logic, first-order intuitionistic logic with
non-constant domains and first-order intuitionistic logic with constant
domains. It is shown that Fitting's nested calculi naturally arise from their
corresponding labelled calculi--for each of the aforementioned logics--via the
elimination of structural rules in labelled derivations. The translational
correspondence between the two types of systems is leveraged to show that the
nested calculi inherit proof-theoretic properties from their associated
labelled calculi, such as completeness, invertibility of rules and cut
admissibility. Since labelled calculi are easily obtained via a logic's
semantics, the method presented in this paper can be seen as one whereby
refined versions of labelled calculi (containing nested calculi as fragments)
with favourable properties are derived directly from a logic's semantics.

framework suffers from biased classification due to incomplete construction of
sample pairs with the foreground prototype only. To address this issue, in this
paper, we introduce a complementary self-contrastive task into few-shot
semantic segmentation. Our new model is able to associate the pixels in a
region with the prototype of this region, no matter they are in the foreground
or background. To this end, we generate self-contrastive background prototypes
directly from the query image, with which we enable the construction of
complete sample pairs and thus a complementary and auxiliary segmentation task
to achieve the training of a better segmentation model. Extensive experiments

proposal. At no expense of inference efficiency, our model achieves
state-of-the results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings for few-shot semantic

However, the formation of the mature third body is largely uncharted territory

body initially consisting of particles acting as roller bearings transitions
into a shear-band-like state by forming adhesive bridges between the particles.
Using large-scale atomistic simulations on a brittle model material, we find
that this transition is controlled by the growth and increasing disorganization
of the particles with increasing sliding distance. Sliding resistance and wear
rate are at first controlled by the surface roughness, but upon agglomeration
wear stagnates and friction becomes solely dependent on the real contact area
in accordance with the plasticity theory of contact by Bowden and Tabor.

retained as persistent spiking activity of cortical neural networks. Yet, how
this activity is related to changes in the oscillatory profile observed during
WM tasks remains an open issue. We explore joint effects of input gamma-band
oscillations and noise on the dynamics of several firing rate models of WM. The
considered models have a metastable active regime, i.e. they demonstrate
long-lasting transient post-stimulus firing rate elevation. We start from a
single excitatory-inhibitory circuit and demonstrate that either gamma-band or
noise input could stabilize the active regime, thus supporting WM retention. We
then consider a system of two circuits with excitatory intercoupling. We find
that fast coupling allows for better stabilization by common noise compared to
independent noise and stronger amplification of this effect by in-phase gamma
inputs compared to anti-phase inputs. Finally, we consider a multi-circuit
system comprised of two clusters, each containing a group of circuits receiving
a common noise input and a group of circuits receiving independent noise. Each
cluster is associated with its own local gamma generator, so all its circuits
receive gamma-band input in the same phase. We find that gamma-band input
differentially stabilizes the activity of the ""common-noise"" groups compared to
the ""independent-noise"" groups. If the inter-cluster connections are fast, this
effect is more pronounced when the gamma-band input is delivered to the
clusters in the same phase rather than in the anti-phase. Assuming that the
common noise comes from a large-scale distributed WM representation, our
results demonstrate that local gamma oscillations can stabilize the activity of
the corresponding parts of this representation, with stronger effect for fast
long-range connections and synchronized gamma oscillations.

are intended to tackle the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF), which
occurs for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when sequentially training them on
successive sub-tasks. GMR mitigates CF by generating samples from previous
tasks and merging them with current training data. GMMs serve several purposes
here: sample generation, density estimation (e.g., for detecting outliers or
recognizing task boundaries) and providing a high-level feature representation
for classification. GMR has several conceptual advantages over existing
replay-based CL approaches. First of all, GMR achieves sample generation,
classification and density estimation in a single network structure with
strongly reduced memory requirements. Secondly, it can be trained at constant
time complexity w.r.t. the number of sub-tasks, making it particularly suitable
for life-long learning. Furthermore, GMR minimizes a differentiable loss
function and seems to avoid mode collapse. In addition, task boundaries can be
detected by applying GMM density estimation. Lastly, GMR does not require
access to sub-tasks lying in the future for hyper-parameter tuning, allowing CL
under real-world constraints. We evaluate GMR on multiple image datasets, which
are divided into class-disjoint sub-tasks.

studied as a resource for metrology and quantum computation. Finding reliable
and effective methods for assessing its presence is then highly desirable.
Coherence witnesses rely on measuring observables whose outcomes can guarantee
that a state is not diagonal in a known reference basis. Here we experimentally
measure a novel type of coherence witness that uses pairwise state comparisons
to identify superpositions in a basis-independent way. Our experiment uses a
single interferometric set-up to simultaneously measure the three pairwise
overlaps among three single-photon states via Hong-Ou-Mandel tests. Besides
coherence witnesses, we show the measurements also serve as a Hilbert-space
dimension witness. Our results attest to the effectiveness of pooling many
two-state comparison tests to ascertain various relational properties of a set
of quantum states.

self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates, possibly representing dark matter
halos, experience a process of gravitational cooling and violent relaxation. We
propose a heuristic parametrization of this complicated process in the spirit
of Lynden-Bell's theory of violent relaxation for collisionless stellar
systems. We derive a generalized wave equation (that was introduced
phenomenologically in [P.H. Chavanis, Eur. Phys. J. Plus {\bf 132}, 248
(2017)]) involving a logarithmic nonlinearity associated with an effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ and a damping term associated with a friction $\xi$.
These terms can be obtained from a maximum entropy production principle and are
linked by a form of Einstein relation expressing the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. The wave equation satisfies an $H$-theorem for the Lynden-Bell entropy
and relaxes towards a stable equilibrium state which is a maximum of entropy at
fixed mass and energy. This equilibrium state represents the most probable
state of a Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halo. It generically has a
core-halo structure. The quantum core prevents gravitational collapse and may
solve the core-cusp problem. The isothermal halo leads to flat rotation curves
in agreement with the observations. These results are consistent with the
phenomenology of dark matter halos. Furthermore, as shown in a previous paper
[P.H. Chavanis, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 100}, 123506 (2019)], the maximization of
entropy with respect to the core mass at fixed total mass and total energy
determines a core mass--halo mass relation which agrees with the relation
obtained in direct numerical simulations. We stress the importance of using a
microcanonical description instead of a canonical one. We also explain how our
formalism can be applied to the case of fermionic dark matter halos.

reduced-state Bellman optimality equation. Specifically, in the case that the
closed-loop system is almost surely controllable, we show that the optimal
control solution always exists and is unique. In the case that MIMO fading
channels and the random access of the remote controller destroy the closed-loop
controllability, we propose a novel controllable and uncontrollable positive
semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition induced by the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of the MIMO fading channel contaminated control input
matrix. Based on the decomposed fine-grained reduced-state Bellman optimality
equation, we further propose a closed-form sufficient condition for both the

clustering (MVC) has drawn increasing attentions recently. In this field, one
of the most crucial challenges is that the characteristics and qualities of
different views usually vary extensively. Therefore, it is essential for MVC
methods to find an effective approach that handles the diversity of multiple
views appropriately. To this end, a series of MVC methods focusing on how to
integrate the loss from each view have been proposed in the past few years.
Among these methods, the mainstream idea is assigning weights to each view and
then combining them linearly. In this paper, inspired by the effectiveness of
non-linear combination in instance learning and the auto-weighted approaches,
we propose Non-Linear Fusion for Self-Paced Multi-View Clustering (NSMVC),
which is totally different from the the conventional linear-weighting
algorithms. In NSMVC, we directly assign different exponents to different views
according to their qualities. By this way, the negative impact from the corrupt
views can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, to address the non-convex issue
of the MVC model, we further define a novel regularizer-free modality of
Self-Paced Learning (SPL), which fits the proposed non-linear model perfectly.
Experimental results on various real-world data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

discrete and locally non-discrete dynamics. For an open set in parameter space,
$\mathcal{N} \subset \mathbb{C}^4$, we show that there simultaneously exists an
open set in $S_{A,B,C,D}$ on which $\Gamma_{A,B,C,D}$ acts locally discretely
and a second open set in $S_{A,B,C,D}$ on which $\Gamma_{A,B,C,D}$ acts locally
non-discretely. After removing a countable union of real-algebraic
hypersurfaces from $\mathcal{N}$ we show that $\Gamma_{A,B,C,D}$ simultaneously
exhibits a non-empty Fatou set and also a Julia set having non-trivial
interior. The open set $\mathcal{N}$ contains a natural family of parameters
previously studied by Dubrovin-Mazzocco.
  The interplay between the Fatou/Julia dichotomy and the locally
discrete/non-discrete dichotomy plays a major theme in this paper and seems
bound to play an important role in further dynamical studies of holomorphic
automorphism groups.

non-adiabatic pulsation models. Furthermore, we combine ground-based WASP and
Kepler space photometry, and measure a linear change in period of order
$\dot{P}/P \simeq 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ for both the fundamental and first
overtone radial modes across a time base of several years, which is at least
two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by evolution models, and is the

calibration measures for risk models predicting a discrete ordinal outcome, and
investigated the impact of the proportional odds assumption on calibration and
overfitting. We studied the multinomial, cumulative, adjacent category,
continuation ratio, and stereotype logit/logistic models. To assess
calibration, we investigated calibration intercepts and slopes, calibration
plots, and the estimated calibration index. Using large sample simulations, we
studied the performance of models for risk estimation under various conditions,
assuming that the true model has either a multinomial logistic form or a
cumulative logit proportional odds form. Small sample simulations were used to
compare the tendency for overfitting between models. As a case study, we
developed models to diagnose the degree of coronary artery disease (five
categories) in symptomatic patients. When the true model was multinomial
logistic, proportional odds models often yielded poor risk estimates, with
calibration slopes deviating considerably from unity even on large model
development datasets. The stereotype logistic model improved the calibration
slope, but still provided biased risk estimates for individual patients. When
the true model had a cumulative logit proportional odds form, multinomial
logistic regression provided biased risk estimates, although these biases were
modest. Non-proportional odds models require more parameters to be estimated
from the data, and hence suffered more from overfitting. Despite larger sample
size requirements, we generally recommend multinomial logistic regression for
risk prediction modeling of discrete ordinal outcomes.

signal-loss possible on scales approaching planetary size). Derived abundances
will differ if PH3 occupies restricted altitudes - molecules in the clouds will
contribute significantly less absorption at line-centre than equivalent numbers
of mesospheric molecules - but in the latter zone, PH3 lifetime is expected to
be short. Given we recover phosphine, we suggest possible solutions (requiring
substantial further testing): a small collisional broadening coefficient could
give narrow lines from lower altitude, or a high eddy diffusion coefficient

the Hartree-Fock approximation and the slave boson approach including
correlations. The criterium for the metal-insulator transition in the Slater
scenario is formulated using an analytical free-energy expansion in the
next-nearest-neighbor transfer integral $t'$ and in direct antiferromagnetic
gap $\Delta$. The correlation effects are generally demonstrated to favor the
first-order transition. For a square lattice with a strong van Hove
singularity, accidental close degeneracy of antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic
phases is analytically found in a wide parameter region. As a result, there
exists an interval of $t'$ values for which the metal-insulator transition is
of the first order due to the existence of the van Hove singularity. This
interval is very sensitive to model parameters (direct exchange integral) or
external parameters. For the simple and body-centered cubic lattices, the
transition from the insulator antiferromagnetic state with increasing $t'$
occurs to the phase of an antiferromagnetic metal and is a second-order
transition which is followed by a transition to a paramagnetic metal. These
results are quantitatively modified when taking into account the intersite

revealed. With synchrotron radiation, temperature and time resolutions
comparable to calorimetric experiments are possible. This opens hitherto
unavailable experimental possibilities allowing to unambiguously correlate
changes in atomic configuration and structure to calorimetrically observed

relaxations ({\alpha}-, {\beta}- and {\gamma}-transition) in glassy materials.
The results suggest that the structural footprint of the {\beta}-transition is
related to entropic relaxation with characteristics of a first-order
transition. Dynamic mechanical analysis data shows that in the range of the
{\beta}-transition, non-reversible structural rearrangements are preferentially
activated. The low-temperature {\gamma}-transition is mostly triggering
reversible deformations and shows a change of slope in the entropic footprint

hydrodynamic equations of rotating and stably stratified fluids in which the
action of the Coriolis acceleration along the direction of the entropy and
chemical stratifications is neglected because it is weak in comparison with the
buoyancy force. The dependent variables in the equations for the dynamics of
gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) then become separable into radial and horizontal
parts as in the non-rotating case. The TAR is built on the assumptions that the
star is spherical (i.e. its centrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly
rotating. We study the feasibility of carrying out a generalisation of the TAR
to account for the centrifugal acceleration in the case of strongly deformed
uniformly and rapidly rotating stars (and planets), and to identify the
validity domain of this approximation. We built analytically a complete
formalism that allows the study of the dynamics of GIWs in spheroidal
coordinates which take into account the flattening of rapidly rotating stars by
assuming the hierarchies of frequencies adopted within the TAR in the spherical
case and by deriving a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal
eigenfunctions of the GIWs and their asymptotic wave periods, which can be used
to probe the structure and dynamics of rotating deformed stars with
asteroseismology. Using 2D ESTER stellar models, we determine the validity
domain of the generalised TAR as a function of the rotation rate of the star
normalised by its critical angular velocity and its pseudo-radius. This
generalisation allows us to study the signature of the centrifugal effects on
GIWs in rapidly rotating deformed stars. We found that the effects of the
centrifugal acceleration in rapidly rotating early-type stars on GIWs are
theoretically detectable in modern space photometry using observations from
Kepler.

excited in metal films, the electromagnetic field components of the evanescent
SPP mode propagating along the long axis ($x$ axis) of the NW can decay along
two longitudinal planes ($x$-$y$ and $x$-$z$ planes), resulting in two

the longitudinal plane ($x$-$y$) reveals spin dependent biasing of the signal

how a chemically prepared plasmonic AgNW can be harnessed to study optical

Intriguingly, while the electron mobility of the TiOxDy increases by an order

  Version",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, a learning-aided content-based wireless image transmission
scheme is proposed, where a multi-antenna-aided source wishes to securely
deliver an image to a legitimate destination in the presence of randomly
distributed eavesdroppers (Eves). We take into account the fact that not all
regions of an image have the same importance from the security perspective.
Hence, we propose a transmission scheme, where the source employs a hybrid
method to realize both the error-free data delivery of public regions
containing less-important pixels; and an artificial noise (AN)-aided
transmission scheme to provide security for the regions containing large amount
of information. Moreover, in order to reinforce system's security,
fountain-based packet delivery is adopted: First, the source node encodes image
packets into fountain-like packets prior to sending them over the air. The
secrecy of our proposed scheme will be achieved if the legitimate destination
correctly receives the entire image source packets, while conforming to the
latency limits of the system, before Eves can obtain the important regions.
Accordingly, the secrecy performance of our scheme is characterized by deriving
the closed-form expression for the quality-of-security (QoSec) violation
probability. Moreover, our proposed wireless image delivery scheme leverages
the deep neural network (DNN) and learns to maintain optimized transmission
parameters, while achieving a low QoSec violation probability. Simulation
results are provided with some useful engineering insights which illustrate
that our proposed learning-assisted scheme outperforms the state-of-the-arts by
achieving considerable gains in terms of security and the delay requirement.

development due to Mishchenko, Khaled and Richt\'{a}rik (2020), in this work we
provide the first analysis of SVRG under Random Reshuffling (RR-SVRG) for
general finite-sum problems. First, we show that RR-SVRG converges linearly
with the rate $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3/2})$ in the strongly-convex case, and can
be improved further to $\mathcal{O}(\kappa)$ in the big data regime (when $n >
\mathcal{O}(\kappa)$), where $\kappa$ is the condition number. This improves
upon the previous best rate $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2)$ known for a variance
reduced RR method in the strongly-convex case due to Ying, Yuan and Sayed

Third, we establish similar fast rates for Cyclic-SVRG and Shuffle-Once-SVRG.

time of exact solvers, deep learning techniques have been used in recent years
as an end-to-end approach to find solutions. However, there are issues of
representation, generalisation, complex architectures, interpretability of
models for mathematical analysis etc. using deep learning techniques. As a
compromise, machine learning can be used to improve the run time performance of
exact algorithms in a matheuristics framework. In this paper, we use a pruning
heuristic leveraging machine learning as a pre-processing step followed by an
exact Integer Programming approach. We apply this approach to sparsify
instances of the classical travelling salesman problem. Our approach learns
which edges in the underlying graph are unlikely to belong to an optimal
solution and removes them, thus sparsifying the graph and significantly
reducing the number of decision variables. We use carefully selected features
derived from linear programming relaxation, cutting planes exploration,
minimum-weight spanning tree heuristics and various other local and statistical
analysis of the graph. Our learning approach requires very little training data
and is amenable to mathematical analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can
reliably prune a large fraction of the variables in TSP instances from
TSPLIB/MATILDA (>85%$) while preserving most of the optimal tour edges. Our
approach can successfully prune problem instances even if they lie outside the
training distribution, resulting in small optimality gaps between the pruned
and original problems in most cases. Using our learning technique, we discover
novel heuristics for sparsifying TSP instances, that may be of independent
interest for variants of the vehicle routing problem.

product spread in a population is usually modeled as a process of social
contagion, in which the agents of a social system can infect their neighbors on
the underlying network of social contacts. More recently, various models have
also been proposed to reproduce the typical dynamics of a process of discovery,
in which an agent explores a space of relations between ideas or items in
search for novelties. In both types of processes, the structure of the
underlying networks, respectively, the network of social contacts in the first
case, and the network of relations among items in the second one, plays a
fundamental role. However, the two processes have been traditionally seen and
studied independently. Here, we provide a brief overview of the existing models

all the fields of remote sensing (RS) and earth observation (EO). This has
allowed the rapid development of new procedures to solve problems affecting
these sectors. In this context, this work aims at presenting a novel method for
filtering speckle noise from Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) data by
applying deep learning (DL) algorithms, based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The paper provides an easy yet very effective approach to extract the
large amount of training data needed for DL approaches in this challenging
case. The experimental results on simulated speckled images and an actual SAR
dataset show a clear improvement with respect to the state of the art in terms
of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM),
equivalent number of looks (ENL), proving the effectiveness of the proposed

configurations at test time, and can be applied to a variety of robots. Second,
we experimentally demonstrate the importance of the robot parametrization for
the iterative pose updates and design a parametrization strategy that is

solid-state chemistry and condensed matter physics. Still, the joint
understanding of their two main subgroups-halides and oxides-has not been fully
developed. Indeed, unlike the case that compounds having a single repeated
motif (""monomorphous""), certain cubic perovskites can manifest a non-thermal
distribution of local motifs (""polymorphous networks""). Such intrinsic
deformations can include positional degrees of freedom. Unlike thermal motion,
such intrinsic distortions do not time-average to zero. The present study
compares electronic structure features of oxide and halide perovskites starting
from the intrinsic polymorphous network described by DFT minimization of the
internal energy, continuing to finite temperature thermal disorder using AIMD.
We find that (i) different oxide vs. halide ABX$_3$ compounds adopt different
energy-lowering distortion modes. The DFT calculated pair distribution function
(PDF) of SrTiO$_3$ agrees with the recently measured PDF. (ii) In both oxides
and halides, such intrinsic distortions lead to bandgap blueshifts with respect
to monomorphous structure. (iii) For oxide perovskites, high-temperature AIMD
simulations initiated from the polymorphous structures reveal that the
thermally-induced distortions can lead to a bandgap redshift. (iv) In contrast,
for cubic CsPbI$_3$, both the intrinsic distortions and the thermal distortions
contribute in tandem to bandgap blueshift, the former, intrinsic effect being
dominant. (v) In the oxide SrTiO$_3$ and CaTiO$_3$ (but not in halide),
octahedral tilting leads to the emergence of a distinct $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$
direct bandgap component as a secondary valley minimum to the well-known
indirect R-$\Gamma$ gap. Understanding such intrinsic vs. thermal effects on
oxide vs. halide perovskites holds the potential for designing target
electronic properties.

optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams, we also estimated the
cluster age, distance and reddening. The luminosity of the RGB-bump was also
determined. This study indicates that the extinction coefficient in the bulge,
in the direction of the cluster has a value ($R_V=2.7$) that is significantly
smaller than that traditionally used for the Galaxy ($R_V=3.1$). The
corresponding best-fit values of the age, distance and color excess of NGC 6440

that the probability density converges to a nonequilibrium stationary state
(NESS). In addition, the approach to the stationary state exhibits a dynamical
phase transition, which can be interpreted as a traveling front separating
spatial regions for which the probability density has relaxed to the NESS from
those where it has not. One can establish the existence of the phase transition
by carrying out an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution. In this paper we
develop an alternative, direct method for characterizing the approach to the
NESS of a stochastic process with resetting that is based on the calculation of
the so-called accumulation time. The latter is the analog of the mean first
passage time of a search process, in which the survival probability density is
replaced by an accumulation fraction density. In the case of one-dimensional
Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, we derive the asymptotic formula
$|x-x_0|\approx \sqrt{4rD}T(x)$ for $|x-x_0|\gg\sqrt{D/r}$, where $T(x)$ is the
accumulation time at $x$, $r$ is the constant resetting rate, $D$ is the
diffusivity and $x_0$ is the reset point. This is identical in form to the
traveling front condition for the dynamical phase transition. We also derive an
analogous result for diffusion in higher spatial dimensions and for
non-Poissonian resetting. We then consider the effects of delays such as
refractory periods and finite return times. In both cases we establish that the
asymptotic behavior of $T(x)$ is independent of the delays. Finally, we extend
the analysis to a run-and-tumble particle with resetting. We thus establish the
accumulation time of a stochastic process with resetting as a useful quantity
for characterizing the approach to an NESS (if it exists) that is relatively
straightforward to calculate.

information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing
methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of
dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of
them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and
width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this
paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon
contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear
images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the
restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away
from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering
trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing
network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup
operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from
preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to
improve the network's transformation capability, respectively. We term our
dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net.

our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released in

systems and have been widely used in route guidance, emerging mobility
services, and advanced traffic management systems. With the availability of
massive traffic data, neural network-based deep learning methods, especially
the graph convolutional networks (GCN) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in mining spatio-temporal information and achieving high prediction
accuracy. Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of GCN under adversarial
attacks, while there is a lack of studies to understand the vulnerability
issues of the GCN-based traffic prediction models. Given this, this paper
proposes a new task -- diffusion attack, to study the robustness of GCN-based
traffic prediction models. The diffusion attack aims to select and attack a
small set of nodes to degrade the performance of the entire prediction model.
To conduct the diffusion attack, we propose a novel attack algorithm, which
consists of two major components: 1) approximating the gradient of the
black-box prediction model with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic
Approximation (SPSA); 2) adapting the knapsack greedy algorithm to select the
attack nodes. The proposed algorithm is examined with three GCN-based traffic
prediction models: St-Gcn, T-Gcn, and A3t-Gcn on two cities. The proposed
algorithm demonstrates high efficiency in the adversarial attack tasks under
various scenarios, and it can still generate adversarial samples under the drop
regularization such as DropOut, DropNode, and DropEdge. The research outcomes
could help to improve the robustness of the GCN-based traffic prediction models

stochastic resetting to the case of partially absorbing targets. Instead of an
absorption event occurring when the search particle reaches the boundary of a
target, the particle can diffuse freely in and out of the target region and is
absorbed at a rate $\kappa$ when inside the target. In the context of cell
biology, the target could represent a chemically reactive substrate within a
cell or a region where a particle can be offloaded onto a nearby compartment.
We apply this framework to a partially absorbing interval and to spherically
symmetric targets in $\R^d$. In each case, we determine how the mean first
passage time (MFPT) for absorption depends on $\kappa$, the resetting rate $r$,
and the target geometry. For the given examples, we find that the MFPT is a
monotonically decreasing function of $\kappa$, whereas it is a unimodal
function of $r$ with a unique minimum at an optimal resetting rate $r_{\rm
opt}$. The variation of $r_{\rm opt}$ with $\kappa$ depends on the spatial
dimension $d$, decreasing in sensitivity as $d$ increases. For finite $\kappa$,
$ r_{\rm opt}$ is a non-trivial function of the target size and distance
between the target and the reset point. We also show how our results converge
to those obtained previously for problems with totally absorbing targets and
similar geometries when the absorption rate becomes infinite. Finally, we
generalize the theory to take into account an extended chemical reaction scheme
within a target.

context of remote sensing (RS) as it provides valuable information in many
aspects, however, difficulties brought by the nature of RS images such as
variations in the spatial arrangements and in-consistent constructional
patterns require studying further, since it often causes poorly classified
segmentation maps. We address this need by designing a joint optimization
scheme for the task of building footprint delineation and introducing two
auxiliary tasks; image reconstruction and building footprint boundary
segmentation with the intent to reveal the common underlying structure to
advance the classification accuracy of a single task model under the favor of
auxiliary tasks. In particular, we propose a deep multi-task learning (MTL)
based unified fully convolutional framework which operates in an end-to-end
manner by making use of joint loss function with learnable loss weights
considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task loss. Experimental
results conducted on the SpaceNet6 dataset demonstrate the potential of the
proposed MTL framework as it improves the classification accuracy considerably

that, compared with other sampling-based and sampling-free methods, SAGN
achieves better or comparable results and SLE can further improve performance.

  Scalable Hybrid Layered Representation of Real-World Light Fields",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel hierarchical coding scheme for light fields based
on transmittance patterns of low-rank multiplicative layers and Fourier
disparity layers. The proposed scheme learns stacked multiplicative layers from
subsets of light field views determined from different scanning orders. The
multiplicative layers are optimized using a fast data-driven convolutional
neural network (CNN). The spatial correlation in layer patterns is exploited
with varying low ranks in factorization derived from singular value
decomposition on a Krylov subspace. Further, encoding with HEVC efficiently
removes intra-view and inter-view correlation in low-rank approximated layers.
The initial subset of approximated decoded views from multiplicative
representation is used to construct Fourier disparity layer (FDL)
representation. The FDL model synthesizes second subset of views which is
identified by a pre-defined hierarchical prediction order. The correlations
between the prediction residue of synthesized views is further eliminated by
encoding the residual signal. The set of views obtained from decoding the
residual is employed in order to refine the FDL model and predict the next
subset of views with improved accuracy. This hierarchical procedure is repeated
until all light field views are encoded. The critical advantage of proposed
hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes not just
spatial and temporal redundancies, but efficiently exploits the strong
intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both horizontal
and vertical directions as specified by different predication orders. Besides,
the scheme is flexible to realize a range of multiple bitrates at the decoder
within a single integrated system. The compression performance analyzed with
real light field shows substantial bitrate savings, maintaining good
reconstruction quality.

Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the
architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel

feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level,
BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination
of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately
designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective
feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention

the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework. BM-NAS
achieves competitive performances with much less search time and fewer model

resources and does not account for unforeseen events. To overcome this
limitation, this paper seeks to initiate the study of voltage collapse
stabilization, i.e., the design of load controllers aimed at stabilizing the
point of voltage collapse. We formulate the problem of voltage stability for a
star direct current network as a dynamic problem where each load seeks to
achieve a constant power consumption by updating its conductance as the voltage
changes. We introduce a voltage collapse stabilization controller and show that
the high-voltage equilibrium is stabilized. More importantly, we are able to
achieve proportional load shedding under extreme loading conditions. We further
highlight the key features of our controller using numerical illustrations.

Bi2Fe4O9 are investigated by means of infrared synchrotron-based spectroscopy

the phonon modes is shown to exhibit an anomalous softening as a function of
temperature in the antiferromagnetic phase below 240 K, highlighting
spin-lattice coupling. Moreover, under applied pressure at 40 K, an even larger
softening is observed through the pressure induced structural transition.
Lattice dynamical calculations reveal that this mode is indeed very peculiar as
it involves a minimal bending of the strongest superexchange path in the
pentagonal planes, as well as a decrease of the distances between second
neighbor irons. The latter confirms the hypothesis made by Friedrich et al.,1
about an increase in the oxygen coordination of irons being at the origin of

the supermassive black hole (BH) with a mass of $M_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim
10^8\,M_\odot$. Besides, accretion-induced collapses (AICs) of WDs in AGN disks
may occur sometimes, which may form highly-magnetized millisecond neutron stars
(NSs). The subsequent spin-down process of this nascent magnetar can deposit
its rotational energy into the disk materials, resulting in a magnetar-driven
shock breakout and a luminous magnetar-powered transient. We show that such an
AIC event could power a rapidly evolving and luminous transient for a magnetic
field of $B\sim10^{15}\,{\rm G}$. The rising time and peak luminosity of the
transient, powered by a magnetar with $B\sim10^{14}\,{\rm G}$, are predicted to
have similar properties with those of superluminous supernovae. AIC events
taking place in the inner parts of the disk around a relatively less massive
supermassive BHs ($M_{\rm SMBH}\lesssim10^8\,M_\odot$) are more likely to power
the transients that are much brighter than the AGN disk emission and hence

conductivities at longer lengths, which violate Fourier law. These follow power
law, where $\mathrm{\kappa \propto\ L^{\beta}}$. At longer lengths, the

$k$-median clustering: we are given a set of $n$ polygonal curves in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each of complexity (number of vertices) at most $m$, and want
to compute $k$ median curves such that the sum of distances from the given
curves to their closest median curve is minimal. Additionally, we restrict the
complexity of the median curves to be at most $\ell$ each, to suppress
overfitting, a problem specific for sequential data. Our algorithm has running
time linear in $n$, sub-quartic in $m$ and quadratic in $\epsilon^{-1}$. With
high probability it returns $\epsilon$-coresets of size quadratic in
$\epsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $n$ and $m$. We achieve this result by
applying the improved $\epsilon$-coreset framework by Langberg and Feldman to a
generalized $k$-median problem over an arbitrary metric space. Later we combine
this result with the recent result by Driemel et al. on the VC dimension of
metric balls under the Fr\'echet distance. Furthermore, our framework yields
$\epsilon$-coresets for any generalized $k$-median problem where the range
space induced by the open metric balls of the underlying space has bounded VC
dimension, which is of independent interest. Finally, we show that our
$\epsilon$-coresets can be used to improve the running time of an existing
approximation algorithm for $(1,\ell)$-median clustering.

developments in moving-mesh relativistic dynamics with a local treatment of

compute accurate broadband GRB afterglow radiation from early to late times.
Our results show that the spectral cooling break shifts by a factor of ~ 40

from the previously calculated temporary steep increase after the jet break.
Instead, we find that the cooling break does not shift with time between the

as the overlap of the spectral function of the surface layer of the leads with
that of the central region. By analyzing these spectral functions, we show that
a change of the coupling parameter between the leads and the central region
significantly and non-trivially affects the conductance. The role of band
structure effects for the transmission is clarified. For a strong coupling
between the leads and the central layer, high-intensity localized states are
formed outside the overlapping bands, while for weaker coupling this
high-intensity spectral weight is formed within the leads' continuum band
around the Fermi energy. A local Coulomb interaction in the central region
modifies the high-intensity states, and hence the transmission. For the present
setup, the major effect of the local interaction consists in shifts of the band
structure, since any sharp features are weakened due to the macroscopic
extension of the configuration in the directions perpendicular to the transport
direction.

and it is often generated in real time, such as transportation passenger
volume, network traffic, system resource consumption, energy usage, and human
gait. Detecting anomalous events based on machine learning approaches in such
time series data has been an active research topic in many different areas.
However, most machine learning approaches require labeled datasets, offline
training, and may suffer from high computation complexity, consequently
hindering their applicability. Providing a lightweight self-adaptive approach
that does not need offline training in advance and meanwhile is able to detect
anomalies in real time could be highly beneficial. Such an approach could be
immediately applied and deployed on any commodity machine to provide timely
anomaly alerts. To facilitate such an approach, this paper introduces SALAD,
which is a Self-Adaptive Lightweight Anomaly Detection approach based on a
special type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
Instead of using offline training, SALAD converts a target time series into a
series of average absolute relative error (AARE) values on the fly and predicts
an AARE value for every upcoming data point based on short-term historical AARE
values. If the difference between a calculated AARE value and its corresponding
forecast AARE value is higher than a self-adaptive detection threshold, the
corresponding data point is considered anomalous. Otherwise, the data point is
considered normal. Experiments based on two real-world open-source time series
datasets demonstrate that SALAD outperforms five other state-of-the-art anomaly
detection approaches in terms of detection accuracy. In addition, the results
also show that SALAD is lightweight and can be deployed on a commodity machine.

implementations of branch-and-bound algorithms. The complexity of such
implementations makes empirical study difficult for a wide variety of reasons.
Various attempts have been made to develop and codify a set of standard
techniques for the assessment of optimization algorithms and their software
implementations; however, most previous work has been focused on classical
sequential algorithms. Since parallel computation has become increasingly
mainstream, it is necessary to re-examine and modernize these practices. In
this paper, we propose a framework for assessment based on the notion that
\emph{resource consumption} is at the heart of what we generally refer to as
the ""effectiveness"" of an implementation. The proposed framework carefully
distinguishes between an implementation's baseline efficiency, the efficacy
with which it utilizes a fixed allocation of resources, and its scalability, a
measure of how the efficiency changes as resources (typically additional
computing cores) are added or removed. Efficiency is typically applied to
sequential implementations, whereas scalability is applied to parallel
implementations. Efficiency and scalability are both important contributors in
determining the overall effectiveness of a given parallel implementation, but
the goal of improved efficiency is often at odds with the goal of improved
scalability. Within the proposed framework, we review the challenges to
effective evaluation and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing
methods of assessment.

this issue. Our studies show that the IST issue is related to the conventional
AST style loss, and reveal that the root cause is the equal weightage of
training samples irrespective of the properties of their corresponding style
images, which biases the model towards certain styles. Through investigation of
the theoretical bounds of the AST style loss, we propose a new loss that

Vanilla (i.e., flat) GMMs require a very large number of components to describe
images well, leading to long training times and memory issues. DCGMMs avoid
this by a stacked architecture of multiple GMM layers, linked by convolution
and pooling operations. This allows to exploit the compositionality of images
in a similar way as deep CNNs do. DCGMMs can be trained end-to-end by
Stochastic Gradient Descent. This sets them apart from vanilla GMMs which are

(CNNs) - to the problem of finding start and endpoints of trends, which are the
optimal points for entering and leaving the market. We aim to explore long-term
trends, which last several months, not days. The key distinction of our model
is that its labels are fully based on expert opinion data. Despite the various
models based solely on stock price data, some market experts still argue that
traders are able to see hidden opportunities. The labelling was done via the
GUI interface, which means that the experts worked directly with images, not
numerical data. This fact makes CNN the natural choice of algorithm. The
proposed framework requires the sequential interaction of three CNN submodels,
which identify the presence of a changepoint in a window, locate it and finally
recognize the type of new tendency - upward, downward or flat. These submodels
have certain pitfalls, therefore the calibration of their hyperparameters is
the main direction of further research. The research addresses such issues as
imbalanced datasets and contradicting labels, as well as the need for specific
quality metrics to keep up with practical applicability. This paper is the full

  Conversational Intelligence","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many current artificial general intelligence (AGI) and natural language
processing (NLP) architectures do not possess general conversational
intelligence--that is, they either do not deal with language or are unable to
convey knowledge in a form similar to the human language without manual,
labor-intensive methods such as template-based customization. In this paper, we
propose a new technique to automatically generate grammatically valid sentences
using the Link Grammar database. This natural language generation method far
outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines and may serve as the final
component in a proto-AGI question answering pipeline that understandably
handles natural language material.

  Collaborative Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.CL cs.DC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large scale contextual representation models have significantly advanced NLP
in recent years, understanding the semantics of text to a degree never seen
before. However, they need to process large amounts of data to achieve
high-quality results. Joining and accessing all these data from multiple
sources can be extremely challenging due to privacy and regulatory reasons.
Federated Learning can solve these limitations by training models in a
distributed fashion, taking advantage of the hardware of the devices that
generate the data. We show the viability of training NLP models, specifically
Word2Vec, with the Federated Learning protocol. In particular, we focus on a
scenario in which a small number of organizations each hold a relatively large
corpus. The results show that neither the quality of the results nor the
convergence time in Federated Word2Vec deteriorates as compared to centralised
Word2Vec.

  abundances",,,"10.1142/S0218301321500282",,"nucl-th astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The production of heavy-mass elements due to the rapid neutron-capture
mechanism (r-process) is associated with astrophysical scenarios, such as
supernovae and neutron-star mergers. In the r-process the capture of neutrons
is followed by $\beta$-decays until nuclear stability is reached. A key element
in the chain of nuclear weak-decays leading to the production of isotopes may
be the change of the parameters controlling the neutrino sector, due to the
mixing of active and sterile species. In this work we have addressed this
question and calculated $\beta$-decay rates for the nuclei involved in the
r-process chains as a function of the neutrino mixing parameters. These rates
were then used in the calculation of the abundance of the heavy elements
produced in core-collapse supernova and in neutron-star mergers, starting from
different initial mass-fraction distributions. The analysis shows that the
core-collapse supernova environment contributes with approximately $30\%$ of
the total heavy nuclei abundance while the neutron-star merger contributes with
about $70\%$ of it. Using available experimental data we have performed a
statistical analysis to set limits on the active-sterile neutrino mixing angle
and found a best-fit value $\sin^2 2\theta_{14}=0.22$, a value comparable with
those found in other studies reported in the literature.

  Networks using Belief Propagation and Evolutionary Algorithms","5 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Locating each node in a wireless sensor network is essential for starting the
monitoring job and sending information about the area. One method that has been
used in hard and inaccessible environments is randomly scattering each node in
the area. In order to reduce the cost of using GPS at each node, some nodes
should be equipped with GPS (anchors), Then using the belief propagation
algorithm, locate other nodes. The number of anchor nodes must be reduced since
they are expensive. Furthermore, the location of these nodes affects the
algorithm's performance. Using multi-objective optimization, an algorithm is
introduced in this paper that minimizes the estimated location error and the
number of anchor nodes. According to simulation results, This algorithm
proposes a set of solutions with less energy consumption and less error than
similar algorithms.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications i.e., industrial internet, intelligent

estimate the average AoI (AAoI) in an ultra-reliable low latency communication
(URLLC) enabled wireless communication system with decodeand-forward relay
scheme over the quasi-static Rayleigh block fading channels. Short packet
communication scheme is used to meet both reliability and latency requirements
of the proposed wireless network. By resorting finite block length information
theory, queuing theory and stochastic processes, a closed-form expression for
AAoI is obtained. Finally, the impact of the system parameters, such as update
generation rate, block length and block length allocation factor on the AAoI
are investigated. All results are validated by the numerical results.

  Aided OFDM Systems","30 pages, 12 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based reflection modulation has been
considered as a promising information delivery mechanism, and has the potential
to realize passive information transfer of a RIS without consuming any
additional radio frequency chain and time/frequency/energy resources. The
existing on-off reflection modulation (ORM) schemes are based on manipulating
the ""on/off"" states of RIS elements, which may lead to the degradation of RIS
reflection efficiency. This paper proposes a frequency reflection modulation
(FRM) method for RIS-aided OFDM systems. The FRM-OFDM scheme modulates the
frequency of the incident electromagnetic waves, and the RIS information is
embedded in the frequency-hoping states of RIS elements. Unlike the ORM-OFDM
scheme, the FRM-OFDM scheme can achieve higher reflection efficiency, since the
latter does not turn off any reflection element in reflection modulation. We
propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to maximize the user
achievable rate for the FRM-OFDM system by jointly optimizing the phase shift
of the RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter. Further, we design a
bilinear message passing (BMP) algorithm for the bilinear recovery of both the
user symbols and the RIS data. Numerical simulations have verified the
efficiency of the designed BCD algorithm for system optimization and the BMP
algorithm for signal detection, as well as the superiority of the proposed
FRM-OFDM scheme over the ORM-OFDM scheme.

presented. The first two stages called Midpoint Delivery System (MPDS) deliver
the next stages to a midpoint. A midpoint is defined by an altitude of 100 $km$
to 120 $km$ and horizontal velocity of 2.8 $km/s$ to 3.2 $km/s$. MPDS stages
decelerate in the atmosphere and perform vertical landing on barges. These
stages can be reused daily for many years. The payload is delivered from the
midpoint to a 400 $km$ Low Earth Orbit by one or two stage rocket called
Midpoint to Orbit Delivery System (MPTO). All of MPTO engines are delivered to
LEO. These engines do not return to Earth themselves. They are returned to
Earth in packs of 50 to 100 by a Reentry Vehicle. Overall, the fully and
multiply reusable launch system should deliver payload to LEO for \$300 to
\$400 per $kg$
