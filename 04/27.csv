mechanized using Isabelle/ZF. The proof builds upon a previous mechanization of
the reflection theorem. The heavy reliance on metatheory in the original proof
makes the formalization unusually long, and not entirely satisfactory: two
parts of the proof do not fit together. It seems impossible to solve these
problems without formalizing the metatheory. However, the present development
follows a standard textbook, Kunen's Set Theory, and could support the
formalization of further material from that book. It also serves as an example
of what to expect when deep mathematics is formalized.

daily-task studies with the same workers throughout on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
We implement this system to conduct a study into touch dynamics, and present
our experiences, challenges and lessons learned from doing so. Study
participants installed our application on their Apple iOS phones and completed
two tasks daily for 31 days. Each task involves performing a series of
scrolling or swiping gestures, from which behavioral information such as
movement speed or pressure is extracted.
  The completion of the daily tasks did not require extra interaction with the
Mechanical Turk platform, yet paid workers through it. This differs somewhat
from the typical rapid completion of one-off tasks that workers are used to on
Amazon Mechanical Turk.
  This atypical use of the platform prompted us to evaluate aspects related to
long-term worker retention and engagement over the study period, in particular
the impacts of payment schedule (amount and structure over time) and reminder
notifications. We also investigate the specific concern of reconciling informed
consent with workers' desire to complete tasks quickly.
  We find that using the Mechanical Turk platform for conducting longitudinal
daily task studies is a viable method to augment or replace traditional lab
studies.

training of deep neural networks. They use an exponential moving average of

optimization problems that arise in training generative adversarial networks.
In this paper, we propose an adaptive momentum min-max algorithm that
generalizes adaptive momentum methods to the non-convex min-max regime.
Further, we establish non-asymptotic rates of convergence for the proposed

language processing. One significant challenge in supervised all-words WSD is
to classify among senses for a majority of words that lie in the long-tail
distribution. For instance, 84% of the annotated words have less than 10
examples in the SemCor training data. This issue is more pronounced as the
imbalance occurs in both word and sense distributions. In this work, we propose
MetricWSD, a non-parametric few-shot learning approach to mitigate this data
imbalance issue. By learning to compute distances among the senses of a given
word through episodic training, MetricWSD transfers knowledge (a learned metric
space) from high-frequency words to infrequent ones. MetricWSD constructs the
training episodes tailored to word frequencies and explicitly addresses the
problem of the skewed distribution, as opposed to mixing all the words trained
with parametric models in previous work. Without resorting to any lexical
resources, MetricWSD obtains strong performance against parametric
alternatives, achieving a 75.1 F1 score on the unified WSD evaluation benchmark
(Raganato et al., 2017b). Our analysis further validates that infrequent words
and senses enjoy significant improvement.

the large communication latency in Cloud-based machine learning solutions,
while preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, the learning performance of FEEL
may be compromised due to limited training data in a single edge cluster. In
this paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized
federated edge learning (SD-FEEL). By allowing model aggregation across
different edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the
training latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer
training data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL
with three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model
updates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to
converge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also
characterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and
the communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training
performance. Experiment results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate the
effectiveness of SD-FFEL in achieving faster convergence than traditional
federated learning architectures. Besides, guidelines on choosing critical
hyper-parameters of the training algorithm are also provided.

work on online joint probabilistic modeling of human annotations and
machine-generated beliefs, we propose modifications and best practices aimed at
minimizing human labeling effort. Specifically, we make use of advances in
self-supervised learning, view annotation as a semi-supervised learning

to propose effective guidelines for labeling. Our analysis is done in a more
realistic simulation that involves querying human labelers, which uncovers

debated since the beginning of its formulation, but still many items have not
yet reached a common consensus. In particular it is well known that Niels Bohr
and Albert Einstein were of quite different opinions on the possible
interpretation of QM. The focus of their debate was on the possibility that QM
is incomplete because of its feature of probabilistic theory. Bohr was denying
that, while Einstein tried to prove its incompleteness. The underlying question
of this debate is if one can have a 'realistic' physical picture of QM, or, on
the contrary, we have to remain at the level of macroscopic description of
phenomena and experiments. In this paper we take the line of thought that QM is
incomplete, but that the wave function is still the proper representation of
physical systems. The starting point is the introduction of an hyperfinite
lattice in the nonstandard real axis \Rns\ for the space coordinates. This
extension of the standard real axis \Rs\ introduces additional nonstandard
degrees of freedom. With additional assumptions the model is able to formulate
a physical description of several so called QM 'paradoxes', as well as to
handle the measurement problem. The latter is described by a stochastic process
that arises from the model itself, and it is in line with the general scheme by
Pearle. Furthermore the entanglement between distant systems gets a natural
representation. In this sense the measurement process and the entanglement turn
out to have a common physical origin.

theory $g \phi^{2}(i\phi)^\epsilon$ were calculated at the first order of the
logarithmic expansion, i.e. at first order in $\epsilon$, and it was proposed
to use this expansion in powers of $\epsilon$ to implement a systematic
renormalization of the theory. Using techniques that we recently developed for
the analysis of an ordinary (hermitian) scalar theory, in the present work we
calculate the Green's functions at $O(\epsilon^2)$, pushing also the analysis
to higher orders. We find that, at each finite order in $\epsilon$, the theory
is non-interacting for any dimension $d \geq 2$. We then conclude that by no
means this expansion can be used for a systematic renormalization of the
theory. We are then lead to consider resummations, and we start with the
leading contributions. Unfortunately, the results are quite poor. Specifying to
the physically relevant $i g \phi^3$ model, we show that this resummation
simply gives the trivial lowest order results of the weak-coupling expansion.
We successively resum subleading diagrams, but again the results are rather
poor. All this casts serious doubts on the possibility of studying the theory
$g \phi^{2}(i\phi)^\epsilon$ with the help of such an expansion. We finally add
that the findings presented in this work were obtained by us some time ago

semantics (e.g., description of an object's attributes while learning about
it). This enables us to learn generalizable concepts from very limited visual
examples. However, current few-shot learning (FSL) methods use numerical class
labels to denote object classes which do not provide rich semantic meanings
about the learned concepts. In this work, we show that by using 'class-level'
language descriptions, that can be acquired with minimal annotation cost, we
can improve the FSL performance. Given a support set and queries, our main idea
is to create a bottleneck visual feature (hybrid prototype) which is then used
to generate language descriptions of the classes as an auxiliary task during
training. We develop a Transformer based forward and backward encoding
mechanism to relate visual and semantic tokens that can encode intricate
relationships between the two modalities. Forcing the prototypes to retain
semantic information about class description acts as a regularizer on the
visual features, improving their generalization to novel classes at inference.
Furthermore, this strategy imposes a human prior on the learned
representations, ensuring that the model is faithfully relating visual and
semantic concepts, thereby improving model interpretability. Our experiments on
four datasets and ablation studies show the benefit of effectively modeling
rich semantics for FSL.

  learning from video",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying underlying governing equations and physical relevant information
from high-dimensional observable data has always been a challenge in physical
sciences. With the recent advances in sensing technology and available
datasets, various machine learning techniques have made it possible to distill
underlying mathematical models from sufficiently clean and usable datasets.
However, most of these techniques rely on prior knowledge of the system and
noise-free data obtained by simulation of physical system or by direct
measurements of the signals. Hence, the inference obtained by using these
techniques is often unreliable to be used in the real world where observed data
is noisy and requires feature engineering to extract relevant features. In this
work, we provide a deep-learning framework that extracts relevant information
from real-world videos of highly stochastic systems, with no prior knowledge
and distills the underlying governing equation representing the system. We
demonstrate this approach on videos of confined multi-agent/particle systems of
ants, termites, fishes as well as a simulated confined multi-particle system
with elastic collision interactions. Furthermore, we explore how these
seemingly diverse systems have predictable underlying behavior. In this study,
we have used computer vision and motion tracking to extract spatial
trajectories of individual agents/particles in a system, and by using LSTM VAE
we projected these features on a low-dimensional latent space from which the
underlying differential equation representing the data was extracted using
SINDy framework.

of polymer clusters (labelled by the numbers of polymer they contain) such that
the model becomes a multicomponent model of particles and polymer clusters with
nonadditive hard interactions. The density functional for this nonadditive hard

singular in the limit of vanishing mass $M\to 0$. However, the Schwarzschild
metric itself is regular in this limit, it is reduced to the Minkowski metric
and there are no reasons to believe that the temperature becomes infinite. This
discrepancy may be due to the singularity of the Kruskal coordinates in this
limit.
  To improve the situation, new coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric are
introduced, called thermal coordinates, which depend on the black hole mass $ M
$ and the parameter $b$. The thermal coordinates are regular in the limit $M\to
0$ when the Schwarzschild metric reduces to Minkowski metric, written in
coordinates dual to the Rindler coordinates. Using the thermal coordinates the
Schwarzschild black hole radiation is reconsidered and it is found that the
Hawking formula for temperature is valid only for large black holes while for
small black holes the temperature is $T=1/2\pi(4M+b)$. The thermal observer in
Minkowski space sees radiation with temperature $T=1/2\pi b$, similar to the
Unruh effect with non-constant acceleration.
  During evaporation, in the thermal coordinates the black hole mass is
decreasing inverse proportional to time and the black hole lifetime is
infinite. More general spherically symmetric metrics are considered and it is
found that the property to have a temperature is not restricted to the cases of
black holes or constant acceleration, but is valid for any spherically
symmetric metric written in thermal coordinates. Implications for primordial
black holes and for the information loss problem are mentioned.

dispersions. MCGs have elevated rotational support, as evidenced by a strong
anti-correlation between the Gauss-Hermite moment $h_3$ and $V/\sigma$. In
contrast, 30$\%$ of control sample galaxies (CSGs) are slow rotators, and
fast-rotating CSGs generally show a weak $h_3-V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. MCGs
and CSGs have similar ages, but MCGs are more metal-rich and $\alpha$-enhanced.
Both MCGs and CSGs have shallow negative metallicity gradients and flat
[$\alpha$/Fe] gradients. On average, MCGs and CSGs have flat age gradients, but
CSGs have a significantly larger dispersion of gradient values. The kinematics
and SP properties of MCGs suggest that they experienced highly-dissipative
gas-rich events, such as mergers, followed by an intense, short, and centrally
concentrated burst of star formation, between 4 to 10 Gyr ago ($z\sim0.4-2$),
and had a quiet accretion history since then. This sequence of events might be
analogous to, although less extreme than, the compaction events which formed
compact quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 2$. The small sizes of MCGs, and the high

detector pixel sizes $<2\,$arcsec; all three requirements are met by the
proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM). For CDIM similar S/N values are
in reach for H$\alpha$. Already the planned NASA mission SPHEREx will detect

background magnetic fields. Individually, each is known to two-dimensionalize
the flow in the perpendicular plane. In realistic flows, both of these effects
are simultaneously present and, importantly, need not be aligned. In this work,
we numerically investigate three-dimensional forced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence subject to the competing effects of global rotation and a
perpendicular background magnetic field. We focus on the case of a strong
background field and find that increasing the rotation rate from zero produces
significant changes in the structure of the turbulent flow. Starting with a
two-dimensional inverse cascade at zero rotation, the flow first transitions to
a forward cascade of kinetic energy, then to a shear-layer dominated regime,
and finally to a second shear-layer regime where the kinetic energy flux is
strongly suppressed and the energy transfer is mediated by the induced magnetic
field. We show that the first two transitions occur at distinct values of the
Rossby number, and the third occurs at a distinct value of the Lehnert number.
More generally, our results demonstrate that, when considering the simultaneous
limits of strong rotation and a strong guide field, the order in which those
limits are taken matters in the misaligned case.

parallel alignment, systems where DWs are known for becoming electrical
conductors could now become useful nanocircuits using only standard
lithographical techniques. Despite this clear application, the microscopic
mechanism responsible for the alignment phenomenon has remained elusive. Using
ultrathin PbTiO$_3$ films as a model system, we explore this mechanism with
large scale density functional theory simulations on as many as 5,136 atoms.
Although we expect multiple contributing factors, we show that parallel DW-ST
alignment can be well explained by this configuration giving rise to an
arrangement of electric dipole moments which best restore polar continuity to
the film. These moments preserve the polar texture of the pristine film, thus
minimizing ST-induced depolarizing fields. Given the generality of this
mechanism, we suggest that STs could be used to engineer other exotic polar
textures in a variety of FE nanostructures as supported by the appearance of
ST-induced polar cycloidal modulations in this letter. Our simulations also
support experimental observations of ST-induced negative strains which have
been suggested to play a role in the alignment mechanism.

expression for the noise covariance matrix between groups in the presence of
correlated noise. We also characterize the correlated readout noise properties
in the NISP engineering grade detectors using long dark integrations. For this
purpose, we assume a $(1/f)^{\, \alpha}$-like noise model and fit the model

of four with respect to the white noise approximation for the covariance

attributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch

self-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent
representations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To
alleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in
vision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch

  Research",,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Telehealth helps to facilitate access to medical professionals by enabling
remote medical services for the patients. These services have become gradually
popular over the years with the advent of necessary technological
infrastructure. The benefits of telehealth have been even more apparent since
the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, as people have become less inclined to
visit doctors in person during the pandemic. In this paper, we focus on
facilitating the chat sessions between a doctor and a patient. We note that the
quality and efficiency of the chat experience can be critical as the demand for
telehealth services increases. Accordingly, we develop a smart auto-response
generation mechanism for medical conversations that helps doctors respond to
consultation requests efficiently, particularly during busy sessions. We
explore over 900,000 anonymous, historical online messages between doctors and
patients collected over nine months. We implement clustering algorithms to
identify the most frequent responses by doctors and manually label the data
accordingly. We then train machine learning algorithms using this preprocessed
data to generate the responses. The considered algorithm has two steps: a
filtering (i.e., triggering) model to filter out infeasible patient messages
and a response generator to suggest the top-3 doctor responses for the ones
that successfully pass the triggering phase. The method provides an accuracy of
83.28\% for precision@3 and shows robustness to its parameters.

celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects.
Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the
evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped. DM
particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the
escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and
escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial
bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range $[10^{-10} -
10^2]~M_\odot$, for constant scattering cross sections and $s$-wave
annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of
the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent
literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the
scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local
galactic position, the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies
in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by $E_c/T_\chi \sim 30$,
where $E_c$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and
$T_\chi$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM
evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, $m_{\rm evap}
\simeq 0.7$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section, the DM
evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range
$10^{-41}~\textrm{cm}^2 \leq \sigma_p \leq 10^{-31}~\textrm{cm}^2$, where
$\sigma_p$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. Its
dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity, or the
scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on
the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small
impact.

show that two-scale homogenization of spatially periodic systems can induce

  The existence of fronts is proved using comparison principles as well as a

such systems to capture the long tail of visual concepts expressed in free form

detects objects in an image conditioned on a raw text query, like a caption or
a question. We use a transformer-based architecture to reason jointly over text

pre-train the network on 1.3M text-image pairs, mined from pre-existing
multi-modal datasets having explicit alignment between phrases in text and
objects in the image. We then fine-tune on several downstream tasks such as
phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension and segmentation,

In particular, the Ising and XY interactions can allow perfect teleportation
through the cluster state even with large errors, but the controlled phase
interaction does not. Nonetheless, we find that teleportation through cluster
state chains of size $N$ has a maximum two-qubit error for teleportation along
a quantum channel that decreases as $N^{-1/2}$. To enable construction of
larger cluster states, we design lowest-order refocusing pulses for correcting
these slow errors in the interaction strength. Our work generalizes to
higher-dimensional cluster states and sets the stage for experiments to monitor
the growth of entanglement in cluster states built from error-prone
interactions.

anti-particles traveling back in time. In quantum field theory, this statement
translates to the long-standing conjecture that probabilities for observing the
two scenarios in a scattering experiment are described by one and the same
function. Why could we expect it to be true? In this work we examine this
question in a simplified setup and take steps towards illuminating a possible
physical interpretation of crossing symmetry. To be more concrete, we consider
planar scattering amplitudes involving any number of particles with arbitrary
spins and masses to all loop orders in perturbation theory. We show that by
deformations of the external momenta one can smoothly interpolate between pairs
of crossing channels without encountering singularities or violating mass-shell
conditions and momentum conservation. The analytic continuation can be realized
using two types of moves. The first one makes use of an $i\varepsilon$
prescription for avoiding singularities near the physical kinematics and allows
us to adjust the momenta of the external particles relative to one another
within their lightcones. The second, more violent, step involves a rotation of
subsets of particle momenta via their complexified lightcones from the future
to the past and vice versa. We show that any singularity along such a
deformation would have to correspond to two beams of particles scattering off
each other. For planar Feynman diagrams, these kinds of singularities are
absent because of the particular flow of energies through their propagators. We
prescribe a five-step sequence of such moves that combined together proves
crossing symmetry for planar scattering amplitudes in perturbation theory,
paving a way towards settling this question for more general scattering
processes in quantum field theories.

function of galactic stellar mass ($10^{9.5} < ({\rm M_*/M}_\odot) < 10^{11}$)
and environment. Because the H$\alpha$ emission correlates with the main
cooling channel for this gas, we are able to estimate the rate at which the CGM
cools and becomes fuel for star formation in the central galaxy. We describe
this calculation, which uses our observations, previous measurements of some
critical CGM properties, and modeling of the cooling mechanism using the
\cloudy modeling suite. We find that the mass cooling rate is larger than the
star formation rates of the central galaxies by a factor of $\sim 4 - 90$,
empirically confirming that there is sufficient fuel to resolve the gas
consumption problem and that feedback is needed to avoid collecting too much
cold gas in galaxies. We find excellent agreement between our estimates of both
the mass cooling rates and mass loading factors and the predictions of
independent theoretical studies. The convergence in results that we find from
several completely different treatments of the problem, particularly at the

We present a set of N-body simulations to describe the evolution of young

do this, we have developed a method that generates realistic initial conditions
for binary stars in star clusters from hydrodynamical simulations. We
considered different evolutionary cases to quantify the impact of binary and
stellar evolution. Also, we compared their evolution to that of King and
fractal models with different length scales. Our results indicate that the
global expansion of the cluster from hydrodynamical simulations is initially
balanced by the sub-clump motion and accelerates when a monolithic shape is
reached, as in a post-core collapse evolution. Compared to the spherical
initial conditions, the ratio of the 50% to 10% Lagrangian radius shows a very
distinctive trend, explained by the formation of a hot core of massive stars
triggered by the high initial degree of mass segregation. As for its binary
population, each cluster shows a self-regulating behaviour by creating
interacting binaries with binding energies of the order of its energy scales.
Also, in absence of original binaries, the dynamically formed binaries present
a mass dependent binary fraction, that mimics the trend of the observed one.

we address this point in a quantum gas that is strongly coupled to a lossy
optical cavity mode using two independent Raman drives, which act on the spin
and motional degrees of freedom of the atoms. This setting allows us to control
the competition between coherent dynamics and dissipation by adjusting the
imbalance between the drives. For strong enough coupling, the transition to a
superradiant phase occurs, as is the case for a closed system. Yet, by
imbalancing the drives we can enter a dissipation-stabilized normal phase and a
region of multistability. Measuring the properties of excitations on top of the
out-of-equilibrium phases reveals the microscopic elementary processes in the
open system. Our findings provide prospects for studying squeezing in
non-Hermitian systems, quantum jumps in superradiance, and dynamical spin-orbit

which would be given by $N_{g}\approx(m/M_{p})^{2}$. Since the number of
gravitons also signify the number of bosonic states they occupy, the number of
gravitons will place an indirect constraint on the gravitational entropy of the
system. We will show that it saturates Bekenstein bound on the gravitational
Area-law of entropy. We will also find that our conclusion is quite robust
against the initial state of the matter degrees of freedom. Based on these
observations, we will ascertain that the gravitons permeating in the observable
Universe always $N_g\gg 1$.

a tight relation between specific SFR (sSFR), H$_2$ star formation efficiency

atomic gas HI does not follow a similar FFR as H$_2$. The relation between
SFE$_{\rm HI}$ and sSFR shows significant scatter and strong systematic
dependence on all of the key galaxy properties that we have explored. The
dramatic difference between HI and H$_2$ indicates that different processes
(e.g., quenching by different mechanisms) may have very different effects on
the HI in different galaxies and hence produce different SFE$_{\rm HI}$-sSFR
relations, while the SFE$_{\rm H_2}$-sSFR relation remains unaffected. The
facts that SFE$_{\rm H_2}$-sSFR relation is independent of other key galaxy
properties, and that sSFR is directly related to the cosmic time and acts as
the cosmic clock, make it natural and very simple to study how different galaxy
populations (with different properties and undergoing different processes)
evolve on the same SFE$_{\rm H_2}$-sSFR $\sim t$ relation. In the gas regulator
model (GRM), the evolution of a galaxy on the SFE$_{\rm H_2}$-sSFR($t$)
relation is uniquely set by a single mass-loading parameter $\lambda_{\rm
net,H_2}$. This simplicity allows us to accurately derive the H$_2$ supply and
removal rates of the local galaxy populations with different stellar masses,
from star-forming galaxies to the galaxies in the process of being quenched.
This combination of FFR and GRM, together with the stellar metallicity
requirement, provide a new powerful tool to study galaxy formation and
evolution.

accuracy of the reduced-order model. For this purpose, a sharp state error
estimator is proposed. Standard a posteriori state error estimation for model
order reduction relies on the inf-sup constant. For parametric systems, the
inf-sup constant is parameter-dependent. The a posteriori error estimation for
systems with very small or vanishing inf-sup constant poses a challenge, since
it is inversely proportional to the inf-sup constant, resulting in rather
useless, overly pessimistic error estimators. Such systems appear in
electromagnetics since the inf-sup constant values are close to zero at points
close to resonant frequencies, where they eventually vanish. We propose a novel
a posteriori state error estimator which avoids the calculation of the inf-sup
constant. The proposed state error estimator is compared with the standard
error estimator and a recently proposed one in the literature. It is shown that
our proposed error estimator outperforms both existing estimators. Numerical
experiments are performed on real-life microwave devices such as narrowband and
wideband antennas, two types of dielectric resonator filters as well as a
dual-mode waveguide filter. These examples show the capabilities and efficiency
of the proposed methodology.

About 80 per cent of the sources have a 'double/triple' structure. The radio
emission at 327 MHz is dominated by steep-spectrum extended structures, while
compact regions become predominant at higher frequencies. As a consequence, we
could unambiguously detect the core region only in three sources, likely due to
self-absorption affecting its emission at this low frequency. Despite their low
surface brightness, lobes store the majority of the source energy budget, whose
correct estimate is a key ingredient in tackling the radio source evolution.
Low-frequency VLBI observations able to disentangle the lobe emission from that
of other regions are therefore the best way to infer the energetics of these
objects. Dynamical ages estimated from energy budget arguments provide values
between 2x10^3 and 5x10^4 yr, in agreement with the radiative ages estimated
from the fit of the integrated synchrotron spectrum, further supporting the
youth of these objects. A discrepancy between radiative and dynamical ages is
observed in a few sources where the integrated spectrum is dominated by
hotspots. In this case the radiative age likely represents the time spent by
the particles in these regions, rather than the source age.

edge channel in two-dimensional topological insulators with broken axial spin
symmetry in the presence of nonmagnetic point defects that create bound states.
In this system the tunneling coupling of the edge and bound states results in
the formation of composite helical edge states in which all four partners of
both Kramers pairs of the conventional helical edge states and bound states are
mixed. The backscattering is considered as a result of inelastic two-particle
scattering of electrons, which are in these composite states. Within this
approach we find that sufficiently strong backscattering occurs even if the
defect creates only one energy level. The effect is caused by electron
transitions between the composite states with energy near the bound state
level. We study the deviation from the quantized conductance due to scattering
by a single defect as a function of temperature and Fermi level. The results
are generalized to the case of scattering by many different defects with energy
levels distributed over the band gap. In this case, the conductance deviation
turns out to be quite strong and comparable with experiment even at a
sufficiently low density of defects. Interestingly, under certain conditions,
the temperature dependence of the conductance deviation becomes very weak over
a wide temperature range.

intuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user
history in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations
in a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for
recommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple
domains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the
domains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on
two widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that
holistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.

to be overcome is the loss of retention for both ON- and OFF-states; the
retention loss. While various models are proposed to explain the retention loss
in memristors consisting of a switching layer, in this paper, we propose that
the nucleation of clusters made of electrical charges, charge-clusters, in the

nucleation results from localized electric-field produced intermittently during
cyclic switching operations. We use the phase-field method to illustrate how
the nucleation of charge-clusters gives rise to the retention loss. Our results
suggest that the degree at which the retention loss arises is linked to the
number of cyclic switching operations since the probability at which nucleation
centers form increases with the number of cycle switching operations, which is
consistent with a range of experimental findings previously reported.

\kms. A narrow jet is also formed with a velocity of 250 \kms, and a mass-loss
rates of $\sim 10^{-12} $ \Moy.
  The computed jets are used to provide inflow boundary conditions for
simulations of proto-planetary nebulae. The wide jet evolves into a molecular
collimated outflow within a few astronomical units, producing proto-planetary
nebulae with bipolar, elongated shapes, whose kinetic energies reach $\sim 4
\times 10^{45}$ erg at 1,000 years. Similarities with observed features in
W43A, OH231.8+4.2, and Hen 3-1475 are discussed.
  The computed wide X-wind produces proto-planetary nebulae with slower
expansion velocities, with bipolar and elliptical shapes, and possible starfish
type and quadrupolar morphology.

towards on-the-fly calculation post observing a sample. Modern approaches

these approaches are merely approximations to integrating over the posterior
predictive distribution that flows naturally from a given model. Further, we
attempt to demonstrate that shortcomings which may be present in the parametric

high-impact graph analytical problems. Existing efforts can be mainly
categorized as spectral-based and spatial-based methods. The major challenge
for the former is to find an appropriate graph filter to distill discriminative
information from input signals for learning. Recently, myriads of explorations
are made to achieve better graph filters, e.g., Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN), which leverages Chebyshev polynomial truncation to seek an approximation
of graph filters and bridge these two families of methods. Nevertheless, it has
been shown in recent studies that GCN and its variants are essentially
employing fixed low-pass filters to perform information denoising. Thus their
learning capability is rather limited and may over-smooth node representations
at deeper layers. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel graph neural
network framework AdaGNN with a well-designed adaptive frequency response
filter. At its core, AdaGNN leverages a simple but elegant trainable filter
that spans across multiple layers to capture the varying importance of
different frequency components for node representation learning. The inherent
differences among different feature channels are also well captured by the
filter. As such, it empowers AdaGNN with stronger expressiveness and naturally
alleviates the over-smoothing problem. We empirically validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework on various benchmark datasets.
Theoretical analysis is also provided to show the superiority of the proposed
AdaGNN. The open-source implementation of AdaGNN can be found here:

time that can be related to the unentangled and entangled regime. At high
molecular weights, influence of contour length fluctuations and con-straint
release cease and pure reptation prevails. With the broad frequency range
dielectric spectroscopy can fol-low polymer dynamics over a very broad
temperature range, with the additional advantage of recording the spec-tral
shape which contains information on reptation. Here we investigate the apparent
discrepancy in the molecular weight for the onset of pure reptation from the
molecular weight dependence and the spectral shape. We examined the popular
derivative method and compared it with a version that includes higher order
terms. Higher order terms lead to a more accurate peak shape and position than
those determined with the simpler version. This becomes important if
experimental spectra contain conductivity and polarization contributions.
Higher order terms require the introduction of an interpolating function to
analyze experimental spectra, which lets the Havriliak-Negami function appear
to be a more robust, yet reliable tool to determine the peak shapes. We reach
the conclusion that molecular weight dependence and spectral shape can be both
strongly affected by conductivity and polarization contributions. While this
leaves uncertainties on the accurate value of the transition molecular weight,
the peak shape points to the existence of reptation and contour length
fluctuations in polyisoprene with a molecular weight greater than 1000 kg/mol,
which would imply a ten times greater threshold molecular weight than expected
from previous estimates using the molecular weight dependence.

solar atmosphere, that show a wide range of kinematic properties and are the
major drivers of the space weather. The angular width of the CMEs is a crucial
parameter in the study of their kinematics. The fact that whether slow and fast
CMEs (as based on their relative speed to the average solar wind speed) are
associated with different processes at the location of their ejection is still
debatable. Thus, in this study, we investigate their angular width to
understand the differences between the slow and fast CMEs. We study the width
distribution of slow and fast CMEs and find that they follow different power
law distributions, with a power law indices ($\alpha$) of -1.1 and -3.7 for
fast and slow CMEs respectively. To reduce the projection effects, we further
restrict our analysis to only limb events as derived from manual catalog and we
find similar results. We then associate the slow and fast CMEs to their source
regions, and classified the sources as Active Regions (ARs) and Prominence
Eruptions (PEs). We find that slow and fast CMEs coming from ARs and PEs, also
follow different power laws in their width distributions. This clearly hints
towards a possibility that different mechanisms might be involved in the width
expansion of slow and fast CMEs coming from different sources.These results are

stiffness and mass matrices of a stiffener are transformed to those of the
plate through the displacement compatibility conditions at the plate/stiffener

using a single NURBS patch generated by creating a ruled surface between two

conditions on the response of stiffened composite plates are then analyzed and
the numerical results are used to derive useful conclusions.

mesh size $\delta$ tends to zero at the same rate as the inverse temperature
goes to the critical one, the two-point spin correlations in the full plane
behave as \[
\delta^{-\frac{1}{4}}\mathbb{E}\left[\sigma_{u_{1}}\sigma_{u_{2}}\right]\ \to\

$\Xi(|u_{1}-u_{2}|,m)$ are independent of the lattice. The mass $m$ is defined
by the relation $k'-1\sim 4m\delta$, where $k'$ is the Baxter elliptic
parameter. This includes $m$ of both signs as well as the critical case when
$\Xi(r,0)=r^{-1/4}.$
  These results, together with techniques developed to obtain them, are
sufficient to extend to isoradial graphs the convergence of multi-point spin
correlations in finite planar domains on the square grid, which was established
in a joint work of the first two authors and C. Hongler at criticality, and by
S.C. Park in the sub-critical massive regime. We also give a simple proof of
the fact that the infinite-volume magnetization in the Z-invariant model is
independent of the site and of the lattice.
  As compared to techniques already existing in the literature, we streamline
the analysis of discrete (massive) holomorphic spinors near their ramification
points, relying only upon discrete analogues of the kernel $z^{-1/2}$ for $m=0$

support intelligent computations and advanced services to assist with automated

of machine intelligence propels the technological evolution of transportation
systems one step further and leads to a new framework known as Cognitive
Internet of Vehicles (C-IoV). The redefined cognitive technology in this
framework promises significant enhancements and optimized network capacities
compared with its predecessor framework, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). CIoV
offers additional security measures and introduces security and privacy
concerns, such as evasion attacks, additional threats of data poisoning, and
learning errors, which may likely lead to system failure and road user
fatalities. Similar to many other public enterprise systems, transportation has
a significant impact on the population. Therefore, it is crucial to understand
the evolution and equally essential to identify potential security
vulnerabilities and issues to offer mitigation towards success. This chapter
offers discussions framing answers to the following two questions, 1) how and
in what ways the penetration of the latest technologies are reshaping the
transportation system? 2) whether the evolved system is capable of addressing
the concerns of cybersecurity? This chapter, therefore, starts presenting the
evolution of the transportation system followed by a quick overview of the
evolved CIoV, highlighting the evolved cognitive design. Later it presents how
a cognitive engine can overcome legacy security concerns and also be subjected
to further potential security, privacy, and trust issues that this cloud-based
evolved transportation system may encounter.

Motivated by the ongoing discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant
from high and low redshift, we explain why cosmic shear provides almost no
constraint on $H_0$ by showing how the lensing angular power spectrum depends
on physical length scales in the dark matter distribution. We derive parameter
constraints from galaxy lensing in KiDS and cosmic microwave background weak
lensing from Planck and SPTpol, separately and jointly, showing how
degeneracies between $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ can be broken. Using lensing and
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis to calibrate the sound horizon measured in projection
by baryon acoustic oscillations gives $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.9 \; \mathrm{km} \,
\mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with previous results from
Planck and the Dark Energy Survey. We find that a toy Euclid-like lensing
survey provides only weak constraints on the Hubble constant due to
degeneracies with other parameters that affect the shape of the lensing
correlation functions. If external priors on $n_s$, the baryon density, and the
amplitude of baryon feedback are available then sub-percent $H_0$ constraints
are achievable with forthcoming lensing surveys.

method to optimize both the heights and widths of each concentric ring (zone)
of the AMDL structure. In this study, the desired focal distance ${\Delta}F_d$
is treated as an optimization parameter in addition to the structural
parameters of the zones for the first time. In other words, MO-DE diminishes
the necessity of predetermined focal distance and center wavelength by also
providing an alternative method for phase profile tailoring. The proposed AMDL
can be considered as an ultra-compact, the radius is $3.7{\lambda_c}$ where
${\lambda_c}$ is the center wavelength (i.e., $12 GHz$ frequency), and flat
lens which has a thickness of ${\lambda_c}$. The numerically calculated
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values are below $0.554{\lambda}$ and
focusing efficiency values are varying between $28{\%}$ and $45.5{\%}$. To
experimentally demonstrate the functionality of the optimized lens, the AMDL
composing of polylactic acid material (PLA) polymer is fabricated via
3D-printing technology. The numerical and experimental results are compared,
discussed in detail and a good agreement between them is observed. Moreover,
the verified AMDL in microwave regime is scaled down to the visible wavelengths
to observe achromatic and diffraction-limited focusing behavior between $380
nm$ - $620 nm$ wavelengths.

isospectral triplets and one isospectral set of four. One of the isospectral
triplets involves a loop where we could prove isospectrality. We also present
several different combinatorial methods to generate arbitrarily large sets of

of this we have found a method to determine if two vertices have the same
Titchmarsh-Weil $M$-function. We give combinatorial methods to generate sets of

spherical shallow water equations. With mesoscale vorticity forcing, both moist
and dry systems show kinetic energy scaling that is dominated by rotational
modes, has a -5/3 exponent. At larger planetary scales, the divergent component
of the energy increases and we see a footprint of tropical waves. The dry
system shows a signature of the entire family of equatorial waves, while the
moist simulations only show low frequency Rossby, Kelvin and mixed Rossby
gravity waves with an equivalent depth that matches rapid condensation
estimates. Further, runs with interactive moisture exhibit spontaneous
aggregation with the equilibrium moist energy spectrum obeying a -2 power-law.
Synoptic scale moisture anomalies form in heterogeneous background saturation,
and are sustained by advection and convergence, within rotational gyres that
dominate the tropical region. In that case, along with equatorial waves and
turbulence, a large-scale eastward moving moisture wave appears in the
midlatitudes. In all simulations with upscale energy transfer, a systematic
equatorial zonal mean zonal flow develops which is easterly and westerly for
the dry and moist ensembles, respectively.The interaction of this zonal mean
flow with a spatially heterogeneous saturation field results in the formation
of a moist stationary tropical wave. The super-rotating flow is driven by
rotational eddy momentum fluxes due to enhanced equatorial Rossby wave activity
in the moist runs. The nature of eddies is such that the tropical circulation
in the dry and moist cases tends to homogenize and exaggerate potential
vorticity gradients, respectively. These experiments demonstrate the
co-existence of tropical waves and turbulence, and highlight the fact that the
vortical and divergent wind are inextricably linked with the evolving moisture
field.

and NuSTAR observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) Circinus ULX5,
to put constraints on the mass of the central object and the accretion mode
operating in this source. We aim to answer whether the source contains a
stellar mass black hole with a super-Eddington accretion flow or an
intermediate mass black hole accreting matter in a sub-Eddington mode.
Moreover, we search for major observed changes in spectra and timing occur, and
determine if they are associated with major structural changes in the disk,
similar to those in black hole X-ray binaries. We performed timing and spectral
analysis to study the relation between luminosity and inner disk temperature.
We constructed the hardness ratio versus intensity diagram to reveal spectral
state transitions in Circinus ULX5. Our spectral analysis revealed at least
three distinctive spectral states of Circinus ULX5, in analogy to state
transitions in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. Disk-dominated spectra are
found in high flux states and the power-law dominated spectra are found in
lower flux states. The source was also observed in an intermediate state, where
the flux was low, but spectrum is dominated by a disk component. Over eighteen
years of collected data, ULX5 appeared two times in the high, three times in
the low, and two times in the intermediate state. The fastest observed
transition was $\sim$7 months. Our analysis suggests that the central object in
Circinus ULX5 is a stellar mass BH ($<10\ \rm M_{\odot}$), or possibly a NS
even though we do not detect pulsations in the lightcurves. Fractional
variability amplitudes are consistent with state transitions in Circinus ULX5
wherein higher variability from the power law-like Comptonized emission gets
suppressed in the thermal disk-dominated state.

These algorithms are typically considered model-free because they do not

parameters are utilized in various steps of the algorithm. These are e.g.,
learning rates, memory buffers, state-space dimensioning, normalizations, or
noise decay rates and the purpose of this work is to systematically test the
effect of these parameter configurations on convergence to the analytically

convergence rates of up to 99%. The reliable convergence may make the method a

find (1) a 150% increase in millimeter light curve variability when adding tilt
to the flow; (2) the tilted image centroid in the millimeter shifts on a scale

misclassifications between any two classes are treated equally. In contrast,
human beings can exploit high-level information in making a prediction of an
unknown object. Inspired by this observation, the paper proposes a super-class
guided network (SGNet) to integrate the high-level semantic information into
the network so as to increase its performance in inference. SGNet takes
two-level class annotations that contain both super-class and finer class
labels. The super-classes are higher-level semantic categories that consist of
a certain amount of finer classes. A super-class branch (SCB), trained on
super-class labels, is introduced to guide finer class prediction. At the
inference time, we adopt two different strategies: Two-step inference (TSI) and
direct inference (DI). TSI first predicts the super-class and then makes
predictions of the corresponding finer class. On the other hand, DI directly
generates predictions from the finer class branch (FCB). Extensive experiments
have been performed on CIFAR-100 and MS COCO datasets. The experimental results
validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior performance on
image classification and object detection.

fabrication errors and limited tunabilities. In this Letter, we show that the
violation of perfect matching does not necessitate a reduction in conversion

introduced to improve the efficiency or tunability of conversion. We identify
the universal conditions for maximizing the efficiency of cavity-based
frequency conversion and show a straightforward approach to fully compensate
for parasitic processes such as thermorefractive and photorefractive effects
that, typically, can limit the conversion efficiency. We also show rigorously
that these high-efficiency states are stable.

patterns that arise in transportation networks. Since static traffic assignment
does not have a notion of time, it is not designed to represent temporal
dynamics that arise as vehicles flow through the network and demand varies
through the day. Dynamic traffic assignment methods attempt to resolve these
issues, but require significant computational resources if modeling urban-scale
regions (on the order of millions of links and vehicles) and often take days of
compute time to complete. The focus of this work is two-fold: 1) to introduce a
new traffic assignment approach - a quasi-dynamic traffic assignment (QDTA)
model and 2) to describe how we parallelized the QDTA algorithms to leverage
High-Performance Computing (HPC) and scale to large metropolitan areas while
dramatically reducing compute time. We examine and compare different scenarios,
including a baseline static traffic assignment (STA) and a quasi-dynamic
scenario inspired by the user-equilibrium (UET). Results are presented for the
San Francisco Bay Area which accounts for 19M trips/day and an urban road
network of 1M links. We utilize an iterative gradient descent method, where the
step size is selected using a Quasi-Newton method with parallelized cost
function evaluations and compare it to using pre-defined step sizes (MSA).
Using the parallelized line search provides a 16 percent reduction in total
execution time due to a reduction in the number of gradient descent iterations
required for convergence. The full day QDTA comprising 96 optimization steps
over 15 minute intervals runs in about 4 minutes on 1,024 cores of the NERSC

understand. What is more is that, the energy conservation based framework is
able to handle dissipation problems, which is usually behind the scope of
Hamiltonian principle. In our case, the mechanical, electric and thermal
phenomena firstly are taken into account, and then the medium with dissipation
is included. The formulations on acoustic dynamic equation and the associated
constitutive relations of the medium will also pave an alternative way in
computational dynamic modelling based on weak formulations. In addition, our

electrodynamics, fluid mechanics and quantum mechanics. This is especially true

  Complement-Based Strategy","33 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a novel preconditioned inexact primal-dual interior point method
for constrained convex quadratic programming problems. The algorithm we
describe invokes the preconditioned conjugate gradient method on a new reduced
Schur complement KKT system, in implicit form. In contrast to standard
approaches, the Schur complement formulation we consider enables reuse of the
factorization of the KKT matrix with rows and columns corresponding to
inequality constraints excluded, across all interior point iterations. Further,
two new preconditioners are presented for the resulting reduced system, that
alleviate the ill-conditioning associated with slack variables in primal-dual
interior point methods. Each of the preconditioners we propose also provably
reduces the number of unique eigenvalues for the coefficient matrix, and thus
the CG iteration count. One preconditioner is efficient when the number of
equality constraints is small, while the other is efficient when the number of
remaining degrees of freedom is small. Numerical experiments with synthetic
problems and problems from the Maros-M\'esz\'aros QP collection show that our
preconditioned inexact interior point solvers are effective at improving
conditioning and reducing cost. Across all test problems for which the direct
method is not fastest, our preconditioned methods achieve a reduction in cost
by a geometric mean of $1.432$ relative to the best alternative preconditioned
method for each problem.

validation because assessment of the model accuracy requires a concrete,

in the nuclear community generally means forward UQ (FUQ), in which the
information flow is from the inputs to the outputs. Inverse UQ (IUQ), in which
the information flow is from the model outputs and experimental data to the
inputs, is an equally important component of UQ but has been significantly
underrated until recently. FUQ requires knowledge in the input uncertainties
which has been specified by expert opinion or user self-evaluation. IUQ is
defined as the process to inversely quantify the input uncertainties based on
experimental data. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive and
comparative discussion of the major aspects of the IUQ methodologies that have
been used on the physical models in system thermal-hydraulics codes. IUQ
methods can be categorized by three main groups: frequentist (deterministic),
Bayesian (probabilistic), and empirical (design-of-experiments). We used eight
metrics to evaluate an IUQ method, including solidity, complexity,
accessibility, independence, flexibility, comprehensiveness, transparency, and
tractability. Twelve IUQ methods are reviewed, compared, and evaluated based on
these eight metrics. Such comparative evaluation will provide a good guidance

source is mainly studied by using {\it NICER} light curves in a $0.5-10$ keV
range. We did not find any signature of quasi-periodic oscillations in the
power density spectra of the source. We carry out spectral analysis with a
combined disk blackbody \& power-law model, and a physical two-component
advective flow (TCAF) model. From the combined {\tt disk blackbody} \& {\tt
power-law} model, we extracted thermal and non-thermal fluxes, photon index,
and inner disk temperature. We also find evidence for weak reflection in the
spectra. We have tested the physical TCAF model on a broadband spectrum from
{\it NuSTAR} and {\it Swift}/XRT. The parameters like mass accretion rates, the
size of the Compton clouds and the shock strength are extracted. Our result
shows that the source remained in the hard state during the entire outburst

$7.4 \pm 1.5$ $M_{\odot}$ from the spectral study with the TCAF model. We use

parameter of the black hole is estimated as $a^* > 0.76$. The inclination angle
of the system is estimated to be in the range of $28^{\circ} - 45^{\circ}$ from

animals are proposed and studied. The voluntary motions of animals are
typically initiated by high level intentions created in the primary cortex
through a combination of perceptions of the current state of the environment
along with memories of past reactions to similar states. Muscle movements are
produced as a result of neural processes in which the parallel activity of
large multiplicities of neurons generate signals that collectively lead to
desired actions. Essential to coordinated muscle movement are intentionality,
prediction, regions of the cortex dealing with misperceptions of sensory cues,
and a significant level of resilience with respect to disruptions in the neural
pathways through which signals must propagate. While linear models of feedback
control systems have been well studied over decades, this paper proposes and
analyzes a class of models whose aims are to capture some of the essential
features of neural control of movement. Whereas most linear models of feedback
systems entail a state component whose dimension is higher than the number of
inputs or outputs, the work that follows will treat models in which the numbers
of input and output channels greatly exceed the state dimension. While we begin
by considering continuous time systems, the aim will be to treat systems whose
evolution involves classes of inputs that emulate neural spike trains. Within
the proposed class of models, the paper will study resilience to channel
dropouts, the ways in which noise and uncertainty can be mitigated by an
appropriate notion of consensus among noisy inputs, and finally, by a simple
model in which binary activations of a multiplicity of input channels produce a
dynamic response that closely approximates the dynamics of a prescribed linear
system whose inputs are continuous functions of time.

AFM Kitaev model with $K_{X}=K_{Y}$, $K_{X}+K_{Y}+K_{Z}=-3K$, and $K_{Z}<-K$,
with magnetic field increasing, the gapped QSL experiences a transition to a
gapless QSL at $h_{c1}=g\mu_{B}H_{z1}/K$, to another gapless QSL with $C_{6}$
rotational symmetry at $h_{c2}$, and to a new $U(1)$ gapless QSL between
$h_{c3}$ and $h_{c4}$, respectively. These indicate that magnetic field could
first turn the anisotropic gapped or gapless QSL back into the isotropic
$C_{6}$ gapless one and then make it to undergo the similar evolution as the
isotropic case. Moreover, the critical magnetic fields $h_{c1}$, $h_{c2}$,
$h_{c3}$, and $h_{c4}$ come up monotonically with the increasing Kitaev
coupling; this suggests that the magnetic field can be applied to the
modulation of the anisotropic Kitaev materials.

although recent work has suggested that the grains could be highly porous.
Aside from influencing the optical properties of the dust, porosity has the
potential to affect the chemistry occurring on dust-grain surfaces, via
increased surface area, enhanced local binding energies, and the possibility of
trapping of molecules within the pores as ice mantles build up on the grains.
Through computational kinetics simulations, we investigate how interstellar
grain-surface chemistry and ice composition are affected by the porosity of the
underlying dust-grain material. Using a simple routine, idealized
three-dimensional dust-grains are constructed, atom by atom, with varying
degrees of porosity. Diffusive chemistry is then simulated on these surfaces
using the off-lattice microscopic Monte Carlo chemical kinetics model, MIMICK,
assuming physical conditions appropriate to dark interstellar clouds. On the
porous grain surface, the build-up of ice mantles, mostly composed of water,
leads to the covering over of the pores, leaving empty pockets. Once the pores
are completely covered, the chemical and structural behavior is similar to
non-porous grains of the same size. The most prominent chemical effect of the
presence of grain porosity is the trapping of molecular hydrogen, formed on the
grain surfaces, within the ices and voids inside the grain pores. Trapping of
H2 in this way may indicate that other volatiles, such as inert gases not
included in these models, could be trapped within dust-grain porous structures
when ices begin to form.

much less understood than in the Euclidean norm. We give two new oblivious
dimensionality reduction techniques for the $\ell_1$-norm which improve
exponentially over prior ones:
  1. We design a distribution over random matrices $S \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times
n}$, where $r = 2^{\tilde O(d/(\varepsilon \delta))}$, such that given any
matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, with probability at least $1-\delta$,
simultaneously for all $x$, $\|SAx\|_1 = (1 \pm \varepsilon)\|Ax\|_1$. Note
that $S$ is linear, does not depend on $A$, and maps $\ell_1$ into $\ell_1$.
Our distribution provides an exponential improvement on the previous best known
map of Wang and Woodruff (SODA, 2019), which required $r = 2^{2^{\Omega(d)}}$,
even for constant $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$. Our bound is optimal, up to a
polynomial factor in the exponent, given a known $2^{\sqrt d}$ lower bound for
constant $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$.
  2. We design a distribution over matrices $S \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$,
where $k = 2^{O(q^2)}(\varepsilon^{-1} q \log d)^{O(q)}$, such that given any
$q$-mode tensor $A \in (\mathbb{R}^{d})^{\otimes q}$, one can estimate the
entrywise $\ell_1$-norm $\|A\|_1$ from $S(A)$. Moreover, $S = S^1 \otimes S^2
\otimes \cdots \otimes S^q$ and so given vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_q \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, one can compute $S(u_1 \otimes u_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes u_q)$
in time $2^{O(q^2)}(\varepsilon^{-1} q \log d)^{O(q)}$, which is much faster
than the $d^q$ time required to form $u_1 \otimes u_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes
u_q$. Our linear map gives a streaming algorithm for independence testing using
space $2^{O(q^2)}(\varepsilon^{-1} q \log d)^{O(q)}$, improving the previous
doubly exponential $(\varepsilon^{-1} \log d)^{q^{O(q)}}$ space bound of
Braverman and Ostrovsky (STOC, 2010).

assess the reliability of the model predictions. This requires us to quantify
the uncertainty of model prediction and construct prediction intervals. In this
paper, We explore the uncertainty in deep learning to construct the prediction
intervals. In general, We comprehensively consider two categories of
uncertainties: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We design a
special loss function, which enables us to learn uncertainty without
uncertainty label. We only need to supervise the learning of regression task.
We learn the aleatory uncertainty implicitly from the loss function. And that
epistemic uncertainty is accounted for in ensembled form. Our method correlates
the construction of prediction intervals with the uncertainty estimation.
Impressive results on some publicly available datasets show that the
performance of our method is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.

of Gaussian ensembles are some of the most important distributions in random
matrix theory, and their numerical evaluation is a subject of great practical
importance. One numerical method for evaluating the distributions uses the fact
that they can be represented as Fredholm determinants involving the so-called
Airy integral operator. When the spectrum of the integral operator is computed
by discretizing it directly, the eigenvalues are known to at most absolute
precision. Remarkably, the Airy integral operator is an example of a so-called
bispectral operator, which admits a commuting differential operator that shares
the same eigenfunctions. In this manuscript, we develop an efficient numerical
algorithm for evaluating the eigendecomposition of the Airy integral operator
to full relative precision, using the eigendecomposition of the commuting
differential operator. This allows us to rapidly evaluate the distributions of
the $k$-th largest level to full relative precision rapidly everywhere except
in the left tail, where they are computed to absolute precision. In addition,
we characterize the eigenfunctions of the Airy integral operator, and describe
their extremal properties in relation to an uncertainty principle involving the
Airy transform. We observe that the Airy integral operator is fairly universal,
and we describe a separate application to Airy beams in optics. Using the
eigenfunctions, we compute a finite-energy Airy beam that is optimal, in the
sense that the beam is both maximally concentrated, and maximally
non-diffracting and self-accelerating.

refractive phenomena, especially for the former class of wave packets. We

refractive phenomena such as group-velocity invariance (ST wave packets whose
group velocity does not change across the interface), anomalous refraction
(group-velocity increase in higher-index media), group-velocity inversion
(change in the sign of the group velocity upon refraction but not its
magnitude), and the dependence of the group velocity of the refracted ST wave
packet on the angle of incidence.

the LIGO and Virgo detectors. The analyses have been done with an assumption
that these objects are black holes by limiting the spin prior to the Kerr
bound. However, the above assumption is not valid for superspinars, which have
the Kerr geometry but rotate beyond the Kerr bound. In this study, we
investigate whether and how the limited spin prior range causes a bias in
parameter estimation for superspinars if they are detected. To this end, we
estimate binary parameters of the simulated inspiral signals of the
gravitational waves of compact binaries by assuming that at least one component
of them is a superspinar. We have found that when the primary is a superspinar,
both mass and spin parameters are biased in parameter estimation due to the
limited spin prior range. In this case, the extended prior range is strongly
favored compared to the limited one. On the other hand, when the primary is a
black hole, we do not see much bias in parameter estimation due to the limited
spin prior range, even though the secondary is a superspinar. We also apply the
analysis to black hole binary merger events GW170608 and GW190814, which have a
long and loud inspiral signal. We do not see any preference of superspinars
from the model selection for both events. We conclude that the extension of the
spin prior range is necessary for accurate parameter estimation if highly
spinning primary objects are found, while it is difficult to identify
superspinars if they are only the secondary objects. Nevertheless, the bias in
parameter estimation of spin for the limited spin prior range can be a clue of
the existence of superspinars.

that it is worthwhile to investigate the radiation cooling effects. We here

heated mainly by the resistive heating dissipates its energy by keV X-ray

the semantic meanings. Due to the lack of parallel data, the Denoising
Auto-Encoder (DAE) is widely used in this task to model distributions of
different sentence styles. However, because of the conflict between the target
of the conventional denoising procedure and the target of style transfer task,
the vanilla DAE can not produce satisfying enough results. To improve the
transferability of the model, most of the existing works combine DAE with
various complicated unsupervised networks, which makes the whole system become
over-complex. In this work, we design a novel DAE model named Style-Enhanced
DAE (SE-DAE), which is specifically designed for the text style transfer task.
Compared with previous complicated style-transfer models, our model do not
consist of any complicated unsupervised networks, but only relies on the
high-quality pseudo-parallel data generated by a novel data refinement
mechanism. Moreover, to alleviate the conflict between the targets of the
conventional denoising procedure and the style transfer task, we propose
another novel style denoising mechanism, which is more compatible with the
target of the style transfer task. We validate the effectiveness of our model
on two style benchmark datasets. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluation
show that our proposed model is highly competitive compared with previous
strong the state of the art (SOTA) approaches and greatly outperforms the
vanilla DAE.

factorize into an IR-divergent (soft and collinear) factor and a finite (hard)

process-dependent quantity. We prove that this factorization persists for the
corresponding celestial amplitudes. Moreover, the soft/collinear factor becomes
a scalar correlator of the product of renormalized Wilson lines defined in
terms of celestial data. Their effect on the hard amplitude is a shift in the
scaling dimensions by an infinite amount, proportional to the cusp anomalous
dimension. This leads us to conclude that the celestial-IR-safe gluon amplitude
corresponds to a expectation value of operators dressed with Wilson line
primaries. These results hold for finite $N$. In the large $N$ limit, we show
that the soft/collinear correlator can be described in terms of vertex
operators in a Coulomb gas of colored scalar primaries with nearest neighbor
interactions. In the particular cases of four and five gluons in planar

establish that the Mellin transform converges in the UV thanks to the fact that

show potential for spintronics and storage applications. Along with extensive
condensed-matter studies of chiral spin textures, photonic counterparts of
these textures have been observed in various optical systems with broken
inversion symmetry. Unfortunately, the resemblances are only phenomenological.
This work proposes a theoretical framework based on the variational theorem to
show that the formation of photonic chiral spin textures in an optical
interface is derived from the system's symmetry and relativity. Analysis of the
optical system's rotational symmetry indicates that conservation of the total
angular momentum is preserved from the local variations of spin vectors.
Specifically, although the integral spin momentum does not carry net energy,
the local spin momentum distribution, which determines the local subluminal
energy transport and minimization variation of the square of total angular
momentum, results in the chiral twisting of the spin vectors. The findings here
deepen the understanding of the symmetries, conservative laws and energy
transportation in optical system, construct the comparability in the formation
mechanisms and geometries of photonic and condensed-matter chiral spin
textures, and suggest applications to optical manipulation and chiral

The device activity detection problem has been formulated as a maximum

algorithm for solving the problem is the (random) coordinate descent (CD)
algorithm. However, the CD algorithm fails to exploit the special sparsity

of devices are not active in each time slot. In this paper, we propose a novel
active set selection strategy to accelerate the CD algorithm and propose an
efficient active set CD algorithm for solving the considered problem.
Specifically, at each iteration, the proposed active set CD algorithm first
selects a small subset of all devices, namely the active set, which contains a
few devices that contribute the most to the deviation from the first-order
optimality condition of the MLE problem thus potentially can provide the most
improvement to the objective function, then applies the CD algorithm to perform
the detection for the devices in the active set. Simulation results show that
the proposed active set CD algorithm significantly outperforms the

that an $E_r$ which changes the sign along the radius is obtained as a solution
of the ambipolar condition and with such an $E_r$, impurity carbon flux can be
outwardly directed even where $E_r<0$ and the carbon density profile is hollow
around the magnetic axis. Furthermore, it is found that the outward carbon flux
is only a factor 2-3 from balancing the modeled inward turbulent flux. Our
result indicates that we have moved one step closer to reproducing the impurity
transport in impurity hole plasmas by kinetic simulation.

pivotal application to realms like anomaly detection. As modern society often
deals with massive high-dimensional complex data spawned by multiple sources,
it is natural to consider OCC from the perspective of multi-view deep learning.
However, it has not been discussed by the literature and remains an unexplored
topic. Motivated by this blank, this paper makes four-fold contributions:
First, to our best knowledge, this is the first work that formally identifies
and formulates the multi-view deep OCC problem. Second, we take recent advances
in relevant areas into account and systematically devise eleven different
baseline solutions for multi-view deep OCC, which lays the foundation for
research on multi-view deep OCC. Third, to remedy the problem that limited
benchmark datasets are available for multi-view deep OCC, we extensively
collect existing public data and process them into more than 30 new multi-view
benchmark datasets via multiple means, so as to provide a publicly available
evaluation platform for multi-view deep OCC. Finally, by comprehensively
evaluating the devised solutions on benchmark datasets, we conduct a thorough
analysis on the effectiveness of the designed baselines, and hopefully provide
other researchers with beneficial guidance and insight to multi-view deep OCC.

model in which the link bandwidth and incoming flows are modeled as a knapsack
capacity and items, respectively. Furthermore, each flow consists of two size
and value aspects, acquired through flow size extraction and the type of
service value assigned by the SDN controller decision. Indeed, the current work
splits the incoming flow size range into Type of Service (ToS) decimal value
numbers. The lower the flow size category, the higher the value dedicated to
the flow. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes the knapsack problem and
first forwards the selected flows by KP-PSO, and the non-selected-flows second.
To address the shortcomings of these methods in the event of dense parallel
flow detection, the present study puts the link under the threshold of a 70

magnetic field was measured in a FeCoB nanomagnet to be 60 Gauss at a current

and are among the main causes of congestion at network bottlenecks. Since video
is resilient to data loss, throwing away less important video packets can ease
network congestion with minimal damage to video quality and free up bandwidth
for other data flows. Frame type is one of the features that can be used to
determine the importance of video packets, but this information is stored in
the packet payload. Due to limited processing power of devices in high
throughput/speed networks, data encryption and user credibility issues, it is
costly for the network to find the frame type of each packet. Therefore, a fast
and reliable standalone method to recognize video packet types at network level
is desired. This paper proposes a method to model the structure of live video
streams in a network node which results in determining the frame type of each
packet. It enables the network nodes to mark and if need be to discard less
important video packets ahead of congestion, and therefore preserve video
quality and free up bandwidth for more important packet types. The method does
not need to read the IP layer payload and uses only the packet header data for
decisions. Experimental results indicate while dropping packets under packet
type prediction degrades video quality with respect to its true type by 0.5-3

  Bi-level Aggregation","Accepted at IJCNN 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn low dimensional representations of nodes
by aggregating information from their neighborhood in graphs. However,
traditional GNNs suffer from two fundamental shortcomings due to their local
($l$-hop neighborhood) aggregation scheme. First, not all nodes in the
neighborhood carry relevant information for the target node. Since GNNs do not
exclude noisy nodes in their neighborhood, irrelevant information gets
aggregated, which reduces the quality of the representation. Second,
traditional GNNs also fail to capture long-range non-local dependencies between
nodes. To address these limitations, we exploit mutual information (MI) to
define two types of neighborhood, 1) \textit{Local Neighborhood} where nodes
are densely connected within a community and each node would share higher MI
with its neighbors, and 2) \textit{Non-Local Neighborhood} where MI-based node
clustering is introduced to assemble informative but graphically distant nodes
in the same cluster. To generate node presentations, we combine the embeddings
generated by bi-level aggregation - local aggregation to aggregate features

degradation issues, we present an underwater image enhancement network via
medium transmission-guided multi-color space embedding, called Ucolor.
Concretely, we first propose a multi-color space encoder network, which
enriches the diversity of feature representations by incorporating the
characteristics of different color spaces into a unified structure. Coupled
with an attention mechanism, the most discriminative features extracted from
multiple color spaces are adaptively integrated and highlighted. Inspired by
underwater imaging physical models, we design a medium transmission (indicating
the percentage of the scene radiance reaching the camera)-guided decoder
network to enhance the response of the network towards quality-degraded
regions. As a result, our network can effectively improve the visual quality of
underwater images by exploiting multiple color spaces embedding and the
advantages of both physical model-based and learning-based methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our Ucolor achieves superior performance against
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative
metrics.

  Moving Targets","13 pages, 21 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Small target motion detection within complex natural environments is an
extremely challenging task for autonomous robots. Surprisingly, the visual
systems of insects have evolved to be highly efficient in detecting mates and
tracking prey, even though targets occupy as small as a few degrees of their
visual fields. The excellent sensitivity to small target motion relies on a
class of specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs).
However, existing STMD-based models are heavily dependent on visual contrast
and perform poorly in complex natural environments where small targets
generally exhibit extremely low contrast against neighbouring backgrounds. In
this paper, we develop an attention and prediction guided visual system to
overcome this limitation. The developed visual system comprises three main
subsystems, namely, an attention module, an STMD-based neural network, and a
prediction module. The attention module searches for potential small targets in
the predicted areas of the input image and enhances their contrast against
complex background. The STMD-based neural network receives the
contrast-enhanced image and discriminates small moving targets from background
false positives. The prediction module foresees future positions of the
detected targets and generates a prediction map for the attention module. The
three subsystems are connected in a recurrent architecture allowing information
to be processed sequentially to activate specific areas for small target
detection. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed visual system for
detecting small, low-contrast moving targets against complex natural
environments.

variational slave-spin mean field (VSSMF) method which allows symmetry broken
states to be studied within the computationally less intensive slave-spin mean
field formalism, thus making the method more powerful to study strongly
correlated electron physics. The results show that at half-filling, the ground
state at smaller $U$ is a Slater antiferromagnet (AF) with substantial local
charge fluctuations. As $U$ is increased, the AF state develops a Heisenberg
behavior, finally undergoing a first order transition to a Mott insulating AF
state at a critical interaction $U_c$ which is of the order of the bandwidth.
Introducing the Hund's coupling $J$ correlates the system more and reduces
$U_c$ drastically. At quarter-filling with one electron per site, the ground
state at smaller $U$ is paramagnetic metallic. At finite Hund's coupling $J$,
as interaction is increased above a lower critical value $U_{c1}$, it goes to a
fully spin polarized ferromagnetic state coexisting with an antiferro-orbital
order. The system eventually becomes Mott insulating at a higher critical value
$U_{c2}$. The results as a function of $U$ and $J$ are thoroughly discussed.

larger in the UV band than in the X-ray band. This demonstrates that the
observed UV variability is intrinsic to the disk, and is not due to X-ray
illumination. The joint X-ray spectral analyses of five SXT and LAXPC spectral
data reveal a soft-X-ray excess component, a narrow iron-line (with no
indication of a significant Compton hump), and a steepening power-law
($\Delta\Gamma\sim 0.21$) with increasing X-ray flux. The soft excess component
could arise due to thermal Comptonization of the inner disk photons in a warm
corona with $kT_e\sim 0.26$ keV. The UV emission we detect acts as the primary
seed photons for the hot corona, which produces the broadband X-ray continuum.
The X-ray spectral variability is well described by the cooling of this corona

optical depth remains constant at $\tau\sim 2.3$.

sufficient to detect few Jupiter mass planets in nearby systems. Although no

BaSn3 (Tc ~ 4.4 K) has been predicted to be a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS)

measurements using the output statistics solely, with minimal assumptions about
the underlying quantum system. It is based on the observation that some
extremal points in the set of quantum correlations can only be achieved, up to
isometries, with specific states and measurements. Here, we present a new
approach for quantum self-testing in Bell non-locality scenarios, motivated by
the following observation: the quantum maximum of a given Bell inequality is,
in general, difficult to characterize. However, it is strictly contained in an
easy-to-characterize set: the \emph{theta body} of a vertex-weighted induced
subgraph $(G,w)$ of the graph in which vertices represent the events and edges
join mutually exclusive events. This implies that, for the cases where the
quantum maximum and the maximum within the theta body (known as the Lov\'asz
theta number) of $(G,w)$ coincide, self-testing can be demonstrated by just
proving self-testability with the theta body of $G$. This graph-theoretic
framework allows us to (i) recover the self-testability of several quantum
correlations that are known to permit self-testing (like those violating the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and three-party Mermin Bell inequalities for
projective measurements of arbitrary rank, and chained Bell inequalities for
rank-one projective measurements), (ii) prove the self-testability of quantum
correlations that were not known using existing self-testing techniques (e.g.,
those violating the Abner Shimony Bell inequality for rank-one projective
measurements). Additionally, the analysis of the chained Bell inequalities
gives us a closed-form expression of the Lov\'asz theta number for a family of
well-studied graphs known as the M\""obius ladders, which might be of
independent interest in the community of discrete mathematics.

We found that the diagonal component of the Eddington tensor is reproduced
better by the DNNs than the M1-closure relation especially for low to
intermediate energies. For the off-diagonal component, the DNNs agree better
with the Boltzmann solver than the M1 closure at large radii. In the comparison
between the two DNNs, the TBNN has slightly better performance than the CWNN.
With the new closure relations at hand based on the DNNs that well reproduce
the Eddington tensor with much smaller costs, we opened up a new possibility

traditional fact checking aims at retrieving relevant evidence to verify the
veracity of a given claim. Fact checking methods typically use knowledge graphs
(KGs) as external repositories and develop reasoning mechanism to retrieve
evidence for verifying the triple claim. However, existing methods only focus
on verifying a single claim. As real-world rumorous information is more complex
and a textual statement is often composed of multiple clauses (i.e. represented
as multiple claims instead of a single one), multiclaim fact checking is not
only necessary but more important for practical applications. Although previous
methods for verifying a single triple can be applied repeatedly to verify
multiple triples one by one, they ignore the contextual information implied in
a multi-claim statement and could not learn the rich semantic information in
the statement as a whole. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end knowledge
enhanced learning and verification method for multi-claim fact checking. Our
method consists of two modules, KG-based learning enhancement and multi-claim
semantic composition. To fully utilize the contextual information, the KG-based
learning enhancement module learns the dynamic context-specific representations
via selectively aggregating relevant attributes of entities. To capture the
compositional semantics of multiple triples, the multi-claim semantic
composition module constructs the graph structure to model claim-level
interactions, and integrates global and salient local semantics with multi-head
attention. Experimental results on a real-world dataset and two benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method for multi-claim fact checking
over KG.

intra-day continuous trading, redispatch, and imbalances. Moreover, ASAM
includes numerous policy performance indicators, including a novel price

design question. The results displayed the following implications from order
types in redispatch markets with multi-period all-or-none design: (1) The order
design provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully cleared. (2)
Large orders may lead to dispatch ramps before and after the delivery period

intra-day. (3) All-or-none design in a liquid situation leads to the
over-procurement of redispatch by the grid operator, as orders cannot be
partially activated. Moreover, it is likely that the grid operator induces
imbalances to the system by incomplete redispatch activation (i.e. upward and
downward redispatch volumes are not equal).

federated learning by eliminating the sharing of global model parameters. CGD
exploits the fact that a gradient descent optimization can start with a set of
discrete points and converges to another set at the neighborhood of the global
minimum of the objective function. It lets the participants independently train
on their local data, and securely share the sum of local gradients to benefit
each other. We formally demonstrate CGD's privacy enhancement over traditional
FL. We prove that less information is exposed in CGD compared to that of
traditional FL. CGD also guarantees desired model accuracy. We theoretically
establish a convergence rate for CGD. We prove that the loss of the proprietary
models learned for each participant against a model learned by aggregated

weakly stripped, with the ratio of strippable HI (i.e., where the galactic
restoring force is lower than the ram pressure in the disk) mass fraction (over

exists with a weak magnetic field in a region far from the protostar where the
Hall effect plays a role in the growth of MRI. On the other hand, in all models
the disk is stable against MRI in the region within $<20$ au from the protostar

from multiple source domains to the target domain, which is a more practical
and challenging problem compared to the conventional single-source domain
adaptation. In this problem, it is essential to model multiple source domains
and target domain jointly, and an effective domain combination scheme is also
highly required. The graphical structure among different domains is useful to
tackle these challenges, in which the interdependency among various
instances/categories can be effectively modeled. In this work, we propose two
types of graphical models, i.e. Conditional Random Field for MSDA (CRF-MSDA)
and Markov Random Field for MSDA (MRF-MSDA), for cross-domain joint modeling
and learnable domain combination. In a nutshell, given an observation set
composed of a query sample and the semantic prototypes (i.e. representative
category embeddings) on various domains, the CRF-MSDA model seeks to learn the
joint distribution of labels conditioned on the observations. We attain this
goal by constructing a relational graph over all observations and conducting
local message passing on it. By comparison, MRF-MSDA aims to model the joint
distribution of observations over different Markov networks via an energy-based
formulation, and it can naturally perform label prediction by summing the joint
likelihoods over several specific networks. Compared to the CRF-MSDA
counterpart, the MRF-MSDA model is more expressive and possesses lower
computational cost. We evaluate these two models on four standard benchmark
data sets of MSDA with distinct domain shift and data complexity, and both
models achieve superior performance over existing methods on all benchmarks. In
addition, the analytical studies illustrate the effect of different model
components and provide insights about how the cross-domain joint modeling
performs.

system (qubit) and a quantum harmonic oscillator. In the limit where the qubit
frequency is smaller than the harmonic frequency, the QRM can be well
approximated by the adiabatic approximation (AA). The AA is widely used due to
its simplicity and explicit physical interpretation. However, the level
crossings in the spectrum of the QRM predicted by the AA are determined by the
zeros of Laguerre polynomials, which deviate from the exact points. We propose
a new approximation to the QRM that predicts the level crossings correctly.
This is done by exploiting a surprising connection between isolated exact
solutions to the QRM and the Laguerre polynomials in the AA. We thus refer to
this approach as the generalized adiabatic approximation (GAA). By
construction, the GAA always predicts the exact exceptional spectrum and
approximates the regular spectrum remarkably well in a much larger parameter
regime than the AA. This generalized approach offers a framework to deal with
the family of Rabi-type light-matter interaction models in a simple but
accurate manner.

explanation for the high coronal temperature is the release of energy by
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The energy transfer is believed to be
possible, among others, by the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
(KHI) in coronal loops. Aims: Our aim is to determine if standing slow waves in
solar atmospheric structures such as coronal loops, and also prominence
threads, sunspots, and pores, can trigger the KHI due to the oscillating shear
flow at the structure's boundary. Methods: We used linearized nonstationary MHD
to work out an analytical model in a cartesian reference frame. The model
describes a compressible plasma near a discontinuous interface separating two
regions of homogeneous plasma, each harboring an oscillating velocity field
with a constant amplitude which is parallel to the background magnetic field
and aligned with the interface. The obtained analytical results were then used
to determine the stability of said interface, both in coronal and photospheric
conditions. Results: We find that the stability of the interface is determined
by a Mathieu equation. In function of the parameters of this equation, the
interface can either be stable or unstable. For coronal as well as photospheric
conditions, we find that the interface is stable with respect to the KHI.
Theoretically, it can, however, be unstable with respect to a parametric
resonance instability, although it seems physically unlikely. We conclude that,
in this simplified setup, a standing slow wave does not trigger the KHI without
the involvement of additional physical processes.

vehicle is updated based on the local traffic conditions, to either keep the
vehicle travels via a shorter path in an un-congested region or to explore
longer diverted paths in a congested region. We found that the optimal number
of steps to trigger an update of path-greediness is dependent on the density of
vehicles, and the magnitude of path-greediness increment affects the
macroscopic traffic conditions of the system. To better coordinate vehicles in
denser networks, the update on the tendency for vehicles to travel via the
shorter paths should be gradual and less frequent.

vertices are the dimensions and there is an edge from $i$ to $j$ if and only if
$A_{i,j}\ne 0$ for some matrix $A\in\Sigma$.
  Furthermore, a bound on the norm is also given: If $\rho(\Sigma)>0$ then
there exist a nonnegative integer $r$ and two positive numbers $\alpha,\beta$
so that for every $n$,
  \[
  \alpha n^r{\rho(\Sigma)}^n \le \max_{A_1,\dots,A_n\in\Sigma} \|A_1\dots A_n\|
\le \beta n^r{\rho(\Sigma)}^n.

some sequences. The method in use is mostly based on Fekete's lemma, for both
submultiplicative and supermultiplicative sequences.

analysis due to the high cost of pixelwise annotation. Prior methods, while

volumetric medical images. To address this, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised segmentation strategy capable of better capturing 3D shape

this representation into segmentation prediction for shape refinement. To this

denoising module, which are trained by an iterative learning strategy.
Moreover, we introduce a weak annotation scheme with a hybrid label design for
volumetric images, which improves model learning without increasing the overall
annotation cost. The empirical experiments show that our approach outperforms
existing SOTA strategies on three organ segmentation benchmarks with
distinctive shape properties. Notably, we can achieve strong performance with
even 10\% labeled slices, which is significantly superior to other methods.

tomography (PET) still suffers from insufficient signal from low-energy protons
around the Bragg peak and biological washout of PET emitters. Here we
investigate the possibilities of O-18-enriched water (18-W), a potential
contrast agent that could be incorporated in live tissues by replacing regular
water, leading to the production of the F-18 PET emitters in the last
millimeters of the proton path. We hypothesize that 18-W could also mitigate
the problem of washout, as PET (F-18) isotopes created inside live cells would
remain trapped in the form of fluoride anions.
  To test our hypothesis, we designed an experiment to prove that 18-W can
incorporate enough O-18 into a living organism to produce a detectable signal
from F-18 after proton irradiation, and to determine the amount of activity
that remains trapped inside the cells. The experiment was performed on a
chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane tumor model of head and neck cancer.
Seven eggs with visible tumors were infused with 18-W and irradiated with 8-MeV
protons, equivalent to clinical protons at the end of particle range. The
activity produced after irradiation was detected and quantified in a
small-animal PET-CT scanner. The specific F-18 activity was detected in the
tumor area of the alive chicken embryo up to 9 h after irradiation. Dynamic PET
studies evidenced a minimal effect of biological washout, with 68% retained
specific 18F activity at 8 hours after irradiation.
  Therefore, an infusion of 18-W can incorporate O-18 in animal tissues by
replacing regular water inside cells, producing a PET signal when irradiated
with low-energy protons that could be used for range verification in
protontherapy. F-18 produced inside cells suffers from minimal biological
washout, allowing for a sharper localization with longer PET acquisitions.

DAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in details, and then
two algorithms DAG-FL Controlling and DAG-FL Updating are designed running on
different nodes to elaborate the operation of DAG-FL consensus mechanism. After
that, a Poisson process model is formulated to discuss that how to set
deployment parameters to maintain DAG-FL stably in different federated learning
tasks. The extensive simulations and experiments show that DAG-FL can achieve
better performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared
with the typical existing on-device federated learning systems as the
benchmarks.

diffusion of particles in a magnetic field composed of both a turbulent and a
mean component. This process, which is two-fold turbulent mixing in that the
particle motion is stochastic with respect to the field lines, needs to be
understood in order to properly model cosmic-ray signatures. One of the most
important aspects in the modeling of cosmic-ray diffusion is that fully
resonant scattering, the most effective such process, is only possible if the
wave spectrum covers the entire range of propagation angles. By taking the wave
spectrum boundaries into account, we quantify cosmic-ray diffusion parallel and
perpendicular to the guide field direction at turbulence levels above 5% of the
total magnetic field. We apply our results of the parallel and perpendicular
diffusion coefficient to the Milky Way. We show that simple purely diffusive
transport is in conflict with observations of the inner Galaxy, but that just
by taking a Galactic wind into account, data can be matched in the central 5
kpc zone. Further comparison shows that the outer Galaxy at $>5\,$kpc, on the
other hand, should be dominated by perpendicular diffusion, likely changing to
parallel diffusion at the outermost radii of the Milky Way.

few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) has recently gained more research
interests. Some existing models employ a few-shot relation's multi-hop neighbor
information to enhance its semantic representation. However, noise neighbor
information might be amplified when the neighborhood is excessively sparse and
no neighbor is available to represent the few-shot relation. Moreover, modeling
and inferring complex relations of one-to-many (1-N), many-to-one (N-1), and
many-to-many (N-N) by previous knowledge graph completion approaches requires
high model complexity and a large amount of training instances. Thus, inferring
complex relations in the few-shot scenario is difficult for FKGC models due to
limited training instances. In this paper, we propose a few-shot relational
learning with global-local framework to address the above issues. At the global
stage, a novel gated and attentive neighbor aggregator is built for accurately
integrating the semantics of a few-shot relation's neighborhood, which helps
filtering the noise neighbors even if a KG contains extremely sparse
neighborhoods. For the local stage, a meta-learning based TransH (MTransH)
method is designed to model complex relations and train our model in a few-shot
learning fashion. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art FKGC approaches on the frequently-used benchmark datasets
NELL-One and Wiki-One. Compared with the strong baseline model MetaR, our model
achieves 5-shot FKGC performance improvements of 8.0% on NELL-One and 2.8% on

increased by changing the side of a single vertex. In this paper we study
Minimum Stable Cut, the problem of finding a stable cut of minimum weight.
Since this problem is NP-hard, we study its complexity on graphs of low
treewidth, low degree, or both. We begin by showing that the problem remains
weakly NP-hard on severely restricted trees, so bounding treewidth alone cannot
make it tractable. We match this hardness with a pseudo-polynomial DP algorithm
solving the problem in time $(\Delta\cdot W)^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)}$, where $tw$ is
the treewidth, $\Delta$ the maximum degree, and $W$ the maximum weight. On the
other hand, bounding $\Delta$ is also not enough, as the problem is NP-hard for
unweighted graphs of bounded degree. We therefore parameterize Minimum Stable
Cut by both $tw$ and $\Delta$ and obtain an FPT algorithm running in time
$2^{O(\Delta tw)}(n+\log W)^{O(1)}$. Our main result for the weighted problem
is to provide a reduction showing that both aforementioned algorithms are
essentially optimal, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth: if there exists
an algorithm running in $(nW)^{o(pw)}$ or $2^{o(\Delta pw)}(n+\log W)^{O(1)}$,
then the ETH is false. Complementing this, we show that we can, however, obtain
an FPT approximation scheme parameterized by treewidth, if we consider
almost-stable solutions, that is, solutions where no single vertex can
unilaterally increase the weight of its incident cut edges by more than a
factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$.
  Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider Unweighted Minimum
Stable Cut. Here our results already imply a much faster exact algorithm
running in time $\Delta^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)}$. We show that this is also probably
essentially optimal: an algorithm running in $n^{o(pw)}$ would contradict the
ETH.

this allows us to use previous work on dynamic unweighted matching algorithms

transformations to quantitatively model - let alone to actually understand - be

quantities involved with the crystallization process is the nucleation rate, a
single, elusive number that is supposed to quantify the average probability for
a nucleus of critical size to occur within a certain volume and time span. A
substantial amount of effort has been devoted to attempt a connection between
the crystal nucleation rates computed by means of atomistic simulations and
their experimentally measured counterparts. Sadly, this endeavour almost
invariably fails to some extent, with the venerable classical nucleation theory
typically blamed as the main culprit. Here, we review some of the recent
advances in the field, focusing on a number of perhaps more subtle details that
are sometimes overlooked when computing nucleation rates. We believe it is
important for the community to be aware of the full impact of aspects such as
finite size effects and slow dynamics, that often introduce inconspicuous and
yet non-negligible sources of uncertainty into our simulations. In fact, it is
key to obtain robust and reproducible trends to be leveraged so as to shed new
light on the kinetics of a process, that of crystal nucleation, which is

stratosphere during the 2007 equinox. We detect a variability of up to 15% at
wavelengths sensitive to stratospheric methane, ethane and acetylene at the
~0.1-mbar level. The tropospheric hydrogen-helium continuum and deuterated
methane absorption exhibit a negligible variation (less than 2%), constraining
the phenomenon to the stratosphere. Building on the forward-modelling analysis
of the global average study, we present full optimal estimation inversions
(using the NEMESIS retrieval algorithm, Irwin et al., 2008
[10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.006]) of the Uranus-2007 spectra at each longitude to
distinguish between thermal and compositional variability. We found that the
variations can be explained by a temperature change of less than 3 K in the
stratosphere. Near-infrared observations from Keck II NIRC2 in December 2007
(Sromovsky et al., 2009 [arXiv:1503.01957], de Pater et al., 2011

continuously trained with enormous data from production environments. The sheer

insight is that these deployed ML systems continuously perform forward passes
on data instances during inference, but ad-hoc sampling does not take advantage
of this substantial computational effort. Therefore, we propose to record a
constant amount of information per instance from these forward passes. The
extra information measurably improves the selection of which data instances

framework is proposed to analyze this problem and we provide an efficient
approximation algorithm under the framework of Mini-batch gradient descent as a

to investigate fundamental aspects of the crystallization of fluids. In
experiments on colloidal models of hard-sphere fluids, the uid is unavoidably
at contact with the walls of the sample cell, where heterogeneous
crystallization may take place. In this work we use simulations to investigate
the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous crystallization. We
report simulations of wall-induced nucleation for different confining walls.
Combining the results of these simulations with earlier studies of homogeneous
allows us to asses the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous
nucleation as a function of wall type, fluid density and the system size. On at
walls, heterogeneous nucleation will typically overwhelm homogeneous
nucleation. However, even for surfaces randomly coated with spheres with a
diameter that was some three times larger than that of the fluid spheres - as
has been used in some experiments - heterogeneous nucleation is likely to be
dominant for volume fractions smaller than 0.535. Only for a disordered coating
that has the same structure as the liquid holds promise did we find the
nucleation was likely to occur in the bulk. Hence, such coatings might be used
to suppress heterogeneous nucleation in experiments. Finally, we report the
apparent homogeneous nucleation rate taking into account the formation of
crystallites both in the bulk and at the walls. We find that the apparent
overall nucleation rates coincides with those reported in ""homogeneous
nucleation"" experiments. This suggests that heterogeneous nucleation at the
walls could partly explain the large discrepancies found between experimental
measurements and simulation estimates of the homogeneous nucleation rate.

Brownian particles. We consider a Brownian motion with different diffusion
constants in the two shells and a potential barrier between the two and
investigate the narrow escape problem by calculating the MFPT for Brownian
particles to reach a small window on the external boundary. In two and three

using the finite element method and stochastic simulations. From this
analytical and numeric analysis we finally extract the dependence of the MFPT
on the ratio of diffusion constants, the potential barrier height and the width

a minimum for a sufficiently attractive cortex, for which we propose an
analytical expression of the potential barrier height matching very well the

periods and compute average photometric period of each target. Analysed sample
in this study provides a quantitative representation of a positive linear
correlation between the inverse of the rotation period and the cycle period
normalized to the rotation period, on the log-log scale. We also observe no
correlation between the activity cycle length and the relative surface shear,
indicating that the activity cycle must be driven by a parameter rather than
the differential rotation. Our analyses show that the relative surface shear is
positively correlated with the rotation period and there is a noticeable
separation between main sequence stars and our sample. Compared to our sample,
the relative surface shear of a main sequence star is larger for a given
rotation period. However, dependence of the relative surface shear on the

two-layer blockchain-driven FL system, called ChainFL, which splits the IoT
network into multiple shards as the subchain layer to limit the scale of
information exchange, and adopts a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based mainchain
as the mainchain layer to achieve parallel and asynchronous cross-shard

with blockchain technology, and the modified DAG consensus mechanism is
proposed to mitigate the distortion caused by abnormal models. To provide a

problem (KP). Our goal is to evolve a population of solutions that all have a
profit of at least $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot OPT$, where OPT is the value of an
optimal solution. Furthermore, they should differ in structure with respect to
an entropy-based diversity measure. To this end we propose a simple
$(\mu+1)$-EA with initial approximate solutions calculated by a well-known
FPTAS for the KP. We investigate the effect of different standard mutation
operators and introduce biased mutation and crossover which puts strong
probability on flipping bits of low and/or high frequency within the
population. An experimental study on different instances and settings shows
that the proposed mutation operators in most cases perform slightly inferior in
the long term, but show strong benefits if the number of function evaluations
is severely limited.

the diffraction pattern from a grid, with the role of the grid and the spacing

granular system, where packings are tuned gradually from a crystalline, to
polycrystals, and to an amorphous material. We observe a coexistence of well

broadening their shapes and eventually disappear completely when the structural
disorder $\eta$ becomes sufficiently high. By analyzing firstly the strongly

and then systems of intermediate disorder with $\eta$ in between, we find that
boson peak is associated with spatially uncorrelated random flucutations of

transmitting will be affected significantly. In this work, we focus on the
consensus process in blockchain-based wireless local area network (B-WLAN) by
investigating the impact of the media access control (MAC) protocol, CSMA/CA.
With the randomness of the backoff counter in CSMA/CA, it is possible for
latter blocks to catch up or outpace the earlier one, which complicates
blockchain forking problem. In view of this, we propose mining strategies to
pause mining for reducing the forking probability, and a discard strategy to
remove the forking blocks that already exist in CSMA/CA backoff procedure.
Based on the proposed strategies, we design Block Access Control (BAC)
approaches to effectively schedule block mining and transmitting for improving
the performance of B-WLAN. Then, Markov chain models are presented to conduct
performance analysis in B-WLAN. The results show that BAC approaches can help
the network to achieve a high transaction throughput while improving block
utilization and saving computational power. Meanwhile, the trade-off between
transaction throughput and block utilization is demonstrated, which can act as
a guidance for practical deployment of blockchain.

the distance to Vela X-1, the spectral classification for HD 77518 and find
that the supergiant may be very close to filling its Roche lobe. Constraints on
the clumpiness of the stellar wind have improved. The orbit is very well

eccentricity and the non-spherical shape of HD 77581. Realistic

Such trajectory safety assessment component gives a diverse observation on the

and chemical phenomena. Here, a completely different effect in electrides is
predicted. By recognizing the long-range Coulomb interactions between matrix

that revolves around the black hole of Sgr A* in orbit with a mean radius of
~3.2 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole, here corrected to ~3.13. The
finding of the period of the third pacemaker is consistent with the suggested
revolving star model. Here, I present the specific orbit of the star as well as
a plausible description of its sidereal rotation. The model also implies that
the star has an unusual internal structure. I show that the discovery of the

correspond to systems whose antenna sizes are so large that conventional
modelling assumptions, such as uniform plane wave (UPW) impingement, are longer
valid. This paper studies the mathematical modelling and performance analysis
of XL-array communications. By deviating from the conventional modelling
approach that treats the array elements as sizeless points, we explicitly model
their physical area/aperture, which enables a unified modelling for the
classical discrete antenna arrays and the emerging continuous surfaces. As
such, a generic array/surface model that accurately takes into account the
variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array
elements is proposed. Based on the proposed model, a closed-form expression of
the resulting SNR with the optimal single-user MRC/MRT beamforming is derived.
The expression reveals that instead of scaling linearly with the antenna number
M as in conventional UPW modelling, the SNR with the more generic model
increases with M with diminishing return, which is governed by the collective
properties of the array, such as the array occupation ratio and the physical
sizes of the array along each dimension, while irrespective of the properties
of the individual array element. Additionally, we have derived an alternative
insightful expression for the optimal SNR in terms of the vertical and
horizontal angular spans. Furthermore, we also show that our derived results
include the far-field UPW modelling as a special case. One important finding
during the study of far-field approximation is the necessity to introduce a new
distance criterion to complement the classical Rayleigh distance, termed
uniform-power distance (UPD), which concerns the signal amplitude/power
variations across array elements, instead of phase variations as for Rayleigh
distance.

so-called McKibben pneumatic artificial muscle. A major advantage of handmade
McKibben muscles, as well as its commercial versions, lies in the possibility
it offers of realizing antagonist muscle actuator on the model of the
biceps-triceps system. If pressures are independently controlled in each
artificial muscle, it is then possible to define a position-stiffness control
of the antagonist actuator by analogy with natural neural control of antagonist
skeletal muscles. Such a control however requires a knowledge model of the
actuator making possible a stiffness estimation provided by control pressures,
while position closed-loop control is facilitated by a feedforward model of
this highly nonlinear actuation device. We discuss this issue in the particular
case of the antagonist Festo air muscle actuator, and we propose a simplified
static actuator model derived from the classic static theoretical model of the
McKibben artificial muscle, simple enough for a future MIMO position-stiffness
controller be able to integrate it. If the proposed model highlights the
ability of the antagonist Festo muscle actuator to mimic the stiffness neural
control by the mean of the sum of pressures inside artificial muscles, it also
highlights the difficulty to derive a simple but accurate model of the static
force produced by Festo muscle in the full control range of pressure. The
reported results suggest that it would be particularly interesting to derive
advantage from numerous studies about Festo muscle modelling to go further in
order to find such an inverse actuator model including an accurate estimation

emergence of multiple degenerate steady states. From a quantum jump
(trajectory) perspective, the appearance of multiple steady states is related
to underlying dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) at the fluctuating level,
leading to a dynamical coexistence of different transport channels classified
by symmetry. In this paper, we investigate how strong symmetries affect both
the transport properties and the activity patterns of a particular class of
Markovian open quantum system, a three-qubit model under the action of a
magnetic field and in contact with a thermal bath. We find a pair of twin DPTs
in exciton current statistics, induced by the strong symmetry and related by
time reversibility, where a zero-current exchange-antisymmetric phase coexists
with a symmetric phase of negative exciton current. On the other hand, the
activity statistics exhibits a single DPT where the symmetric and antisymmetric
phases of different but nonzero activities dynamically coexists. The presence
of a strong symmetry under non-equilibrium conditions implies non-analyticities
in the dynamical free energy in the dual activity-current plane, including an
activity-driven current lockdown phase for activities below some critical
threshold. Finally, we also study the effect of a symmetry-breaking,
ergodicity-restoring dephasing channel on the coupled activity-current
statistics for this model. Interestingly, we observe that while this dephasing
noise destroys the symmetry-induced DPTs, the underlying topological symmetry
leaves a dynamical fingerprint in the form of intermittent, bursty on/off
dynamics between the different symmetry sectors.

user equipment (UE) association scheme for maximizing the average received

geometry based analytical framework, where the locations of RISs, base stations
(BSs), and UEs are modeled as homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs). Based
on this framework, we first derive the closed-form probability density function
(PDF) to characterize the distribution of the reflective links created by RISs.
Then, both the exact expressions and upper/lower bounds of UE association
probability are calculated. Lastly, the analytical expressions of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability
are deduced. Additionally, to investigate the impact of RISs on system
coverage, the asymptotic expressions of two coverage probabilities are derived.
The theoretical results show that RIS length is not the decisive factor for
coverage improvement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS
HetNet structure brings significant enhancement in rate coverage. Moreover,
there exists an optimal combination of RISs and BSs deployment densities to
maximize coverage probability.

asymmetry is that the nucleus of 3C328 was temporarily inactive. There was no
energy transfer from it to the lobes during the period of quiescence, and so
they began to fade out. However, under the assumption that the axis connecting
the two lobes makes an appreciable angle with the sky plane, and hence one is
considerably farther from the observer than the other, the lobes are observed
at two distinct stages of evolution due to the light-travel lag. While the
far-side lobe is still perceived as being of the FR II type with a hotspot,
decay of the near-side lobe is already apparent. No jets are visible in the VLA
images, but the VLBA observations of the inverted-spectrum core component of
3C328 have revealed that it has a jet of a sub-arcsecond length pointing
towards the lobe that shows evidence of decay. Since the jet always points to
the near side, its observed orientation is in line with the scenario proposed
here. The presence of the jet supports the inference that the nucleus of 3C328
is currently active; however, given the fact that the jet is short (approx. 200
pc in projection), the activity must have restarted very recently. The lower
and upper limits of the quiescent period length have been calculated.

The efficiency of such further processing heavily depends on the regularity and
structure of the embedding. In this article, the embedding into latent space is
regularized via a loss function that promotes an as isometric and as flat
embedding as possible. The required training data comprises pairs of nearby
points on the input manifold together with their local distance and their local
Frechet average. This regularity loss functional even allows to train the
encoder on its own. The loss functional is computed via a Monte Carlo
integration which is shown to be consistent with a geometric loss functional

enough such that interpolation between not too distant points on the manifold

superconductivity in NbSe$_2$ monolayer, one of the most exciting findings in
superconductivity in recent years. It was proposed that spin fluctuations may
strongly affect the parity of the order parameter. Previous estimates suggested
proximity to ferromagnetism, $i.e.$, $\chi(\mathbf{q})$ peaked at
$\mathbf{q}=0$. We find that the structure of spin fluctuations is more
complicated, with the fluctuation spectrum sharply peaked at $\mathbf{q}\approx
(0.2,0)$. Such a spectrum would change the interband pairing interaction and
considerably affect the superconducting state.

many applications such as community detection and graph partitioning. Counting
k-cliques is typically done by traversing search trees starting at each vertex
in the graph. Parallelizing k-clique counting has been well-studied on CPUs and
many solutions exist. However, there are no performant solutions for k-clique
counting on GPUs.
  Parallelizing k-clique counting on GPUs comes with numerous challenges such
as the need for extracting fine-grain multi-level parallelism, sensitivity to
load imbalance, and constrained physical memory capacity. While there has been
work on related problems such as finding maximal cliques and generalized
sub-graph matching on GPUs, k-clique counting in particular has yet to be
explored in depth. In this paper, we present the first parallel GPU solution
specialized for the k-clique counting problem. Our solution supports both graph
orientation and pivoting for eliminating redundant clique discovery. It
incorporates both vertex-centric and edge-centric parallelization schemes for
distributing work across thread blocks, and further partitions work within each
thread block to extract fine-grain multi-level parallelism while tolerating
load imbalance. It also includes optimizations such as binary encoding of
induced sub-graphs and sub-warp partitioning to limit memory consumption and
improve the utilization of execution resources.
  Our evaluation shows that our best GPU implementation outperforms the best
state-of-the-art parallel CPU implementation by a geometric mean of 12.39x,
6.21x, and 18.99x for k=4, 7, and 10, respectively. We also perform a detailed
evaluation of the trade-offs involved in the choice of parallelization scheme,
and the incremental speedup of each optimization to provide an in-depth
understanding of the optimization space. ...

excitations above the critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$. In this letter, we
consider the effect of long-range decaying couplings $\sim r^{-2-\sigma}$ on

detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large
ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its
companion. In the second paper of the series we presented a simple approach to
derive a robust modified minimum mass ratio (mMMR), based on the observed
ellipsoidal amplitude, without knowing the primary mass and radius, assuming
the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined mMMR is always smaller than
the actual mass ratio. Therefore, a binary with an mMMR larger than unity is a
good candidate for having a massive secondary, which might be a black hole or a
neutron star. This paper considers 10,956 OGLE short-period ellipsoidals
observed towards the Galactic Bulge. We re-analyse their modulation and
identify 136 main-sequence systems with mMMR significantly larger than unity as
candidates for having compact-object secondaries, assuming their observed
periodic modulations reflect indeed the ellipsoidal effect. Obviously, one
needs follow-up observations to find out the true nature of these companions.

companion star via exchange encounters or tidal capture, and then evolves
toward IMBH X-ray binary by the Roche lobe overflow. It is generally thought
that IMBH X-ray binaries are potential ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs),
hence their evolution is very significant. However, the irradiation-driven
winds by the strong X-ray flux from the accretion disks around the IMBHs play
an important role in determining the evolution of IMBH X-ray binaries, and
should be considered in the detailed binary evolution simulation. Employing the
models with the MESA code, we focus on the influence of irradiation-driven
winds on the evolution of IMBH X-ray binaries. Our simulations indicate that a
high wind-driving efficiency ($f=0.01$ for $Z=0.02$, and $f=0.002$ for
$Z=0.001$) substantially shorten the duration in the ULX stage of IMBH X-ray
binaries with an intermediate-mass ($5~M_{\odot}$) donor star. However, this
effect can be ignored for high-mass ($10~M_{\odot}$) donor stars. The
irradiation effect ($f=0.01$ or $0.002$) markedly shrink the initial parameter
space of IMBH binaries evolving toward ULXs with high luminosity ($L_{\rm
X}>10^{40}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) and hyperluminous X-ray sources in the donor-star
mass versus orbital period diagram. Furthermore, the irradiation effect results
in an efficient angular momentum loss, yielding to IMBH X-ray binaries with
relatively close orbits. In our simulated parameter space, about 1\% of IMBH
binaries would evolve toward compact X-ray sources owing to short initial
orbital periods, some of which might be detected as low-frequency gravitational
wave sources.

assumed that the SN--AUV, AUV--UAV, and UAV--AP links are deployed by
underwater optical communication (UWOC), free-space optic (FSO), and radio
frequency (RF) technologies, respectively. Two scenarios are proposed for the
FSO uplink and downlink transmissions between the AUV and the UAV, subject to
water-to-air and air-to-water interface impacts; direct transmission scenario
(DTS) and retro-reflection scenario (RRS). After providing the channel models
and their statistics, the UWSN's outage probability and average bit error rate
(BER) are computed. Besides, a tracking procedure is proposed to set up
reliable and stable AUV--UAV FSO communications. Through numerical results, it
is concluded that the RSS scheme outperforms the DTS one with about 200% (32%)
and 80% (17%) better outage probability (average BER) in the uplink and
downlink, respectively. It is also shown that the tracking procedure provides
on average 480% and 170% improvements in the network's outage probability and
average BER, respectively, compared to poorly aligned FSO conditions. The
results are verified by applying Monte-Carlo simulations.

establishment of bipartite correlations with ambient environments, which are
typically difficult to be fully characterized. Recently, a new approach of
average over disordered Hamiltonian ensemble is developed and shown to be
capable of describing the nonclassicality of incoherent dynamics based on
inferring the nonclassical nature of the correlations. Here we further extend
the approach of Hamiltonian ensemble in the canonical form to the realm of
structural disorder. Under the variable separation of the probability
distribution within the Hamiltonian ensemble, the geometrical structure is
easily visualized and can be characterized according to the degree of symmetry.
We demonstrate four degrees and investigate the effects of different types of
symmetry breaking on the incoherent dynamics. We show that these effects are
easily understood from the emergences of additional terms in the master
equations, leading to rather general master equations and, consequently, going
beyond the previous frameworks of pure dephasing or isotropic depolarization.

central nervous system is regulated by dynamic permeabilities of ion channels.
So far, the computational role of these membrane conductances remains unclear
and is often considered an artifact of the biological substrate. Here we
demonstrate that conductance-based synaptic coupling allow neurons to
represent, process and learn uncertainties. We suggest that membrane potentials
and conductances on dendritic branches code opinions with associated
reliabilities. The biophysics of the membrane combines these opinions by taking
account their reliabilities, and the soma thus acts as a decision maker. We
derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired
target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative
reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system
and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, and makes testable
predictions on dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity.

train such algorithms is often limited in food-insecure countries. Here, we
evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms and small data to
forecast yield on a monthly basis between the start and the end of the growing
season. To do so, we developed a robust and automated machine-learning pipeline
which selects the best features and model for prediction. Taking Algeria as
case study, we predicted national yields for barley, soft wheat and durum wheat

The best machine-learning models always outperformed simple benchmark models.
This was confirmed in low-yielding years, which is particularly relevant for
early warning. Nonetheless, the differences in accuracy between machine
learning and benchmark models were not always of practical significance.
Besides, the benchmark models outperformed up to 60% of the machine learning
models that were tested, which stresses the importance of proper model
calibration and selection. For crop yield forecasting, like for many
application domains, machine learning has delivered significant improvement in
predictive power. Nonetheless, superiority over simple benchmarks is often
fully achieved after extensive calibration, especially when dealing with small

is the sensitivity and specificity of a machine learning based COVID-19 cough

  SETTING: The audio samples that were collected for this study belong to
individuals who were swabbed in the City of Buenos Aires in 20 public and 1
private facilities where RT-PCR studies were carried out on patients suspected
of COVID, and 14 out-of-hospital isolation units for patients with confirmed
COVID mild cases. The audios were collected through the Buenos Aires city
government WhatsApp chatbot that was specifically designed to address citizen
inquiries related to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
  PARTICIPANTS: The data collected corresponds to 2821 individuals who were
swabbed in the City of Buenos Aires, between August 11 and December 2, 2020.
Individuals were divided into 1409 that tested positive for COVID-19 and 1412

GPUs are typically used for back-projection in production CT devices. However,
with the rise of power-constrained micro-CT devices, and also the emergence of
CPUs comparable in performance to GPUs, back-projection for CPUs could become
favorable. Unlike GPUs, extracting parallelism for back-projection algorithms
on CPUs is complex given that parallelism and locality are not explicitly

instance. We propose a collection of novel back-projection algorithms that
reduce the arithmetic computation, robustly enable vectorization, enforce a
regular memory access pattern, and maximize the data locality. We also
implement the novel algorithms as efficient back-projection kernels that are
performance portable over a wide range of CPUs. Performance evaluation using a
variety of CPUs from different vendors and generations demonstrates that our
back-projection implementation achieves on average 5.2x speedup over the

understand the dwarf galaxy population of the Local Group. Using zoom-in dark
matter-only simulations of MW-mass haloes and concentrating on subhaloes that
are thought to be capable of hosting dwarf galaxies, we demonstrate that the
infall of a massive progenitor is accompanied with the accretion and
destruction of a large number of subhaloes. Massive accreted progenitors do not
increase the total number of infalling subhaloes onto a MW-mass host, but
instead focus surrounding subhaloes onto the host causing a clustering in the
infall time of subhaloes. This leads to a temporary elevation in the number of
subhaloes as well as changes in their cumulative radial profile within the
virial radius of the host. Surviving associated subhaloes with a massive
progenitor have a large diversity in their orbits. We find that the star
formation quenching times of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ($10^{5}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}} \lesssim \mathrm{M}_{*} \lesssim 10^{7} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$)
are clustered around the times of the most massive accretions suffered by the
MW and M31. Our results imply that a) the quenching time of dwarf spheroidals
is a good proxy of their infall time and b) the absence of recently quenched
satellites around M31 suggests that M33 is not on its first infall and was

these observations as a result of current-induced spin polarization due to the
significant spin-orbit coupling in CoSi. Scattering of non-equilibrium
spin-polarized carriers within the surface ferromagnetic layer is responsible
for the precessing spin-wave excitations, so the observed magnon modes are the

WhatsApp groups to manipulate Twitter trends through coordinated mass postings.
We joined 600 WhatsApp groups that support the Bharatiya Janata Party, the
right-wing party that won the general election, to investigate these campaigns.
We found evidence of 75 hashtag manipulation campaigns in the form of
mobilization messages with lists of pre-written tweets. Building on this
evidence, we estimate the campaigns' size, describe their organization and
determine whether they succeeded in creating controlled social media
narratives. Our findings show that the campaigns produced hundreds of
nationwide Twitter trends throughout the election. Centrally controlled but
voluntary in participation, this hybrid configuration of technologies and
organizational strategies shows how profoundly online tools transform campaign
politics. Trend alerts complicate the debates over the legitimate use of
digital tools for political participation and may have provided a blueprint for
participatory media manipulation by a party with popular support.

show that students are able to focus only on the relevant features of Quantum
Composer to achieve the task.

  Our setup constrains the form of quasi bialgebras appearing in the

We demonstrate in the case of $p=2$ that our setup completely determines the

launched by Roscosmos to the Lagrange L2 point of the Sun-Earth system on July
13, 2019. The launch was carried out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome by a Proton-M
rocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on
SRG under an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace
Agency. In December 2019, SRG started to perform its main scientific task:
scanning the celestial sphere to obtain X-ray maps of the entire sky in several
energy ranges (from 0.2 to 8 keV with eROSITA, and from 4 to 30 keV with
ART-XC). By mid-June 2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been
completed. Over a period of four years, it is planned to obtain eight
independent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of
these maps will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million
quasars and over one hundred thousand massive galaxy clusters and galaxy
groups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term
variability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic
X-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. The
rotation of the satellite around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period
of four hours enables tracking the faster variability of bright X-ray sources
during one day every half year. The chosen strategy of scanning the sky leads
to the formation of deep survey zones near both ecliptic poles. The paper
presents sky maps obtained by the telescopes on board SRG during the first
survey of the entire sky and a number of results of deep observations performed
during the flight to the L2 point in the frame of the performance verification
program.(Abriged)

novel framework for the classification of HSI data in light of a very limited
amount of labelled data, inspired by multi-view graph learning and graph signal
processing. Given an a priori superpixel-segmented hyperspectral image, we seek
a robust and efficient graph construction and label propagation method to
conduct semi-supervised learning (SSL). Since the graph is paramount to the
success of the subsequent classification task, particularly in light of the
intrinsic complexity of HSI data, we consider the problem of finding the
optimal graph to model such data. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we
propose a multi-stage edge-efficient semi-supervised graph learning framework
for HSI data which exploits given label information through pseudo-label
features embedded in the graph construction. Secondly, we examine and enhance
the contribution of multiple superpixel features embedded in the graph on the
basis of pseudo-labels in an extension of the previous framework, which is less
reliant on excessive parameter tuning. Ultimately, we demonstrate the
superiority of our approaches in comparison with state-of-the-art methods

to separate ultra-large (cm-scale) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
monolayers (1L) with excellent electronic and optical properties from the
parent van der Waals (vdW) crystals. The strong interaction between $Au$ and
chalcogen atoms is the key to achieve this nearly perfect 1L exfoliation yield.
On the other hand, it may affect significantly the doping and strain of 1L TMDs
in contact with Au. In this paper, we systematically investigated the
morphology, strain, doping, and electrical properties of large area 1L
$MoS_{2}$ exfoliated on ultra-flat $Au$ films ($0.16-0.21 nm$ roughness) and
finally transferred to an insulating $Al_{2}O_{3}$ substrate. Raman mapping and
correlative analysis of the $E'$ and $A1'$ peaks positions revealed a moderate
tensile strain ($0.2\%$) and p-type doping ($n=-0.25 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2}$)
of 1L $MoS_{2}$ in contact with $Au$. Nanoscale resolution current mapping and
current-voltage (I-V) measurements by conductive atomic force microscopy
(C-AFM) showed direct tunnelling across the 1L $MoS_{2}$ on $Au$, with a broad
distribution of tunnelling barrier values (from 0.7 to 1.7 eV) consistent with
the p-type doping of $MoS_{2}$. After the final transfer of $1L-MoS_{2}$ on
$Al_{2}O_{3}/Si$, the strain was converted to compressive ($-0.25\%$).
Furthermore, an n-type doping ($n=0.5 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2}$) was deduced by
Raman mapping and confirmed by electrical measurements of an $Al_{2}O_{3}/Si$
back-gated 1L $MoS_{2}$ transistor. These results provide a deeper
understanding of the $Au$-assisted exfoliation mechanisms and can contribute to
its widespread applications for the realization of novel devices and artificial
vdW heterostructures

learn a Markov model of a fading channel via historical data of the

derive a Markov jump model of a wireless control network, and thus to design a
stochastic optimal controller that takes into account the interdependence
between the plant and the wireless channel dynamics. The proposed method is
validated by comparing its prediction accuracy and control performance with

problems of type $y = A u +\varepsilon$, with $u$ being an unknown parameter,
$y$ a given datum, and $\varepsilon$ measurement noise, is a powerful tool
usually derived from a sequential Monte Carlo point of view. It describes the
dynamics of an ensemble of particles $\{u^j(t)\}_{j=1}^J$, whose initial
empirical measure is sampled from the prior, evolving over an artificial time
$t$ towards an approximate solution of the inverse problem, with $t=1$
emulating the posterior, and $t\to\infty$ corresponding to the
under-regularized minimum-norm solution of the inverse problem. Using spectral
techniques, we provide a complete description of the deterministic dynamics of
EKI and its asymptotic behavior in parameter space. In particular, we analyze
the dynamics of naive EKI and mean-field EKI with a special focus on their time
asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, we show that -- even in the deterministic
case -- residuals in parameter space do not decrease monotonously in the
Euclidean norm and suggest a problem-adapted norm, where monotonicity can be
proved. Finally, we derive a system of ordinary differential equations
governing the spectrum and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. While the
analysis is aimed at the EKI, we believe that it can be applied to understand
more general particle-based dynamical systems.

patterns, but the extent to which one individual's movements can predict
another's remains an open question. Further, latent information about an

develop a ""colocation"" network to distinguish the mobility patterns of an ego's
social ties from those of non-social colocators, individuals not socially
connected to the ego but who nevertheless arrive at a location at the same time
as the ego. We apply entropy and predictability measures to analyse and bound
the predictive information of an individual's mobility pattern and the flow of
that information from their top social ties and from their non-social
colocators. While social ties generically provide more information than
non-social colocators, we find that significant information is present in the
aggregation of non-social colocators: 3-7 colocators can provide as much
predictive information as the top social tie, and colocators can replace up to
85% of the predictive information about an ego, compared with social ties that
can replace up to 94% of the ego's predictability. The presence of predictive
information among non-social colocators raises privacy concerns: given the
increasing availability of real-time mobility traces from smartphones,
individuals sharing data may be providing actionable information not just about
their own movements but the movements of others whose data are absent, both
known and unknown individuals.

noncommutative geometries with both the Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions
becomes more striking when wormhole geometries in the modified theories of
gravity are discussed. Here we consider a linear model within $f(\tau,T)$
gravity to investigate traversable wormholes. In particular, we discuss the
possible cases for the wormhole geometries using the Gaussian and the
Lorentzian noncommutative distributions to obtain the exact shape function for
them. By incorporating the particular values of the unknown parameters
involved, we discuss different properties of the new wormhole geometries
explored here. It is noted that the involved matter violates the weak energy
condition for both the cases of the noncommutative geometries, whereas there is
a possibility for a physically viable wormhole solution. By analyzing the
equilibrium condition, it is found that the acquired solutions are stable.
Furthermore, we provide the embedded diagrams for wormhole structures under

framework, PrivChain, to protect sensitive data on blockchain using zero
knowledge proofs. PrivChain provides provenance and traceability without
revealing any sensitive information to end-consumers or supply chain entities.
Its novelty stems from: a) its ability to allow data owners to protect trade
related information and instead provide proofs on the data, and b) an
integrated incentive mechanism for entities providing valid proofs over
provenance data. In particular, PrivChain uses Zero Knowledge Range Proofs
(ZKRPs), an efficient variant of ZKPs, to provide origin information without
disclosing the exact location of a supply chain product. Furthermore, the
framework allows to compute proofs and commitments off-line, decoupling the
computational overhead from blockchain. The proof verification process and
incentive payment initiation are automated using blockchain transactions, smart
contracts, and events. A proof of concept implementation on Hyperledger Fabric
reveals a minimal overhead of using PrivChain for blockchain enabled supply
chains.

  Classification Tasks","Accepted to CODATA Data Science Journal",,"10.5334/dsj-2021-020",,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There has been a surge in remote sensing machine learning applications that
operate on data from active or passive sensors as well as multi-sensor
combinations (Ma et al. (2019)). Despite this surge, however, there has been
relatively little study on the comparative value of 3D surface information for
machine learning classification tasks. Adding 3D surface information to RGB
imagery can provide crucial geometric information for semantic classes such as
buildings, and can thus improve out-of-sample predictive performance. In this
paper, we examine in-sample and out-of-sample classification performance of
Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
trained with and without 3D normalized digital surface model (nDSM)
information. We assess classification performance using multispectral imagery
from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D
Semantic Labeling contest and the United States Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM) Urban 3D Challenge. We find that providing RGB classifiers with
additional 3D nDSM information results in little increase in in-sample
classification performance, suggesting that spectral information alone may be
sufficient for the given classification tasks. However, we observe that
providing these RGB classifiers with additional nDSM information leads to
significant gains in out-of-sample predictive performance. Specifically, we
observe an average improvement in out-of-sample all-class accuracy of 14.4% on
the ISPRS dataset and an average improvement in out-of-sample F1 score of 8.6%
on the USSOCOM dataset. In addition, the experiments establish that nDSM
information is critical in machine learning and classification settings that
face training sample scarcity.

  with OpenAI Gym Toolkit",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  From cutting costs to improving customer experience, forecasting is the crux
of retail supply chain management (SCM) and the key to better supply chain
performance. Several retailers are using AI/ML models to gather datasets and
provide forecast guidance in applications such as Cognitive Demand Forecasting,
Product End-of-Life, Forecasting, and Demand Integrated Product Flow. Early
work in these areas looked at classical algorithms to improve on a gamut of
challenges such as network flow and graphs. But the recent disruptions have
made it critical for supply chains to have the resiliency to handle unexpected
events. The biggest challenge lies in matching supply with demand.
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) with its ability to train systems to respond to
unforeseen environments, is being increasingly adopted in SCM to improve
forecast accuracy, solve supply chain optimization challenges, and train
systems to respond to unforeseen circumstances. Companies like UPS and Amazon
have developed RL algorithms to define winning AI strategies and keep up with
rising consumer delivery expectations. While there are many ways to build RL
algorithms for supply chain use cases, the OpenAI Gym toolkit is becoming the
preferred choice because of the robust framework for event-driven simulations.
  This white paper explores the application of RL in supply chain forecasting
and describes how to build suitable RL models and algorithms by using the
OpenAI Gym toolkit.

formal proof limited to logical operation15. However, recoloring or formal

are sufficient to color a map and how to color it. We find what trapped
vertices and boundary-vertices are, and how they decide how many colors to be
required in coloring arbitrary maps. We reveal that there is the fourth color
for new adding vertex differing from any three coloring vertices in creation
operation. To implement a coloring map, we also demonstrate how to color an
arbitrary map by iteratively using creation and annihilation operations. We

to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques
have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the
incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to
the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources such as
CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same
time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally
intensive Deep Neural Network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at
high-end (or cloud) nodes. This paper presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage
allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud
paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the
query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching.
VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video
inference process across nodes. The paper proposes a novel content-driven
micro-batch resizing, queryaware caching and micro-batch based utility
filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to
improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive
evaluations are performed over five real-world datasets. The experimental
results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves ~2.3X higher throughput
with minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines
while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds.
