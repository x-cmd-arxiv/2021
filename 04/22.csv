and complex organic species. Using a spectral survey collected with the Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), in this work we report the detection of 42
transitions of HNCO in the hot molecular core/outflow G331.512-0.103 (hereafter
G331). The spectral lines were observed in the frequency interval $\sim$ 160 -
355 GHz. By means of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) analyses, applying
the rotational diagram method, we studied the excitation conditions of HNCO.
The excitation temperature and column density are estimated to be $T_{ex}$ =
58.8 $\pm$ 2.7 K and $N$ = (3.7 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$,
considering beam dilution effects. The derived relative abundance is between
(3.8 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times $10$^{-9}$ and (1.4 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times $10$^{-8}$. In
comparison with other hot molecular cores, our column densities and abundances
are in agreement. An update of the internal partition functions of the four
CHNO isomers: HNCO; cyanic acid, HOCN; fulminic acid, HCNO; and isofulminic
acid, HONC is provided. We also used the astrochemical code Nautilus to model
and discuss HNCO abundances. The simulations could reproduce the abundances
with a simple zero-dimensional model at a temperature of 60 K and for a
chemical age of $\sim$ 10$^5$ years, which is larger than the estimated
dynamical age for G331. This result could suggest the need for a more robust
model and even the revision of chemical reactions associated with HNCO.

solve this task with RGB cameras, however struggling when subjects are moving

advantages of event-cameras, especially their efficiency and robustness to
appearance changes. Yet, finding human poses in asynchronous events is in
general more challenging than standard RGB pose estimation, since little or no
events are triggered in static scenes. Here we propose the first learning-based
method for 3D human pose from a single stream of events. Our method consists of
two steps. First, we process the event-camera stream to predict three
orthogonal heatmaps per joint; each heatmap is the projection of of the joint
onto one orthogonal plane. Next, we fuse the sets of heatmaps to estimate 3D
localisation of the body joints. As a further contribution, we make available a

SAT(FO2), which is known to be NEXP-complete. The upper bound is usually
derived from its well known Exponential Size Model (ESM) property. Whether it
can be determinized efficiently is still an open question.
  In this paper we present a different approach by reducing it to a novel
graph-theoretic problem that we call Conditional Independent Set (CIS). We show
that CIS is NP-complete and present two simple algorithms for it with run time
O(1.4423^n) and O(1.6181^n), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. We
also show that unless the ""Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis"" (SETH) fails,
there is no algorithm for CIS with run time O(1.4141^n).
  We show that without the equality predicate SAT(FO2) is in fact equivalent to
CIS in succinct representation. This yields two algorithms for SAT(FO2) without
the equality predicate with run time O(1.4423^{2^n}) and O(1.6181^{2^n}), where
n is the number of predicates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
first exact algorithms for an NEXP-complete decidable logic with run time
significantly lower than O(2^{2^n}). We also identify a few lower complexity
fragments of FO2 which correspond to the tractable fragments of CIS. Similar to
CIS, unless SETH fails, there is no algorithm for SAT(FO2) with run time
O(1.4141^{2^n}).
  For the fragment with the equality predicate, we present a linear time
many-one reduction to the fragment without the equality predicate. The
reduction yields equi-satisfiable formulas with a small constant blow-up in the
number of predicates. Finally, we also perform some small experiments which
show that our approach is indeed more promising than the existing method (based
on the ESM property). The experiments also show that although theoretically it
has the worse run time, the second algorithm in general performs better than
the first one.

confined in a Paul trap. The non-periodic Coulomb interaction experienced by
melted ions forms a medium for non-conservative energy transfer from the
radio-frequency (rf) field to the ions, a process known as rf heating. We study
rf heating by analyzing numerical simulations of non-crystallized ion motion in
Paul trap potentials, in which the energy of the ions' secular motion changes
at discrete intervals, corresponding to ion-ion collisions. The analysis of
these collisions is used as a basis to derive a simplified model of rf heating
energy dynamics, from which we conclude that the rf heating rate is
predominantly dependent on the rf field strength. We confirm the predictability
of the model experimentally: Two trapped $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ions are
deterministically driven to melt, and their fluorescence rate is used to infer
the ions' energy. From simulation and experimental results, we generalize which
experimental parameters are required for efficient recrystallization of melted

is a natural way to describe the N-ary relational data. Recently, tensor
decomposition methods have been introduced into N-ary relational data and
become state-of-the-art on embedding learning. However, the performance of
existing tensor decomposition methods is not as good as desired. First, they
suffer from the data-sparsity issue since they can only learn from the N-ary
relational data with a specific arity, i.e., parts of common N-ary relational
data. Besides, they are neither effective nor efficient enough to be trained
due to the over-parameterization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, i.e., S2S, for effectively and efficiently learning from the N-ary
relational data. Specifically, we propose a new tensor decomposition framework,
which allows embedding sharing to learn from facts with mixed arity. Since the
core tensors may still suffer from the over-parameterization, we propose to
reduce parameters by sparsifying the core tensors while retaining their
expressive power using neural architecture search (NAS) techniques, which can
search for data-dependent architectures. As a result, the proposed S2S not only
guarantees to be expressive but also efficiently learns from mixed arity.
Finally, empirical results have demonstrated that S2S is efficient to train and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

for each of the $(n-1)!/2$ possible planar orderings, $\alpha$, and agrees with
the corresponding planar trees in the moduli space, ${\rm

${\rm Trop}^{\alpha}G(2,n)$ and ${\rm Trop}^{\beta}G(2,n)$ intersect in ${\rm

binary trees that belong to both and construct a $(n-1)!/2\times (n-1)!/2$

permutations of rows and columns) submatrices of maximum possible rank for a
given $n$. We prove that such diagonal matrices cannot have rank larger than
$(n-3)!$ using the CHY formalism. We also prove that the bound is saturated for
$n=5$ (the condition is trivial for $n=4$), that for $n=6$ the maximum rank is
$4$, and that for $n=7$ the maximum rank is $\geq 14$. We also ask the
following question: Is there a value $n_{\rm c}$ so that for any $n>n_{\rm c}$
the bound $(n-3)!$ is always saturated? We review and extend two relevant
results in the literature. The first is the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) choice of
sets which leads to a $(n-3)!\times (n-3)!$ block diagonal submatrix with
blocks of size $d\times d$ with $d = \lceil (n-3)/2\rceil !\lfloor
(n-3)/2\rfloor !$. The second result is that the number of ${\rm Trop}^\alpha
G(2,n)$'s that intersect a given one grows as $\exp(n\log (3+\sqrt{8}))$ for
large $n$ which implies that the density of the intersection matrix goes as
$\exp(-n(\log(n)-2.76))$. We interpret this as an indication that the generic

an exact formula for the number of zeros in a KLT block.

scheme. With a windowing function $V$ and a scaling parameter $\sigma$ which
can be appropriately chosen, $l_{\sigma}$ can include a wide range of popular

$l_{\sigma}$ is not necessarily convex, hence largely improving the former
regression class (least square) in the literature of DR. The learning rates
under different regularity ranges of the regression function $f_{\rho}$ are

to a network of partially distrustful parties for encrypting data that is both
sensitive (it must remain secure) and important (it must not be lost or
destroyed). When sharing classical secrets (as opposed to quantum states), one
can distinguish between protocols that leverage bi-partite quantum key
distribution (QKD) and those that exploit multi-partite entanglement. The
latter class are known to be vulnerable to so-called participant attacks and,
while progress has been made recently, there is currently no analysis that
quantifies their performance in the composable, finite-size regime which has
become the gold standard for QKD security. Given this - and the fact that
distributing multi-partite entanglement is typically challenging - one might
well ask: Is there any virtue in pursuing multi-partite entanglement based
schemes? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a class of secret
sharing protocols based on continuous variable graph states. We establish
security in a composable framework and identify a network topology,
specifically a bottleneck network of lossy channels, and parameter regimes
within the reach of present day experiments for which a multi-partite scheme
outperforms the corresponding QKD based method in the asymptotic and
finite-size setting. Finally, we establish experimental parameters where the
multi-partite schemes outperform any possible QKD based protocol. This one of
the first concrete compelling examples of multi-partite entangled resources
achieving a genuine advantage over point-to-point protocols for quantum
communication and represents a rigorous, operational benchmark to assess the
usefulness of such resources.

away from the known continuum sources. We searched through the MOSFIRE slits

of H$_{2}$O (at 4.0$\sigma$ confidence), while providing moderate evidence of
H$^{-}$ bound-free opacity (3.3$\sigma$) and strong evidence of stellar
contamination from unocculted faculae (4.7$\sigma$). The retrieved H$_{2}$O
abundance ($\sim$ 1$\%$) suggests a super-stellar atmospheric metallicity,
though stellar or sub-stellar abundances remain consistent with present
observations (O/H = 0.3 - 34$\times$ stellar). All three retrieval codes obtain
a precise H$^{-}$ abundance constraint: log(X$_{\rm{H^{-}}}$) $\approx$ -8.0
$\pm$ 0.7. The potential presence of H$^{-}$ suggests that JWST observations
may be sensitive to ionic chemistry in the atmosphere of WASP-79b. The inferred
faculae are $\sim$ 500 K hotter than the stellar photosphere, covering $\sim$
15$\%$ of the stellar surface. Our analysis underscores the importance of
observing UV - optical transmission spectra in order to disentangle the

matter halo hosts. However, deriving accurate mass estimates is particularly
challenging for low-mass galaxy groups. Moreover, calibration of bservational
mass-proxies using weak-lensing estimates have been mainly focused on massive
clusters. We present here a study of halo masses for a sample of galaxy groups
identified according to a spectroscopic catalogue, spanning a wide mass range.
The main motivation of our analysis is to assess mass estimates provided by the
galaxy group catalogue derived through an abundance matching luminosity
technique. We derive total halo mass estimates according to a stacking
weak-lensing analysis. Our study allows to test the accuracy of mass estimates
based on this technique as a proxy for the halo masses of large group samples.
Lensing profiles are computed combining the groups in different bins of
abundance matching mass, richness and redshift. Fitted lensing masses correlate
with the masses obtained from abundance matching. However, when considering
groups in the low- and intermediate-mass ranges, masses computed according to
the characteristic group luminosity tend to predict higher values than the
determined by the weak-lensing analysis. The agreement improves for the
low-mass range if the groups selected have a central early-type galaxy.
Presented results validate the use of mass estimates based on abundance
matching techniques which provide good proxies to the halo host mass in a wide

if the mass of PBHs is as large as $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10 \, M_\odot$, with an

accretion onto the PBHs counteracts the enhancement due to the isocurvature

effects imprints distinctive signatures in the number of absorbers, allowing to
bound the abundance of PBHs. We compute the prospects for constraining PBHs

gas densities were higher and gas-rich mergers were common. They can also form
inside lower-mass galaxies that have since been accreted and tidally disrupted,
leaving their globular cluster complement bound to higher-mass halos. We argue
that the age-metallicity-specific orbital energy relation in a galaxy's
globular cluster system can be used to identify its origin. Gas-rich mergers
should produce tightly bound systems in which metal-rich clusters are younger
than metal-poor clusters. Globular clusters formed in massive disks and then
scattered into a halo should have no relationship between age and specific
orbital energy. Accreted globular clusters should produce weakly bound systems
in which age and metallicity are correlated with each other but inversely
correlated with specific orbital energy. We use precise relative ages,
self-consistent metallicities, and space-based proper motion-informed orbits to
show that the Milky Way's metal-poor globular cluster system lies in a plane in
age-metallicity-specific orbital energy space. We find that relatively young or
metal-poor globular clusters are weakly bound to the Milky Way, while
relatively old or metal-rich globular clusters are tightly bound to the Galaxy.
While metal-rich globular clusters may be formed either in situ or ex situ, our
results suggest that metal-poor clusters formed outside of the Milky Way in
now-disrupted dwarf galaxies. We predict that this relationship between age,
metallicity, and specific orbital energy in a $L^{*}$ galaxy's globular cluster
system is a natural outcome of galaxy formation in a $\Lambda$CDM universe.

for such experiments on (a) excitation of a pair of spatial modes by a single

  Pressure Bumps","Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abfaa4",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The formation of gas-giant planets within the lifetime of a protoplanetary
disk is challenging especially far from a star. A promising model for the rapid
formation of giant-planet cores is pebble accretion in which gas drag during
encounters leads to high accretion rates. Most models of pebble accretion
consider disks with a monotonic, radial pressure profile. This causes a
continuous inward flux of pebbles and inefficient growth. Here we examine
planet formation in a disk with multiple, intrinsic pressure bumps. In the
outer disk, pebbles become trapped near these bumps allowing rapid growth under
suitable conditions. In the inner disk, pebble traps may not exist because the
inward gas advection velocity is too high. Pebbles here are rapidly removed. In
the outer disk, growth is very sensitive to the initial planet mass and the
strength of turbulence. This is because turbulent density fluctuations raise
planetary eccentricities, increasing the planet-pebble relative velocity.
Planetary seeds above a distance-dependent critical mass grow to a Jupiter mass
in 0.5--3 million years out to at least 60 AU in a 0.03 solar-mass disk.
Smaller bodies remain near their initial mass, leading to a sharp dichotomy in
growth outcomes. For turbulent alpha = 1e-4, the critical masses are 1e-4 and
1e-3 Earth masses at 9 and 75 AU, respectively. Pressure bumps in disks may
explain the large mass difference between the giant planets and Kuiper belt
objects, and also the existence of wide-orbit planets in some systems.

as belonging to air, dirt, or bone. While various intensity-based methods have
been proposed to segment scans into these classes, it is often the case that
intensity values for dirt and bone are nearly indistinguishable. In these

scale well in practice when a large number of scans are to be analyzed. Here we
present a new domain-enriched network for three-class image segmentation, which
utilizes the domain knowledge of experts familiar with manually segmenting bone
and dirt structures. More precisely, our novel structure consists of two
components: 1) a representation network trained on special samples based on
newly designed custom loss terms, which extracts discriminative bone and dirt
features, 2) and a segmentation network that leverages these extracted
discriminative features. These two parts are jointly trained in order to
optimize the segmentation performance. A comparison of our network to that of
the current state-of-the-art U-NETs demonstrates the benefits of our proposal,
particularly when the number of labeled training images are limited, which is
invariably the case for micro-CT segmentation.

machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property. This has
spurred interest in model stealing, which is made more practical by advances in
learning with partial, little, or no supervision. Existing defenses focus on
inserting unique watermarks in a model's decision surface, but this is
insufficient: the watermarks are not sampled from the training distribution and
thus are not always preserved during model stealing. In this paper, we make the
key observation that knowledge contained in the stolen model's training set is
what is common to all stolen copies. The adversary's goal, irrespective of the
attack employed, is always to extract this knowledge or its by-products. This
gives the original model's owner a strong advantage over the adversary: model
owners have access to the original training data. We thus introduce $dataset$
$inference$, the process of identifying whether a suspected model copy has
private knowledge from the original model's dataset, as a defense against model
stealing. We develop an approach for dataset inference that combines
statistical testing with the ability to estimate the distance of multiple data
points to the decision boundary. Our experiments on CIFAR10, SVHN, CIFAR100 and
ImageNet show that model owners can claim with confidence greater than 99% that
their model (or dataset as a matter of fact) was stolen, despite only exposing
50 of the stolen model's training points. Dataset inference defends against
state-of-the-art attacks even when the adversary is adaptive. Unlike prior
work, it does not require retraining or overfitting the defended model.

Doppler effect of the {\gamma}-ray energies is improved by the detection of the

of biological systems and have drawn interest for their potential to perform
cognitive tasks with high energy efficiency. However, some factors such as
temporal dynamics and spike timings prove critical for information processing
but are often ignored by existing works, limiting the performance and
applications of neuromorphic computing. On one hand, due to the lack of
effective SNN training algorithms, it is difficult to utilize the temporal
neural dynamics. Many existing algorithms still treat neuron activation
statistically. On the other hand, utilizing temporal neural dynamics also poses
challenges to hardware design. Synapses exhibit temporal dynamics, serving as
memory units that hold historical information, but are often simplified as a
connection with weight. Most current models integrate synaptic activations in
some storage medium to represent membrane potential and institute a hard reset
of membrane potential after the neuron emits a spike. This is done for its
simplicity in hardware, requiring only a ""clear"" signal to wipe the storage
medium, but destroys temporal information stored in the neuron.
  In this work, we derive an efficient training algorithm for Leaky Integrate
and Fire neurons, which is capable of training a SNN to learn complex spatial
temporal patterns. We achieved competitive accuracy on two complex datasets. We
also demonstrate the advantage of our model by a novel temporal pattern
association task. Codesigned with this algorithm, we have developed a CMOS

electric field. This model can be derived from the Oseen-Frank director field
theory, assuming that the dynamics of the electric field are governed by the
electrostatics equations with a suitable constitutive relation for the electric
displacement field that describes the coupling with the liquid crystal director
field. The resulting system of partial differential equations consists of an
elliptic equation that is coupled to the wave map equations through a quadratic
source term. We show that the discretization preserves the unit length
constraint of the director field, is energy-stable and convergent. In numerical
experiments, we show that the method is stable even when singularities develop.
Moreover, predictions about the alignment of the director field with the
electric field are confirmed.

To address these challenges, we propose a robotic solution that automates the

metric GPR imaging by tagging the pose information with GPR measurement in
real-time. We also introduce a deep neural network (DNN) based GPR data

attracted much attention as it can greatly release human labor from searching

coarse-grained recommendation where all relevant articles are predicted as a

Since one case can be formed of many supporting facts, traversing over them to
verify the correctness of recommendation results can be time-consuming. We
believe that learning fine-grained correspondence between each single fact and
law articles is crucial for an accurate and trustworthy AI system. With this
motivation, we perform a pioneering study and create a corpus with manually

the model better digest the content of law articles, we parse articles in form
of premise-conclusion pairs with random forest. Experiments show that the
parsed form yielded better performance and the resulting model surpassed other
popular text matching baselines. Furthermore, we compare with previous
researches and find that establishing the fine-grained fact-article

best system reaches an F1 score of 96.3%, making it of great potential for
practical use. It can also significantly boost the downstream task of legal

topologies is one of the main challenges of today's complexity science. Each
network possesses an intrinsic diffusive potential that depends on its
structural connectivity. However, the diffusion of a process depends not only
on this topological potential but also on the dynamical process itself.
Quantifying this potential will allow the design of more efficient systems in
which it is necessary either to weaken or to enhance diffusion. Here we
introduce a measure, the {\em diffusion capacity}, that quantifies, through the
concept of dynamical paths, the potential of an element of the system, and
also, of the system itself, to propagate information. Among other examples, we
study a heat diffusion model and SIR model to demonstrate the value of the
proposed measure. We found, in the last case, that diffusion capacity can be
used as a predictor of the evolution of the spreading process. In general, we
show that the diffusion capacity provides an efficient tool to evaluate the
performance of systems, and also, to identify and quantify structural
modifications that could improve diffusion mechanisms.

UCT holds for all nuclear $C^*$-algebras.
  We introduce the idea of a $C^*$-algebra that ""decomposes"" over a class

approximately central elements that approximately cut the $C^*$-algebra into
two $C^*$-subalgebras from $\mathcal{C}$ that have well-behaved intersection.
We show that if a $C^*$-algebra decomposes over the class of nuclear, UCT
$C^*$-algebras, then it satisfies the UCT. The argument is based on controlled
$KK$-theory, as introduced by the authors in earlier work. Nuclearity is used
via Kasparov's Hilbert module version of Voiculescu's theorem, and Haagerup's
theorem that nuclear $C^*$-algebras are amenable
  We say that a $C^*$-algebra has finite complexity if it is in the smallest
class of $C^*$-algebras containing the finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras, and
closed under decomposability; our main result implies that all $C^*$-algebras
in this class satisfy the UCT. The class of $C^*$-algebras with finite
complexity is large, and comes with an ordinal-number invariant measuring the
complexity level. We conjecture that a $C^*$-algebra of finite nuclear
dimension and real rank zero has finite complexity; this (and several other
related conjectures) would imply the UCT for all separable nuclear

them expensive and time-consuming. Sample size calculations are often performed
with the assumption of an unadjusted analysis, even if the trial analysis plan
specifies a more efficient estimator (e.g. ANCOVA). This leads to conservative
estimates of required sample sizes and an opportunity for savings. Here we show
that a relatively simple formula can be used to estimate the power of any
two-arm, single-timepoint trial analyzed with a semiparametric efficient
estimator, regardless of the domain of the outcome or kind of treatment effect
(e.g. odds ratio, mean difference). Since an efficient estimator attains the
minimum possible asymptotic variance, this allows for the design of trials that
are as small as possible while still attaining design power and control of type
I error. The required sample size calculation is parsimonious and requires the
analyst to provide only a small number of population parameters. We verify in
simulation that the large-sample properties of trials designed this way attain
their nominal values. Lastly, we demonstrate how to use this formula in the
""design"" (and subsequent reanalysis) of a real clinical trial and show that
fewer subjects are required to attain the same design power when a
semiparametric efficient estimator is accounted for at the design stage.

and present a system were all harmonies are conserved at once. It will become
clear, when we expose our solution, why this solution could not be found in the
way in which earlier on musicians and scientist have been approaching the
problem. We follow indeed a different approach. We first construct a
mathematical representation of the complete harmony by means of a vector space,
where the different tones are represented in complete harmonic way for all keys
at once. One of the essential differences with earlier systems is that tones
will no longer be ordered within an octave, and we find the octave-like
ordering back as a projection of our system. But it is exactly by this
projection procedure that the possibility to create a harmonic system for all
keys at once is lost. So we see why the old way of ordering tones within an
octave could not lead to a solution of the problem. We indicate in which way a
real musical instrument could be built that realizes our harmonic scheme.
Because tones are no longer ordered within an octave such a musical instrument
will be rather unconventional. It is however a physically realizable musical
instrument, at least for the Pythagorean harmony. We also indicate how perfect
harmonies of every dimension could be realized by computers.

a layer of silver paint coated on an insulating DPPH sample is able to excite
the paramagnetic resonance in DPPH. As the applied dc magnetic field H is
swept, the high-frequency resistance of the Ag-paint layer, measured at room

complex relationship between data entities. Currently, most KG embedding models
are trained based on negative sampling, i.e., the model aims to maximize some
similarity of the connected entities in the KG, while minimizing the similarity
of the sampled disconnected entities. Negative sampling helps to reduce the
time complexity of model learning by only considering a subset of negative
instances, which may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the
uncertainty in the sampling procedure. To avoid such deficiency, we propose a
new framework for KG embedding -- Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph
Embedding (NS-KGE). The basic idea is to consider all of the negative instances
in the KG for model learning, and thus to avoid negative sampling. The
framework can be applied to square-loss based knowledge graph embedding models
or models whose loss can be converted to a square loss. A natural side-effect
of this non-sampling strategy is the increased computational complexity of
model learning. To solve the problem, we leverage mathematical derivations to
reduce the complexity of non-sampling loss function, which eventually provides
us both better efficiency and better accuracy in KG embedding compared with
existing models. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our NS-KGE
framework can achieve a better performance on efficiency and accuracy over
traditional negative sampling based models, and that the framework is
applicable to a large class of knowledge graph embedding models.

defined by evaluating the distinguishability of meter states for different

magnitude of the back action of the meter on the system. The trade-off between
measurement resolution and back action is decided by the relation between
sensitivity and quantum coherent uncertainty in the external meter. No matter

coherent in the degrees of freedom that interact with the system being

a tunable graphene-based metasurface to enable analog signal and image

first part of the paper, we propose a switchable analog computing paradigm in
which the proposed metasurface can switch among defined performances by
selecting a proper external voltage for graphene monolayers. Spatial isotropic
differentiation and edge detection in the spatial channel and first-order
temporal differentiation and metasurface-based phaser with linear group-delay
response in the temporal channel are demonstrated. In the second section of the
paper, simultaneous and parallel spatiotemporal analog computing is
demonstrated. The proposed metasurface processor has almost no static power
consumption due to its floating-gate configuration. The spatial- and
temporal-frequency transfer functions (TFs) are engineered by using a
transmission line (TL) model, and the obtained results are validated with
full-wave simulations. Our proposal will enable real-time parallel

emulation of languages that satisfy a strong notion of semantic transparency.
However, for classes of languages where the same expression can take different

we establish fundamental limits on signal-to-noise ratio for reciprocal and

(e.g., non-Markov) transitions between neural states. This model is distinct
from a network with asymmetric Hebbian connectivity and a network trained with

our model, we propose and demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying stable

the context signal and a delayed period) in a working memory task, resulting in
a robust performance against noise and change in a task protocol. These results

speakers by applying bilingual bottleneck features. To boost voice cloning
performance, we use an adversarial speaker classifier with a gradient reversal
layer to reduce the source speaker's information from the output of encoder.
Furthermore, in order to improve speaker similarity between reference speech
and converted speech, we adopt an embedding consistency loss between the
synthesized speech and its natural reference speech in our network.
Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve high quality
converted speech with mean opinion score (MOS) around 4. The conversion system
performs well in terms of speaker similarity for both in-set speaker conversion
and out-set-of one-shot conversion.

that of daytime images in autonomous driving, but the former is much more
challenging due to poor illuminations and arduous human annotations. In this
paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation network (DANNet) for nighttime
semantic segmentation without using labeled nighttime image data. It employs an
adversarial training with a labeled daytime dataset and an unlabeled dataset
that contains coarsely aligned day-night image pairs. Specifically, for the
unlabeled day-night image pairs, we use the pixel-level predictions of static
object categories on a daytime image as a pseudo supervision to segment its
counterpart nighttime image. We further design a re-weighting strategy to
handle the inaccuracy caused by misalignment between day-night image pairs and
wrong predictions of daytime images, as well as boost the prediction accuracy
of small objects. The proposed DANNet is the first one stage adaptation
framework for nighttime semantic segmentation, which does not train additional
day-night image transfer models as a separate pre-processing stage. Extensive
experiments on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime semantic segmentation.

investigate how escapers and the structure evolution of collisional stellar

short-range interactions. We study a group of simulations of ideal low-mass
star clusters in which the accuracy parameters are varied. We find that
although the number of escapers is different in individual simulations, its
distribution from all simulations can be described by Poisson statistics. The
density profile also has a similar feature. By using a self-consistent set-up
of the accuracy parameters for long- and short-range interactions, such that
orbits are resolved well enough, the physical evolution of the models is
identical. But when the short-range accuracy is too low, a nonphysical
dynamical evolution can easily occur; this is not the case for long-range
interactions. This strengthens the need to include a proper algorithm (e.g.
regularization methods) in the realistic modelling of collisional stellar
systems. We also demonstrate that energy-conservation is not a good indicator

controlled by the hardest binary, and thus, it may not reflect the ensemble

inverters are generally inertialess. The transient stability of power systems
dominated by homogeneous GFM devices has been extensively studied. Regarding
the hybrid system jointly dominated by heterogeneous GFM devices, the transient
stability is rarely reported. This paper aims to fill this gap. It is found
that the synchronization behavior of the hybrid system can be described by a
second-order motion equation, resembling the swing equation of SGs. Moreover,
two significant differences from conventional power systems are discovered. The
first is that the droop control dramatically enhances the damping effect,
greatly affecting the transient stability region. The second is that the
frequency state variable exhibits a jump at the moment of fault disturbances,
thus impacting the post-fault initial-state location and stability assessment.
The underlying mechanism behind the two new characteristics is clarified and
the impact on the transient stability performance is analyzed and verified. The

severely change the pandemic's course by interfering with public health

holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents
findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the

mutation score of the given test suite. Seshat exploits the natural language
channel in code, and learns the relationship between the syntactic and semantic
concepts of each test case and the mutants it can kill, from a given kill
matrix. The learnt model can later be used to predict the kill matrices for
subsequent versions of the program, even after both the source and test code
have changed significantly. Empirical evaluation using the programs in the
Defects4J shows that Seshat can predict kill matrices with the average F-score
of 0.83 for versions that are up to years apart. This is an improvement of
F-score by 0.14 and 0.45 point over the state-of-the-art predictive mutation
testing technique, and a simple coverage based heuristic, respectively. Seshat

safety-critical surveillance systems. Especially, deep neural network (DNN)
methods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting
missions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations
could mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust
attack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to
systematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the
attacker's goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades
their performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede
accidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density
background information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches
via a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We
observe that by perturbing less than 6\% of image pixels, our attacks severely
degrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and
physically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting
models, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA),
which is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error
of RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial
examples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. The supplementary

potential to provide valuable information about binary evolution. Binary
population synthesis codes have emerged as the most effective tool for
modelling populations of binary systems, but such codes have traditionally
employed greatly simplified nova physics, precluding detailed study. In this
work, we implement a model treating H and He novae as individual events into
the binary population synthesis code \binaryc. This treatment of novae
represents a significant improvement on the `averaging' treatment currently
employed in modern population synthesis codes. We discuss the evolutionary
pathways leading to these phenomena and present nova event rates and
distributions of several important physical parameters. Most novae are produced
on massive white dwarfs, with approximately 70 and 55 per cent of nova events
occurring on O/Ne white dwarfs for H and He novae respectively. Only 15 per
cent of H-nova systems undergo a common-envelope phase, but these systems are
responsible for the majority of H nova events. All He-accreting He-nova systems
are considered post-common-envelope systems, and almost all will merge with
their donor star in a gravitational-wave driven inspiral. We estimate the
current annual rate of novae in M31 (Andromeda) to be approximately $41 \pm 4$
for H novae, underpredicting the current observational estimate of
$65^{+15}_{-16}$, and $0.14\pm0.015$ for He novae. When varying common-envelope
parameters, the H nova rate varies between 20 and 80 events per year.

mysteries of the Sun is the solar cycle. The activity cycle of the Sun drives
the structure and behaviour of the heliosphere and is, of course, the driver of
space weather. In addition, solar activity and variability provides fluctuating
input into the Earth climate models, and these same physical processes are
applicable to stellar systems hosting exoplanets. One of the main obstructions
to understanding the solar cycle, and hence all solar activity, is our current
lack of understanding of the polar regions. In this White Paper, submitted to

analyzed the motion of helical electron beam along the direction of a uniform

electrical energy storage owing to their high energy densities and low
manufacturing cost. However, their mechanical properties critical to maintain
structural stability at the interface are still insufficiently understood. In
this study, a machine learning based regression model was developed for
predicting the mechanical properties of Na-SSEs. As a training set, 12,361
materials were obtained from a well-known materials database (Materials
Project) and were represented with their respective chemical and structural
descriptors. The developed surrogate model exhibited a remarkable accuracy (R2
score) of 0.72 and 0.87, with a mean absolute error of 11.8 GPa and 15.3 GPa
for the shear and bulk modulus, respectively. This model was then applied to
predict the mechanical properties of 2,432 Na-SSEs, the properties of which
have been validated with first principles calculations. Finally, the
optimization process was performed to develop an ideal materials screening
platform by adding the new minimized dataset, wherein the prediction
uncertainty is reduced. We believe that the platform proposed in this study can
accelerate the search for Na-SSEs with ideal mechanical properties at minimum
cost.

leveraging features of collision avoidance in robotic P&P. The first approach
reduces number of binary variables, which are related to the collision
avoidance of delivery objects, by reformulating them as continuous variables
with additional hard constraints. These hard constraints maintain consistency
by conditionally propagating binary values, which are related to the carry
action state and collision avoidance of robots, to the reformulated continuous
variables. The second approach is more aware of the branch-and-bound method,
which is the fundamental algorithm of modern MILP solvers. This approach guides
the MILP solver to find integer solutions with shallower branching by adding a
soft constraint, which softly restricts a robot's routes around delivery
objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches with a
modern MILP solver.

Once the initial surface density exceeds $\sim 100~M_{\odot}\;{\rm pc^{-2}}$
for clouds with $M_{\rm cl}=10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ and $Z= Z_{\odot}$, most of the
gas is converted into stars because the photoionization feedback is inefficient

and gravitationally bounded as YMCs. The transition surface density increases
as metallicity decreases, and it is $\sim 350~M_{\odot}\;{\rm pc^{-2}}$ for
$Z=10^{-2}~Z_{\odot}$. We show that more than 10 percent of star-formation

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core task in nowadays commercial
recommender systems. Feature crossing, as the mainline of research on CTR
prediction, has shown a promising way to enhance predictive performance.
  Even though various models are able to learn feature interactions without
manual feature engineering, they rarely attempt to individually learn
representations for different feature structures.
  In particular, they mainly focus on the modeling of cross sparse features but
neglect to specifically represent cross dense features.
  Motivated by this, we propose a novel Extreme Cross Network, abbreviated
XCrossNet, which aims at learning dense and sparse feature interactions in an
explicit manner.
  XCrossNet as a feature structure-oriented model leads to a more expressive
representation and a more precise CTR prediction, which is not only explicit
and interpretable, but also time-efficient and easy to implement.
  Experimental studies on Criteo Kaggle dataset show significant improvement of
XCrossNet over state-of-the-art models on both effectiveness and efficiency.

multiagent cooperative game among urban intersections, where intersections
cooperate to optimize their common goal. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)
has achieved marked successes in managing sequential decision making problems,
which motivates us to apply RL in the ASTC problem. Here we use independent
reinforcement learning (IRL) to solve a complex traffic cooperative control
problem in this study. One of the largest challenges of this problem is that
the observation information of intersection is typically partially observable,
which limits the learning performance of IRL algorithms. To this, we model the
traffic control problem as a partially observable weak cooperative traffic
model (PO-WCTM) to optimize the overall traffic situation of a group of
intersections. Different from a traditional IRL task that averages the returns
of all agents in fully cooperative games, the learning goal of each
intersection in PO-WCTM is to reduce the cooperative difficulty of learning,
which is also consistent with the traffic environment hypothesis. We also
propose an IRL algorithm called Cooperative Important Lenient Double DQN
(CIL-DDQN), which extends Double DQN (DDQN) algorithm using two mechanisms: the
forgetful experience mechanism and the lenient weight training mechanism. The
former mechanism decreases the importance of experiences stored in the
experience reply buffer, which deals with the problem of experience failure
caused by the strategy change of other agents. The latter mechanism increases
the weight experiences with high estimation and `leniently' trains the DDQN
neural network, which improves the probability of the selection of cooperative
joint strategies. Experimental results show that CIL-DDQN outperforms other
methods in almost all performance indicators of the traffic control problem.

spectral signature when observed from orbit. This may indicate a greater amount
of surface adsorbed or bound water, although it has not yet been possible to
easily reconcile orbital observations with ground measurements by Phoenix. Here
we re-analyzed OMEGA/Mars Express observations acquired during the Northern
summer to further characterize this 3 ${\mu}$m absorption band increase. We
identify the presence of a new specific spectral signature composed of an
additional narrow absorption feature centered at 3.03 ${\mu}$m coupled with an
absorption at ${\lambda}$ ${\geq}$ 3.8 ${\mu}$m. This signature is
homogeneously distributed over a high-albedo open ring surrounding the
circumpolar low-albedo terrains between ~ 68{\deg}N and 76{\deg}N and ~
0{\deg}E and 270{\deg}E. This location includes the Phoenix landing site. This
feature shows no time variability and can be confidently attributed to a
seasonally stable surface component. All together, the stability, spectral
shape and absence of significant correlation with other signatures in the 1 $-$
2.5 ${\mu}$m range discard interpretations relying on water ice or easily
exchangeable adsorbed water. Sulfates, notably anhydrite, provide interesting
comparisons to several sections of the spectrum. Analogies with Earth samples
also show that the spectral signature could result from a latitudinal
modification of the hydration state and/or grains size of salts contaminants.
While the exact full spectral shape cannot be easily reproduced, plausible
explanations to this observation seem to involve geologically recent water
alteration at high northern latitudes.

understanding natural languages. They are playing a critical role in native ads
service, which facilitates the recommendation of appropriate ads based on
user's web browsing history. For the sake of efficient recommendation,
conventional methods would generate user and advertisement embeddings
independently with a siamese transformer encoder, such that approximate nearest
neighbour search (ANN) can be leveraged. Given that the underlying semantic
about user and ad can be complicated, such independently generated embeddings
are prone to information loss, which leads to inferior recommendation quality.
Although another encoding strategy, the cross encoder, can be much more
accurate, it will lead to huge running cost and become infeasible for realtime
services, like native ads recommendation. In this work, we propose hybrid
encoder, which makes efficient and precise native ads recommendation through
two consecutive steps: retrieval and ranking. In the retrieval step, user and
ad are encoded with a siamese component, which enables relevant candidates to
be retrieved via ANN search. In the ranking step, it further represents each ad
with disentangled embeddings and each user with ad-related embeddings, which
contributes to the fine-grained selection of high-quality ads from the
candidate set. Both steps are light-weighted, thanks to the pre-computed and
cached intermedia results. To optimize the hybrid encoder's performance in this

induced motion of a domain wall in perpendicular anisotropy magnets. In disc of
diameters between 70 and 100 nm, the wall drifts across the disc with
pronounced back-and-forth oscillations that arise because the wall moves in the
Walker regime. Several switching paths occur stochastically and lead to
distinct switching durations. The wall can cross the disc center either in a
ballistic manner or with variably marked oscillations before and after the
crossing. The crossing of the center can even occur multiple times if a
vertical Bloch line nucleates within the wall. The wall motion is analyzed
using a collective coordinate model parametrized by the wall position $q$ and
the tilt $\phi$ of its in-plane magnetization projection. The dynamics results
from the stretch field, which describes the affinity of the wall to reduce its
length and the wall stiffness field describing the wall tendency to reduce
dipolar energy by rotating its tilt. The wall oscillations result from the
continuous exchange of energy between to the two degrees of freedom $q$ and
$\phi$. The stochasticity of the wall dynamics can be understood from the
concept of the retention pond: a region in the $q-\phi$ space in which walls
are transiently bound to the disc center. Walls having trajectories close to
the pond must circumvent it and therefore have longer propagation times. The
retention pond disappears for a disc diameter of typically 40 nm: the wall then
moves in a ballistic manner irrespective of the dynamics of its tilt. The
propagation time is then robust against fluctuations hence reproducible.

of exposure to exhaled droplets remains insufficiently characterized. In this
study, an integrated risk assessment is presented for SARS-CoV-2 close contact
exposure between a speaking infectious subject and a susceptible subject. It is
based on a three-dimensional transient numerical model for the description of
exhaled droplet spread once emitted by a speaking person, coupled with a
recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 emission approach. Particle image velocimetry
measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution
of large droplets to infection risk is dominant for distances < 0.6 m, whereas
for longer distances, the exposure risk depends only on airborne droplets. In
particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m
should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1%; for exposures of 1 and 15
min this distance increases to about 1.0 and 1.5 m, respectively. Based on the
interpersonal distances across countries reported as a function of interacting
individuals, cultural differences, and environmental and sociopsychological
factors, the approach presented here revealed that, in addition to intimate and
personal distances, particular attention must be paid to exposures longer than
1 min within social distances (of about 1 m).

(NLP) but also demonstrate high potential in computer vision (CV). Despite
great advance, most of works only focus on improvement of architectures but pay
little attention to the classification head. For years transformer models base
exclusively on classification token to construct the final classifier, without
explicitly harnessing high-level word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformer model called second-order transformer (SoT), exploiting
simultaneously the classification token and word tokens for the classifier.
Specifically, we empirically disclose that high-level word tokens contain rich

are complementary to the classification token. To effectively harness such rich
information, we propose multi-headed global cross-covariance pooling with
singular value power normalization, which shares similar philosophy and thus is
compatible with the transformer block, better than commonly used pooling
methods. Then, we study comprehensively how to explicitly combine word tokens
with classification token for building the final classification head. For CV
tasks, our SoT significantly improves state-of-the-art vision transformers on
challenging benchmarks including ImageNet and ImageNet-A. For NLP tasks,
through fine-tuning based on pretrained language transformers including GPT and
BERT, our SoT greatly boosts the performance on widely used tasks such as CoLA

Solar Orbiter have characterized prevalent small-scale transient brightenings
in the corona above the quiet Sun termed campfires. Aims. In this study we
search for comparable brightenings in a numerical model and then investigate
their relation to the magnetic field and the processes that drive these events.
Methods. We use the MURaM code to solve the 3D radiation MHD equations in a box
that stretches from the upper convection zone to the corona. The model
self-consistently produces a supergranular network of the magnetic field and a
hot corona above this quiet Sun. For the comparison with the model we
synthesize the coronal emission as seen by EUI in its 174 {\AA} channel,
isolate the seven strongest transient brightenings, and investigate (the
changes of) the magnetic field in and around these in detail. Results. The
transients we isolate have a lifetime of about 2 minutes and are elongated
loop-like features with lengths around 1Mm to 4 Mm. They tend to occur at
heights of about 2Mm to 5Mm above the photosphere a bit offset from magnetic
concentrations that mark the bright chromospheric network and they reach
temperatures of above 1 MK. With this they very much resemble the (larger)
campfires found in observations. In our model most events are energised by
component reconnection between (bundles of) field lines that interact at
coronal heights. In one case we find that untwisting of a highly twisted flux
rope initiates the heating. Conclusions. Based on our study we propose that the
majority of campfire events found by EUI are driven by component reconnection
and our model suggests that this process contributes significantly to the
heating of the corona above the quiet Sun.

that occurred in the active region NOAA 12734 on 8 March 2019. The
investigation utilises data from AIA and HMI on board the SDO and the
Udaipur-CALLISTO solar radio spectrograph of the Physical Research Laboratory.
This low intensity C1.3 event is characterised by typical features of a long
duration event (LDE), viz. extended flare arcade, large-scale two-ribbon
structures and twin coronal dimmings. The eruptive event occurred in a coronal
sigmoid and displayed two distinct stages of energy release, manifested in
terms of temporal and spatial evolution. The formation of twin dimming regions
are consistent with the eruption of a large flux rope with footpoints lying in
the western and eastern edges of the coronal sigmoid. The metric radio
observations obtained from Udaipur-CALLISTO reveals a broad-band
($\approx$50-180 MHz), stationary plasma emission for $\approx$7 min during the
second stage of the flaring activity that resemble a type IV radio burst. A
type III decametre-hectometre radio bursts with starting frequency of
$\approx$2.5 MHz precedes the stationary type IV burst observed by
Udaipur-CALLISTO by $\approx$5 min. The synthesis of multi-wavelength
observations and Non-Linear Force Free Field (NLFFF) coronal modelling together
with magnetic decay index analysis suggests that the sigmoid flux rope
underwent a zipping-like uprooting from its western to eastern footpoints in
response to the overlying asymmetric magnetic field confinement. The
asymmetrical eruption of the flux rope also accounts for the observed
large-scale structures viz. apparent eastward shift of flare ribbons and post
flare loops along the polarity inversion line (PIL), and provides an evidence
for lateral progression of magnetic reconnection site as the eruption proceeds.

implements all operations on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Just as GPUs
played a pivotal role in the success of modern deep learning, they are also
essential for realizing scalable privacy-preserving deep learning. In this
work, we start by introducing a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic
operations over secret-shared values (in a discrete domain) into floating-point
operations that can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels for linear
algebra. We then identify a sequence of ""GPU-friendly"" cryptographic protocols
to enable privacy-preserving evaluation of both linear and non-linear
operations on the GPU. Our microbenchmarks indicate that our private GPU-based
convolution protocol is over 150x faster than the analogous CPU-based protocol;
for non-linear operations like the ReLU activation function, our GPU-based
protocol is around 10x faster than its CPU analog.
  With CryptGPU, we support private inference and private training on
convolutional neural networks with over 60 million parameters as well as handle
large datasets like ImageNet. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, when
considering large models and datasets, our protocols achieve a 2x to 8x
improvement in private inference and a 6x to 36x improvement for private

privacy-preserving machine learning, but also highlights the importance of
designing new MPC primitives that can take full advantage of the GPU's

from jump-driven streamflow dynamics and reservoir water balance. A
continuous-time branching process with immigration driven by a tempered stable
subordinator efficiently describes clustered inflow streamflow dynamics. This
is a completely new attempt in hydrology and control engineering. Applying a
stochastic maximum principle to the dynamics based on an objective functional
for designing cost-efficient control of dam and reservoir systems leads to the
FBSDEs as a system of optimality equations. The FBSDEs under a linear-quadratic
ansatz lead to a tractable model, while they are solved numerically in the
other cases using a least-squares Monte-Carlo method. Optimal controls are
found in the former, while only sub-optimal ones are computable in the latter
due to a hard state constraint. Model parameters are successfully identified
from a real data of a river in Japan having a dam and reservoir system. We also
show that the linear-quadratic case can capture the real operation data of the
system with underestimation of the outflow discharge. More complex cases with a
realistic time horizon are analyzed numerically to investigate impacts of
considering the environmental flows and seasonal operational purposes. Key
challenges towards more sophisticated modeling and analysis with jump-driven

reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection
offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial
to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we
study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage

transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and
decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to
different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned
only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure.
Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based
on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this
framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D
correspondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the

neural networks may be activated by different song types. The aim of the
present study was to show differential functional connectivity of the
prefrontal cortices while listening to breakup and rebellious songs. Breakup
songs describe romance and longing, whereas rebellious songs convey criticism
of conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms. We hypothesized that the medial
and lateral prefrontal cortices may interact with different brain regions in
response to these two song types. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data of
fifteen participants were collected while they were listening to two complete
breakup songs and two complete rebellious songs currently popular in Taiwan.
The results showed that listening to the breakup songs, compared to the
rebellious songs, enhanced the coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex
and several emotion-related regions, including the thalamus, caudate, amygdala,
hippocampus, middle orbitofrontal cortex, and right inferior frontal gyrus.
This coupling may reflect the neural processes of pain empathy, reward
processing, compassion, and reappraisal in response to longing and sorrow
expressed by the breakup songs. Compared to the breakup songs, listening to the
rebellious songs was associated with enhanced coupling between subregions in
the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. These areas might work in concert to
support re-evaluation of conventional ideas or socio-cultural norms as
suggested by the rebellious songs. This study advanced our understanding of the

at a cellular scale. The tiny size of the probe enables a deep exploration of
the tissues. Lensless endoscopy with a multicore fiber (MCF) commonly uses a
spatial light modulator (SLM) to coherently combine, at the output of the MCF,
few hundreds of beamlets into a focus spot. This spot is subsequently scanned
across the sample to generate a fluorescent image. We propose here a novel
scanning scheme, partial speckle scanning (PSS), inspired by compressive
sensing theory, that avoids the use of an SLM to perform fluorescent imaging in
LE with reduced acquisition time. Such a strategy avoids photo-bleaching while
keeping high reconstruction quality. We develop our approach on two key
properties of the LE: (i) the ability to easily generate speckles, and (ii) the
memory effect in MCF that allows to use fast scan mirrors to shift light
patterns. First, we show that speckles are sub-exponential random fields.
Despite their granular structure, an appropriate choice of the reconstruction
parameters makes them good candidates to build efficient sensing matrices.
Then, we numerically validate our approach and apply it on experimental data.
The proposed sensing technique outperforms conventional raster scanning: higher
reconstruction quality is achieved with far fewer observations. For a fixed
reconstruction quality, our speckle scanning approach is faster than
compressive sensing schemes which require to change the speckle pattern for
each observation.

on the excitation of optical radiationless anapole hidden in a resonant state

The coexistence of magnetic resonant state and anapole condition at the same
wavelength further enables the triggering of resonant state by tightly focused
azimuthally polarized (AP) beam whose corresponding electric multipole
coefficient could be zero. As a result, high contrast inter-transition between
radiationless anapole condition and ideal magnetic resonant scattering can be

[F\""ugger et al., IEEE TCAD 2020], which has been shown to be the only existing
candidate for faithful glitch propagation known so far. In its present form,
however, it has shortcomings that limit its practical applicability and
utility. First, IDM delay predictions are conceptually based on discretizing
the analog signal waveforms using specific matching input and output
discretization threshold voltages. Unfortunately, they are difficult to
determine and typically different for interconnected gates. Second,
metastability and high-frequency oscillations in a real circuit could be
invisible in the IDM signal predictions. Our CIDM reduces the characterization
effort by allowing independent discretization thresholds, improves
composability and increases the modeling power by exposing canceled pulse
trains at the gate interconnect. We formally show that, despite these
improvements, the CIDM still retains the IDM's faithfulness, which is a
consequence of the mathematical properties of involution delay functions.

surface functionalization with organic groups did not damage the mesoporous
network and their structural and textural properties were also preserved
despite the high solubility of MBG matrices. The incorporation of Lys confers a
zwitterionic nature to these MBG materials due to the presence of adjacent
amine and carboxylic groups in the external surface. At physiologic pH, this
coexistence of basic amine and carboxilic acid groups from anchored Lys
provided zero surface charge named zwitterionic effect. This behaviour could
give rise to potential applications of antibacterial adhesion. Therefore, in
order to assess the influence of zwitterionic nature in in vitro bacterial
adhesion, studies were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus. It was
demonstrated that the efficient interaction of these zwitterionic pairs onto
the MBG surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion up to 99.9% compared to bare MBGs.
In order to test the suitability of zwitterionic MBGs materials as bone grafts,
their cytocompatibility was investigated in vitro with MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts.
These findings suggested that the proposed surface functionalization strategy
provided MBG materials with notable antibacterial adhesion properties, hence
making these materials promising candidates for local bone infection therapy.

pandemic. Travellers are likely to adapt their behaviour to avoid the risk of
transmission and these changes may even be sustained after the pandemic. To
evaluate travellers' behaviour in public transport networks during these times
and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct
a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands. We
specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of
COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii)
prevalent infection rate.
  Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals
two, nearly equally sized traveller segments: 'COVID Conscious' and 'Infection
Indifferent'. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding,
accepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time to reduce one person
on-board. Moreover, they demonstrate a strong desire to sit without anybody in
their neighbouring seat and are quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent
infection rate. By contrast, Infection Indifferent travellers' value of
crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) is only slightly higher than
pre-pandemic estimates and they are relatively unaffected by infection rates.
We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious
while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic
tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences
between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported
rule-following behaviour. The behavioural insights from this study will not
only contribute to better demand forecasting for service planning but will also
inform public transport policy decisions aimed at curbing the shift to private

clearly distinguish these two non-Fourier regimes only by this phenomenon. In

from the center to the outer. Numerical results show that in quasi-two (three)

scattering dominates heat conduction. Besides, it disappears in quasi-one

with time varying heat source. This novel transient heat propagation phenomenon
of hydrodynamic phonon transport distinguishes it well from (quasi) ballistic

cortex to compose complex shapes and descriptors. While different aspects of
the process have been extensively studied, as the lens adaptation or the
feature detection, some other,as the feature fusion, have been mostly left
aside. In this work we elaborate on the fusion of early vision primitives using
generalizations of the Choquet integral, and novel aggregation operators that
have been extensively studied in recent years. We propose to use
generalizations of the Choquet integral to sensibly fuse elementary edge cues,
in an attempt to model the behaviour of neurons in the early visual cortex. Our
proposal leads to a full-framed edge detection algorithm, whose performance is
put to the test in state-of-the-art boundary detection datasets.

the vehicle motion information and feed it into the model to have an adaptation

the six degrees of freedom vehicle motion into a pixel-wise tensor which can be
fed as input to the CNN model. The proposed model using Vehicle Motion Tensor

impressive performance in challenging sequential decision-making problems.
However, an open question is how to make RL cope with partial observability
which is prevalent in many real-world problems. Contrary to contemporary RL
approaches, which focus mostly on improved memory representations or strong
assumptions about the type of partial observability, we propose a simple but
efficient approach that can be applied together with a wide variety of RL
methods. Our main insight is that smoothly transitioning from full
observability to partial observability during the training process yields a
high performance policy. The approach, called partially observable guided
reinforcement learning (PO-GRL), allows to utilize full state information
during policy optimization without compromising the optimality of the final
policy. A comprehensive evaluation in discrete partially observableMarkov
decision process (POMDP) benchmark problems and continuous partially observable
MuJoCo and OpenAI gym tasks shows that PO-GRL improves performance. Finally, we
demonstrate PO-GRL in the ball-in-the-cup task on a real Barrett WAM robot

a human expert monitoring the procedure from a console. Data scarcity, on the
other hand, hinders what would be a desirable migration towards autonomous
robotic-assisted surgical systems. Automated anomaly detection systems in this
area typically rely on classical supervised learning. Anomalous events in a
surgical setting, however, are rare, making it difficult to capture data to
train a detection model in a supervised fashion. In this work we thus propose
an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection for robotic-assisted surgery
based on deep residual autoencoders. The idea is to make the autoencoder learn
the 'normal' distribution of the data and detect abnormal events deviating from
this distribution by measuring the reconstruction error. The model is trained
and validated upon both the publicly available Cholec80 dataset, provided with
extra annotation, and on a set of videos captured on procedures using
artificial anatomies ('phantoms') produced as part of the Smart Autonomous
Robotic Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) project. The system achieves recall and
precision equal to 78.4%, 91.5%, respectively, on Cholec80 and of 95.6%, 88.1%

physical processes. While there is a notion that the physics model enables
better process understanding and ML algorithms exhibit better predictive
skills, scientific knowledge that does not add to predictive ability may be
deceptive. Hence, there is a need for a hybrid modeling approach to couple ML
algorithms and physics-based models in a synergistic manner. Here we develop a
Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) model that combines the process
understanding of conceptual hydrological model with predictive abilities of
state-of-the-art ML models. We apply the proposed model to predict the monthly

is a crucial data mining task for an intelligent healthcare system. It can
assist doctors in making clinical decisions more efficiently. However, the
inherent complexity of the EHR data renders it as a challenging task: (1)
Multilevel structures: the EHR data typically contains multilevel structures
which are closely related with the decision-making pathways, e.g., laboratory
results lead to disease diagnoses, and then contribute to the prescribed
medications; (2) Multiple sequences interactions: multiple sequences in EHR
data are usually closely correlated with each other; (3) Abundant noise: lots
of task-unrelated features or noise information within EHR data generally
result in suboptimal performance. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a
multilevel selective and interactive network (MeSIN) for medication
recommendation. Specifically, MeSIN is designed with three components. First,
an attentional selective module (ASM) is applied to assign flexible attention
scores to different medical codes embeddings by their relevance to the
recommended medications in every admission. Second, we incorporate a novel
interactive long-short term memory network (InLSTM) to reinforce the
interactions of multilevel medical sequences in EHR data with the help of the
calibrated memory-augmented cell and an enhanced input gate. Finally, we employ
a global selective fusion module (GSFM) to infuse the multi-sourced information
embeddings into final patient representations for medications recommendation.
To validate our method, extensive experiments have been conducted on a
real-world clinical dataset. The results demonstrate a consistent superiority
of our framework over several baselines and testify the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

procedures that first apply a linear spatial filter, a so-called beamformer,
and combine it with a single-channel approach for postprocessing. However, the
serial concatenation of a linear spatial filter and a postfilter is not
generally optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense for noise
distributions other than a Gaussian distribution. Rather, the MMSE optimal
filter is a joint spatial and spectral nonlinear function. While estimating the
parameters of such a filter with traditional methods is challenging, modern
neural networks may provide an efficient way to learn the nonlinear function
directly from data. To see if further research in this direction is worthwhile,
in this work we examine the potential performance benefit of replacing the
common two-step procedure with a joint spatial and spectral nonlinear filter.
  We analyze three different forms of non-Gaussianity: First, we evaluate on
super-Gaussian noise with a high kurtosis. Second, we evaluate on inhomogeneous
noise fields created by five interfering sources using two microphones, and
third, we evaluate on real-world recordings from the CHiME3 database. In all
scenarios, considerable improvements may be obtained. Most prominently, our
analyses show that a nonlinear spatial filter uses the available spatial
information more effectively than a linear spatial filter as it is capable of
suppressing more than $D-1$ directional interfering sources with a
$D$-dimensional microphone array without spatial adaptation.

contrary to naive expectations. However, when the equations of motion are
solved using a qualitative non-perturbative resummation, the dependence on the

decrease. The piecewise nature of the dependence is related to the dynamics of
branch point singularities of the energy-momentum tensor finite-temperature
two-point functions in the complex plane of spatial momentum squared. We repeat
the study using the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a model where the
equations can be solved fully non-perturbatively, and find the expected
decrease of the radii of convergence with the effective inverse coupling which
is also piecewise continuous. Finally, we provide arguments in favour of the

measurements acquired in identical conditions, which is crucial in order to

a multi-paradigm language with a well-defined semantics, allowing one to write

language of choice for the implementation of sensible software, e.g.,
industrial compilers, proof assistants, and automated solvers. Yet, with the
notable exception of some interactive tools, formal verification has been

consider the uplink channel estimation for time-division duplexing systems. To
reduce the uplink pilot overhead for estimating the high-dimensional channels
from a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains at the base station (BS),
we propose to jointly train the phase shift network and the channel estimator
as an auto-encoder. Particularly, by exploiting the channels' structured
sparsity from an a priori model and learning the integrated trainable
parameters from the data samples, the proposed multiple-measurement-vectors
learned approximate message passing (MMV-LAMP) network with the devised
redundant dictionary can jointly recover multiple subcarriers' channels with
significantly enhanced performance. Moreover, we consider the downlink channel
estimation and feedback for frequency-division duplexing systems. Similarly,
the pilots at the BS and channel estimator at the users can be jointly trained
as an encoder and a decoder, respectively. Besides, to further reduce the
channel feedback overhead, only the received pilots on part of the subcarriers
are fed back to the BS, which can exploit the MMV-LAMP network to reconstruct
the spatial-frequency channel matrix. Numerical results show that the proposed
MDDL-based channel estimation and feedback scheme outperforms the

scenario. For example, there are estimated more than 40 different kinds of
retinal diseases with variable morbidity, however with more than 30+ conditions

long-tailed learning problem for deep learning-based screening models. In this
study, we propose class subset learning by dividing the long-tailed data into
multiple class subsets according to prior knowledge, such as regions and
phenotype information. It enforces the model to focus on learning the
subset-specific knowledge. More specifically, there are some relational classes
that reside in the fixed retinal regions, or some common pathological features
are observed in both the majority and minority conditions. With those subsets
learnt teacher models, then we are able to distill the multiple teacher models

rapidly-exploring random trees for fast online replanning of autonomous
vehicles in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed algorithm
is built upon the RRT algorithm with a multi-tree structure. At the beginning,
the RRT algorithm is applied to find the initial solution based on partial
knowledge of the environment. Then, the robot starts to execute this path. At
each iteration, the new obstacle configurations are collected by the robot's
sensor and used to replan the path. This new information can come from unknown
static obstacles (e.g., seafloor layout) as well as moving obstacles. Then, to
accommodate the environmental changes, two procedures are adopted: 1) edge
pruning, and 2) tree regrowing. Specifically, the edge pruning procedure checks
the collision status through the tree and only removes the invalid edges while
maintaining the tree structure of already-explored regions. Due to removal of
invalid edges, the tree could be broken into multiple disjoint trees. As such,
the RRT algorithm is applied to regrow the trees. Specifically, a sample is
created randomly and joined to all the disjoint trees in its local neighborhood
by connecting to the nearest nodes. Finally, a new solution is found for the
robot. The advantages of the proposed MRRT algorithm are as follows: i) retains
the maximal tree structure by only pruning the edges which collide with the
obstacles, ii) guarantees probabilistic completeness, and iii) is computational
efficient for fast replanning since all disjoint trees are maintained for
future connections and expanded simultaneously.

The hybrid form of Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm (MLSGA) already
shows good performance on range of problems due to its diversity-first
approach, which is rare among Evolutionary Algorithms. To increase the
generality of its performance this paper proposes a distinct set of
co-evolutionary mechanisms, which defines co-evolution as competition between
collectives rather than individuals. This distinctive approach to
co-evolutionary provides less regular communication between sub-populations and
different fitness definitions between individuals and collectives. This
encourages the collectives to act more independently creating a unique
sub-regional search, leading to the development of co-evolutionary MLSGA
(cMLSGA). To test this methodology nine genetic algorithms are selected to
generate several variants of cMLSGA, which incorporates these approaches at the
individual level. The new mechanisms are tested on over 100 different functions
and benchmarked against the 9 state-of-the-art competitors in order to find the
best general solver. The results show that the diversity of co-evolutionary
approaches is more important than their individual performances. This allows
the selection of two competing algorithms that improve the generality of
cMLSGA, without large loss of performance on any specific problem type. When
compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed methodology is the most
universal and robust, leading to an algorithm more likely to solve complex

construct splitting authentication codes with good properties. In this paper we
show that a design-theoretic approach is useful in the analysis of more general
splitting authentication codes. Motivated by the study of algebraic
manipulation detection (AMD) codes, we define the concept of a group generated
splitting authentication code. We show that all group-generated authentication
codes have perfect secrecy, which allows us to demonstrate that algebraic
manipulation detection codes can be considered to be a special case of an
authentication code with perfect secrecy.
  We also investigate splitting BIBDs that can be ""equitably ordered"". These
splitting BIBDs yield authentication codes with splitting that also have
perfect secrecy. We show that, while group generated BIBDs are inherently
equitably ordered, the concept is applicable to more general splitting BIBDs.
For various pairs $(k,c)$, we determine necessary and sufficient (or almost
sufficient) conditions for the existence of $(v, k \times c,1)$-splitting BIBDs
that can be equitably ordered. The pairs for which we can solve this problem
are $(k,c) = (3,2), (4,2), (3,3)$ and $(3,4)$, as well as all cases with $k =

classified as Sy1.5 during the late spring of 2020. We have measured time
delays in the responses of the Balmer and He II 4686 lines to continuum
variations. In the case of the best-characterized broad H-beta line, the delay
to continuum variability is about 17 days in the blue wing and is clearly
shorter, 9 days, in the red, which is suggestive of inflow. As the broad lines
strengthened, the blue side came to dominate the Balmer lines, resulting in
very asymmetric profiles with blueshifted peaks during this high state. During
the outburst the X-ray flux reached its maximum on 1 April 2020 and it was the
highest value ever observed for NGC 3516 by the Swift observatory. The X-ray
hard photon index became softer, about 1.8 in the maximum on 21 Apr 2020
compared to the mean about 0.7 during earlier epochs before 2020. We have found
that the UV and optical variations correlated well (with a small time delay of
1-2 days) with the X-ray until the beginning of April 2020, but later, until
the end of Jun. 2020, these variations were not correlated. We suggest that
this fact may be a consequence of partial obscuration by Compton-thick clouds

investigation of a special class of adaptive digital filters: Orthonormal
filter banks possess the robust and simple adaptation of the widely applied
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, but at a lower model order, which is
important when considering implementation on embedded systems. However, the
filter banks require prior knowledge about the resonance frequencies and
damping of the structure. This knowledge can be supposed to be of limited
precision, since in many practical systems, uncertainties in the structural
parameters exist. In this work, a procedure using a number of training systems
to find the fixed parameters for the filter banks is applied. The effect of
uncertainties in the prior knowledge on the model error is examined both with a
basic example and in an experiment. Furthermore, the possibilities to
compensate for the imprecise prior knowledge by a higher filter order are
investigated. Also comparisons with FIR filters are implemented in order to
assess the possible advantages of the orthonormal filter banks. Numerical and
experimental investigations show that significantly lower computational effort
can be reached by the filter banks under certain conditions.

sharpness depends strongly on the inclination of the system within $\theta_c$,

significance, which override the longer near-source pulses. Our wavelet
analysis identified 109 pulse-like records from normal faults, 188 records from
reverse faults and 125 records from strike-slip faults, all with epicentral
distances $D\leq$ 20 km. Regression analysis on the extracted data concluded
that the same $T_p$--$M_\text{W}$ relation can be used for pulse-like ground
motions generated either from strike-slip faults or from normal faults;
whereas, a different $T_p$--$M_{\text{W}}$ relation is proposed for reverse
faults. The study concludes that for the same moment magnitude, $M_{\text{W}}$,
the pulse periods of ground motions generated from strike-slip faults are on
average larger than these from reverse faults. Most importantly, our wavelet
analysis on acceleration records produces $T_p$--$M_{\text{W}}$ relations with
a lower slope than the slopes of the $T_p$--$M_{\text{W}}$ relations presented
by past investigators after merely fitting velocity pulses. As a result, our
proposed $T_p$--$M_{\text{W}}$ relations yield lower $T_p$ values for
larger-magnitude earthquakes (say $M_{\text{W}}>$ 6), allowing for the
estimation of dependable peak structural displacements that scale invariably
with $a_pT_p^{\text{2}}$.

theoretical models are established to work or not to work for a few members of
the class, it is often the case that some researchers will make arguments on
the basis of Occam's razor that all members of the class must be produced by
whichever mechanism first successfully explained one of the objects. It is also
frequent that this assumption will be more more implicitly. Retrospective
analysis shows rather clearly that this argument fails a large fraction of the
time, and in many cases, this search for false consistency has led to more
fundamental astrophysical errors, a few of which are quite prominent in the
history of astronomy. A corollary of this is that on numerous occasions,
theoretical models to explain transients have turned out to be models that
describe real (but often not yet discovered) phenomenona other than the ones to
which they have first been applied, albeit with minor errors that caused the
model to appear to fit to a known phenomenon it did not describe. A set of
examples of such events is presented here (some of which will be quite familiar
to most astronomers), along with a discussion of why this phenomenon occurs,
how it may be manifesting itself at the present time. Some discussion will also
be made of why and when survey designs have led to immediate separation of
various transient mechanisms, generally by being overpowered in some way
relative to what is needed to {\it detect} a new class of objects.

combination of a shear flow and a turbulent coefficient $\beta_{21}$ with a
favorable negative sign for exponential mean-field growth, rather than positive
for diffusion. There have been long standing disagreements among theoretical
calculations and comparisons of theory with numerical experiments as to the
sign of kinetic ($\beta^u_{21}$) and magnetic ($\beta^b_{21}$) contributions.
To resolve these discrepancies, we combine an analytical approach with
simulations, and show that unlike $\beta^b_{21}$, the kinetic SCE
$\beta^u_{21}$ has a strong dependence on the kinetic energy spectral index and
can transit from positive to negative values at $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Reynolds
numbers if the spectrum is not too steep. Conversely, $\beta^b_{21}$ is always
negative regardless of the spectral index and Reynolds numbers. For very steep
energy spectra, the positive $\beta^u_{21}$ can dominate even at energy
equipartition $u_\text{rms}\simeq b_\text{rms}$, resulting in a positive total
$\beta_{21}$ even though $\beta^b_{21}<0$. Our findings bridge the gap between
the seemingly contradictory results from the second-order-correlation
approximation (SOCA) versus the spectral-$\tau$ closure (STC), for which
opposite signs for $\beta^u_{21}$ have been reported, with the same sign for
$\beta^b_{21}<0$. The results also offer an explanation for the simulations
that find $\beta^u_{21}>0$ and an inconclusive overall sign of $\beta_{21}$ for
$\mathcal{O}(10)$ Reynolds numbers. The transient behavior of $\beta^u_{21}$ is
demonstrated using the kinematic test-field method. We compute dynamo growth

dictate a sub-optimal calibration of plasticity- and fracture-related
parameters for a large number of material properties. These parameters enter
the system of partial differential equations as a forward model. In this work,
we develop a step-wise Bayesian inversion framework for ductile fracture to
provide accurate knowledge regarding the effective mechanical parameters. To
this end, synthetic and experimental observations are used to estimate the
posterior density of the unknowns. To model the ductile failure behavior of
solid materials, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture, for which we
present a unified formulation that allows recovering different models on a
variational basis. In the variational framework, incremental minimization
principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to
derive the governing equations. The overall formulation is revisited and
extended to the case of anisotropic ductile fracture. Three different models
are subsequently recovered by certain choices of parameters and constitutive
functions, which are later assessed through Bayesian inversion techniques. To
estimate the posterior density function of ductile material parameters, three
common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are employed: (i) the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, (ii) delayed-rejection adaptive Metropolis, and
(iii) ensemble Kalman filter combined with MCMC. To examine the computational
efficiency of the MCMC methods, we employ the R-convergence tool.

of the Drude weight of the edge spin Seebeck effect in the Kitaev model.
Moreover, the absence of backscatterings in the chiral edge mode results in the
generation of a dissipationless spin current in spite of an extremely short
spin correlation length close to a lattice constant in the bulk. This result is
not only experimentally observable, but also opens a way towards spintronics
application of Kitaev materials. In contrast to magnetically ordered systems, a

symmetric elastic bodies is introduced which extends the two-parameters class
of polytropic fluid models widely used in several applications of fluid
mechanics. The four parameters in the polytropic elastic model are the
polytropic exponent $\gamma$, the bulk modulus $\kappa$, the shear exponent
$\beta$ and the Poisson ratio $\nu\in (-1,1/2]$. The two-parameters class of
polytropic fluid models arises as a special case when $\nu=1/2$ and
$\beta=\gamma$. In contrast to the standard Lagrangian approach in elasticity
theory, the polytropic elastic model in this paper is formulated directly in
physical space, i.e., in terms of Eulerian state variables, which is
particularly useful for the applications e.g. to astrophysics where the
reference state of the bodies of interest (stars, planets, etc.) is not
observable. After discussing some general properties of the polytropic elastic
model, the steady states and the homologous motion of Newtonian
self-gravitating polytropic elastic balls are investigated. It is shown
numerically that static balls exist when the parameters $\gamma,\beta$ are
contained in a particular region $\mathcal{O}$ of the plane, depending on
$\nu$, and proved analytically for $(\gamma,\beta)\in\mathcal{V}$, where
$\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{O}$ is a disconnected set which also depends on the
Poisson ratio $\nu$. Homologous solutions describing continuously collapsing
balls are constructed numerically when $\gamma=4/3$. The radius of these
solutions shrinks to zero in finite time, causing the formation of a center
singularity with infinite density and pressure. Expanding self-gravitating
homologous elastic balls are also constructed analytically for some special
values of the shear parameter $\beta$.

Adapting the model avoids the need for complicated decoding time fusions and
external language models. Using appropriate regularization, the prediction
network can be adapted to new domains while still retaining good generalization

we propose a novel approach based on deep learning (a subfield of artificial
intelligence) that flags cartel participants based on their pairwise bidding
interactions with other firms. More concisely, we combine a so-called
convolutional neural network for image recognition with graphs that in a
pairwise manner plot the normalized bid values of some reference firm against
the normalized bids of any other firms participating in the same tenders as the
reference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct such
graphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging
cartel is or is not active) and use a subset of graphs to train the neural
network such that it learns distinguishing collusive from competitive bidding
patterns. We use the remaining graphs to test the neural network's
out-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive
bidding interactions. We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 90% or
slightly higher when either applying the method within Japanese, Swiss, or
mixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When using data
from one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the
other country (i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely
due to institutional differences in procurement procedures across countries),
but often remains satisfactorily high. All in all, the generally quite high
accuracy of the convolutional neural network despite being trained in a rather
small sample of a few 100 graphs points to a large potential of deep learning
approaches for flagging and fighting bid-rigging cartels.

critical infrastructure and the Internet at large; detecting anomalous behavior
from these devices remains of critical importance, but fast, efficient,
accurate anomaly detection (also called ""novelty detection"") for these classes
of devices remains elusive. One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one
of the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection)
in machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear
boundaries between {normal} and {novel} data. IoT devices in smart homes and
cities and connected building infrastructure present a compelling use case for
novelty detection with OCSVM due to the variety of devices, traffic patterns,
and types of anomalies that can manifest in such environments. Much previous
research has thus applied OCSVM to novelty detection for IoT. Unfortunately,
conventional OCSVMs introduce significant memory requirements and are
computationally expensive at prediction time as the size of the train set
grows, requiring space and time that scales with the number of training points.
These memory and computational constraints can be prohibitive in practical,
real-world deployments, where large training sets are typically needed to
develop accurate models when fitting complex decision boundaries. In this work,
we extend so-called Nystr\""om and (Gaussian) Sketching approaches to OCSVM, by
combining these methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models to achieve
significant speedups in prediction time and space in various IoT settings,
without sacrificing detection accuracy.

identification solution where a Deep Metric Learning model that is trained with
Proxy Anchor Loss (PAL) function generates embedding vectors for each pill
image. The generated embedding vectors are fed into a one-layer fully connected

image. Then, the aggregation/verification function aggregates the multiple
predictions coming from multiple single pill images and verifies the
correctness of the final prediction with respect to predefined rules. Besides,
we enhanced the PAL with a better proxy initialization that increased the
performance of the models and let the model learn the new classes of images
continually without retraining the model with the whole dataset. When the model
that is trained with initial classes is retrained only with new classes, the
accuracy of the model increases for both old and new classes. The

the agency to choose an outcome then presumably it would choose a pleasant over

in a third person theory. If a preference is strong it gives rise to a force
causing a deterministic evolution, while weak preferences give rise to
non-deterministic evolutions. Quantum physics assigns a high degree of
non-determinism to large systems of qubits, a Knightian uncertainty, in which
one can not even assign probabilities to observed outcomes. This can give

have no semantic connection to the actual task. Networks relying on such
shortcuts bear the risk of not generalizing well to unseen inputs.
Explainability methods help to uncover such network vulnerabilities. However,
many of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network
is constrained, in so-called black-box setups. These setups are prevalent when
using third-party ML components. To address this constraint, we present an
approach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network

guarantees on introspection we automatically extract candidates for learned
shortcuts. Their transferability to the black box is validated in a systematic
fashion. Concretely, as proxy model we choose a BagNet, which bases its

(DLKFM). The learned DLKFM can spontaneously recognize invariant features under
various appearance-changing conditions. It also has two nice properties for the
Lucas-Kanade algorithm: (1) The template feature map keeps brightness
consistency with the input feature map, thus the color difference is very small
while they are well-aligned. (2) The Lucas-Kanade objective function built on
DLKFM has a smooth landscape around ground truth homography parameters, so the
iterative solution of the Lucas-Kanade can easily converge to the ground truth.
With those properties, directly updating the Lucas-Kanade algorithm on our
feature maps will precisely align image pairs with large appearance changes. We

  arXiv:2007.12845",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Why can the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixture models
converge? Why can different initial parameters cause various convergence
difficulties? The Q-L synchronization theory explains that the observed data
log-likelihood L and the complete data log-likelihood Q are positively
correlated; we can achieve maximum L by maximizing Q. According to this theory,
the Deterministic Annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm's authors make great efforts to
eliminate locally maximal Q for avoiding L's local convergence. However, this
paper proves that in some cases, Q may and should decrease for L to increase;
slow or local convergence exists only because of small samples and unfair
competition. This paper uses marriage competition to explain different
convergence difficulties and proposes the Fair Competition Principle (FCP) with
an initialization map for improving initializations. It uses the
rate-verisimilitude function, extended from the rate-distortion function, to
explain the convergence of the EM and improved EM algorithms. This convergence
proof adopts variational and iterative methods that Shannon et al. used for
analyzing rate-distortion functions. The initialization map can vastly save
both algorithms' running times for binary Gaussian mixtures. The FCP and the
initialization map are useful for complicated mixtures but not sufficient; we
need further studies for specific methods.

This is arguably due to the development of varieties of soybean and corn

soybeans in the same year. Corn and soybean market participants increasingly
look to Brazil for fundamental price information, and studies have shown that
the two markets have become cointegrated. However little is known about how
much volatility from each market spills over to the other. In this article we
measure volatility spillover ratios between U.S. and Brazilian first crop corn,
second crop corn, and soybeans. We find that linkages between the two countries
increased after double cropping corn after soybeans expanded, volatility
spillover magnitudes expanded, and the direction of volatility spillovers
flipped from U.S. volatility spilling over to Brazil before double cropping, to
Brazil spilling over to U.S. after double cropping.

countries around the world so that many hospitals have been overwhelmed with
Covid-19 cases. As medical resources are limited, deciding on the proper
allocation of these resources is a very crucial issue. Besides, uncertainty is
a major factor that can affect decisions, especially in medical fields. To cope
with this issue, we use fuzzy logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in
modeling systems with high uncertainty and complexity. We intend to make use of
the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in ICU. In this
study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for prediction of ICU
admission in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these
fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known classification methods such as
Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT), and K Nearest

peak temperatures and transient variations in temperature in electronic
devices. But as the power levels increase, the thermal conduction pathway from
the heat source to the heat sink limits the effectiveness of these systems. In
this work, we evaluate embedding the PCM within the silicon device layer of an
electronic device to minimize the thermal resistance between the source and the
PCM to minimize this thermal resistance and enhance the thermal performance of
the device. The geometry and material properties of the embedded PCM regions
are optimized using a combination of parametric and machine learning
algorithms. For a fixed geometry, considering commercially available materials,
Solder 174 significantly outperforms other organic and metallic PCMs. Also with
a fixed geometry, the optimal melting points to minimize the peak temperature
is higher than the optimal melting point to minimize the amplitude of the
transient temperature oscillation, and both optima increase with increasing
heater power. Extending beyond conventional optimization strategies, genetic
algorithms and particle swarm optimization with and without neural network
surrogate models are used to enable optimization of many geometric and material
properties. For the test case evaluated, the optimized geometries and
properties are similar between all ML-assisted algorithms, but the
computational time depends on the technique. Ultimately, the optimized design
with embedded phase change materials reduces the maximum temperature rise by
19% and the fluctuations by up to 88% compared to devices without PCM.

theory, starting from backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and
leading to biomedical applications. Darwinian evolution has organized each
protein family in different ways, but dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is
both simple and effective in providing readily transferable dynamical insights
for many proteins represented in the uncounted amino acid sequences, as well as
the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base.
Critical point theory is general, and recently it has proved to be the most
effective way of describing protein networks that have evolved towards nearly
perfect functionality in given environments, self-organized criticality.
Darwinian evolutionary patterns are governed by common dynamical hydropathic
scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been
developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of static PDB structures. The
most effective dynamical scales involve hydropathic globular sculpting
interactions averaged over length scales centered on domain dimensions. A
central feature of dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is the characteristic
domain length associated with a given protein functionality. Evolution has
functioned in such a way that the minimal critical length scale established so
far is about nine amino acids, but in some cases it is much larger. Some
ingenuity is needed to find this primary length scale, as shown by the examples
discussed here. Often a survey of the Darwinian evolution of a protein sequence
suggests a means of determining the critical length scale. The evolution of
Coronavirus is an interesting application; it identifies critical mutations.

streams of heavy-duty mission-critical processing tasks, such as real-time
obstacle detection and navigation. However, in practical applications, erratic
patterns in channel quality, network load, and edge server load can interrupt
the task flow execution, which necessarily leads to severe disruption of the
system's key operations. Existing work has mostly tackled the problem with
reactive approaches, which cannot guarantee task-level reliability. Conversely,
in this paper we focus on learning-based predictive edge computing to achieve
self-resilient task offloading. By conducting a preliminary experimental
evaluation, we show that there is no dominant feature that can predict the
edge-MAS system reliability, which calls for an ensemble and selection of
weaker features. To tackle the complexity of the problem, we propose SeReMAS, a
data-driven optimization framework. We first mathematically formulate a
Redundant Task Offloading Problem (RTOP), where a MAS may connect to multiple
edge servers for redundancy, and needs to select which server(s) to transmit
its computing tasks in order to maximize the probability of task execution
while minimizing channel and edge resource utilization. We then create a
predictor based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which produces the
optimum task assignment based on application-, network- and telemetry-based
features. We prototype SeReMAS on a testbed composed by a drone, mounting a
PixHawk flight controller, a Jetson Nano board, and three 802.11n WiFi
interfaces. We extensively evaluate SeReMAS by considering an application where
one drone offloads high-resolution images for real-time analysis to three edge
servers on the ground. Experimental results show that SeReMAS improves task
execution probability by $17\%$ with respect to existing reactive-based
approaches.
