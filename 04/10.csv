of random numbers employed in many scientific and cryptographic applications.
However, entanglement-based certified random number generators are particularly
challenging to implement. Here, we demonstrate a new certified quantum random
number generator based on momentum-polarization entangled single photon states.
The use of single photon entanglement allows employing an attenuated laser
source and a simple setup where only linear optical components are utilized.
For the latter, a semi-device-independent modeling of the photonic quantum
random number generator is developed, which certifies a minimum entropy of
$(2.5\pm 0.5)\%$, corresponding to a generation rate of 4.4 kHz. At the
expenses of a higher level of trust in the system, the certified minimum
entropy can be increased to $(30.1 \pm0.5 )\%$, implying a generation rate of
52.7 kHz. Our results show that a simple optical implementation combined with
an accurate modeling provide an entanglement-based high-security quantum random
number generator using imperfect devices.

critical for the development of large scale quantum computers. We consider an
experimentally motivated situation, in which we have a decent estimate of the
Hamiltonian, and its parameters need to be characterized and fine-tuned
frequently to combat drifting experimental variables. We use a machine learning
technique known as meta-learning to learn a more efficient optimizer for this
task. We consider training with the nearest-neighbor Ising model and study the
trained model's generalizability to other Hamiltonian models and larger system
sizes. We observe that the meta-optimizer outperforms other optimization
methods in average loss over test samples. This advantage follows from the
meta-optimizer being less likely to get stuck in local minima, which highly
skews the distribution of the final loss of the other optimizers. In general,
meta-learning decreases the number of calls to the experiment and reduces the
needed classical computational resources.

The revised structure is $P2_1/m$, with two dimerized stacks per unit cell, and
is consistent with the vibrational data. However, polarized Raman data in the
low-frequency region also indicate that by increasing temperature above 200 K
the structure presents an increasing degree of disorder mainly along the stack
axis. X-ray diffraction data at room temperature have confirmed that the
correct structure is $P2_1/m$ -- no phase transitions -- but did not allow to
definitely substantiate the presence of disorder. On the other hand, dielectric
measurement have evidenced a typical relaxor ferroelectric behavior already at
room temperature, with a peak in real part of dielectric constant
$\epsilon'(T,\nu)$ around 200 K and 0.1 Hz. The relaxor behavior is explained
in terms of the presence of spin solitons separating domains of opposite
polarity that yield to ferroelectric nanodomains. TMB-TCNQF4 is confirmed to be
a narrow gap band semiconductor ($E_a \sim 0.3$ eV) with room temperature
conductivity of $\sim 10^{-4}~ \Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$.

$(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly has important implications for allowed particle spectra in
softly broken supersymmetry (SUSY) models with neutralino dark matter (DM).
Generally, the DM has to be quite light, with the mass up to a few hundred GeV,
and bino-dominated if it is to provide most of DM in the Universe. Otherwise, a
higgsino or wino dominated DM is also allowed but only as a strongly
subdominant component of at most a few percent of the total density. These
general patterns can easily be found in the phenomenological models of SUSY but
in GUT-constrained scenarios this proves much more challenging. In this paper
we revisit the issue in the framework of some unified SUSY models with
different GUT boundary conditions on the soft masses. We study the so-called
non-universal gaugino model (NUGM) in which the mass of the gluino is
disunified from those of the bino and the wino and an SO(10) and an SU(5)
GUT-inspired models as examples. We find that in these unified frameworks the
above two general patterns of DM can also be found, and thus the muon anomaly
can also be accommodated, unlike in the simplest frameworks of the CMSSM or the
NUHM. We show the resulting values of direct detection cross-section for points
that do and do not satisfy the muon anomaly. On the other hand, it will be
challenging to access those solutions at the LHC because the resulting spectra
are generally very compressed.

parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion of pump photons, whose
efficiency is increased by fabrication errors in the periodic poling. Here we
characterise the poling quality of commercial periodically-poled bulk potassium
titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) by measuring the sum-frequency generation (SFG)
efficiency over a large phase mismatch range from 0 to more than 400$\pi$. Over
the probed range the SFG efficiency behaves nearly ideally and drops to a
normalised efficiency of $10^{-6}$. Our results demonstrate that any background
pedestal which would be formed by random duty cycle errors in ppKTP is
substantially reduced when compared to periodically poled lithium niobate. The
standard deviation of the random duty cycle errors can be estimated to be
smaller than 2% of the domain length. From this, we expect a noise spectral
density which is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of current
state-of-the-art single-step frequency converters.

complex. In particular, this class is not well-quasi-ordered by induced
subgraphs, and the clique-width is not bounded in it. In the present paper, we
show that the universe of quasi-chain graphs is at least as complex as the
universe of permutations by establishing a bijection between the class of all
permutations and a subclass of quasi-chain graphs. This implies, in particular,
that the induced subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete for quasi-chain
graphs. On the other hand, we propose a decomposition theorem for quasi-chain
graphs that implies an implicit representation for graphs in this class and
efficient solutions for some algorithmic problems that are generally
intractable.

investigated. We show that considering the classical powers correlation could
lead to a spurious assessment of the volatility persistency or long memory
volatility effects, if the zero returns probability is non-constant over time.
In other words, the classical tools are not able to distinguish between
long-run volatility effects, such as IGARCH, and the case where the zero
returns are not evenly distributed over time. As a consequence, tools that are
robust to changes in the degree of illiquidity are proposed. Since a
time-varying zero returns probability could potentially be accompanied by a
non-constant unconditional variance, we then develop powers correlations that
are also robust in such a case. In addition, note that the tools proposed in
the paper offer a rigorous analysis of the short-run volatility effects, while
the use of the classical power correlations lead to doubtful conclusions. The
Monte Carlo experiments, and the study of the absolute value correlation of
some stocks taken from the Chilean financial market, suggest that the
volatility effects are only short-run in many cases.

reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large
models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations
required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training
times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and
pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these
methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to
expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting
on other devices to make progress.
  In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor,
pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs
and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline
parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that
can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing
approaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline,

motivated by the complexity and computational cost of high-fidelity simulations

post-failure full-field stress distribution and crack pattern in
two-dimensional representations of the composites based on the geometry of
microstructures. The material of interest is selected to be a high-performance
unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite. The deep learning
framework contains two stacked fully-convolutional networks, namely, Generator
1 and Generator 2, trained sequentially. First, Generator 1 learns to translate
the microstructural geometry to the full-field post-failure stress
distribution. Then, Generator 2 learns to translate the output of Generator 1
to the failure pattern. A physics-informed loss function is also designed and
incorporated to further improve the performance of the proposed framework and
facilitate the validation process. In order to provide a sufficiently large
data set for training and validating the deep learning framework, 4500
microstructural representations are synthetically generated and simulated in an
efficient finite element framework. It is shown that the proposed deep learning

growth and division processes. From extensive single-cell experiments by using
E. coli strains with different promoter strength (over two orders of magnitude)
and under different nutrient conditions, we found that the variance of protein
concentration fluctuations follows a robust square power-law dependence on its
mean, which belongs to a general phenomenon called Taylor's law. To understand
the mechanistic origin of this observation, we use a minimal mechanistic model
to describe the stochastic growth and division processes in a single cell with
a feedback mechanism for regulating cell division. The model reproduces the
observed Taylor's law. The predicted protein concentration distributions agree
quantitatively with those measured in experiments for different nutrient
conditions and a wide range of promoter strength. By using a mean-field
approximation, we derived a single Langevin equation for protein concentration
with multiplicative noise, which can be solved exactly to prove the square
Taylor's law and to obtain an analytical solution for the protein concentration
distribution function that agrees with experiments. Analysis of experiments by
using our model showed that noise in production rates dominates over noise from
cell division in contributing to protein concentration fluctuations. In
general, a multiplicative noise in the underlying stochastic dynamics may be
responsible for Taylor's law in other systems.

from the Vlasov equation for oscillating equilibrium distribution functions,
and used to demonstrate that the plasma has an infinite number of unstable
kinetic modes. This instability represents a new kinetic mechanism for the
decay of the initial mode of infinite wavelength (or equivalently null
wavenumber), for which no classical wave breaking or Landau damping exists. The
relativistic generalization of the instability is discussed. In this regime,
the growth rate of the fastest growing unstable modes scales with
$\gamma_T^{-1/2}$, where $\gamma_T$ is the largest Lorentz factor of the plasma
distribution. This result hints that this instability is not as severely
suppressed for large Lorentz factor flows as purely streaming instabilities.
The relevance of this instability in inductive electric field oscillations
driven in pulsar magnetospheres is discussed.

shown that ad delivery on such platforms can be skewed by gender or race due to
hidden algorithmic optimization by the platforms, even when not requested by
the advertisers. Building on prior work measuring skew in ad delivery, we
develop a new methodology for black-box auditing of algorithms for
discrimination in the delivery of job advertisements. Our first contribution is
to identify the distinction between skew in ad delivery due to protected
categories such as gender or race, from skew due to differences in
qualification among people in the targeted audience. This distinction is
important in U.S. law, where ads may be targeted based on qualifications, but
not on protected categories. Second, we develop an auditing methodology that
distinguishes between skew explainable by differences in qualifications from
other factors, such as the ad platform's optimization for engagement or
training its algorithms on biased data. Our method controls for job
qualification by comparing ad delivery of two concurrent ads for similar jobs,
but for a pair of companies with different de facto gender distributions of
employees. We describe the careful statistical tests that establish evidence of
non-qualification skew in the results. Third, we apply our proposed methodology
to two prominent targeted advertising platforms for job ads: Facebook and
LinkedIn. We confirm skew by gender in ad delivery on Facebook, and show that
it cannot be justified by differences in qualifications. We fail to find skew
in ad delivery on LinkedIn. Finally, we suggest improvements to ad platform
practices that could make external auditing of their algorithms in the public
interest more feasible and accurate.

materials, a simple stochastic model has been introduced: the ABBM model.
Later, the ABBM model has been advocated as a paradigm for a broad class of
diverse phenomena, baptised ""crackling noise phenomena"". The model reproduces
many statistical features of such intermittent signals, as the statistics of
burst (or avalanche) durations and sizes, with their power law exponents that
would characterise the dynamics as critical. Beyond such ""critical exponents"",
the measure of the average shape of the avalanche has also been proposed. Here,
the exact calculation of average and fluctuations of the avalanche shape for
the ABBM model is presented, showing that its normalised shape is independent
from the external drive. Moreover, average and fluctuations of the
multi-avalanche shape, that is a sequence of avalanches of fixed total
duration, is also computed. Surprisingly, the two quantities (avalanche and
multi-avalanche normalised shapes) are identical. This result is obtained using
the exact solution of the ABBM model, obtained leveraging the equivalence with
the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process (CIR), through an exact ""time change"". A
presentation of this and other known exact results is provided: notably the
correspondence of the ABBM/CIR model with the generalised Bessel process,
describing the dynamics of the modulus of the multi dimensional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As a consequence, the correspondence between the
excursion (avalanche) and bridge (multi-avalanche) shape distributions, turns
to apply to all the aforementioned stochastic processes. In simple words:
considering the distance from the origin of such diffusive particles, the
(normalised) average shape (and fluctuations) of its trajectory until a return
in a time T is the same, whether it has returned before T or not.

Here we demonstrate the generation and certification of full-field
Laguerre-Gaussian entanglement between photons pairs generated by spontaneous

In addition, we show how the noise-robustness of high-dimensional entanglement
certification can be significantly increased by using measurements in multiple

to an execution model called *synchronization plans* which supports
synchronization between parallel nodes. Our evaluation shows that APIs offered

unbiased Monte Carlo estimation that can utilize parallel computation. However,
these approaches depend crucially on chains meeting after a small number of
transitions. For models that assign data into groups, e.g. mixture models, the
obvious approaches to couple Gibbs samplers fail to meet quickly. This failure
owes to the so-called ""label-switching"" problem; semantically equivalent
relabelings of the groups contribute well-separated posterior modes that impede
fast mixing and cause large meeting times. We here demonstrate how to avoid
label switching by considering chains as exploring the space of partitions
rather than labelings. Using a metric on this space, we employ an optimal
transport coupling of the Gibbs conditionals. This coupling outperforms
alternative couplings that rely on labelings and, on a real dataset, provides
estimates more precise than usual ergodic averages in the limited time regime.

different attribution techniques align with this assumption on realistic
counterfactuals in the case of reading comprehension (RC). RC is a particularly
challenging test case, as token-level attributions that have been extensively
studied in other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis are less suitable to
represent the reasoning that RC models perform. We construct counterfactual
sets for three different RC settings, and through heuristics that can connect
attribution methods' outputs to high-level model behavior, we can evaluate how
useful different attribution methods and even different formats are for
understanding counterfactuals. We find that pairwise attributions are better
suited to RC than token-level attributions across these different RC settings,
with our best performance coming from a modification that we propose to an
existing pairwise attribution method.

best-performing model is used to suppress bones in the publicly available

large collection of publicly available CXRs. The CXR-pretrained model is then
fine-tuned individually on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed CXRs of
Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections to classify them as showing normal
lungs or TB manifestations. The performances of these models are compared using
several performance metrics, analyzed for statistical significance, and their
predictions are qualitatively interpreted through class-selective relevance
maps. It is observed that the models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs
significantly outperformed (p<0.05) the models trained on the
non-bone-suppressed CXRs. Models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs improved
detection of TB-consistent findings and resulted in compact clustering of the

emission: this class is known as radio-loud. A substantial fraction, the
so-called radio-quiet AGN population, displays intermediate or weak radio
emission. However, an appreciable fraction of strong X-rays emitting AGN are
characterized by the absence of radio emission, down to an upper limit of about

  We wish to address the nature of these - seemingly radio-silent -
X-ray-luminous AGN and their host galaxies: is there any radio emission, and if
so, where does it originate? Focusing on the GOODS-N field, we examine the
nature of these objects employing stacking techniques on ultra-deep radio data
obtained with the JVLA. We combine these radio data with Spitzer far-infrared
data. We establish the absence, or totally insignificant contribution of
jet-driven radio-emission in roughly half of the otherwise normal population of
X-ray luminous AGN, which appear to reside in normal star-forming galaxies. We
conclude that AGN- or jet-driven radio emission is simply a mechanism that may
be at work or may be dormant in galaxies with actively accreting black holes.
The latter can be classified as radio-silent AGN.

as a convolution of the multiple parton scattering amplitudes and the
transverse momentum dependent (TMD) two-parton correlation matrix elements. We
study this medium-induced dijet spectrum and its azimuthal angle correlation
under the approximation of small longitudinal momentum transfer in the
secondary scattering and the factorization of two-parton correlation matrix
elements as a product of quark and gluon TMD parton distribution function
(PDF). Using a simple model for gluon saturation based on the parametrized
gluon TMD PDF, we can calculate the $x_B$ and $Q^2$ dependence of the
saturation scale and parton transport coefficient $\hat q$. Contributions to
dijet cross section from double scattering are power-suppressed and only become
sizable for mini-jets at small transverse momentum. We find that the total
dijet correlation for these mini-jets, which also includes the contribution
from single scattering, is sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening in
the quark TMD PDF at large $x$ and saturation in the gluon TMD PDF at small $x$
inside the nucleus. The correlation from double scattering is also found to
increase with the dijet rapidity gap and have a quadratic nuclear-size
dependence because of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) interference in gluon
emission induced by multiple scattering. Experimental measurements of such
unique features in the dijet correlation can shed light on the LPM interference
in strong interaction and gluon saturation in large nuclei.

high-resolution optical spectroscopy at the 1.2-m Mercator telescope. Our

the envelope layers of these non-radially pulsating dwarfs. We determined
stellar parameters and surface abundances in a homogeneous way from atmospheric
analysis with spectrum normalisation based on a new machine learning tool. Our
results suggest a systematic overestimation of [M/H] in the literature for the
studied F-type dwarfs, presumably due to normalisation limitations caused by
the dense line spectrum of these rotating stars. CNO-surface abundances were
found to be uncorrelated with the rotation properties of the F-type stars. For
the B-type stars, we find a hint of deep mixing from C and O abundance ratios;
N abundances have too large uncertainties to reveal a correlation with the
rotation of the stars. Our spectroscopic stellar parameters and abundance
determinations allow for future joint spectroscopic, astrometric (Gaia), and
asteroseismic modelling of this legacy sample of gravity-mode pulsators, with

sources, likelihood based inference methods are required to estimate the
uncertainty on the characteristics of the source population. In this work, a
new parametric likelihood is constructed for this problem using Compound
Poisson Generator (CPG) functionals which incorporate instrumental effects from
first principles. We demonstrate that the CPG approach exhibits a number of
advantages over Non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF) - an existing method -
in a series of test scenarios in the context of X-ray astronomy. These
demonstrations show that the effect of the point-spread function, effective
area, and choice of point-source spatial distribution cannot, generally, be
factorised as they are in NPTF, while the new CPG construction is validated in
these scenarios. Separately, an examination of the diffuse-flux emission limit
is used to show that most simple choices of priors on the standard
parameterisation of the population model can result in unexpected biases: when
a model comprising both a point-source population and diffuse component is
applied to this limit, nearly all observed flux will be assigned to either the
population or to the diffuse component. A new parametrisation is presented for
these priors which properly estimates the uncertainties in this limit. In this
choice of priors, CPG correctly identifies that the fraction of flux assigned
to the population model cannot be constrained by the data.

Methods: We compute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two
different prescriptions of the temperature gradient and mixing profile in the
near-core region. We determine which of these prescriptions is preferred
according to the prograde dipole modes detected in 4-yr $\textit{Kepler}$

realistic uncertainties for the theoretical predictions and the former does
not. Results: Period spacings of modes with consecutive radial order offer a
better diagnostic than mode periods or mode frequencies for asteroseismic
modelling of stars revealing only high-order gravito-inertial modes. We find
KIC$\,$7760680 to reveal a radiative temperature gradient in models with

statistically preferred for this rotating star, revealing extremely low

extragalactic distances. The radio pulse undergoes dispersion caused by free
electrons along the line of sight, most of which are associated with the
large-scale structure (LSS). The total dispersion measure therefore increases
with the line of sight and provides a distance estimate to the source. We
present the first measurement of the Hubble constant using the dispersion
measure -- redshift relation of FRBs with identified host counterpart and
corresponding redshift information. A sample of nine currently available FRBs
yields a constraint of $H_0 = 62.3 \pm 9.1 \,\rm{km}
\,\rm{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainty stemming from the
LSS, host halo and Milky Way contributions to the observed dispersion measure.
The main current limitation is statistical, and we estimate that a few hundred
events with corresponding redshifts are sufficient for a per cent measurement
of $H_0$. This is a number well within reach of ongoing FRB searches. We
perform a forecast using a realistic mock sample to demonstrate that a
high-precision measurement of the expansion rate is possible without relying on
other cosmological probes. FRBs can therefore arbitrate the current tension
between early and late time measurements of $H_0$ in the near future.

flaring activity during 2019 May from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. Similar to
radio observations of previous outbursts from Cygnus X-3, we find that this
source was significantly variable at low frequencies, reaching a maximum flux
density of about 5.8 Jy. We compare our LOFAR light curve with contemporaneous
observations taken at 1.25 and 2.3 GHz with the RATAN-600 telescope, and at 15
GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array. The initial
143.5-MHz flux density level, $\sim$2 Jy, is suggested to be the delayed and
possibly blended emission from at least some of the flaring activity that had
been detected at higher frequencies before our LOFAR observations had begun.
There is also evidence of a delay of more than four days between a bright flare
that initially peaked on May 6 at 2.3 and 15 GHz, and the corresponding peak
($\gtrsim$ 5.8 Jy) at 143.5 MHz. From the multi-frequency light curves, we
estimate the minimum energy and magnetic field required to produce this flare
to be roughly 10$^{44}$ erg and 40 mG, respectively, corresponding to a minimum
mean power of $\sim$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we show that the
broadband radio spectrum evolved over the course of our observing campaign; in
particular, the two-point spectral index between 143.5 MHz and 1.25 GHz
transitioned from being optically thick to optically thin as the flare
simultaneously brightened at 143.5 MHz and faded at GHz frequencies.

the merged filamentary complex shows already signs of cores at the edges or (c)
the filaments merge into a structure which is not end-dominated. We develop an

continuous healthcare monitoring is their cumbersome and obtrusive nature. This
is particularly true for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which require
the placement of multiple electrodes in contact with the scalp. In this work,
we propose to identify the optimal wearable EEG electrode set-up, in terms of
minimal number of electrodes, comfortable location and performance, for
EEG-based event detection and monitoring. By relying on the demonstrated power
of autoencoder (AE) networks to learn latent representations from
high-dimensional data, our proposed strategy trains an AE architecture in a
one-class classification setup with different electrode set-ups as input data.
The resulting models are assessed using the F-score and the best set-up is
chosen according to the established optimal criteria. Using alpha wave
detection as use case, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to detect
an alpha state from an optimal set-up consisting of electrodes in the forehead
and behind the ear, with an average F-score of 0.78. Our results suggest that a
learning-based approach can be used to enable the design and implementation of
optimized wearable devices for real-life healthcare monitoring.

and three right-handed neutrinos. Both scalar fields couple nonminimally to
gravity and induce the Planck scale dynamically, once they develop vacuum
expectation values. By means of the Gildener-Weinberg approach, we describe the
inflationary dynamics in terms of a single scalar degree of freedom along the

the Einstein frame exhibits plateaus on both sides of the minimum and thus the

is the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the density of interstellar gas
and the rate at which that gas forms stars. A tight correlation between these
quantities has long been measured at galactic scales. More recently, using
surveys of YSOs, a KS relationship has been found within molecular clouds
relating the surface density of star formation to the surface density of gas;
however, the scaling of these laws varies significantly from cloud to cloud. In
this Letter, we use a recently developed, high-accuracy catalog of young
stellar objects from $\textit{Spitzer}$ combined with high-dynamic-range gas
column density maps of twelve nearby ($<$1.5 kpc) molecular clouds from
$\textit{Herschel}$ to re-examine the KS relation within individual molecular
clouds. We find a tight, linear correlation between clouds' star formation rate
per unit area and their gas surface density normalized by the gas free-fall
time. The measured intracloud KS relation, which relates star formation rate to
the volume density, extends over more than two orders of magnitude within each
cloud and is nearly identical in each of the twelve clouds, implying a constant
star formation efficiency per free-fall time $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 0.026$.
The finding of a universal correlation within individual molecular clouds,
including clouds that contain no massive stars or massive stellar feedback,
favors models in which star formation is regulated by local processes such as
turbulence or stellar feedback such as protostellar outflows, and disfavors
models in which star formation is regulated only by galaxy properties or
supernova feedback on galactic scales.

table adds neither extra operations to each forward pass nor extra parameters
that need to be stored on limited GPU/TPU memory. We explore scaling n-gram
embedding tables up to nearly a billion parameters. When trained on a 3-billion
sentence corpus, we find that LookupLM improves long tail log perplexity by
2.44 and long tail WER by 23.4% on a downstream speech recognition task over a

protocols that leverages basic security primitives offered by low-cost,
hardware chipsets containing millions of synchronized self-powered timers. The
keys are derived from the temporal dynamics of a physical, micro-scale
time-keeping device which makes the keys immune to any potential side-channel
attacks, malicious tampering, or snooping. Using the behavioral model of the
self-powered timers, we first show that the derived key-strings can pass the
randomness test as defined by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) suite. The key-strings are then used in two SPoTKD
(Self-Powered Timer Key Distribution) protocols that exploit the timer's
dynamics as one-way functions: (a) protocol 1 facilitates secure communications
between a user and a remote Server, and (b) protocol 2 facilitates secure
communications between two users. In this paper, we investigate the security of
these protocols under standard model and against different adversarial attacks.
Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we also investigate the robustness of these
protocols in the presence of real-world operating conditions and propose
error-correcting SPoTKD protocols to mitigate these noise-related artifacts.

establish the invariance of the surface plasmonic frequency combs~(FCs) and
phase singularities for plasmonic peregrine waves and Akhmediev breather. By
finely tuning the nonlinear coefficient of the interaction interface, we
uncover the conservation conditions through this plasmonic system and employ
the mean-value evolution of the quantum NSPP field commensurate with the
Schr\""odinger equation to evaluate spectral dynamics of the plasmonic

exciting PFCs as equally spaced invariant quantities of this plasmonic scheme

presentation aims at providing a tutorial view that helps to understand the

be used also for KWS, even though KWS does not generally require or rely on any
kind of previously produced image transcripts. These ideas are developed into a
specific, probabilistically sound approach for segmentation-free,

are presented, which support the consistency and general interest of the
proposed framework. Several datasets, traditionally used for KWS benchmarking

crystallization process in two glass-forming Copper alloys, $Ag_6Cu_4$, which

directly correlated with a non-monotonic temperature dependence for the
formation energy of connected icosahedral structures, which are incompatible
with crystalline order and impede the development of the crystal nucleus,
leading to an unexpectedly larger free energy barrier at low temperature. This,
in turn, promotes the formation of a predominantly closed-packed critical

ones. For example, a healthcare provider may be interested in the effect of a
treatment plan for a specific subset of their patients; policymakers may be
concerned with the impact of a policy in a particular state within a given
population. In these cases, the focus is on a specific finite population, as
opposed to an infinite super-population. Such a population can be characterized
by fixing some attributes that are intrinsic to them, leaving unexplained
variations like measurement error as random. Inference for a population with
fixed attributes can then be modeled as inferring parameters of a conditional
distribution. Accordingly, it is desirable that confidence intervals are
conditionally valid for the realized population, instead of marginalizing over
many possible draws of populations.
  We provide a statistical inference framework for parameters of finite
populations with known attributes. Leveraging the attribute information, our
estimators and confidence intervals closely target a specific finite
population. When the data is from the population of interest, our confidence
intervals attain asymptotic conditional validity given the attributes, and are
shorter than those for super-population inference. In addition, we develop
procedures to infer parameters of new populations with differing covariate
distributions; the confidence intervals are also conditionally valid for the
new populations under mild conditions. Our methods extend to situations where
the fixed information has a weaker structure or is only partially observed. We
demonstrate the validity and applicability of our methods using simulated and

observations, and large-scale numerical simulations at a wide range of
spatio-temporal scales have enabled the rapid advancement of data-driven and
especially deep learning models in the field of fluid mechanics. Although these
methods are proven successful for many applications, there is a grand challenge
of improving their generalizability. This is particularly essential when
data-driven models are employed within outer-loop applications like
optimization. In this work, we put forth a physics-guided machine learning
(PGML) framework that leverages the interpretable physics-based model with a
deep learning model. The PGML framework is capable of enhancing the
generalizability of data-driven models and effectively protect against or
inform about the inaccurate predictions resulting from extrapolation. We apply
the PGML framework as a novel model fusion approach combining the physics-based
Galerkin projection model and long-short term memory (LSTM) network for
parametric model order reduction of fluid flows. We demonstrate the improved
generalizability of the PGML framework against a purely data-driven approach
through the injection of physics features into intermediate LSTM layers. Our
quantitative analysis shows that the overall model uncertainty can be reduced
through the PGML approach especially for test data coming from a distribution
different than the training data. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach
can be used as an inverse diagnostic tool providing a confidence score
associated with models and observations. The proposed framework also allows for
multi-fidelity computing by making use of low-fidelity models in the online
deployment of quantified data-driven models.

sources, many of which are noisy and some of which conflict, resulting in a
level of uncertainty for each triple. Knowledge bases are also often
incomplete, prompting the use of embedding methods to generalize from known
facts, however, existing embedding methods only model triple-level uncertainty,
and reasoning results lack global consistency. To address these shortcomings,
we propose BEUrRE, a novel uncertain knowledge graph embedding method with
calibrated probabilistic semantics. BEUrRE models each entity as a box (i.e.
axis-aligned hyperrectangle) and relations between two entities as affine
transforms on the head and tail entity boxes. The geometry of the boxes allows
for efficient calculation of intersections and volumes, endowing the model with
calibrated probabilistic semantics and facilitating the incorporation of
relational constraints. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show
that BEUrRE consistently outperforms baselines on confidence prediction and
fact ranking due to its probabilistic calibration and ability to capture
high-order dependencies among facts.

industrial and biophysical processes. In this Letter, we experimentally
investigate the generation of drops of a viscoelastic suspension, made of
non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a dilute polymer solution. Using
high-speed imaging, we characterize the different stages of the detachment. Our
experiments show that the particles primarily affect the initial Newtonian
necking by increasing the fluid viscosity. In the viscoelastic regime,
particles do not affect the thinning until the onset of the blistering
instability, which they accelerate. We find that the transition from one regime
to another, which corresponds to the coil-stretch transition of the polymer
chains, strongly depends on the particle content. Considering that the presence
of rigid particles increase the deformation of the liquid phase, we propose an
expression for the local strain rate in the suspension, which rationalizes our
experimental results. This method could enable the precise measurement of local

can be extremely challenging. To date, researchers have proposed various
automated program repair (APR) techniques to reduce efforts of manual
debugging. However, given a real-world buggy program, a typical APR technique
usually generates a large number of patches, each of which needs to be
validated against the original test suite which incurs extremely high
computation costs. Although existing APR techniques have already leveraged
various static and/or dynamic information to find the desired patches faster,
they are still rather costly. In a recent work, researchers proposed unified
debugging to leverage the patch execution information during APR to help boost
fault localization; in this way,the application scope of APR techniques can be
extended to all possible bugs, e.g., the patch execution information during APR
can help with manual repair of the bugs that cannot be automatically fixed.
Inspired by unified debugging, this work proposes SeAPR (Self-Boosted Automated
Program Repair), the first technique to leverage the earlier patch execution
information during APR to help boost automated repair itself on-the-fly. Our
basic intuition is that patches similar to earlier high-quality/low-quality
patches should be promoted/degraded to speed up the detection of the desired
patches. This experimental study on 12 state-of-the-art APR systems
demonstrates that, overall, SeAPR can substantially reduce the number of patch
executions with negligible overhead. Our study also investigates the impact of
various configurations on SeAPR. Lastly, our study demonstrates that SeAPR can
even leverage the patch execution information from other APR tools from the
same buggy program to further boost APR.

complicated by interlopers contaminating the sample. In spectroscopic galaxy
surveys this can be due to the misclassification of an emission line; for
example in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) low
redshift [OII] emitters may make up a few percent of the observed Ly${\alpha}$
emitter (LAE) sample. The presence of contaminants affects the measured
correlation functions and power spectra. Previous attempts to deal with this
using the cross-correlation function have assumed sources at a fixed redshift,
or not modelled evolution within the adopted redshift bins. However, in
spectroscopic surveys like HETDEX, where the contamination fraction is likely
to be redshift dependent, the observed clustering of misclassified sources will
appear to evolve strongly due to projection effects, even if their true
clustering does not. We present a practical method for accounting for the
presence of contaminants with redshift-dependent contamination fractions and
projected clustering. We show using mock catalogues that our method, unlike
existing approaches, yields unbiased clustering measurements from the upcoming
HETDEX survey in scenarios with redshift-dependent contamination fractions
within the redshift bins used. We show our method returns auto-correlation
functions with systematic biases much smaller than the statistical noise for
samples with at least as high as 7 per cent contamination. We also present and
test a method for fitting for the redshift-dependent interloper fraction using
the LAE-[OII] galaxy cross-correlation function, which gives less biased
results than assuming a single interloper fraction for the whole sample.

the need to be aware of the existence of the other SPs or to know the channel
state information (CSI) outside the cell. The InP performs network
virtualization to meet the SPs' service demands while managing both the
inter-SP and inter-cell interference. We consider coordinated multi-cell
precoding at the InP and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a
weighted sum of signal leakage and precoding deviation, with per-cell transmit
power constraints. We propose a fully distributed semi-closed-form solution at

low-complexity scheme to allocate the virtual transmit power, for the InP to

a system scales as $L^\alpha$, this implies $\alpha < d/2$. The diffusion rate
of particles diverges as a power of decreasing rate before saturating in the QS
regime. A scaling theory for the diffusion is derived using the QS avalanche
rate distribution and generalized to the finite strain rate regime. This theory
is used to collapse curves for different system sizes and confirm $\beta/\nu$.

power plants may require a configuration modification as large as that of a
stellarator. (2) The demonstrated reliability of the computational design of
stellarators should change fusion strategy. (3) Deployment of carbon-free
energy sources is mandated by the thirty-year doubling of carbon dioxide
emissions. Carbon-free energy options must be developed and fully deployed
within a few doubling times. Unit size and cost of electricity are only
relevant in comparison to alternative worldwide energy solutions.
Intermittency, site specificity, waste management, and nuclear proliferation
make fusion attractive as the basis for a carbon-free energy system compared to
the alternatives. Nonetheless, fusion is not an option for deployment until a
power plant has successfully operated. A critical element in a minimal time and
risk program is the use of computational design as opposed to just
extrapolation. Only the stellarator has an empirical demonstration of the
reliable computational design through large changes in configuration properties
and scale. The computational design of stellarators should proceed while the
inventions necessary for a more tokamak-like power plant are sought. The cost
of computational design is extremely small, but adequate time is required for
the development of ideas that maximize attractiveness and minimize risk. Rapid
power-plant construction without many intermediate steps may seem risky, but
the price is small compared to the cost of trillions of dollars for each year's
delay in addressing carbon-dioxide emissions.

the generated data to train offline a set of beam-specific Deep Neural Network

Finally, we deploy the DNN models online into the system-level simulator to
evaluate the benefits of the proposed solution. Our prediction-based beam

disordered solids consists of three distinct domains: a novel power-law rise
with frequency at low frequencies indicating anticorrelation, white-noise at
intermediate frequencies, and a power-law decay at high frequencies. As the
strain rate increases, the white-noise regime shrinks and ultimately disappears
as the finite strain rate restricts the maximum size of an avalanche. A new
strain-rate- and system-size-dependent scaling theory is derived for power
spectra in both the quasistatic and finite-strain-rate regimes. This theory is
validated using data from overdamped two- and three-dimensional molecular
dynamics simulations. We identify important exponents in the yielding
transition including the dynamic exponent $z$ which relates the size of an
avalanche to its duration, the fractal dimension of avalanches, and the
exponent characterizing the divergence in correlations with strain rate.
Results are related to temporal correlations within a single avalanche and

modern data analysis. Common methods for time-varying data such as functional
data analysis are infeasible when observations are time courses of networks or
other complex non-Euclidean random objects that are elements of general metric
spaces. In such spaces, only pairwise distances between the data objects are
available and a strong limitation is that one cannot carry out arithmetic
operations due to the lack of an algebraic structure. We combat this complexity
by a generalized notion of mean trajectory taking values in the object space.
For this, we adopt pointwise Fr\'echet means and then construct pointwise
distance trajectories between the individual time courses and the estimated
Fr\'echet mean trajectory, thus representing the time-varying objects and
networks by functional data. Functional principal component analysis of these
distance trajectories can reveal interesting features of dynamic networks and
object time courses and is useful for downstream analysis. Our approach also
makes it possible to study the empirical dynamics of time-varying objects,
including dynamic regression to the mean or explosive behavior over time. We
demonstrate desirable asymptotic properties of sample based estimators for
suitable population targets under mild assumptions. The utility of the proposed
methodology is illustrated with dynamic networks, time-varying distribution

dispersed in the Chicago metropolitan area. Each site has one or more quantum
nodes (Q-nodes) representing the communication parties in a quantum network.
Q-nodes generate or measure quantum signals such as entangled photons and
communicate the results via standard, classical, means. The entangled photons
in IEQNET nodes are generated at multiple wavelengths, and are selectively
distributed to the desired users via optical switches. Here we describe the
network architecture of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered
hierarchy that leverages software-defined-networking (SDN) technology to
perform traditional wavelength routing and assignment between the Q-nodes.
Specifically, SDN decouples the control and data planes, with the control plane
being entirely classical. Issues associated with synchronization, calibration,
network monitoring, and scheduling will be discussed. An important goal of
IEQNET is demonstrating the extent to which the control plane can coexist with
the data plane using the same fiber lines. This goal is furthered by the use of
tunable narrow-band optical filtering at the receivers and, at least in some
cases, a wide wavelength separation between the quantum and classical channels.
We envision IEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks
by demonstrating metro-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement
distribution and quantum-state teleportation.

the allocation of vaccines is a complex task in which economic and social
considerations can be important. The central problem is to use the limited
number of vaccines in a country to reduce the risk of infection and mitigate
economic uncertainty at the same time. In this paper, we propose a simple
economic model for vaccine allocation across two types of workers:
white-collars can work from home; while blue-collars must work on site. These
worker types are complementary to each other, thus a negative shock to the
supply of either one decreases the demand for the other that leads to
unemployment. Using parameters of blue and white-collar labor supply, their
infection risks, productivity losses at home office during lock-down, and
available vaccines, we express the optimal share of vaccines allocated to
blue-collars. The model points to the dominance of blue-collar vaccination,
especially during waves when their relative infection risks increase and when
the number of available vaccines is limited. Taking labor supply data from 28
European countries, we quantify blue-collar vaccine allocation that minimizes
unemployment across levels of blue- and white-collar infection risks. The model
favours blue-collar vaccination identically across European countries in case
of vaccine scarcity. As more vaccines become available, economies that host
large-shares of employees in home-office shall increasingly immunize them in
case blue-collar infection risks can be kept down. Our results highlight that
vaccination plans should include workers and rank them by type of occupation.
We propose that prioritizing blue-collar workers during infection waves and
early vaccination can also favour economy besides helping the most vulnerable
who can transmit more infection.

convenience and policy relevance. To analyze them properly, we must address the
fact that the treatment is assigned at the cluster level instead of the
individual level. Standard analytic strategies are regressions based on
individual data, cluster averages, and cluster totals, which differ when the
cluster sizes vary. These methods are often motivated by models with strong and
unverifiable assumptions, and the choice among them can be subjective. Without
any outcome modeling assumption, we evaluate these regression estimators and
the associated robust standard errors from a design-based perspective where
only the treatment assignment itself is random and controlled by the

a weighted average treatment effect, regression based on individual data is
suboptimal in terms of efficiency, and regression based on cluster totals is
consistent and more efficient with a large number of clusters. We highlight the
critical role of covariates in improving estimation efficiency, and illustrate
the efficiency gain via both simulation studies and data analysis. Moreover, we
show that the robust standard errors are convenient approximations to the true
asymptotic standard errors under the design-based perspective. Our theory holds

explicit schemes for the transport of species in a porous medium suffers from
severe restrictions on the time step. This has led to the development of
implicit schemes that are increasingly favoured by practitioners for their
computational efficiency. The transport equation requires knowledge of the
velocity field, which results from an elliptic problem (Darcy problem) that is
the most expensive part of the computation. When considering large reservoirs,
a cost-effective way of approximating the Darcy problems is using multiscale
domain decomposition (MDD) methods. They allow for the pressure and velocity
fields to be computed on coarse meshes (large scale), while detailed basis
functions are defined locally, usually in parallel, in a much finer grid (small
scale). In this work we adopt the Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM,
[Guiraldello, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 355 (2018) pp. 1-21], [Rocha, et al.,
J. Comput. Phys., (2020) 109316]), which is a generalization of previous MDD
methods that allows for great flexibility in the choice of interface spaces. In
this article we investigate the combination of the MRCM with implicit transport
schemes. A sequentially implicit strategy is proposed, with different
trust-region algorithms ensuring the convergence of the transport solver. The
method is assessed on several very stringent 2D two-phase problems,
demonstrating its stability even for large time steps. It is also shown that
the best accuracy is achieved by considering recently introduced non-polynomial
interface spaces, since polynomial spaces are not optimal for high-contrast
channelized permeability fields.

ensemble interactions of such systems are inherently nonlinear and complex,
compounded by interfacial effects, making it a difficult many-body problem for
theory. In comparison, the self-assembly dynamics of solid particles in flow
have long been described and successfully exploited in the field of inertial
microfluidics, where particle crystals can be realized from inertial forces and
hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we report novel self-assembly dynamics of
liquid drops in confined microfluidic channels that contrast starkly with the
established paradigm of inertial microfluidics: higher inertia leads to better
spatial ordering. Instead, we find that the conventional straight wall channel
geometry not only fails to achieve regular spatial ordering for drops but
actually exacerbates it with increasing inertia. Conversely, an asymmetric
serpentine geometry is able to achieve long-range, periodic spatial ordering
over length scales that are at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than the
drop diameter, particularly at low inertia. Experimentally, we are able to
decouple droplet generation from ordering, enabling independent variation of
number density, confinement, inertia, and surfactant concentration. We find the
inertia-dependent emergence of preferred drop separations and show for the
first time that Marangoni effects can influence the longitudinal ordering of
multidrop arrays. These results present a largely unexplored direction for
inertial microfluidics but also show the potential of its unification with

PRM and RRT being two of the most effective classes of planners. Though
generally very efficient, these sampling-based planners can become
computationally expensive in the important case of ""narrow passages"". This
paper develops a path planning paradigm specifically formulated for narrow
passage problems. The core is based on planning for rigid-body robots
encapsulated by unions of ellipsoids. Each environmental feature is represented
geometrically using a strictly convex body with a $\mathcal{C}^1$ boundary
(e.g., superquadric). The main benefit of doing this is that
configuration-space obstacles can be parameterized explicitly in closed form,
thereby allowing prior knowledge to be used to avoid sampling infeasible
configurations. Then, by characterizing a tight volume bound for multiple
ellipsoids, robot transitions involving rotations are guaranteed to be
collision-free without needing to perform traditional collision detection.
Furthermore, by combining with a stochastic sampling strategy, the proposed
planning framework can be extended to solving higher dimensional problems in
which the robot has a moving base and articulated appendages. Benchmark results
show that the proposed framework often outperforms the sampling-based planners
in terms of computational time and success rate in finding a path through
narrow corridors for both single-body robots and those with higher dimensional
configuration spaces. Physical experiments using the proposed framework are
further demonstrated on a humanoid robot that walks in several cluttered
environments with narrow passages.

parton cascade takes place inside a medium, is an intrinsically quantum
process, where color coherence effects play an essential role. Despite a very
significant progress in the last years, the simulation of a full quantum medium
induced cascade remains inaccessible to classical Monte Carlo parton showers.
In this situation, alternative formulations are worth being tried and the fast
developments in quantum computing provide a very promising direction. The goal
of this paper is to introduce a strategy to quantum simulate single particle
momentum broadening, the simplest building block of jet quenching. Momentum
broadening is the modification of the quark or gluon transverse momentum due
interactions with the underlying medium, modeled as a QCD background field. At
the lowest order in $\alpha_s$ that we consider here, momentum broadening does
not involve parton splittings and particle number is conserved, greatly
simplifying the quantum algorithmic implementation. This quantity is, however,
very relevant for the phenomenology of RHIC, LHC or the future EIC.

adaptation in a sense of practical deployment, where only the interface of
source model is available to the target domain, and where the label-space
relations between the two domains are allowed to be different and unknown. We
term such a setting as Universal Black-Box Domain Adaptation (UB$^2$DA). The
great promise that UB$^2$DA makes, however, brings significant learning
challenges, since domain adaptation can only rely on the predictions of
unlabeled target data in a partially overlapped label space, by accessing the
interface of source model. To tackle the challenges, we first note that the
learning task can be converted as two subtasks of in-class\footnote{In this
paper we use in-class (out-class) to describe the classes observed (not
observed) in the source black-box model.} discrimination and out-class
detection, which can be respectively learned by model distillation and entropy
separation. We propose to unify them into a self-training framework,
regularized by consistency of predictions in local neighborhoods of target
samples. Our framework is simple, robust, and easy to be optimized. Experiments
on domain adaptation benchmarks show its efficacy. Notably, by accessing the
interface of source model only, our framework outperforms existing methods of
universal domain adaptation that make use of source data and/or source models,
with a newly proposed (and arguably more reasonable) metric of H-score, and
performs on par with them with the metric of averaged class accuracy.

are considered as a noninvasive indicator for diagnostic applications in
medical fields. Contrast ultrasound imaging using the modality of subharmonics
could be also better than that of using harmonics. Unlike the harmonics of an
UCA that increase with increasing the amplitude of excitation pressure,
subharmonics occur only when the excitation pressure exceeds a threshold value.
The excitation pressure inducing the onset of subharmonic components from the
UCA during nonlinear oscillations is known as the subharmonic threshold.
Although numerous studies on the subharmonics of free bubbles or UCAs have been
carried out for decades, several experimental observations, such as the shift
of the subharmonic resonance and subharmonic threshold at low excitation
pressures, cannot be well characterized by existing theories. An analytical
method for resolving these inconsistencies remains incomplete. The present
article theoretically investigates the subharmonic threshold of an UCA through
the techniques of energy balancing in the phase plane and instability analysis
of subharmonic-free oscillations. The influence of shell parameters of the UCA
on the subharmonic threshold is studied. Those experimental observations are
explained by the amplitude-dependent nonlinear resonance and damping. The
effect of nonspherical oscillations on subharmonic emissions is also discussed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the group-level analyses prevalently used
for investigation and understanding of the disease are not applicable for
diagnosis of individuals. More recently, deep learning, which can efficiently
analyze large-scale complex patterns in 3D brain images, has helped pave the
way for computer-aided individual diagnosis by providing accurate and automated
disease classification. Great progress has been made in classifying AD with
deep learning models developed upon increasingly available structural MRI data.
The lack of scale-matched functional neuroimaging data prevents such models
from being further improved by observing functional changes in pathophysiology.
Here we propose a potential solution by first learning a
structural-to-functional transformation in brain MRI, and further synthesizing
spatially matched functional images from large-scale structural scans. We
evaluated our approach by building computational models to discriminate
patients with AD from healthy normal subjects and demonstrated a performance
boost after combining the structural and synthesized functional brain images
into the same model. Furthermore, our regional analyses identified the temporal
lobe to be the most predictive structural-region and the parieto-occipital lobe
to be the most predictive functional-region of our model, which are both in
concordance with previous group-level neuroimaging findings. Together, we
demonstrate the potential of deep learning with large-scale structural and
synthesized functional MRI to impact AD classification and to identify AD's
neuroimaging signatures.

our analysis, we compare the distributions of our clouds' polarization
observables with measurements from synthetic polarization maps generated from

measurements to estimate the inclination angle of each cloud's cloud-scale

synthesis in free-viewpoint video. The depth map intra prediction in 3D
extensions of the HEVC applies intra modes with auxiliary depth modeling modes
(DMMs) to better preserve depth edges and handle motion discontinuities.
Although such modes enable high efficiency compression, but at the cost of very
high encoding complexity. Skipping conventional intra coding modes and DMMs in
depth coding limits practical applicability of the HEVC for 3D display
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity scheme for
depth video compression based on low-rank tensor decomposition and HEVC intra
coding. The proposed scheme leverages spatial and temporal redundancy by
compactly representing the depth sequence as a high-order tensor. Tensor
factorization into a set of factor matrices following CANDECOMP PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition via alternating least squares give a low-rank approximation of
the scene geometry. Further, compression of factor matrices with HEVC intra
prediction support arbitrary target accuracy by flexible adjustment of bitrate,
varying tensor decomposition ranks and quantization parameters. The results
demonstrate proposed approach achieves significant rate gains by efficiently
compressing depth planes in low-rank approximated representation. The proposed
algorithm is applied to encode depth maps of benchmark Ballet and Breakdancing
sequences. The decoded depth sequences are used for view synthesis in a

dynamic parameter by a multi-agent system over a directed communication network
in the presence of an adversarial attack on the agents' sensors. The mode of
attack of the adversaries is to corrupt the sensor measurements of some of the
agents, while the communication and information processing capabilities of
those agents remain unaffected. To ensure that all the agents, both normal as
well as those under attack, are able to correctly estimate the parameter value,
the Resilient Estimation through Weight Balancing (REWB) algorithm is
introduced. The only condition required for the REWB algorithm to guarantee
resilient estimation is that at any given point in time, less than half of the
total number of agents are under attack. The paper discusses the development of
the REWB algorithm using the concepts of weight balancing of directed graphs,
and the consensus+innovations approach for linear estimation. Numerical
simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of our algorithm over
directed graphs under different conditions of adversarial attacks.

alternating direction method of multipliers to establish our algorithm.
Besides, the complexity and convergence are investigated to further validate
the algorithm effectiveness. The proposed scheme is then evaluated through
various data sets. Experiment results verify that, the proposed method

and the correlations between luminosities can shed light on the Jet-accretion

programmable propagation of information-bearing signals, which can be jointly
optimized with transceiver operations. Typical RIS implementations include
metasurfaces with nearly passive meta-atoms, allowing to solely reflect the

Autonomous robots operating in real-world complex scenarios require planning in
the discrete (task) space and the continuous (motion) space. In
knowledge-intensive domains, on the one hand, a robot has to reason at the
highest-level, for example, the objects to procure, the regions to navigate to
in order to acquire them; on the other hand, the feasibility of the respective
navigation tasks have to be checked at the execution level. This presents a
need for motion-planning-aware task planners. In this paper, we discuss a
probabilistically complete approach that leverages this task-motion interaction
for navigating in large knowledge-intensive domains, returning a plan that is
optimal at the task-level. The framework is intended for motion planning under
motion and sensing uncertainty, which is formally known as belief space
planning. The underlying methodology is validated in simulation, in an office
environment and its scalability is tested in the larger Willow Garage world. A
reasonable comparison with a work that is closest to our approach is also

suppression is steeper than Chevalier's power-law model through Bondi accretion
within a turn-around radius. The characteristic halting timescale is $\sim

enough to continue the long-lasting emission of sGRBs. The halting timescale is
sensitive to the uncertainty of the $r$-process. Future observation of fallback
halting could constrain the $r$-process heating on the year scale.

which are missing in the usual eikonal description of these reactions.
Encouraging results have been obtained for total breakup cross sections in
comparison to more elaborate reaction models.
  Purpose: We extend these comparisons to more differential breakup cross
sections expressed as functions of the relative energy or parallel momentum
between the core and halo neutron.
  Method: ERT predictions of these cross sections are compared to
state-of-the-art calculations.
  Results: The hypotheses upon which the ERT is based are confirmed and their
range of validity is made clearer. The actual ordering of the evolution
operators {affects ERT differential} cross sections and a specific choice leads
to excellent agreement with the reference calculation. Dynamical effects in the
treatment of the neutron-target interaction can be significant in the
parallel-momentum observable.
  Conclusions: The role of the different interactions in the dynamics of
breakup reactions of one-neutron halo nuclei are better understood and
improvements to the ERT are suggested.

intersections to detect frequent patterns, then selects the most meaningful

is the intersection of the previous node and a random chosen observation. The
frequency of patterns in the tail nodes is estimated by maximum likelihood
estimation, then the patterns with largest estimated frequency are selected.
After that, their confidence is calculated by Bayes' theorem. The most
confident patterns are finally returned by Random Intersection Chains. We show
that if the number and length of chains are appropriately chosen, the patterns
in the tail nodes are indeed the most frequent ones in the data set. We analyze

standard practice of using a large number of samples for training often does
not improve the performance of a DNN to a satisfactory level. Thus, a
systematic training approach is needed. To address this need, we introduce an
innovative approach of using metamorphic relations (MRs) as ""knowledge

(which play the role of a test oracle in software testing), we make use of the
notion of metamorphic group of inputs as concrete instances of MRs (which are
abstractions of knowledge) to train a DNN in a systematic and effective manner.
To verify the viability of our training approach, we have conducted a
preliminary experiment to compare the performance of two DNNs: one trained with
MRs and the other trained without MRs. We found that the DNN trained with MRs
has delivered a better performance, thereby confirming that our approach of
using MRs as knowledge carriers to train DNNs is promising. More work and

induction and 3D personalization simultaneously. Efficient algorithms to
compress HDR stereo data is critical. Direct capturing of HDR content is
complicated due to the high expense and scarcity of HDR cameras. The HDR 3D
images could be generated in low-cost by fusing low-dynamic-range (LDR) images
acquired using a stereo camera with various exposure settings. In this paper,
an efficient scheme for coding multi-exposure stereo images is proposed based
on a tensor low-rank approximation scheme. The multi-exposure fusion can be
realized to generate HDR stereo output at the decoder for increased realism and
exaggerated binocular 3D depth cues.
  For exploiting spatial redundancy in LDR stereo images, the stack of
multi-exposure stereo images is decomposed into a set of projection matrices
and a core tensor following an alternating least squares Tucker decomposition
model. The compact, low-rank representation of the scene, thus, generated is
further processed by 3D extension of High Efficiency Video Coding standard. The
encoding with 3D-HEVC enhance the proposed scheme efficiency by exploiting
intra-frame, inter-view and the inter-component redundancies in low-rank
approximated representation. We consider constant luminance property of IPT and
Y'CbCr color space to precisely approximate intensity prediction and
perceptually minimize the encoding distortion. Besides, the proposed scheme
gives flexibility to adjust the bitrate of tensor latent components by changing
the rank of core tensor and its quantization. Extensive experiments on natural
scenes demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art
JPEG-XT and 3D-HEVC range coding standards.

should the thermal power plants dance on the blade motivates this research.
Considering the impact of price fluctuations of carbon emission right
allowance, we investigate the operation of Chinese thermal power plant by
modeling the decision-making with optimal stopping problem, which is
established on the stochastic environment with carbon emission allowance price
process simulated by geometric Brownian motion. Under the overall goal of
maximizing the ultimate profitability, the optimal stopping indicates the
timing of suspend or halt of production, hence the optimal stopping boundary
curve implies the edge of life and death with regard to this enterprise.
Applying this methodology, real cases of failure and survival of several
Chinese representative thermal power plants were analyzed to explore the
industry ecotope, which leads to the findings that: 1) The survival environment
of existed thermal power plants becomes severer when facing more pressure from
the newborn carbon-finance market. 2) Boundaries of survival environment is
mainly drawn by the technical improvements for rising the utilization rate of
carbon emission. Based on the same optimal stopping model, outlook of this

a rich body of research concerned with hardware accelerators for
compute-intensive DNN operators. However, implementing such operators
efficiently with complex hardware intrinsics such as matrix multiply is a task
not yet automated gracefully. Solving this task often requires joint program
and data layout transformations. First solutions to this problem have been
proposed, such as TVM, UNIT or ISAMIR, which work on a loop-level
representation of operators and specify data layout and possible program
transformations before the embedding into the operator is performed. This
top-down approach creates a tension between exploration range and search space
complexity, especially when also exploring data layout transformations such as
im2col, channel packing or padding.
  In this work, we propose a new approach to this problem. We created a
bottom-up method that allows the joint transformation of both compuation and
data layout based on the found embedding. By formulating the embedding as a
constraint satisfaction problem over the scalar dataflow, every possible
embedding solution is contained in the search space. Adding additional
constraints and optmization targets to the solver generates the subset of
preferable solutions.
  An evaluation using the VTA hardware accelerator with the Baidu DeepBench
inference benchmark shows that our approach can automatically generate code
competitive to reference implementations. Further, we show that dynamically
determining the data layout based on intrinsic and workload is beneficial for
hardware utilization and performance. In cases where the reference
implementation has low hardware utilization due to its fixed deployment
strategy, we achieve a geomean speedup of up to x2.813, while individual
operators can improve as much as x170.

can generate residual thermal stresses in injection-molded fiber-reinforced
plastic (FRP) objects. During cooling from mold to room temperature, these
stresses can be relaxed by large deformations resulting from an instability of
the unwarped configuration (i.e., buckling). This article investigates the
thermal buckling of thin FRP disks via an analytical formulation based on the
Foppl-von Karman theory. Expanding on our previous work, cylindrical orthotropy
with material parameters varying over the disk thickness is assumed in order to
account for thickness dependency of the glass fiber orientation distribution. A
disk parameter generalizing the thermal anisotropy ratio for homogeneous
orthotropic disks is introduced and its relation with the occurrence and
periodicity of buckling is discussed. This is done for a skin-coreskin model,
for which the core-to-total thickness ratio is defined. For fiber orientation
distributions typical of injection-molded disks, it is found that there exists
a value of the thickness ratio for which no buckling occurs. It is also
demonstrated that the periodicity of the first buckling mode is described by
the generalized thermal anisotropy ratio, thus extending the results obtained
for a homogeneous fiber orientation distribution. Improvements in the accuracy
of the predictions for experimental data available in the literature when using
the skin-core-skin model are shown. Finally, we study the relation between
buckling temperature and disk thickness and propose an expression for the
dependence of the normalized buckling temperature on the thermal anisotropy
ratio. Results of FEM simulations are used to validate the proposed expression,
proving its applicability and accuracy.

specific HPC codes. However even with the advent of High Level Synthesis (HLS),
which enables FPGA programmers to write code in C or C++, programming such
devices still requires considerable expertise. Much of this is due to the fact
that these architectures are founded on dataflow rather than the Von Neumann
abstraction of CPUs or GPUs. Thus programming FPGAs via imperative languages is
not optimal and can result in very significant performance differences between
the first and final versions of algorithms on dataflow architectures with the
steps in between often not obvious and requiring considerable expertise.
  In this position paper we argue that languages built upon dataflow principals
should be exploited to enable fast by construction codes for FPGAs, and this is
akin to the programmer adopting the abstraction of developing a bespoke
dataflow machine specialised for their application. It is our belief that much
can be learnt from the generation of dataflow languages that gained popularity
in the 1970s and 1980s around programming general purpose dataflow machines,
and we introduce Lucent which is a modern derivative of Lucid, and used as a
vehicle to explore this hypothesis. The idea behind Lucent is to provide high
programmer productivity and performance for FPGAs by giving developers the most
suitable language level abstractions. The focus of Lucent is very much to
support the acceleration of HPC kernels, rather than the embedded electronics
and circuit level, and we provide a brief overview of the language driven by
examples.

However, they left open whether the existence of a quantum network coding

we characterize the set of distribution tasks achievable with non zero

which encompasses both types of distribution protocols by reducing the solving
of a distribution task to the factorization of a tensor with complex

concrete examples of both convergence and divergence. We answer by the negative
to the issue previously left open: some tasks are achievable in the quantum

tool for studying the extent of quantum network ability to perform multipartite

magnetic resonance (ODMR) study at room-temperature on individual TR12 centers
(ZPL at 471nm), which are known in the literature since 1956. In this work we
found TR12 centers to show a strong ODMR signal under optical saturation. These
observed defects were created in high-purity epitaxial layers of diamond by
standard irradiation and annealing processes. From the analysis of the ODMR
spectra along with antibunching measurements and coherent population trapping,
we proposed the energy level structure of TR12 center, consisting of ground
state and excited state singlets complemented by a metastable triplet in
between. Mapping the fluorescence dependence of the center on an external
magnetic field and on the polarization of laser excitation, allows us to
identify twelve inequivalent orientations for TR12 centers. This includes the
exact orientations of the dipole transition and the triplet axes in the diamond
lattice in full agreement with the results of modeling based on the proposed
level structure. Furthermore, a static Jahn-Teller effect was detected through
fluorescence switching between two levels at low optical excitation power,
directly observable in the real-time fluorescence signal for various
polarization of laser excitation. Based on these results we discuss the
prospects of the TR12 center in diamond for quantum sensing and quantum

optics and fluid mechanics. However, in order to solve the strict evolution
behavior of wave packet, it is necessary not only to determine the parameters
of various physical quantities such as mass, but also to carry out the complex
integration process in configuration space and momentum space. In the final
analysis, the evolution behavior of wave packet is the evolution behavior of
distribution function parameters with time. Using the method of grey system
theory, the time-varying parameters are replaced by time-varying response
series, and then the formal structure is constructed according to the physical
meaning of time evolution to realize the approximate simulation and approximate
calculation of wave function expression. The advantage of this method is that
it can simulate the evolution of wave packet under the uncertainty of each
physical quantity. Based on the grey system theory, this paper uses GM (1,1)
model to replace the time response function of wave packet distribution,
obtains the simulated evolution behavior of wave packet wave function by means
of mathematical techniques such as variational method, and makes error analysis
and correction. In practical application, the approximate evolution behavior of
wave function can be obtained only by determining the parameters of expansion
coefficient of wave function. In this paper, the Gauss wave packet is taken as
an example to discuss the method. The grey system theory of mathematical
modeling is introduced into physical calculation for the first time, and an
approximate calculation method which can be widely used in wave packet
evolution calculation is given.

of such scenarios in the light of cosmological data by making use of the Planck

  Applications","This is a pre-print for the paper version that has been accepted to
  TCAS-II, Express Briefs",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, almost all computer systems use IEEE-754 floating point to represent
real numbers. Recently, posit was proposed as an alternative to IEEE-754
floating point as it has better accuracy and a larger dynamic range. The
configurable nature of posit, with varying number of regime and exponent bits,
has acted as a deterrent to its adoption. To overcome this shortcoming, we
propose fixed-posit representation where the number of regime and exponent bits
are fixed, and present the design of a fixed-posit multiplier. We evaluate the
fixed-posit multiplier on error-resilient applications of AxBench and OpenBLAS
benchmarks as well as neural networks. The proposed fixed-posit multiplier has
47%, 38.5%, 22% savings for power, area and delay respectively when compared to
posit multipliers and up to 70%, 66%, 26% savings in power, area and delay
respectively when compared to 32-bit IEEE-754 multiplier. These savings are
accompanied with minimal output quality loss (1.2% average relative error)
across OpenBLAS and AxBench workloads. Further, for neural networks like
ResNet-18 on ImageNet we observe a negligible accuracy loss (0.12%) on using
the fixed-posit multiplier.

fossil energy exploration, waste disposal, geologic carbon sequestration, and

global water-energy nexus, providing both the source and buffering mechanisms
for enabling societal adaptation to climate variability and change. The
responsible use and exploration of geosystems are thus critical to the
geosystem governance, which in turn depends on the efficient monitoring, risk
assessment, and decision support tools for practical implementation. Fast
advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms and novel sensing technologies in
recent years have presented new opportunities for the subsurface research
community to improve the efficacy and transparency of geosystem governance.
Although recent studies have shown the great promise of scientific ML (SciML)
models, questions remain on how to best leverage ML in the management of
geosystems, which are typified by multiscality, high-dimensionality, and data
resolution inhomogeneity. This survey will provide a systematic review of the
recent development and applications of domain-aware SciML in geosystem

  Network",,,,,"eess.IV cs.LG cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The double JPEG compression detection has received much attention in recent
years due to its applicability as a forensic tool for the most widely used JPEG
file format. Existing state-of-the-art CNN-based methods either use histograms
of all the frequencies or rely on heuristics to select histograms of specific
low frequencies to classify single and double compressed images. However, even
amidst lower frequencies of double compressed images/patches, histograms of all
the frequencies do not have distinguishable features to separate them from
single compressed images. This paper directly extracts the quantized DCT
coefficients from the JPEG images without decompressing them in the pixel
domain, obtains all AC frequencies' histograms, uses a module based on $1\times
1$ depth-wise convolutions to learn the inherent relation between each
histogram and corresponding q-factor, and utilizes a tailor-made BiLSTM network
for selectively encoding these feature vector sequences. The proposed system
outperforms several baseline methods on a relatively large and diverse publicly
available dataset of single and double compressed patches. Another essential
aspect of any single vs. double JPEG compression detection system is handling
the scenario where test patches are compressed with entirely different
quantization matrices (Q-matrices) than those used while training; different
camera manufacturers and image processing software generally utilize their
customized quantization matrices. A set of extensive experiments shows that the
proposed system trained on a single dataset generalizes well on other datasets
compressed with completely unseen quantization matrices and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both seen and unseen quantization matrices
scenarios.

tensors in linearized gravity; many different tensors are published in the
literature, yet for particular calculations a unique expression is required. It
has been shown that (A) none of these spin-2 energy-momentum tensors are gauge
invariant and (B) the Noether and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors are not, in
general, equivalent; therefore uniqueness criteria is difficult to specify.
Conventional wisdom states that the various published energy-momentum tensors
for linearized gravity can be derived from the canonical Noether
energy-momentum tensor of spin-2 Fierz-Pauli theory by adding ad-hoc
'improvement' terms (the divergence of a superpotential and terms proportional
to the equations of motion), that these superpotentials are in some way unique
or physically significant, and that this implies some meaningful connection to
the Noether procedure. To explore this question of uniqueness, we consider the
most general possible energy-momentum tensor for linearized gravity with free
coefficients using the Fock method. We express this most general
energy-momentum tensor as the canonical Noether tensor, supplemented by the
divergence of a general superpotential plus all possible terms proportional to
the equations of motion. We then derive systems of equations which we solve in
order to prove several key results for spin-2 Fierz-Pauli theory, most notably
that there are infinitely many conserved energy-momentum tensors derivable from
the 'improvement' method, and there are infinitely many conserved symmetric
energy-momentum tensors that follow from specifying the Belinfante
superpotential alone. $\dots$ since there are infinitely many energy-momentum
tensors of this form, no meaningful or unique connection to Noether's first
theorem can be claimed by application of the canonical Noether 'improvement'
method.

policies. When this signal is sparse or the corresponding gradient is
deceptive, such agents need a dedicated mechanism to efficiently explore their
search space without relying on the reward. Looking for a large diversity of
behaviors or using Motion Planning (MP) algorithms are two options in this
context. In this paper, we build on the common roots between these two options
to investigate the properties of two diversity search algorithms, the Novelty
Search and the Goal Exploration Process algorithms. These algorithms look for
diversity in an outcome space or behavioral space which is generally
hand-designed to represent what matters for a given task. The relation to MP
algorithms reveals that the smoothness, or lack of smoothness of the mapping
between the policy parameter space and the outcome space plays a key role in
the search efficiency. In particular, we show empirically that, if the mapping
is smooth enough, i.e. if two close policies in the parameter space lead to
similar outcomes, then diversity algorithms tend to inherit exploration
properties of MP algorithms. By contrast, if it is not, diversity algorithms
lose these properties and their performance strongly depends on specific
heuristics, notably filtering mechanisms that discard some of the explored
policies.

The structure of the chaotic component is discerned from the cells visited by
the chaotic orbit. The fractal dimension of the border of the chaotic component

box-counting method. The cell-filling dynamics is compared to a model of
uncorrelated motion, the so-called random model [Robnik et al. J. Phys. A:

phase space are found. The statistics of the number of orbit visits to the
cells is analyzed and found to be in agreement with the random model in the
long run. The stickiness of the various structures in the phase space is
quantified in terms of the cell recurrence times. The recurrence time
distributions in a few selected cells as well as the mean and standard
deviation of recurrence times for all cells are analyzed. The standard
deviation of cell recurrence time is found to be a good quantifier of
stickiness on a global scale. Three methods for determining the measure of the

proposed on the basis of mass balance considerations. The model consists of a
system of parabolic partial differential equations for the variables
representing the concentrations of the bio-components constituting the waste
matrix and takes into account convective and diffusive phenomena. The plug-flow
reactor is modelled as a one-dimensional domain; the waste matrix moves in the
direction of the reactor axis and undergoes diffusive phenomena which reproduce
the movement of the bio-components along the reactor axis due to a gradient in
concentration. The velocity characterizing the convection of the waste matrix
is not fixed a priori but it is considered as an additional unknown of the
mathematical problem. The variation in the convective velocity allows to
account the mass variation occurring along a plug-flow reactor due to the
conversion of solids. The equation governing the convective velocity is derived
by considering the density of the waste matrix within the reactor constant over
time and the sum of the volume fractions of the bio-components constituting the
waste matrix constrained to unity. The waste matrix undergoes biochemical
transformations catalysed by anaerobic microbial species which lead to the
production of gaseous methane, the final product of the anaerobic digestion
process. Biochemical processes are modelled using a simplified scheme and a
differential equation is used to describe the dynamics of the produced gaseous
methane. A finite difference scheme is used for the numerical integration.
Model consistency is showed through numerical simulations which investigate the
effect of the variation of some operating parameters on process performance.
The model is then applied to a real case scenario of engineering interest.
Simulations produce results in good agreement with experimental observations.

generic features, widely used in both stages, are not reliable for
characterizing unseen objects, leading to poor generalization. To address this,
we introduce a novel approach for more accurate and efficient spatio-temporal
segmentation. In particular, to address \textbf{instance discrimination}, we
propose to combine foreground region estimation and instance grouping together

each frame, enabling more accurate object discovery. For \textbf{temporal

relation in two-dimensional Yukawa liquids. Using comprehensive molecular
dynamics simulations, we identify the time scales supporting the violation of
the SE relation $D\propto (\eta/T)^{-1}$, where $D$ is the self-diffusion
coefficient and $\eta$ is the shear viscosity. We first compute the
self-intermediate scattering function $F_s(k,t)$, the non-Gaussian parameter
$\alpha_2$, and the autocorrelation function of the shear stress $C_{\eta}(t)$.
The timescales obtained from these functions are included the structural
relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$, the peak time of the non-Gaussian parameter
$\tau_{\alpha_2}$, and the shear stress relaxation time $\tau_{\eta}$. We find
that $\tau_{\eta}$ is coupled with $D$ for all temperatures indicating the SE
preservation, however, $\tau_{\alpha}$ and $\tau_{\alpha_2}$ are decoupled with
$D$ at low temperatures indicating the SE violation. Surprisingly, we find that
the origins of this violation are related to the non-exponential behavior of
the autocorrelation function of the shear stress and non-Gaussian behavior of
the distribution function of particle displacements. These results confirm
dynamic heterogeneity that occurs in two-dimensional Yukawa liquids that
reflects the presence of regions in which dust particles move faster than the
rest when the liquid cools to below the phase transition temperature.

broad range of machine learning tasks, ranging from anomaly detection and
manifold learning to graph classification. Persistent homology is one of the
key approaches here, allowing us to systematically assess the evolution of
various hidden patterns in the data as we vary a scale parameter. The extracted
patterns, or homological features, along with information on how long such
features persist throughout the considered filtration of a scale parameter,
convey a critical insight into salient data characteristics and data
organization.
  In this work, we introduce two new and easily interpretable topological
summaries for single and multi-parameter persistence, namely, saw functions and
multi-persistence grid functions, respectively. Compared to the existing
topological summaries which tend to assess the numbers of topological features
and/or their lifespans at a given filtration step, our proposed saw and
multi-persistence grid functions allow us to explicitly account for essential
complementary information such as the numbers of births and deaths at each
filtration step.
  These new topological summaries can be regarded as the complexity measures of
the evolving subspaces determined by the filtration and are of particular
utility for applications of persistent homology on graphs. We derive
theoretical guarantees on the stability of the new saw and multi-persistence
grid functions and illustrate their applicability for graph classification
tasks.

  Reality",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Social presence, the feeling of being there with a real person, will fuel the
next generation of communication systems driven by digital humans in virtual
reality (VR). The best 3D video-realistic VR avatars that minimize the uncanny
effect rely on person-specific (PS) models. However, these PS models are
time-consuming to build and are typically trained with limited data
variability, which results in poor generalization and robustness. Major sources
of variability that affects the accuracy of facial expression transfer
algorithms include using different VR headsets (e.g., camera configuration,
slop of the headset), facial appearance changes over time (e.g., beard,
make-up), and environmental factors (e.g., lighting, backgrounds). This is a
major drawback for the scalability of these models in VR. This paper makes
progress in overcoming these limitations by proposing an end-to-end
multi-identity architecture (MIA) trained with specialized augmentation
strategies. MIA drives the shape component of the avatar from three cameras in
the VR headset (two eyes, one mouth), in untrained subjects, using minimal
personalized information (i.e., neutral 3D mesh shape). Similarly, if the PS
texture decoder is available, MIA is able to drive the full avatar
(shape+texture) robustly outperforming PS models in challenging scenarios. Our
key contribution to improve robustness and generalization, is that our method
implicitly decouples, in an unsupervised manner, the facial expression from
nuisance factors (e.g., headset, environment, facial appearance). We
demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of the proposed method
versus state-of-the-art PS approaches in a variety of experiments.

including the cumbersome process of feature engineering. Designing
representative features require expert domain knowledge. There is a need for
minimizing human experts' intervention by circumventing handcrafted feature

automatically. Previous work has shown that operational codes (opcodes) of

application of deep RL. We demonstrate that symmetry-reduced deep RL yields
improved data efficiency as well as improved control policy efficacy compared
to policies found by naive deep RL. Interestingly, the policy learned by the

of the forced KSE that is connected by continuation to an equilibrium of the

Authors (CC and FF) found the gravitational potential, the Schrodinger
equation, the solution for the energy levels, the area quantum and the quantum
representation of the ground state at the Planck scale of the SBH. Such results
are consistent with previous ones in the literature. It was also shown that the
traditional classical singularity in the core of the SBH is replaced by a
quantum oscillator describing a non-singular two-particle system where the two
components, named the ""nucleus"" and the ""electron"", strongly interact with each
other through a quantum gravitational interaction. In agreement with the de
Broglie hypothesis, the ""electron"" is interpreted in terms of the quantum
oscillations of the BH horizon. In other words, the SBH should be the
gravitational analogous of the hydrogen atom. In this paper, it is shown that
these results allow us to compute the SBH entropy as a function of the BH
principal quantum number in terms of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and three
sub-leading corrections. In addition, the coefficient of the formula of
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is reduced to a quarter of the traditional value.
Then, it is shown that, by performing a correct rescaling of the energy levels,
the semi-classical Bohr-like approach to BH quantum physics, previously
developed by one of the Authors (CC), is consistent with the obtained results
for large values of the BH principal quantum number. After this, Hawking
radiation will be analysed by discussing its connection with the BH quantum
structure. Finally, it is shown that the time evolution of the above mentioned
system solves the BH information paradox.

  Understanding","10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contextualized entity representations learned by state-of-the-art
transformer-based language models (TLMs) like BERT, GPT, T5, etc., leverage the
attention mechanism to learn the data context from training data corpus.
However, these models do not use the knowledge context. Knowledge context can
be understood as semantics about entities and their relationship with
neighboring entities in knowledge graphs. We propose a novel and effective
technique to infuse knowledge context from multiple knowledge graphs for
conceptual and ambiguous entities into TLMs during fine-tuning. It projects
knowledge graph embeddings in the homogeneous vector-space, introduces new
token-types for entities, aligns entity position ids, and a selective attention
mechanism. We take BERT as a baseline model and implement the
""Knowledge-Infused BERT"" by infusing knowledge context from ConceptNet and
WordNet, which significantly outperforms BERT and other recent knowledge-aware
BERT variants like ERNIE, SenseBERT, and BERT_CS over eight different subtasks
of GLUE benchmark. The KI-BERT-base model even significantly outperforms
BERT-large for domain-specific tasks like SciTail and academic subsets of QQP,
QNLI, and MNLI.

also prove the existence of metric connections, we show that our rigid body

application of AI in automation. This paper reports on a systematic review of
the published studies used to investigate the application of AI in PM. This
comprehensive systematic review used ScienceDirect to identify relevant
articles. Of the 422 articles found, 40 met the inclusion and exclusion
criteria and were used in the review. Selected articles were classified based
on categories of human factors and areas of application. The results indicated
that application of AI in automation with respect to human factors could be
divided into three areas of physical ergonomics, cognitive ergonomic and
organizational ergonomics. The main areas of application in physical and
cognitive ergonomics are including transportation, User experience, and
human-machine interactions.

research fields of life science, condensed matter physics and physical
chemistry. In non-liquid environments, this task is commonly regarded as
difficult due to strong adhesive surface force ($\sim\mu\rm N$) between solid
interfaces that makes tiny optical driven force ($\sim\rm pN$) insignificant.
Here, by recognizing the microscopic interaction mechanism between friction
force -- the parallel component of surface force on the contact surface -- and
thermoelastic waves induced by pulsed optical absorption, we establish a
general principle enabling the actuation of micro-objects on dry frictional
surfaces based on the opto-thermo-mechanical effects. Theoretically, we predict
that nanosecond pulsed optical absorption with mW-scale peak power is
sufficient to tame $\mu\rm N$-scale friction force. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that two-dimensional spiral motion of gold plates on micro-fibers
driven by a nanosecond pulsed laser, and reveal the specific rules of motion
control. Our results pave the way for future development of micro-scale
actuators in nonliquid environments.

COVID-19 cases and environmental factors, such as temperature, relative
humidity, and atmospheric pollutants. Our analysis confirms a significant
association of some environmental parameters with the spread of the virus. This
suggests that machine learning models trained on the environmental parameters
to predict the number of future infected cases may be accurate. Predictive
models may be useful for helping institutions in making decisions for
protecting the population and contrasting the pandemic.

to suggest a practical path to ensure the development and use of AI at the

AI is an increasingly powerful tool with potential for good, albeit one with a
high risk of negative side-effects that go against fundamental human rights and
UN values. It explains the need for ethical principles for AI aligned with
principles for data governance, as data and AI are tightly interwoven. It
explores different ethical frameworks that exist and tools such as assessment
lists. It recommends that the UN develop a framework consisting of ethical
principles, architectural standards, assessment methods, tools and
methodologies, and a policy to govern the implementation and adherence to this
framework, accompanied by an education program for staff.

  pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent years have seen rapid development in Information Extraction, as well
as its subtask, Relation Extraction. Relation Extraction is able to detect
semantic relations between entities in sentences. Currently, many efficient
approaches have been applied to relation extraction tasks. Supervised learning
approaches especially have good performance. However, there are still many
difficult challenges. One of the most serious problems is that manually labeled
data is difficult to acquire. In most cases, limited data for supervised
approaches equals lousy performance. Thus here, under the situation with only
limited training data, we focus on how to improve the performance of our
supervised baseline system with unsupervised pre-training. Feature is one of
the key components in improving the supervised approaches. Traditional
approaches usually apply hand-crafted features, which require expert knowledge
and expensive human labor. However, this type of feature might suffer from data
sparsity: when the training set size is small, the model parameters might be
poorly estimated. In this thesis, we present several novel unsupervised
pre-training models to learn the distributed text representation features,
which are encoded with rich syntactic-semantic patterns of relation
expressions. The experiments have demonstrated that this type of feature,
combine with the traditional hand-crafted features, could improve the
performance of the logistic classification model for relation extraction,
especially on the classification of relations with only minor training
instances.
