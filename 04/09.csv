this purpose, the Casimir force in the sphere-plate geometry is computed
independently on the basis of first principles of quantum electrodynamics using
the scattering theory and the gradient expansion. In doing so, the
frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of Au is found from the optical
data extrapolated to zero frequency by means of the plasma and Drude models. It
is shown that the measurement results exclude the Drude model extrapolation
over the region of separations from 0.2 to 4.8~$\upmu$m, whereas the
alternative extrapolation by means of the plasma model is experimentally
consistent over the entire measurement range. A discussion of the obtained

organic and inorganic substances such as salt, proteins, peptides, mucins,
virions, etc. The presence of such solutes affects the evaporation time of
respiratory droplets that are sedimenting in air, and thereby the airborne
transmission of infections. From solutions of the coupled heat-conduction and
water-diffusion equations within the droplet and in the ambient vapor phase, we
find that the solute-induced water vapor-pressure reduction considerably slows
down the evaporation process and dominates the solute-concentration dependence
of the droplet evaporation time. The evaporation-induced solute-concentration
gradient near the droplet surface, which is accounted for using a two-stage
evaporation model, is found to further intensify the slowing down of the drying
process. On the other hand, the presence of solutes is found to reduce
evaporation cooling of the droplet, which causes a slight decrease in the
evaporation time. Overall, the first two effects are dominant, meaning that the
droplet evaporation time increases in the presence of solutes. The
solute-concentration dependence of the water diffusivity inside the droplet
does not significantly change the evaporation time. Finally, crust formation on
the droplet surface is found to increase the final equilibrium size of the
droplet.

the hyperbolic spaces, that exhibit better inductive biases for hierarchical
structures and may better reveal linguistic hierarchies encoded in
contextualized representations. We introduce a Poincare probe, a structural
probe projecting these embeddings into a Poincare subspace with explicitly
defined hierarchies. We focus on two probing objectives: (a) dependency trees
where the hierarchy is defined as head-dependent structures; (b) lexical
sentiments where the hierarchy is defined as the polarity of words (positivity
and negativity). We argue that a key desideratum of a probe is its sensitivity
to the existence of linguistic structures. We apply our probes on BERT, a
typical contextualized embedding model. In a syntactic subspace, our probe
better recovers tree structures than Euclidean probes, revealing the
possibility that the geometry of BERT syntax may not necessarily be Euclidean.
In a sentiment subspace, we reveal two possible meta-embeddings for positive

would change the geometric localization of embeddings. We demonstrate the

paper considers the DADD problem for both uncoded and coded media modulation

exhibit a doubly structured sparsity in both the time domain and the modulation

for the past years. Recent works have mainly focused on pushing the
state-of-the-art in the general-purpose COCO benchmark. However, the use of
such detection frameworks in specific applications such as autonomous driving
is yet an area to be addressed. This study presents an enhanced 2D object
detector based on Faster R-CNN that is better suited for the context of
autonomous vehicles. Two main aspects are improved: the anchor generation
procedure and the performance drop in minority classes. The default uniform
anchor configuration is not suitable in this scenario due to the perspective
projection of the vehicle cameras. Therefore, we propose a perspective-aware
methodology that divides the image into key regions via clustering and uses
evolutionary algorithms to optimize the base anchors for each of them.
Furthermore, we add a module that enhances the precision of the second-stage
header network by including the spatial information of the candidate regions
proposed in the first stage. We also explore different re-weighting strategies
to address the foreground-foreground class imbalance, showing that the use of a
reduced version of focal loss can significantly improve the detection of
difficult and underrepresented objects in two-stage detectors. Finally, we
design an ensemble model to combine the strengths of the different learning
strategies. Our proposal is evaluated with the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the
most extensive and diverse up to date. The results demonstrate an average
accuracy improvement of 6.13% mAP when using the best single model, and of
9.69% mAP with the ensemble. The proposed modifications over the Faster R-CNN

which our posterior enjoys consistency in a well-specified setting and outlier
robustness. We perform inference with pseudo-marginal (PM) Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) or stochastic-gradient (SG) MCMC. While PM-MCMC works
satisfactorily for simple setups, it mixes poorly for concentrated targets.
Conversely, SG-MCMC requires differentiating the simulator model but improves
performance over PM-MCMC when both work and scales to higher-dimensional setups
as it is rejection-free. Although both techniques target the SR posterior
approximately, the error diminishes as the number of model simulations at each
MCMC step increases. In our simulations, we employ automatic differentiation to
effortlessly differentiate the simulator model. We compare our posterior with
related approaches on standard benchmarks and a chaotic dynamical system from
meteorology, for which SG-MCMC allows inferring the parameters of a neural
network used to parametrize a part of the update equations of the dynamical
system.

the capability to perform daily living activities. Current control methods
based on physiological signals such as electromyography (EMG) are prone to
yielding poor inference outcomes due to motion artifacts, muscle fatigue, and
many more. Vision sensors are a major source of information about the
environment state and can play a vital role in inferring feasible and intended
gestures. However, visual evidence is also susceptible to its own artifacts,
most often due to object occlusion, lighting changes, etc. Multimodal evidence
fusion using physiological and vision sensor measurements is a natural approach
due to the complementary strengths of these modalities. Methods: In this paper,
we present a Bayesian evidence fusion framework for grasp intent inference
using eye-view video, eye-gaze, and EMG from the forearm processed by neural
network models. We analyze individual and fused performance as a function of
time as the hand approaches the object to grasp it. For this purpose, we have
also developed novel data processing and augmentation techniques to train
neural network components. Results: Our results indicate that, on average,
fusion improves the instantaneous upcoming grasp type classification accuracy
while in the reaching phase by 13.66% and 14.8%, relative to EMG and visual
evidence individually, resulting in an overall fusion accuracy of 95.3%.
Conclusion: Our experimental data analyses demonstrate that EMG and visual
evidence show complementary strengths, and as a consequence, fusion of
multimodal evidence can outperform each individual evidence modality at any

the power consumed on the electricity grid. Due to wake effects, the available
power is reduced and turbulence is increased at downstream wind turbines. Such
effects lead to a design challenge for wind farm control, where the delicate
balance between supply and demand should be maintained, while considering the
load balancing in the wind turbine structures. We propose a control
architecture based on simple feedback controllers that adjusts the demanded
power set points of individual wind turbines to compensate for turbine
saturations and to balance thrust forces. For compensation purposes, the
dynamics of power tracking in the wind turbines is approximated as a pure
time-delay process, and the thrust force balance design is based on an
identified linear model of the turbines. In this paper, we show that the
proposed control architecture allows the generated power to track its reference
even when turbines saturate, while the thrust forces are balanced. In addition,
the result shows that the proposed power dispatch strategy, which considers
thrust force balance, also avoids turbine saturation, being thus beneficial for
energy production. The effectiveness of the proposed feedback controller is
demonstrated using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a
small wind farm.

we have every neighbor describe the position of the point within its own

parallel transport in a scattering operation while placing no constraints on
the filters themselves, providing a definition of convolution that commutes
with the action of isometries, has increased descriptive potential, and is
robust to noise and other nuisance factors. The result is a rich notion of
convolution which we call field convolution, well-suited for CNNs on surfaces.
Field convolutions are flexible, straight-forward to incorporate into surface
learning frameworks, and their highly discriminating nature has cascading
effects throughout the learning pipeline. Using simple networks constructed
from residual field convolution blocks, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
standard benchmarks in fundamental geometry processing tasks, such as shape
classification, segmentation, correspondence, and sparse matching.

success on single degradation, they still suffer performance drop with multiple
degrading effects in real scenarios. Recently, some blind and non-blind models
for multiple degradations have been explored. However, those methods usually
degrade significantly for distribution shifts between the training and test
data. Towards this end, we propose a conditional meta-network framework (named
CMDSR) for the first time, which helps SR framework learn how to adapt to
changes in input distribution. We extract degradation prior at task-level with
the proposed ConditionNet, which will be used to adapt the parameters of the
basic SR network (BaseNet). Specifically, the ConditionNet of our framework
first learns the degradation prior from a support set, which is composed of a
series of degraded image patches from the same task. Then the adaptive BaseNet
rapidly shifts its parameters according to the conditional features. Moreover,
in order to better extract degradation prior, we propose a task contrastive
loss to decrease the inner-task distance and increase the cross-task distance
between task-level features. Without predefining degradation maps, our blind
framework can conduct one single parameter update to yield considerable SR
results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMDSR over
various blind, even non-blind methods. The flexible BaseNet structure also
reveals that CMDSR can be a general framework for large series of SISR models.

1) only ureteroscopy images, 2) only cystoscopy images and 3) the combination

paper demonstrates the viability of utilizing a sensor with time-series and

for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) are used to assess the benefit of a
color dynamic capture. The first algorithm utilizes Static-Temporal Feature
Engineering on the fingerprint capture to generate a classification decision.
The second generates its classification decision using features extracted by
way of the Inception V3 CNN trained on ImageNet. Classification performance is
evaluated using features extracted exclusively from the static capture,
exclusively from the dynamic capture, and on a fusion of the two feature sets.
With both PAD approaches we find that the fusion of the dynamic and static

algorithm based on natural language processing that automatically detects

physician notes in Research Data Warehouse at CHU Sainte Justine Hospital.
First, a word representation learning technique was employed by using
bag-of-word (BoW), term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and
neural word embeddings (word2vec). Each representation technique aims to retain
the words semantic and syntactic analysis in critical care data. It helps to
enrich the mutual information for the word representation and leads to an
advantage for further appropriate analysis steps. Second, a machine learning
classifier was used to detect the patients condition for either cardiac failure
or stable patient through the created word representation vector space from the
previous step. This machine learning approach is based on a supervised binary
classification algorithm, including logistic regression (LR), Gaussian
Naive-Bayes (GaussianNB), and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN).
Technically, it mainly optimizes the empirical loss during training the
classifiers. As a result, an automatic learning algorithm would be accomplished
to draw a high classification performance, including accuracy (acc), precision
(pre), recall (rec), and F1 score (f1). The results show that the combination
of TFIDF and MLPNN always outperformed other combinations with all overall

modelling the inverse function of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) either

output. On the other hand, partially modelling the inverse function means
generating the values of a subset of features and fixing the remaining feature
values. The feature set generation is a critical step for artificial neural
networks, useful in several practical applications in engineering and science.
The proposed Oracle Guided Generative Neural Network, dubbed as OGGN, is
flexible to handle a variety of feature generation problems. In general, an ANN
is able to predict the target values based on given feature vectors. The OGGN
architecture enables to generate feature vectors given the predetermined target
values of an ANN. When generated feature vectors are fed to the forward ANN,
the target value predicted by ANN will be close to the predetermined target
values. Therefore, the OGGN architecture is able to map, inverse function of
the function represented by forward ANN. Besides, there is another important
contribution of this work. This paper also introduces a new class of functions,
defined as constraint functions. The constraint functions enable a neural
network to investigate a given local space for a longer period of time. Thus,
enabling to find a local optimum of the loss function apart from just being
able to find the global optimum. OGGN can also be adapted to solve a system of
polynomial equations in many variables. The experiments on synthetic datasets

Search (NS) draws more and more attention from the research community, it is
natural to expect that its application to increasingly complex real-world

Spaces which will not necessarily be Euclidean. Novelty Search traditionally
relies on k-nearest neighbours search and an archive of previously visited
behavior descriptors which are assumed to live in a Euclidean space. This is
problematic because of a number of issues. On one hand, Euclidean distance and
Nearest-neighbour search are known to behave differently and become less
meaningful in high dimensional spaces. On the other hand, the archive has to be
bounded since, memory considerations aside, the computational complexity of
finding nearest neighbours in that archive grows linearithmically with its
size. A sub-optimal bound can result in ""cycling"" in the behavior space, which
inhibits the progress of the exploration. Furthermore, the performance of NS
depends on a number of algorithmic choices and hyperparameters, such as the
strategies to add or remove elements to the archive and the number of
neighbours to use in k-nn search. In this paper, we discuss an alternative
approach to novelty estimation, dubbed Behavior Recognition based Novelty

zero Kelvin, the so-called quantum critical systems, appear to fall into two
categories: (chemically) heavily-doped systems where the unusual properties can
be related to a disorder-induced distribution of Kondo shielding temperatures,
and (almost) stoichiometric systems where the departures from Fermi-liquid
theory have been attributed to intrinsic instabilities. Here we show that this
distinction is not as clear cut and that magnetic clusters associated with a
distribution of Kondo shielding temperatures are also present in
CeRu$_2$Si$_2$, a system close to a quantum critical point. By revisiting
published data on this system and comparing them to the results for
heavily-doped quantum critical Ce(Ru$_{0.755}$Fe$_{0.245}$)$_2$Ge$_2$, we show
that clusters exist in both systems at low temperatures, and that the moments
of the Ce-ions within these clusters have all lined up with their neighbors.
This implies that the dominant physics that drives heavily-doped systems,
namely spontaneous formation of magnetic clusters, should also play a leading
role in the response of homogenous systems. This represents a notable departure
of how the physics that governs quantum critical points is treated in the
literature.

the log-likelihood function using a Gaussian process (GP) in a local fashion

Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm would take if it was applicable. New
log-likelihood evaluation locations are selected using sequential experimental
design strategies such that each MH accept/reject decision is done within a
pre-specified error tolerance. The resulting approach is conceptually simple
and sample-efficient as it takes full advantage of the GP model. It is also
more robust to violations of GP modelling assumptions and better suited for the
typical situation where the posterior is substantially more concentrated than
the prior, compared with various existing inference methods based on global GP
surrogate modelling. We discuss the probabilistic interpretations and central
theoretical aspects of our approach, and we then demonstrate the benefits of
the resulting algorithm in the context of likelihood-free inference for

is feasible in gridworlds, but how do we scale it to complex tasks? In this

entity, the social planner, as a powerful decision maker who manages all
resources. However, this is often not the case in practice. Instead of making
this assumption, we specifically examine the innate noncooperative nature of
two different entities involved in the planning problem. Namely, they are the
charging service provider (CSP) and the fleet operator (FO). To address the
strategic interaction between entities, a bilevel mixed integer program is
formulated, with the CSP and FO problems expressed in the upper and lower
levels respectively, in a joint decision making process. These decisions
involve the CSP infrastructure siting, sizing, substation capacity upgrades,
the FO fleet composition, vehicle routing, charging, and delivery assignment.
To relieve computational burdens, we utilize a double loop solution
architecture to iteratively reach optimality. We conduct detailed numerical
studies on a synthesized small network and the simulation results reveal the
unique aspects of this two entity framework. This modeling perspective can be

to capture 3D shapes in a continuous and resolution-independent manner.
However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing
approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points.
However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent
and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce
SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for
polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward
deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined
in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen
poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging
since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not
be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that
finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root
finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling
end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to
state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes
better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in
challenging scenarios on (clothed) 3D humans in diverse and unseen poses.

gases confined by regular background measures at determinantal inverse
temperature, and a class of random polynomials. We observe that the limiting
outlier process only depends on the shape of the uncharged region containing
them, and the global net excess charge.
  In particular, for a determinantal Coulomb gas confined by a sufficiently
regular background measure, the outliers in a simply connected uncharged region
converge to the corresponding Bergman point process. For a finitely connected
uncharged region $\Omega$, a family of limiting outlier processes arises,
indexed by the (Pontryagin) dual of the fundamental group of $\Omega$.
Moreover, the outliers in different uncharged regions are asymptotically

methods are typically optimized for a single signal. We present a new

low-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGB
color). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the target
signal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesis
network. We also propose a local-functional representation which enables
generalization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,with

analysis methodology currently assimilating and inventing deep learning
techniques. The bulk of the sophisticated flagship searches of the field rely
on the time-tested matched filtering principle within their core. In this
paper, we make a key observation on the relationship between the emerging deep
learning and the traditional techniques: matched filtering is formally
equivalent to a particular neural network. This means that a neural network can
be constructed analytically to exactly implement matched filtering, and can be
further trained on data or boosted with additional complexity for improved
performance. Moreover, we show that the proposed neural network architecture
can outperform matched filtering, both with or without knowledge of a prior on
the parameter distribution. When a prior is given, the proposed neural network
can approach the statistically optimal performance. We also propose and
investigate two different neural network architectures MNet-Shallow and
MNet-Deep, both of which implement matched filtering at initialization and can
be trained on data. MNet-Shallow has simpler structure, while MNet-Deep is more
flexible and can deal with a wider range of distributions. Our theoretical
findings are corroborated by experiments using real LIGO data and synthetic
injections, where our proposed methods significantly outperform matched
filtering at false positive rates above $5\times 10^{-3}\%$. The fundamental
equivalence between matched filtering and neural networks allows us to define a
""complexity standard candle"" to characterize the relative complexity of the
different approaches to gravitational wave signal searches in a common
framework. Finally, our results suggest new perspectives on the role of deep
learning in gravitational wave detection.

We think this ability to forecast, i.e., to anticipate, is integral for the
success of autonomous agents which need not only passively analyze an
observation but also must react to it in real-time. Importantly, accurate
forecasting hinges upon the chosen scene decomposition. We think that superior
forecasting can be achieved by decomposing a dynamic scene into individual
'things' and background 'stuff'. Background 'stuff' largely moves because of
camera motion, while foreground 'things' move because of both camera and
individual object motion. Following this decomposition, we introduce panoptic
segmentation forecasting. Panoptic segmentation forecasting opens up a
middle-ground between existing extremes, which either forecast instance
trajectories or predict the appearance of future image frames. To address this
task we develop a two-component model: one component learns the dynamics of the
background stuff by anticipating odometry, the other one anticipates the
dynamics of detected things. We establish a leaderboard for this novel task,
and validate a state-of-the-art model that outperforms available baselines.

low computational resources. Second, large images should be locally and
globally consistent, avoid repetitive patterns, and look realistic. To address

studies report a correlation between the mass of a protoplanetary disc and its
distance to massive ionising stars in star-forming regions, and cite external
photoevaporation by the massive stars as the origin of this correlation. We
present N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions
and determine the mass-loss in protoplanetary discs from external
photoevaporation due to far ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
radiation from massive stars. We find that projection effects can be
significant, in that low-mass disc-hosting stars that appear close to the
ionising sources may be fore- or background stars in the star-forming region.
We find very little evidence in our simulations for a trend in increasing disc
mass with increasing distance from the massive star(s), even when projection
effects are ignored. Furthermore, the dynamical evolution of these young
star-forming regions moves stars whose discs have been photoevaporated to
far-flung locations, away from the ionising stars, and we suggest that any
correlation between disc mass and distance the ionising star is either
coincidental, or due to some process other than external photoevaporation.

radiative stability of the inflaton potential leads to upper bounds. In

electromagnetic waves, we here compare with quadrupole waves in axisymmetry. We
perform numerical simulations of dipole and quadrupole wave initial data,
fine-tuning both sets of data to the onset of black hole formation in order to
study the critical solution and related critical phenomena. We observe that
different multipole moments have different symmetries, indicating that the
critical solution for electromagnetic waves cannot be unique, at least not
globally. This is confirmed in our numerical simulations: while dipole data
lead to a single center of collapse, at the center of symmetry, quadrupole data
feature two separate centers of collapse on the symmetry axis, above and below
the center of symmetry -- reminiscent of similar findings reported for critical
collapse of vacuum gravitational waves. While the critical solution for neither
the dipole nor the quadrupole data is exactly self-similar, we find that their
approximate echoing periods appear to differ, as do the critical exponents. We
discuss whether the centers of collapse found for dipole and quadrupole data
might all have the same properties, which would suggest a ""local uniqueness"" of
the critical solution. Instead, we provide some evidence -- including the

baryon physics. Many of the ICM clumps can originate from infalling galaxies,
as stripped interstellar medium (ISM) mixing into the hot ICM. However, a
direct connection between ICM clumping and stripped ISM has not been
unambiguously established before. Here we present the discovery of the first
and still the only known isolated cloud (or orphan cloud, OC) detected in both
X-rays and H$\alpha$ in the nearby cluster Abell 1367. With an effective radius
of 30 kpc, this cloud has an average X-ray temperature of 1.6 keV, a bolometric
X-ray luminosity of $\sim 3.1\times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a hot gas mass of
$\sim 10^{10}\ {\rm M}_\odot$. From the MUSE data, the OC shows an interesting
velocity gradient nearly along the east-west direction with a low level of
velocity dispersion of $\sim 80$ km/s, which may suggest a low level of the ICM
turbulence. The emission line diagnostics suggest little star formation in the
main H$\alpha$ cloud and a LI(N)ER-like spectrum, but the excitation mechanism
remain unclear. This example shows that the stripped ISM, even long time after
the initial removal from the galaxy, can still induce the ICM inhomogeneities.
We suggest that magnetic field can stabilize the OC by suppressing hydrodynamic
instabilities and thermal conduction. This example also suggests that at least
some ICM clumps are multi-phase in nature and implies that the ICM clumps can
also be traced in H$\alpha$. Thus, future deep and wide-field H$\alpha$ survey
can be used to probe the ICM clumping and turbulence.

water production and water treatment. The major concern in many applications is
the formation of a biological fouling layer leading to increased hydraulic
resistance and flux decline during membrane operations. The growth of bacteria
constituting such a biological layer implicates the formation of a multispecies
biofilm and the consequent increase of operational costs for reactor management
and cleaning procedures. To predict the biofilm growth and evolution during the
filtration process, a one-dimensional continuous model has been developed by
considering a free boundary value problem describing biofilm dynamics and EPS
production in different operational phases of microfiltration systems. The
growth of microbial species and EPS is governed by a system of hyperbolic PDEs.
Substrates dynamics are modeled thorough parabolic equations accounting for
diffusive and advective fluxes generated during the filtration process. The
free boundary evolution depends on both microbial growth and detachment
processes. The proposed model has been solved numerically to simulate biofilm
evolution during biologically relevant conditions, and to investigate the
hydraulic behavior of the membrane. The model has been calibrated and validated
using lab scale experimental data. In all cases, numerical results accurately
predicted the membrane pressure drop occurring in the microfiltration system.

there are multiple input sources, e.g., multi-modal data from different
sensors, requiring diverse data preprocessing, sensor fusion, and feature
aggregation. Second, there are multiple tasks that require various AI models to
run simultaneously, e.g., perception, localization, and control. Third, the
computing and control system is heterogeneous, composed of hardware components
with varied features, such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and dedicated
accelerators. Therefore, autonomous systems essentially require multi-modal
multi-task (MMMT) learning which must be aware of hardware performance and
implementation strategies. While MMMT learning has been attracting intensive
research interests, its applications in autonomous systems are still
underexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the opportunities of applying
MMMT techniques in autonomous systems and then discuss the unique challenges
that must be solved. In addition, we discuss the necessity and opportunities of
MMMT model and hardware co-design, which is critical for autonomous systems
especially with power/resource-limited or heterogeneous platforms. We formulate
the MMMT model and heterogeneous hardware implementation co-design as a
differentiable optimization problem, with the objective of improving the
solution quality and reducing the overall power consumption and critical path
latency. We advocate for further explorations of MMMT in autonomous systems and
software/hardware co-design solutions.

detectors and systems working in the so-called TeraHertz (THz) gap covering the
frequency window from 0.1 to 10 THz (1 THz = 10$^{12}$~Hz). This gap represents
a challenge for conventional electronic devices due to carrier transit delays
($\sim$1-10ps), as well as for photonic devices due to thermal fluctuations
(300K$\sim$6THz). Nonetheless, designing efficient, room-temperature THz
sources would constitute a key enabler to applications spanning from
high-resolution imaging to extreme wide band wireless communication. Whereas
high-harmonic generation in solid is usually limited to less than ten
harmonics, broadband THz emission has been demonstrated using laser-induced
superdiffusive spin currents in magnetic bilayers composed of a ferromagnet
deposited on top of a noble metal. While promising, this technique presents the
major disadvantage of necessitating optical pumping and hence lacks
scalability. Here, we demonstrate that extremely high harmonic emission can be
achieved by exploiting conventional spin pumping, without the need of optical
excitation. We show that when the spin-orbit coupling strength is close to the
s-d exchange energy, a strongly non linear regime resulting from resonant spin
flip scattering occurs leading to the generation of a thousand of harmonics at
realistic antiferromagnetic precession frequencies, thereby enhancing both spin
and charge dynamics by two orders of magnitude, and allowing for an emission at
frequencies above 300 THz.

physical machines to learn optimal behavior instead of being programmed.
However, effective control of the machines usually requires fine time
discretization. The most common RL methods apply independent random elements to
each action, which is not suitable in that setting. It is not feasible because
it causes the controlled system to jerk, and does not ensure sufficient
exploration since a~single action is not long enough to create a~significant
experience that could be translated into policy improvement. In our view these
are the main obstacles that prevent application of RL in contemporary control
systems. To address these pitfalls, in this paper we introduce an RL framework
and adequate analytical tools for actions that may be stochastically dependent
in subsequent time instances. We also introduce an RL algorithm that
approximately optimizes a~policy that produces such actions. It applies
experience replay to adjust likelihood of sequences of previous actions to
optimize expected $n$-step returns the policy yields. The efficiency of this
algorithm is verified against four other RL methods (CDAU, PPO, SAC, ACER) in

to $A_{_{\rm V}}\gtrsim 7$). The dust temperature, $T$, tends to be correlated
with the dust opacity index, $\beta$, with low $T$ and low $\beta$ tend
concentrated in the interiors of filaments. The one exception to this tendency
is a section of filament in L1688 that falls -- in projection -- between the
two B stars, S1 and HD147889; here $T$ and $\beta$ are relatively high, and
there is compelling evidence that feedback from these two stars has heated and
compressed the filament. Filament {\sc fwhm}s are typically in the range
$0.10\,{\rm pc}$ to $0.15\,{\rm pc}$. Most filaments have line densities in the
range $25\,{\rm M_{_\odot}\,pc^{-1}}$ to $65\,{\rm M_{_\odot}\,pc^{-1}}$. If
their only support is thermal gas pressure, and the gas is at the canonical
temperature of $10\,{\rm K}$, the filaments are highly supercritical. However,
there is some evidence from ammonia observations that the gas is significantly
warmer than this, and we cannot rule out the possibility of additional support
from turbulence and/or magnetic fields. On the basis of their spatial
distribution, we argue that most of the starless cores are likely to disperse
(rather than evolving to become prestellar).

stability and the root loci over a wide coupling range. Under the red-sideband
pumping and for the so-called $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase it displays a
double optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) for an experimentally

rate is the same inside coronal holes as in the quiet Sun, we show that
interchange reconnection between ERs and open field lines gives rise to a solar
wind energy flux that exceeds 10$^5$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and that scales as
the field strength at the coronal base, consistent with observations. In
addition to providing Ohmic heating in the low corona, these reconnection
events may be a source of Alfv{\'e}n waves with periods ranging from the
granular timescale of $\sim$10 minutes to the supergranular/plume timescale of
many hours, with some of the longer-period waves being reflected and dissipated
in the outer corona. The asymptotic wind speed depends on the radial
distribution of the heating, which is largely controlled by the rate of
flux-tube expansion. Along the rapidly diverging flux tubes associated with
slow wind, heating is concentrated well inside the sonic point (1) because the
outward conductive heat-flux density and thus the outer coronal temperatures
are reduced, and (2) because the net wave energy flux is dissipated at a rate
proportional to the local Alfv{\'e}n speed. In this ""hybrid"" solar wind model,
reconnection heats the lower corona and drives the mass flux, whereas waves
impart energy and momentum to the outflow at greater distances.

CNN-based reparameterization scheme that can be used to obtain improved
metallization designs. SolarNet modifies the optimization domain such that
rather than optimizing the electrode material distribution directly, the
weights of a CNN model are optimized. The design generated by CNN is then
evaluated using the physics equations, which in turn generates gradients for
backpropagation. SolarNet is trained end-to-end involving backpropagation

of a magnetic field. We show that, after carrying out the renormalization
procedure and identifying the most general perturbative tensor structure for
the modified fermion {mass operator} in the large field limit, the mass
develops an imaginary part. This happens when account is made of the
sub-leading contributions associated to Landau levels other than the lowest
one. The imaginary part is associated to a spectral density describing the
spread of the mass function in momentum. The center of the distribution
corresponds to the magnetic-field modified mass. The width becomes small as the
field intensity increases in such a way that for asymptotically large values of
the field, when the separation between Landau levels becomes also large, the
mass function describes a stable particle occupying only the lowest Landau
level. For large but finite values of the magnetic field, the spectral density
represents a finite probability for the fermion to occupy Landau levels other
than the LLL.

  $\mathbf{c} \in (-\infty, 25)$","56 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physics considerations suggest that a theory of Liouville quantum gravity
(LQG) should exist for all values of matter central charge $\mathbf{c} \in
(-\infty,25)$. Probabilists have rigorously defined LQG as a random metric
measure space for $\mathbf{c} < 1$; however, they have only very recently begun
to explore LQG in the $\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$ phase. We define a random metric
associated to LQG for all $\mathbf{c} < 25$ by a collection of axioms analogous
to axioms stated in the $\mathbf{c} < 1$ setting. We show that such a metric
exists for each $\mathbf{c}$ by considering an approximating metric known as
Liouville first passage percolation. Ding and Gwynne proved that these
approximating metrics are tight in a suitably chosen topology; we show that
every subsequential limit satisfies our axioms. In particular, our result
defines a metric associated to LQG in the critical case $\mathbf{c} =1$.
  The metrics we define for $\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$ exhibit geometric behavior
that sharply contrasts with the $\mathbf{c} < 1$ regime. We show that, for
$\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$, the metrics do not induce the Euclidean topology since
they a.s. have a dense (measure zero) set of singular points, points at
infinite distance from all other points. We use this fact to prove that a.s.
the metric ball is not compact and its boundary has infinite Hausdorff
dimension. Despite these differences, we demonstrate that many properties of
LQG metrics for $\mathbf{c} < 1$ extend in some form to the entire range
$(-\infty, 25)$. We show that the metrics are a.s. reverse H\""older continuous
with respect to the Euclidean metric, are a.s. complete and geodesic away from
the set of singular points, and satisfy the bounds for set-to-set distances
that hold in the $\mathbf{c} < 1$ phase. Finally, we prove that the metrics
satisfy a version of the (geometric) Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ)
formula.

layers as a function of thickness were determined. Our findings show that
optical absorption is red-shifted for a chemisorbed molecular layer relative to
the molecule in solution, indicating electronic coupling between the molecule

absorption characteristics follow Beers law, with no further shifts in the
wavelength of maximum absorption or low-energy absorption onset. For energies
where no absorption occurs, an internal photoemission process takes place
resulting in photocurrent that can be sustained over a limited range. For
energies at which the molecular component absorbs light, photocurrent can
proceed over longer distances, and the trends in photocurrent yield versus
thickness shows interesting trends that may be related to the distance scale
over which charge carriers can communicate with the conductive contacts. This
method is particularly relevant for strongly coupled systems that rely on
molecular properties to mediate charge transport, since excitation takes place

showing high efficiency. However, because of difficulties in separation of such

models to predict national- and state-level COVID-19 cases or deaths in the
future. These approaches assume parameters such as reproduction time, test
positivity rate, hospitalization rate, and social intervention effectiveness
(masking, distancing, and mobility) are constant. However, the one certainty
with the COVID-19 pandemic is that these parameters change over time, as well
as vary across counties and states. In fact, the rate of spread over region,
hospitalization rate, hospital length of stay and mortality rate, the
proportion of the population that is susceptible, test positivity rate, and
social behaviors can all change significantly over time. Thus, the
quantification of uncertainty becomes critical in making meaningful and
accurate forecasts of the future. Bayesian approaches are a natural way to
fully represent this uncertainty in mathematical models and have become
particularly popular in physics and engineering models. The explicit
integration time varying parameters and uncertainty quantification into a
hierarchical Bayesian forecast model differentiates the Mayo COVID-19 model
from other forecasting models. By accounting for all sources of uncertainty in
both parameter estimation as well as future trends with a Bayesian approach,
the Mayo COVID-19 model accurately forecasts future cases and hospitalizations,

accurate and a linchpin in Mayo Clinic's response to managing the COVID-19

optimization problems, whose solutions both damp undesirable frequency bands
and maintain stability of the system. These frameworks also allow us to weight
which frequency bands are the most important to damp. Second, we also propose a
fast new eigensolver for the structured quadratic eigenvalue problems that

exploits special properties of diagonal-plus-rank-one complex symmetric

The result is an eigensolver that is substantially faster than standard

where $n \geq p$, with an isolated critical point at the origin has a fibration
on the tube $f|\colon B_\epsilon^n \cap f^{-1}(S_\delta^{p-1}) \to
S_\delta^{p-1}$. Constructing a vector field such that, (1) it is transverse to
the spheres, and (2) it is transverse to the tubes, he ""inflates"" the tube to
the sphere, to get a fibration $\varphi\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1} \setminus
f^{-1}(0) \to S^{p-1}$, but the projection is not necessarily given by $f/
\|f\|$ as in the complex case.
  In the case $f$ has isolated critical value, in [9] it was proved that if the
fibres inside a small tube are transverse to the sphere $S_\epsilon$, then it
has a fibration on the tube. Also in [9], the concept of $d$-regularity was
defined, it turns out that $f$ is $d$-regular if and only if the map
$f/|f\|\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1} \setminus f^{-1}(0) \to S^{p-1}$ is a fibre
bundle equivalent to the one on the tube.
  In this article, we prove the corresponding facts in a more general setting:
if a locally surjective map $f$ has a linear discriminant $\Delta$ and a
fibration on the tube $f|\colon B_\epsilon^n \cap f^{-1}(S_\delta^{p-1}
\setminus \Delta) \to S_\delta^{p-1} \setminus \Delta$, then $f$ is $d$-regular
if and only if the map $f/ \|f\|\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1} \setminus
f^{-1}(\Delta) \to S^{p-1} \setminus \mathcal{A}$ (with $\mathcal{A}$ the
radial projection of $\Delta$ on $S^{p-1}$) is a fibre bundle equivalent to the
one on the tube. We do this by constructing a vector field $\tilde{w}$ which
inflates the tube to the sphere in a controlled way, it satisfies properties
analogous to the vector field constructed by Milnor in the complex setting:
besides satisfying (1) and (2) above, it also satisfies that $f/ \|f\|$ is
constant on the integral curves of $\tilde{w}$.

  In this work, we propose a novel carefully designed strategy for conditioning

and pitch accent, that help achieve more natural prosody. To this end, we use
of a classifier to learn these features in an end-to-end fashion, and apply
feature conditioning at three parts of Tacotron-2's Text-To-Mel Spectrogram:
pre-encoder, post-encoder, and intra-decoder. Further, we show that jointly
conditioned features at pre-encoder and intra-decoder stages result in
prosodically natural synthesized speech (vs. Tacotron-2), and allows the model
to produce speech with more accurate pitch accent and stress patterns.

between an ideal depolarizer and Fresnel matrix to a single depolarization
parameter. Rather than a 16-dimensional matrix norm, this parameter can form a
one-dimensional merit function. Then, instead of a full Mueller matrix
measurement, a scheme for pBSDF fitting to only two polarimetric measurements
is introduced. Depolarization can be mathematically expressed as the incoherent
addition of coherent states. This work shows that, for a Mueller matrix to be
in the span of a Fresnel matrix and an ideal depolarizer, the weights in the

in five different colored opaque plastics treated with nine different surface

(via SDTrimSP) and chemical (via empirical scalings) sputtering yield from SiC,
Si, and C. The Si content in the near-surface SiC layer is predicted to
increase during D plasma bombardment due to more efficient physical and
chemical sputtering of C relative to Si. Silicon erosion from SiC thereby
occurs primarily from sputtering of the enriched Si layer, rather than directly
from the SiC itself. SiC coatings on ATJ graphite, manufactured via chemical
vapor deposition, were exposed to repeated H-mode plasma discharges in the
DIII-D tokamak to test this model. The qualitative trends from analytic
modeling are reproduced by the experimental measurements, obtained via
spectroscopic inference using the S/XB method. Quantitatively the model
slightly under-predicts measured erosion rates, which is attributed to
uncertainties in the ion impact angle distribution, as well as the effect of
edge-localized modes. After exposure, minimal changes to the macroscopic or
microscopic surface morphology of the SiC coatings were observed. Compositional
analysis reveals Si enrichment of about 10%, in line with expectations from the
erosion model. Extrapolating to a DEMO-type device, an order-of-magnitude
decrease in impurity sourcing, and up to a factor of 2 decrease in impurity
radiation, is expected with SiC walls, relative to graphite, if low C plasma

environment and the interactions between sessile and planktonic phenotypes.
Bacterial biofilms typically develop in three distinct stages: attachment of
cells to a surface, growth of cells into colonies, and detachment of cells from
the colony into the surrounding medium. The attachment of planktonic cells
plays a prominent role in the initial phase of biofilm lifecycle as it
initiates the colony formation. During the maturation stage, biofilms harbor
numerous microenvironments which lead to metabolic heterogeneity. Such
microniches provide conditions suitable for the growth of new species, which
are present in the bulk liquid as planktonic cells and can penetrate the porous
biofilm matrix. We present a 1D continuum model on the interaction of sessile
and planktonic phenotypes in biofilm lifestyle which considers both the initial
attachment and colonization phenomena. The model is formulated as a
hyperbolic-elliptic free boundary value problem with vanishing initial value.
Hyperbolic equations reproduce the transport and growth of sessile species,
while elliptic equations model the diffusion and conversion of planktonic cells
and dissolved substrates. The attachment is modelled as a continuous,
deterministic process which depends on the concentrations of the attaching
species. The growth of new species is modelled through a reaction term in the
hyperbolic equations which depends on the concentration of planktonic species
within the biofilm. Existence and uniqueness of solutions are discussed and
proved for the attachment regime. Finally, some numerical examples show that
the proposed model correctly reproduces the growth of new species within the
biofilm and overcomes the ecological restrictions characterizing the
Wanner-Gujer type models.

derive the spectrum from five transits observed between 2016 and 2018, with
combined wavelength coverage between 5200 {\AA} - 9269 {\AA} in 200 {\AA} bins,
and with a median precision of 247 ppm per bin. HAT-P-23b's relatively high
surface gravity (g ~ 30 m/s^2), combined with updated stellar and planetary
parameters from Gaia DR2, gives a 5-scale-height signal of 384 ppm for a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Bayesian models favor a clear atmosphere for the
planet with the tentative presence of TiO, after simultaneously modeling
stellar contamination, using spots parameter constraints from photometry. If
confirmed, HAT-P-23b would be the first example of a high-gravity gas giant
with a clear atmosphere observed in transmission at optical/NIR wavelengths;
therefore, we recommend expanding observations to the UV and IR to confirm our
results and further characterize this planet. This result demonstrates how
combining transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with long-term
photometric monitoring of the host stars can help disentangle the exoplanet and
stellar activity signals.

  and Why It Matters",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Causal decision making (CDM) based on machine learning has become a routine
part of business. Businesses algorithmically target offers, incentives, and
recommendations to affect consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an
acceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE)
using machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective:
CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not
necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood
by practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is
different, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the
use of statistical models for CDM. We draw on prior research to highlight three
implications. (1) We should consider carefully the objective function of the
causal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate treatment
assignment rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding
does not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot is that for
supporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded
data as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical modeling may
not be necessary to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling
might do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least
one broad common CDM practice that seems wrong at first blush: the widespread
use of non-causal models for targeting interventions. The last two implications
are particularly important in practice, as acquiring (unconfounded) data on all
counterfactuals can be costly and often impracticable. These observations open
substantial research ground. We hope to facilitate research in this area by
pointing to related articles from multiple contributing fields, including two
dozen articles published the last three to four years.

of adversarial modeling: the nature of perturbation (e.g., pixel-level or face

architecture), goals (dodging or impersonation), and capability (tailored to

significantly more important than knowledge of the training data in black-box

vulnerable than closed-set systems under different types of attacks. The
efficacy of attacks for other threat model variations, however, appears highly
dependent on both the nature of perturbation and the neural network

usually more potent, even against adversarially trained models, and the ArcFace

team of pursuer robots operating in a two-dimensional polygonal space seek to
establish visibility of an arbitrarily fast evader. This is a computationally
challenging task for which the best known complete algorithm takes time doubly
exponential in the number of robots. However, recent advances that utilize
sampling-based methods have shown progress in generating feasible solutions. An
aspect of this problem that has yet to be explored concerns how to ensure that
the robots can recover from catastrophic failures which leave one or more
robots unexpectedly incapable of continuing to contribute to the pursuit of the

from catastrophic failures. When such failures occur, a replanning occurs,
leveraging both the information retained from the previous iteration and the
partial progress of the search completed before the failure to generate a new

lifecycle. It is a laborious human activity comprised of repeated decision
making: the human labeler decides which of several potential labels to apply to
each example. Prior work has shown that providing AI assistance can improve the
accuracy of binary decision tasks. However, the role of AI assistance in more
complex data-labeling scenarios with a larger set of labels has not yet been
explored. We designed an AI labeling assistant that uses a semi-supervised
learning algorithm to predict the most probable labels for each example. We
leverage these predictions to provide assistance in two ways: (i) providing a
label recommendation and (ii) reducing the labeler's decision space by focusing
their attention on only the most probable labels. We conducted a user study
(n=54) to evaluate an AI-assisted interface for data labeling in this context.
Our results highlight that the AI assistance improves both labeler accuracy and
speed, especially when the labeler finds the correct label in the reduced label
space. We discuss findings related to the presentation of AI assistance and
design implications for intelligent labeling interfaces.

lighten the job of the operator but in doing so, the accuracy should not be

angle dynamics and the longitudinal speed dynamics. In this study, a
proportional-integral-derivative controller is used to control the longitudinal
velocity of the tractor. For the control of the yaw angle dynamics, a
proportional-derivative controller works in parallel with a type-2 fuzzy neural
network. In such an arrangement, the former ensures the stability of the
related subsystem, while the latter learns the system dynamics and becomes the
leading controller. In this way, instead of modeling the interactions between
the subsystems prior to the design of model-based control, we develop a control
algorithm which learns the interactions online from the measured feedback
error. In addition to the control of the stated subsystems, a kinematic
controller is needed to correct the errors in both the x- and the y- axis for
the trajectory tracking problem of the tractor. To demonstrate the real-time
abilities of the proposed control scheme, an autonomous tractor is equipped
with the use of reasonably priced sensors and actuators. Experimental results

Might simpler approaches (e.g., retrieving train examples most similar to a

enormous clinical potential - most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to

Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep
learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level
suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a
clinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the
C-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the
time-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and

blocks of musical language. Using the Kunstderfuge corpus of classical music,
we analyze the historical evolution of the richness of harmonic vocabulary of
76 classical composers, covering almost 6 centuries. Such corpus comprises
about 9500 pieces, resulting in more than 5 million tokens of music codewords.
The fulfilment of Heaps' law for the relation between the size of the harmonic
vocabulary of a composer (in codeword types) and the total length of his works
(in codeword tokens), with an exponent around 0.35, allows us to define a
relative measure of vocabulary richness that has a transparent interpretation.
When coupled with the considered corpus, this measure allows us to quantify
harmony richness across centuries, unveiling a clear increasing linear trend.
In this way, we are able to rank the composers in terms of richness of
vocabulary, in the same way as for other related metrics, such as entropy. We
find that the latter is particularly highly correlated with our measure of
richness. Our approach is not specific for music and can be applied to other
systems built by tokens of different types, as for instance natural language.

populations, potentially altering the course of natural evolution. In this
paper, we investigate the population genetics of Escherichia coli proliferating
in microchannels with open ends. Our analysis is based on a population model in
which reproducing cells shift entire lanes of cells towards the open ends of
the channel. The model predicts that diversity is lost very rapidly within
lanes, but at a much slower pace among lanes. As a consequence, two mixed,
neutral E. coli strains competing in a microchannel must organize into an
ordered regular stripe pattern in the course of a few generations. These
predictions are in quantitative agreement with our experiments. We also
demonstrate that random mutations appearing in the middle of the channel are
much more likely to reach fixation than those occurring elsewhere. Our results
illustrate fundamental mechanisms of microbial evolution in spatially confined
space.

classification tasks. This often leads to trained models that are unusable for
any practical purpose. In this study we explore an unsupervised approach to
address these imbalances by leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained image
classification models to encoder-based Generative Adversarial Network (eGAN).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this problem
using GAN without needing to augment with synthesized fake images.
  In the proposed approach we use the discriminator network to output a
negative or positive score. We classify as minority, test samples with negative
scores and as majority those with positive scores. Our approach eliminates
epistemic uncertainty in model predictions, as the P(minority) + P(majority)
need not sum up to 1. The impact of transfer learning and combinations of
different pre-trained image classification models at the generator and
discriminator is also explored. Best result of 0.69 F1-score was obtained on
CIFAR-10 classification task with imbalance ratio of 1:2500.

To extract this extra information, accurate modelling of baryonic effects is
necessary. In this work, we adopt a baryonic correction model, which includes
gas both bound inside and ejected from dark matter (DM) haloes, a central
galaxy, and changes in the DM profile induced by baryons. We use this model to
incorporate baryons into a large suite of DM-only $N$-body simulations,
covering a grid of 75 cosmologies in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-\sigma_8$ parameter
space. We investigate how baryons affect Gaussian and non-Gaussian weak lensing
statistics and the cosmological parameter inferences from these statistics. Our
results show that marginalizing over baryonic parameters degrades the
constraints in $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-\sigma_8$ space by a factor of $2-4$ compared
to those with baryonic parameters fixed. We investigate the contribution of
each baryonic component to this degradation, and find that the distance to
which gas is ejected (from AGN feedback) has the largest impact due to its
degeneracy with cosmological parameters. External constraints on this

remote location on the basis of natural-language instructions and a set of
photo-realistic panoramas. Most existing methods take the words in the
instructions and the discrete views of each panorama as the minimal unit of
encoding. However, this requires a model to match different nouns (e.g., TV,
table) against the same input view feature. In this work, we propose an
object-informed sequential BERT to encode visual perceptions and linguistic

sequential BERT also enables the visual-textual clues to be interpreted in
light of the temporal context, which is crucial to multi-round VLN tasks.
Additionally, we enable the model to identify the relative direction (e.g.,
left/right/front/back) of each navigable location and the room type (e.g.,
bedroom, kitchen) of its current and final navigation goal, as such information
is widely mentioned in instructions implying the desired next and final

algorithms and variants of Householder orthogonalization with a non-standard
inner product. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that
our approach is numerically stable under mild assumptions.

calcium phosphate mineral pins to grow inside, which, on one hand, enhances
coating integration with membrane substrate, and on the other hand provides
diffusion channels for delivering drugs from the lower chamber of a

phosphate coating was first demonstrated as a drug screening device by using
alen-dronate, a widely used drug for osteoporosis. It was confirmed that the
delivery of alendronate significant-ly decreased both the number of
monocyte-differentiated osteoclasts and coating resorption. To demon-strate the
application in studying bone metastasis, we delivered PC3 prostate cancer

conservation, have fundamental importance for both classical and quantum
systems in physics. A widely used method to derive the conservation laws is
based on Noether's theorem. However, for classical relativistic particle-field
systems, this process is still impeded. Different from the quantum situation,
the obstruction emerged when we regard the particle's field as a classical
world line. The difficulties come from two aspects. One is the mass-shell
constraint and the other comes from the heterogeneous-manifolds that particles
and fields reside on. This study develops a general geometric (manifestly
covariant) field theory for classical relativistic particle-field systems. In
considering the mass-shell constraint, the Euler-Lagrange-Barut (ELB) equation
as a geometric version of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation is applied to
determine the world lines of the relativistic particles. As a differential
equation in the standard field theory, the infinitesimal criterion of the
symmetry condition is converted into an integro-differential equation. To
overcome the second difficulty, we develop a weak ELB equation on the 4D
space-time. The weak version of the ELB equation will play an essential role in
establishing the connections between symmetries and local conservation laws.
Using field theory together with the weak ELB equation developed here, the
conservation laws can be systematically derived from the symmetries that the
systems admit.

time distributions of electrons ionized by an XUV pulse alone and in the
presence of an infrared (IR) pulse. In the case of a single XUV pulse, although
the overall shape of the ionization time distribution resembles the
XUV-envelope, its detail shows dependence on the emission direction of the
electron and the carrier-envelope phase of the pulse, which mainly results from
the low-energy interference structure. It is further found that the electron
from the counter-rotating term plays an important role in the interference. In
the case of the two-color pulse, both the time-energy distributions and the
ionization time distributions change with varying IR field. Our analysis
demonstrates that the IR field not only modifies the final electron kinetic
energy but also changes the electron's emission time, which results from the
change of the electric field induced by the IR pulse. Moreover, the ionization
time distributions of the photoelectrons emitted from atoms with higher

In theory, the expectations about user involvement, such as the PO's, are quite
demanding in this Agile way of working. But what are the expectations seen in
practice, and are the expectations of user involvement aligned among the
development team and users? Any misalignment could contribute to conflict and
miscommunication among stakeholders that may result in ineffective user
involvement. Objective: Our aim is to compare and contrast the expectations of
two stakeholder groups (software development team, and software users) about
user involvement in order to understand the expectations and assess their
alignment. Method: We have conducted an exploratory case study of expectations
about user involvement in an Agile software development. Qualitative data was
collected through interviews to design a novel method for the assessing the
alignment of expectations about user involvement by applying Repertory Grids
(RG). Results: By aggregating the results from the interviews and RGs, varying
degrees of expectation alignments were observed between the development team

in practice using the proposed RG instrument and can reveal misalignment
between user roles and activities they participate in Agile software
development projects. Although we used RG instrument retrospectively in this

worldwide, a fervent debate is underway on whether it competes with or
complements public transport services. We use Uber trip data in six cities in
the United States and Europe to identify the most attractive public transport
alternative for each ride. We then address the following questions: (i) How
does ride-hailing travel time and cost compare to the fastest public transport
alternative? (ii) What proportion of ride-hailing trips that do not have a
viable public transport alternative? (iii) How does ride-hailing change overall
service accessibility? (iv) What is the relation between demand share and

  Our findings suggest that the dichotomy - competing with or complementing -

transport alternative, between 20% and 40% of them have no viable public
transport alternative. The increased service accessibility attributed to the
inclusion of ride-hailing is greater in our US cities than in their European
counterparts. Demand split is directly related to the relative competitiveness
of travel times i.e. when public transport travel times are competitive
ride-hailing demand share is low and vice-versa.

Notwithstanding, even though demand distribution patterns are expected to

this study we explore the shareability of various demand patterns. We devise a
set of experiments tailored to identify the most promising demand patterns for
introducing ride-pooling services by varying the number of centers, the
dispersion of destinations around each of these centers and the trip length
distribution. When matching trips into rides, we do not only ensure their
mutual compatibility in time and space but also that shared rides are only
composed by travellers who find the ride-pooling offer to be more attractive
than the private ride-hailing alternative given the trade-offs between travel
time, fare and discomfort. We measure the shareability potential using a series
of metrics related to the extent to which passenger demand can be assigned to
shared rides. Our findings indicate that introducing a ride-pooling service can
reduce vehicle-hours by 18-59% under a fixed demand level and depending on the
concentration of travel destinations around the center and the trip length
distribution. System efficiency correlates positively with the former and
negatively with the latter. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand
pattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of shared rides.

noise can induce various coherent behaviors. Self-induced stochastic resonance
(SISR) is a typical noise-induced phenomenon identified in such systems,
wherein noise acting on the fast subsystem causes stochastic resonancelike
boundary crossings. In this paper, we analyze the stochastic periodic orbits
caused by SISR in fast-slow systems. By introducing the notion of the mean
first passage velocity toward the boundary, a distance matching condition is
established, through which the critical transition position of boundary
crossing can be calculated. The theoretical stochastic periodic orbit can be
accordingly obtained via gluing the dynamics along the slow manifolds. It is
shown that the theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations for a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at GHz frequencies by the cosmological evolution
of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The mass function and Eddington ratio
distributions of SMBHs have been taken as starting point for this analysis. Our
approach is based on physical and phenomenological relations that allow to
statistically calculate the radio luminosity of AGN cores, corrected for
beaming effects, by linking it with the SMBH at their center, through the
Fundamental Plane of black hole activity. Moreover, radio luminosity from
extended jets and lobes is also computed through a power-law relationship that
reflects the expected correlation between the inner radio core and the extended
jets/lobes. Radio-loud AGN are further divided in two classes, characterized by
different accretion modes onto the central BH. If the Eddington ratio is <0.01
they are called low-kinetic (LK-mode) AGN; if >0.01, they are called
high-kinetic (HK-mode) AGN, being this critical value roughly corresponding to
the transition between radiatively inefficient and efficient accretion flows.
The few free parameters used in the present model are determined by fitting two
different types of observational data sets: local LFs of radio-loud AGN at 1.4
GHz and differential number counts of extragalactic radio sources at 1.4 and 5
GHz. Our present model fits well almost all published data on LFs of LK-mode
AGN and of the total AGN population up to redshifts z<=1.5 and, moreover, in
the full range of luminosities currently probed by data. On the other hand, it
tends to underestimate some recent measures of the LF of HK-mode AGN at low
redshifts, but only at low radio luminosities. The present model is also able
to provide a very good fit to almost all data on number counts of radio-loud
sources at 1.4 and 5 GHz. (abridged)

suitable tools to remove the experimental noise, and compute the statistics of
both Lagrangian velocity increments and wavelet coefficients of the Lagrangian

that the signature of noise is strongest on short trajectories, and results in
deviations from the regularity condition at small time scales. Considering only
long trajectories to get rid of such effect, we obtain scaling regimes that are
compatible with a reduced intermittency, meaning that long trajectories are
also associated with areas of larger regularity. The scaling laws, both in time

log-normal spectrum and an intermittency parameter that is three times smaller
than in the Eulerian case, where all the areas of the flow are taken into

the local effects and osseointegration of dental implants incorporating surface
micro/nanofeatures compared to implants of identical design without surface
treatment. Background: Known to impact bone cell behavior, surface chemical and
topography modifications target improved osseointegration and long-term success
of dental implants. Very few studies assess the performance of implants
presenting both micro-and nanofeatures in vivo on the animal models used in
preclinical studies for medical device certification. Methods: Implant surfaces
were characterized in terms of topography and surface chemical composition.
After 4 weeks and 13 weeks of implantation in sheep femoral condyles, forty
implants were evaluated through micro-computed tomography, histopathologic, and
histomorphometric analyses. Results: No local adverse effects were observed
around implants. Histomorphometric analyses showed significantly higher
bone-to-implant contact in the coronal region of the surface treated implant at
week 4 and week 13, respectively 79.3$\pm$11.2% and 86.4$\pm$6.7%, compared to
the untreated implant's 68.3$\pm$8.8% and 74.8$\pm$13%. Micro-computed
tomography analyses revealed that healing patterns differed between coronal and
apical regions, with higher coronal boneto-implant contact at week 13.
Histopathologic results showed, at week 13, bone healing around the surface
treated implant with undistinguishable defect margins while the untreated
implant still presented bone condensation and traces of the initial drill
defect. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the surface treated implant not
only shows no deleterious effects on local tissues but also promotes faster
bone healing around the implant. (word count: 241

defeating the purpose of CHCs as a representation that is language-independent

factor, no scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic
metapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the
positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We
incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by
assuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two
types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole
US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while
only three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction
(k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is
responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal
fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic
fatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would
have reduced by 68% on average. Our study shows that pandemic fatigue is the
major cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States. Reduced

tends to push local people to react to the outbreak faster and maintain

optical waveguides in guided-wave optics. The reason following the singlemode
condition is that higher-order modes might be excited and thus introduce some
undesired mode-mismatching loss as well as inter-mode crosstalk when light
propagates along an optical waveguide beyond the singlemode regime. As a
result, multimode photonic waveguides are usually not allowed. In this paper,
we propose the concept of silicon photonics beyond the singlemode regime,
developed with low-loss and low-crosstalk light propagation in multimode
photonic waveguides with broadened silicon cores. In particular, silicon
photonic waveguides with a broadened core region have shown an ultra-low-loss
of ~0.1 dB/cm for the fundamental mode even without any special fabrication
process. A micro-racetrack resonator fabricated with standard 220-nm-SOI
MPW-foundry processes shows a record intrinsic Q-factor as high as 1.02*107 for
the first time, corresponding to ultra-low waveguide propagation loss of only
0.065 dB/cm. A high-performance microwave photonic filter on silicon is then
realized with an ultra-narrow 3-dB bandwidth of 20.6 MHz as well as a tuning
range of ~20 GHz for the first time. An on-chip 100-cm-long delayline is also
demonstrated by using the present broadened SOI photonic waveguides with
compact Euler-curve bends, the measured propagation loss is ~0.14 dB/cm. The
proposed concept of silicon photonics beyond the singlemode regime helps solve
the issue of high propagation loss and also significantly reduces the random
phase errors of light due to the random variations of waveguide dimensions. In
particularity it enables silicon photonic devices with enhanced performances,
which paves the way for new-generation silicon photonics realizing the
large-scale photonic integration.

learnable image transformation method with a secret key. The proposed method
embeds a watermark pattern in a model by using learnable transformed images and
allows us to remotely verify the ownership of the model. As a result, it is
piracy-resistant, so the original watermark cannot be overwritten by a pirated
watermark, and adding a new watermark decreases the model accuracy unlike most
of the existing DNN watermarking methods. In addition, it does not require a
special pre-defined training set or trigger set. We empirically evaluated the
proposed method on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results show that it was resilient
against fine-tuning and pruning attacks while maintaining a high

investigations reveal that the system is a quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnet
with a peculiar coexistence of two different orbital-selective magnetic moments
at two crystallographically inequivalent cobalt atoms, Co1 and Co2. Namely, due
to different crystal-field splitting, the magnetic moment of Co1 atoms
predominantly derives from $d_{xz}$ orbital whereas of Co2 atoms from $d_{xy}$
orbital. Consequently, Co1 and Co2 atoms develop unequal net magnetic moments,
a feature that gives rise to a periodic, spatial modulation of magnetization
along crystallographic $c$-direction. The amplitude of the spatial modulation,
small at ambient pressure, drastically increases with applied pressure, until
Co2 atoms become nonmagnetic. With the help of a toy model mimicking found
orbital-selective ferromagnetic order, we demonstrate that the increasing

the blade loads on large-scale wind turbines. Since IPC usually requires high
pitch actuation, the safety constraints of the pitch actuator should be taken
into account when designing the controller. This paper introduces a constrained
Subspace Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC) approach, which considers the
limitation of blade pitch angle and pitch rate. To fulfill this goal, a model
predictive control scheme is implemented in the fully data-driven SPRC approach
to incorporate the physical limitations of the pitch actuator in the control
problem formulation. An optimal control law subjected to constraints is then
formulated so that future constraint violations are anticipated and prevented.
Case studies show that the developed constrained SPRC reduces the pitch
activities necessary to mitigate the blade loads when experiencing wind
turbulence and abrupt wind gusts. More importantly, the approach allows the
wind farm operator to design conservative bounds for the pitch actuator
constraints that satisfies safety limitations, design specifications and
physical restrictions. This will help to alleviate the cyclic fatigue loads on
the actuators, increase the structural reliability and extend the lifespan of
the pitch control system.

frequency interval, provided that the branches possess sufficiently different
group velocities. We first measure the microwave scattering matrix of a network
composed of distant antennas inductively coupled to the spin wave bath of the
magnetic film. After a mathematical transformation to the time-domain to get
the transmission impulse response, the different spin wave branches are viewed
as wavepackets that reach successively the receiving antenna after different
travel times. In analogy with time-of flight spectroscopy, the wavepackets are
then separated by time-gating. The time-gated responses are used to recalculate
the contribution of each spin wave branch to the frequency domain scattering
matrix. The dispersion relation of each branch stems from the absolute phase of
the time-gated transmission parameter. The spin wave wavevector can be
determined unambiguously if the results for several propagation distances are
combined, so as to get the dispersion relations.

going from $p=2$ to $p>2$, the main difficulty is to analyze the associated
linearized operator, whose coefficients are degenerate, unbounded, and depend
on the random input $A$ via the solution of a nonlinear equation. One of our
main achievements is the control of this intricate nonlinear dependence,

serious concerns about integrity due to model-reuse attacks and backdoor
attacks. In order to protect these open-source networks, many algorithms have

the contents of the network permanently and are not suitable for integrity
authentication. In this paper, we propose a reversible watermarking algorithm
for integrity authentication. Specifically, we present the reversible
watermarking problem of deep convolutional neural networks and utilize the
pruning theory of model compression technology to construct a host sequence
used for embedding watermarking information by histogram shift. As shown in the
experiments, the influence of embedding reversible watermarking on the
classification performance is less than 0.5% and the parameters of the model
can be fully recovered after extracting the watermarking. At the same time, the
integrity of the model can be verified by applying the reversible watermarking:
if the model is modified illegally, the authentication information generated by
original model will be absolutely different from the extracted watermarking

sharply constrained to eccentricities < 0.42 and inclinations < 21 deg, leading
to a paucity of VR scattered disk and distant MMR objects. We then interpret
these findings using N-body simulations accounting for Neptune's outward
migration into a massless particles disk, and find that these observations are
best reproduced with a LR-to-VR color transition line between 38 and 42 AU in
the primordial disk, separating the objects' formation locations. For an
initial surface density profile $\Sigma \propto 1/r^2$, a color transition
around 38 AU is needed to explain the high abundance of VR plutinos but creates
too many VR scattered disk objects, while a transition line around 42 AU seems
to better reproduces the scattered disk colors but creates virtually no VR
plutinos. Our simulations furthermore show that the rarity of VR particles at
high eccentricity is possibly due to the absence of sweeping higher order MMRs,
and secular resonances, beyond 42 AU. Inspecting individual populations, we
show that the majority of VR SDOs originate as objects trapped in Neptune's
second and third order MMRs. These then evolve due to diffusion, scattering,
Kozai-Lidov cycles, and secular resonances into their current orbits. Future
unbiased color surveys are crucial to better constrain the TNOs dynamical
origins.

constrain the inner slope of the dark matter (DM) halo density profile

($\beta_{z}, \beta_{r}$). For the first time, we show how jointly constraining
the mass distribution from the HI gas rotation curve and solving the Jeans'
equations with discrete stellar kinematics leads to a factor of $\sim2$
reduction in the uncertainties on $\gamma$. The mass-anisotropy degeneracy is
also partially broken, leading to reductions on uncertainty by $\sim 30\%$ on
$M_\mathrm{vir}$ (and $\sim 70\%$ at the half-light radius) and $\sim 25\%$ on
anisotropy. Our inferred value of $\gamma = 0.3 \pm 0.1$ is robust to the halo
geometry, and in excellent agreement with predictions of stellar feedback
driven DM core creation. The derived prolate geometry of the DM halo with
$q_\mathrm{DM} = 2 \pm 1$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM simulations of dwarf
galaxy halos. While self-interacting DM (SIDM) models with $\sigma/m_{X} \sim
0.6$ can reproduce this cored DM profile, the interaction events may
sphericalise the halo. The simultaneously cored and prolate DM halo may
therefore present a challenge for SIDM. Finally we find that the radial profile
of stellar anisotropy in WLM ($\beta_{r}$) follows a nearly identical trend of
increasing tangential anisotropy to the classical dSphs, Fornax and Sculptor.
Given WLM's orbital history, this result may call into question whether such
anisotropy is a consequence of tidal stripping in only one pericentric passage

evolutionary pathways for some dwarf galaxies.

called Direct Differentiable Augmentation Search (DDAS). It exploits
meta-learning with one-step gradient update and continuous relaxation to the
expected training loss for efficient search. Our DDAS can achieve efficient
augmentation search without relying on approximations such as Gumbel Softmax or
second order gradient approximation. To further reduce the adverse effect of
improper augmentations, we organize the search space into a two level
hierarchy, in which we first decide whether to apply augmentation, and then
determine the specific augmentation policy. On standard image classification
benchmarks, our DDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency
tradeoff while reducing the search cost dramatically, e.g. 0.15 GPU hours for
CIFAR-10. In addition, we also use DDAS to search augmentation for object
detection task and achieve comparable performance with AutoAugment, while being
1000x faster.

families of (quantified) non-classical logics featuring special unary
connectives, called recovery operators, that allow us to 'recover' the
properties of classical logic in a controlled fashion. These structures are
called topological Boolean algebras. They are Boolean algebras extended with
additional unary operations, called operators, such that they satisfy
particular conditions of a topological nature. In the present work we focus on
the paradigmatic case of negation. We show how these algebras are well-suited
to provide a semantics for some families of paraconsistent Logics of Formal
Inconsistency and paracomplete Logics of Formal Undeterminedness, which feature
recovery operators used to earmark propositions that behave 'classically' in
interaction with non-classical negations. In contrast to traditional semantical
investigations, carried out in natural language (extended with mathematical
shorthand), our formal meta-language is a system of higher-order logic (HOL)
for which automated reasoning tools exist. In our approach, topological Boolean
algebras become encoded as algebras of sets via their Stone-type
representation. We employ our higher-order meta-logic to define and interrelate
several transformations on unary set operations (operators), which naturally
give rise to a topological cube of opposition. Furthermore, our approach allows
for a uniform characterization of propositional, first-order and higher-order
quantification (also restricted to constant and varying domains). With this

a large stain. However, anomaly detection based on sparse coding, one of the
widely used anomaly detection methods, has an issue in dealing with anomalies
that are out of the patch size employed to sparsely represent images. A large
anomaly can be considered normal if seen in a small scale, but it is not easy
to determine a single scale (patch size) that works well for all images. Then,
we propose to incorporate multi-scale features to sparse coding and improve the
performance of anomaly detection. The proposed method, multi-layer feature
sparse coding (MLF-SC), employs a neural network for feature extraction, and
feature maps from intermediate layers of the network are given to sparse
coding, whereas the standard sparse-coding-based anomaly detection method
directly works on given images. We show that MLF-SC outperforms
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods including those employing deep

instrument inner and outer working angles and its minimum planet-to-star
constrast (IWA, OWA, $C_{min}$). We adopt for these technical specifications
three plausible configurations labeled as pessimistic, intermediate and
optimistic. Our key outputs for each exoplanet are its probability of being
Roman-accessible ($P_{access}$), the range of observable phase angles, the
evolution of its equilibrium temperature, the number of days per orbit that it
is accessible and its transit probability. In the optimistic scenario, we find
26 Roman-accessible exoplanets with $P_{access}$>25% and host stars brighter

Jupiter but also includes the super-Earths tau Cet e and f which orbit near

the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never
infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about
the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2)
the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness
requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of
edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation
capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the
supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion,
deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded
edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is
upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this
co-synthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis

approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location

  Sensing MR Angiography at 7 Tesla","Manuscript to be submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: 3D Time-of-flight (TOF) MR Angiography (MRA) can accurately
visualize the intracranial vasculature, but is limited by long acquisition
times. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction can be used to substantially
accelerate acquisitions. The quality of those reconstructions depends on the
undersampling patterns used in the acquisitions. In this work, optimized sets
of undersampling parameters using various acceleration factors for Cartesian 3D
TOF-MRA are established.
  Methods: Fully-sampled datasets acquired at 7T were retrospectively
undersampled using variable-density Poisson-disk sampling with various
autocalibration region sizes, polynomial orders, and acceleration factors. The
accuracy of reconstructions from the different undersampled datasets was
assessed using the vessel-masked structural similarity index. Results were
compared for four imaging volumes, acquired from two different subjects.
Optimized undersampling parameters were validated using additional
prospectively undersampled datasets.
  Results: For all acceleration factors, using a fully-sampled calibration area
of 12x12 k-space lines and a polynomial order of around 2-2.4 resulted in the
highest image quality. The importance of sampling parameter optimization was
found to increase for higher acceleration factors. The results were consistent
across resolutions and regions of interest with vessels of varying sizes and
tortuosity. In prospectively undersampled acquisitions, using optimized
undersampling parameters resulted in a 7.2% increase in the number of visible
small vessels at R = 7.2.
  Conclusion: The image quality of CS TOF-MRA can be improved by appropriate
choice of undersampling parameters. The optimized sets of parameters are
independent of the acceleration factor.

credible performance, but a major barrier to their use in practice is their
propensity to output summaries that are not faithful to the input and that
contain factual errors. While a number of annotated datasets and statistical
models for assessing factuality have been explored, there is no clear picture
of what errors are most important to target or where current techniques are
succeeding and failing. We explore both synthetic and human-labeled data
sources for training models to identify factual errors in summarization, and
study factuality at the word-, dependency-, and sentence-level. Our
observations are threefold. First, exhibited factual errors differ
significantly across datasets, and commonly-used training sets of simple
synthetic errors do not reflect errors made on abstractive datasets like XSum.
Second, human-labeled data with fine-grained annotations provides a more
effective training signal than sentence-level annotations or synthetic data.
Finally, we show that our best factuality detection model enables training of
more factual XSum summarization models by allowing us to identify non-factual

$L_*$. In particular, we surround the EUP black hole of mass $m$ with a static
spherical shell of dark matter described by the parameters mass $M$, inner
radius $r_s$, and thickness $\Delta r_s$. In this study, we find that there is
no deviation in the event horizon, which readily implies that the black hole
temperature due to the Hawking radiation is independent of any dark matter
concentration. In addition, we show some effects of the EUP parameter on the
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius of time-like particles, photon
sphere, shadow radius, and weak deflection angle. It is found that time-like
orbits are affected by deviation of low values of mass $M$. A greater dark
matter density is needed to have remarkable effects on the null orbits. Using
the analytic expression for the shadow radius and the approximation $\Delta
r_s>>r_s$, it is revealed that $L_*$ should not be lower than $2m$. To broaden
the scope of this study, we also calculate the analytic expression for the weak
deflection angle using the Ishihara et al. method \cite{Ishihara_2016}. As a
result, we show that $\Delta r_s$ is improved by a factor of $(1+4\alpha

biases and using data at the largest radii to determine the background sky
level, we reconstruct the surface brightness profile out to a radius of 2 Mpc.
This radius is the largest to which the intracluster light (ICL) has been
measured for an individual cluster. Within this radius, we measure a total
luminosity of 1.5e13 Lsun for the brightest cluster galaxy plus ICL light. From
the profile and its logarithmic slope, we identify the transition from the
brightest cluster galaxy to ICL at r~70 kpc. Remarkably, we also detect an
inflection in the profile centered in the 1.2-1.7 Mpc (0.37-0.52 r200m) radial
bin, a signature of an infall caustic in the stellar distribution. Based upon
the shape and strength of the feature, we interpret it as potentially being at
the splashback radius, although the radius is smaller than theoretical

detection in the ICL and the first detection of the splashback radius for an

successful precursor for the amplitude of the subsequent cycle. Numerical
simulations of the surface flux transport (SFT) model are widely used to
effectively predict the dipole moment at cycle minimum. Recently an algebraic
method has been proposed to quickly predict the contribution of an active
region (AR) to the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum instead of SFT
simulations. However, the method assumes a bipolar magnetic region (BMR)
configuration of ARs. Actually most ARs are asymmetric in configuration of
opposite polarities, or have more complex configurations. Such ARs evolve
significantly differently from that of BMR approximations. We propose a
generalized algebraic method to describe the axial dipole contribution of an AR
with an arbitrary configuration, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to the
BMR-based method. We employ mathematical deductions to obtain the generalized
method. We compare the results of the generalized method with SFT simulations
of observed ARs, artificially created BMRs, and ARs with more complex
configurations. We also compare the results with that from the BMR-based
method. The generalized method is equivalent to the SFT model, and precisely
predicts the ARs' contributions to the dipole moment. The method has a much
higher computational efficiency than SFT simulations. Although the BMR-based
method has similar computational efficiency as the generalized method, it is
only accurate for symmetric bipolar ARs. The BMR-based method systematically
overestimates the dipole contributions of asymmetric bipolar ARs, and randomly
miscalculate the contributions of more complex ARs. The generalized method
provides a quick and precise quantification of an AR's contribution to the
solar cycle evolution, which paves the way for the application into the
physics-based solar cycle prediction.

originating from two adjacent coronal bright points (CBP1 and CBP2) in a polar
coronal hole, using soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet observations
respectively taken by the Hinode and the Solar Dynamic Observatory. In the
event, a collimated jet with obvious westward lateral motion firstly launched
from CBP1, during which a small bright point appeared around CBP1's east end,
and magnetic flux cancellation was observed within the eruption source region.
Based on these characteristics, we interpret the observed jet as a standard jet
associated with photosperic magnetic flux cancellation. About 15 minutes later,
the westward moving jet spire interacted with CBP2 and resulted in magnetic
reconnection between them, which caused the formation of the second jet above
CBP2 and the appearance of a bright loop system in-between the two CBPs. In
addition, we observed the writhing, kinking, and violent eruption of a small
kink structure close to CBP2's west end but inside the jet-base, which made the
second jet brighter and broader than the first one. These features suggest that
the second jet should be a blowout jet triggered by the magnetic reconnection
between CBP2 and the spire of the first jet. We conclude that the two
successive jets were physically connected to each other rather than a temporal
coincidence, and this observation also suggests that coronal jets can be
triggered by external eruptions or disturbances, besides internal magnetic
activities or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities.

The main difficulties lie in the large domain differences and unbalanced
disparity distribution across a variety of datasets, which greatly limit the
real-world applicability of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper,
we propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the
robustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost
volume representation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing
multiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive field, we
can extract robust structural representations for initial disparity estimation.
Second, we propose a cascade cost volume representation to alleviate the
unbalanced disparity distribution. Specifically, we employ a variance-based
uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search
space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of
unlikely correspondences. By iteratively narrowing down the disparity search
space and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is
gradually refined in a coarse-to-fine manner. When trained on the same training
images and evaluated on KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury datasets with the fixed
model parameters and hyperparameters, our proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art overall performance and obtains the 1st place on the stereo

threshold for electron-positron pair production, 511 keV. This allows us to
calculate the rate of the electron-positron pair production and put a lower
limit on the size of the source from pair equilibrium. At the fitted Thomson
optical depth of the Comptonizing plasma, the limit is about 4 gravitational
radii. If we adopt the sizes estimated by us from the reflection spectroscopy
of $>$20 gravitational radii, the fractional pair abundance becomes much less

entity recognition (NER). Most existing works assume clean data annotation, yet
a fundamental challenge in real-world scenarios is the large amount of noise
from a variety of sources (e.g., pseudo, weak, or distant annotations). This
work studies NER under a noisy labeled setting with calibrated confidence
estimation. Based on empirical observations of different training dynamics of
noisy and clean labels, we propose strategies for estimating confidence scores
based on local and global independence assumptions. We partially marginalize
out labels of low confidence with a CRF model. We further propose a calibration
method for confidence scores based on the structure of entity labels. We
integrate our approach into a self-training framework for boosting performance.
Experiments in general noisy settings with four languages and distantly labeled
settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code can be found at

reliable alternative for centralized state estimation (CSE) in power system.
Especially, taking into account the future power grid, so called smart grid in

energy sources with huge indeterminacy are applied more than before. Combining
the mentioned features and complexity of the power network, there is a high
probability that CSE face problems such as communication bottleneck or

of DSE problem, considering the most important factors such as iteration

designed by minimizing the matching error to the beampattern template, and the

taken into account with particular focus on the role of the supersymmetry
breaking (SUSY) scale and the cosmological constraints associated with the
gravitino. The scalar potential of the model is considered in the context of
no-scale supergravity consisting of the F-part constructed from the K\""ahler
function, the D-terms and soft SUSY contributions. We investigate several
limiting cases and by varying the SUSY scale from a few TeV up to intermediate
energies, for a spectral index around $n_s\sim 0.9655$ and reheating
temperature $T_r\le 10^{9}$ GeV we find that the value of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio ranges from $r\approx 10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$. Furthermore, it is shown
that for certain regions of the parameter space the gravitino can live
sufficiently long and as such is a potential candidate for a dark matter
component. In general, the inflationary scenario is naturally implemented and
it is consistent with non-thermal leptogenesis whereas the dominant decay
channel of the inflaton yields right-handed neutrinos. Other aspects of
cosmology and particle physics phenomenology are briefly discussed. Finally, we
investigate the case where the inflaton is initially relaxed in a false minimum

be effective for video object segmentation. They are mostly based on
pixel-level matching, both spatially and temporally. The main shortcoming of
memory-based approaches is that they do not take into account the sequential
order among frames and do not exploit object-level knowledge from the target.
To address this limitation, we propose to Learn position and target Consistency
framework for Memory-based video object segmentation, termed as LCM. It applies
the memory mechanism to retrieve pixels globally, and meanwhile learns position
consistency for more reliable segmentation. The learned location response
promotes a better discrimination between target and distractors. Besides, LCM
introduces an object-level relationship from the target to maintain target
consistency, making LCM more robust to error drifting. Experiments show that
our LCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and Youtube-VOS

minimizes the average detection delay (ADD) subject to a false alarm

sensors may be mobile. In the rare event regime, the optimal procedure
converges to a more practical threshold test on the posterior probability of
the change point. A convenient recursive computation of this posterior
probability is derived by using the propagation characteristics of the spatial
event. The ADD of the posterior probability threshold test is analyzed in the
asymptotic regime, and specific analysis is conducted in the setting of
detecting random Gaussian signals affected by path loss. Then, we show how the
proposed procedure is easy to extend for detecting multiple propagating spatial
events in parallel in a multiple hypothesis testing setting. A method that
provides strict false discovery rate (FDR) control is proposed. In the
simulation section, it is demonstrated that exploiting the spatial properties

This problem is typically addressed using centralized estimators, which can
negatively impact the flexibility and robustness of the overall system. To
overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel distributed learning framework
for the exemplary task of cooperative manipulation using Bayesian principles.
Using only local state information each agent obtains an estimate of the object
dynamics and grasp kinematics. These local estimates are combined using dynamic
average consensus. Due to the strong probabilistic foundation of the method,
each estimate of the object dynamics and grasp kinematics is accompanied by a
measure of uncertainty, which allows to guarantee a bounded prediction error
with high probability. Moreover, the Bayesian principles directly allow
iterative learning with constant complexity, such that the proposed learning
method can be used online in real-time applications. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated in a simulated cooperative manipulation task.

solution is approximated by a Pth order polynomial of which all the DOFs are
stored and updated separately. The cell average is updated by a classical
finite volume scheme which is constructed based on space-time staggered meshes
such that the fluxes are continuous across the interfaces of the adjacent
control volumes and, therefore, the local Riemann problem is bypassed. The kth
order spatial derivatives are updated by a central difference of (k-1)th order

calculated by the Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. By doing so, the schemes are
able to achieve arbitrarily uniform spacetime high order on a super-compact

without spurious oscillations, a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)

fundamental component of quantum technologies and leads to coherent
correlations within the global quantum process. However correlation structures
in quantum channels are less studied than those in quantum states. Motivated by
recent techniques in randomized benchmarking, we develop a range of results for
efficient estimation of correlations within a bipartite quantum channel. We
introduce sub-unitarity measures that are invariant under local changes of
basis, generalize the unitarity of a channel, and allow for the analysis of
coherent information exchange within channels. Using these, we show that
unitarity is monogamous, and provide a novel information-disturbance relation.
We then define a notion of correlated unitarity that quantifies the
correlations within a given channel. Crucially, we show that this measure is
strictly bounded on the set of separable channels and therefore provides a
witness of non-separability. Finally, we describe how such measures for
effective noise channels can be efficiently estimated within different
randomized benchmarking protocols. We find that the correlated unitarity can be
estimated in a SPAM-robust manner for any separable quantum channel, and show
that a benchmarking/tomography protocol with mid-circuit resets can reliably
witness non-separability for sufficiently small reset errors. The tools we
develop provide information beyond that obtained via simultaneous randomized
benchmarking and so could find application in the analysis of cross-talk and
coherent errors in quantum devices.

Specifically, we find that dynamical quantum phase transition relies on the

impact on the Loschmidt overlap. These massless excitations are a subset of all
gapless modes, which leads to quantum phase transitions. The underlying two
dimensional model reveals gapless modes, which do not couple to the dynamical

periodic nonanalytic signatures on the Loschmidt amplitude. The topological

computer vision and biometrics due to its applications in law enforcement and
entertainment. Recent advances in deep generative networks have made it
possible to synthesize high-quality face images from visual attributes.
However, existing methods are specifically designed for generating unimodal
images (i.e visible faces) from attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel
generative adversarial network that simultaneously synthesizes identity
preserving multimodal face images (i.e. visible, sketch, thermal, etc.) from
visual attributes without requiring paired data in different domains for
training the network. We introduce a novel generator with multimodal
stretch-out modules to simultaneously synthesize multimodal face images.
Additionally, multimodal stretch-in modules are introduced in the discriminator
which discriminates between real and fake images. Extensive experiments and
comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods are performed to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed attribute-based multimodal synthesis method.

the absence of proper elastic-relaxation time scale. In this work, we propose a
minimal classical-density-functional-theory-based model for crystal growth in
supercooled liquid. Growth front nucleation (GFN) and various nonequilibrium
patterns, including the faceting growth, spherulite, dendrite and the
columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) among others, are grasped at atom scale.
It is amazing that, except for undercooling and seed spacing, seed distribution
is key factor that determines the CET. Overall, two-stage growth process, i.e.,
the diffusion-controlled growth and the GFN-dominated growth, are identified.
But, compared with the second stage, the first stage becomes too short to be
noticed under the high undercooling. The distinct feature for the second stage
is the dramatic increments of dislocations, which explains the amorphous
nucleation precursor in the supercooled liquid. Transition time between the two
stages at different undercooling are investigated. Crystal growth of BCC

astronomical frequencies observed here were combined with laboratory

beam-averaged column densities of (2.7 +/- 0.5)e12 cm-2 for CHD2CCH and (2.2

CH3CCH/CHD2CCH = 34 +/- 10 and CH3CCH/CH2DCCD = 42 +/- 13. The doubly
deuterated isotopologues of methyl acetylene are only a few times less abundant
than the singly deuterated ones, concretely around 2.4 times less abundant than
CH3CCD. The abundances of the different deuterated isotopologues with respect
to CH3CCH are reasonably accounted for by a gas-phase chemical model in which
deuteration occurs from the precursor ions C3H6D+ and C3H5D+, when the
ortho-to-para ratio of molecular hydrogen is sufficiently low. This points to
gas-phase chemical reactions, rather than grain-surface processes, as
responsible for the formation and deuterium fractionation of CH3CCH in L483.

synchronisation by utilising Liouville space perturbation theory. We begin by
clarifying the role of centers, symmetries and oscillating coherences in the
context of quantum synchronisation. We then analyse the eigenspectrum of the
Liouville superoperator generating the dynamics of the quantum system and
determine the conditions under which synchronisation arises. We apply our
framework to derive a powerful relationship between energy conservation,
degeneracies and synchronisation in quantum systems. Finally, we demonstrate
our approach by analysing two mutually coupled thermal machines and the close
relationship between synchronisation and thermodynamic quantities.

supercomputing time. The resources required scale with the problem size,
internal workings of the code and the number of iterations to convergence, the
latter being controlled by what is called mixing. This note describes a new
approach to handling trust-regions within these and other fixed-point problems.
Rather than adjusting the trust-region based upon improvement, the prior steps
are used to estimate what the parameters and trust-regions should be,
effectively estimating the optimal Polyak step from the prior history. Detailed
results are shown for eight structures using both the Good and Bad Multisecant
versions as well as Anderson and a hybrid approach, all with the same
predictive method. Additional comparisons are made for thirty-six cases with
fixed algorithm Greed The predictive method works well independent of which
method is used for the candidate step, and is capable of adapting to different
problem types particularly when coupled with the hybrid approach. It would be
premature to claim that it is the best possible approach, but the results
suggest that it may be.

straightforward: we follow a language's description to localize the target
object based on its relative spatial relation to `Landmarks', which is
characterized by some spatial positional words and some descriptive words about
the object. The core of our LBYL-Net is a landmark feature convolution module
that transmits the visual features with the guidance of linguistic description
along with different directions. Consequently, such a module encodes the
relative spatial positional relations between the current object and its
context. Then we combine the contextual information from the landmark feature
convolution module with the target's visual features for grounding. To make
this landmark feature convolution light-weight, we introduce a dynamic
programming algorithm (termed dynamic max pooling) with low complexity to
extract the landmark feature. Thanks to the landmark feature convolution
module, we mimic the human behavior of `Look Before You Leap' to design an
LBYL-Net, which takes full consideration of contextual information. Extensive
experiments show our method's effectiveness in four grounding datasets.
Specifically, our LBYL-Net outperforms all state-of-the-art two-stage and
one-stage methods on ReferitGame. On RefCOCO and RefCOCO+, Our LBYL-Net also
achieves comparable results or even better results than existing one-stage

the center of the Coma cluster with probability distributions for their orbital
parameters obtained using an N-body simulation to connect their orbital and
star formation histories. We find that all 11 galaxies likely quenched near
their first pericentric approach. Higher stellar mass galaxies
($\log(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot)>10$) had formed a higher fraction of their
stellar mass (more than $\sim90\%$) than their lower mass counterparts ($\sim
80$-$90\%$) by the time they fell into the cluster (when they cross
$2.5r_\mathrm{vir}$). We find that the expected infall occurred around
$z\sim0.6$, followed by the first pericentric passage $\sim4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$
later. Galaxies in our sample formed a significant fraction of their stellar
mass, up to $15\%$, between infall and first pericenter, and had assembled more
than $\sim98\%$ of their cumulative stellar mass by first pericenter. Unlike
previous low-redshift studies that suggest that star formation continues until
about first apocenter or later, the high percentage of stellar mass already
formed by first pericenter in our sample galaxies points to star formation
ceasing within a gigayear after the first pericentric passage. We consider the
possible physical mechanisms driving quenching and find that our results
resemble the situation in clusters at $z\sim1$, where active stripping of gas
(ram-pressure or tidally driven) seems to be required to quench satellites by
their first pericentric passage. However, a larger sample will be required to
conclusively account for the unknown fraction of preprocessed satellites in the

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2101.12054",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stagnation detection has been proposed as a mechanism for randomized search
heuristics to escape from local optima by automatically increasing the size of
the neighborhood to find the so-called gap size, i.e., the distance to the next
improvement. Its usefulness has mostly been considered in simple multimodal
landscapes with few local optima that could be crossed one after another. In
multimodal landscapes with a more complex location of optima of similar gap
size, stagnation detection suffers from the fact that the neighborhood size is
frequently reset to $1$ without using gap sizes that were promising in the
past.
  In this paper, we investigate a new mechanism called radius memory which can
be added to stagnation detection to control the search radius more carefully by
giving preference to values that were successful in the past. We implement this
idea in an algorithm called SD-RLS$^{\text{m}}$ and show compared to previous
variants of stagnation detection that it yields speed-ups for linear functions
under uniform constraints and the minimum spanning tree problem. Moreover, its
running time does not significantly deteriorate on unimodal functions and a
generalization of the Jump benchmark. Finally, we present experimental results
carried out to study SD-RLS$^{\text{m}}$ and compare it with other algorithms.

subproblem if the current iterate is in the interior of the $\ell_p$ ball, and
it solves a gradient projection subproblem with a weighted $\ell_1$-ball
constraint if the current iterate is on the boundary of the $\ell_p$ ball.

gradient only by two function evaluations, have attracted much attention
recently because of its broad applications in machine learning community. The
two function evaluations are normally generated with random perturbations from
standard Gaussian distribution. To speed up ZO methods, many methods, such as
variance reduced stochastic ZO gradients and learning an adaptive Gaussian
distribution, have recently been proposed to reduce the variances of ZO
gradients. However, it is still an open problem whether there is a space to
further improve the convergence of ZO methods. To explore this problem, in this
paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning based ZO algorithm (ZO-RL) with
learning the sampling policy for generating the perturbations in ZO
optimization instead of using random sampling. To find the optimal policy, an
actor-critic RL algorithm called deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with
two neural network function approximators is adopted. The learned sampling
policy guides the perturbed points in the parameter space to estimate a more
accurate ZO gradient. To the best of our knowledge, our ZO-RL is the first
algorithm to learn the sampling policy using reinforcement learning for ZO
optimization which is parallel to the existing methods. Especially, our ZO-RL
can be combined with existing ZO algorithms that could further accelerate the
algorithms. Experimental results for different ZO optimization problems show
that our ZO-RL algorithm can effectively reduce the variances of ZO gradient by
learning a sampling policy, and converge faster than existing ZO algorithms in
different scenarios.

  Search with a Lightweight Index",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the wide applications in recommendation systems, multi-class label
prediction and deep learning, the Maximum Inner Product (MIP) search problem
has received extensive attention in recent years. Faced with large-scale
datasets containing high-dimensional feature vectors, the state-of-the-art
LSH-based methods usually require a large number of hash tables or long hash
codes to ensure the searching quality, which takes up lots of index space and
causes excessive disk page accesses. In this paper, we relax the guarantee of
accuracy for efficiency and propose an efficient method for c-Approximate
Maximum Inner Product (c-AMIP) search with a lightweight iDistance index. We
project high-dimensional points to low-dimensional ones via 2-stable random
projections and derive probability-guaranteed searching conditions, by which
the c-AMIP results can be guaranteed in accuracy with arbitrary probabilities.
To further improve the efficiency, we propose Quick-Probe for quickly
determining the searching bound satisfying the derived condition in advance,
avoiding the inefficient incremental searching process. Extensive experimental
evaluations on four real datasets demonstrate that our method requires less
pre-processing cost including index size and pre-processing time. In addition,
compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark methods, it provides superior
results on searching quality in terms of overall ratio and recall, and
efficiency in terms of page access and running time.

process with deletions and mergers, which is inspired by the 4-cycle structure
of both the hypercube $Q_d$ and the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for large $d$.
Individuals have Poisson offspring distribution with mean $1+p$ and certain
deletions and mergers occur with probability $q$; these parameters correspond
to the mean number of edges discovered from a given vertex in an exploration of
a percolation cluster and to the probability that a non-backtracking path of
length four closes a cycle, respectively.
  We prove survival and extinction under certain conditions on $p$ and $q$ that
heuristically match the known expansions of the critical probabilities for bond
percolation on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and the hypercube $Q_d$. These
expansions have been rigorously established by Hara and Slade in 1995, and van
der Hofstad and Slade in 2006, respectively. We stress that our method does not
constitute a branching process proof for the percolation threshold.
  The analysis of the graph process survival is considerably more challenging
than for branching processes in discrete time, due to the interdependence
between the descendants of different individuals in the same generation. In
fact, it is left open whether the survival probability of $\mathcal{G}(p,q)$ is
monotone in $p$ or $q$; we discuss this and some other open problems regarding
the new graph process.

active regions. We find that the fractional contribution of active regions to
the solar wind varies between 30% to 80% at any one time during solar maximum

number. While active regions are typically confined to latitudes
$\pm$30$^{\circ}$ in the corona, the solar wind they produce can reach
latitudes up to $\pm$60$^{\circ}$. Their fractional contribution to the solar
wind also correlates with coronal mass ejection rate, and is highly variable,
changing by $\pm$20% on monthly timescales within individual solar maxima. We
speculate that these variations could be driven by coronal mass ejections

systems with local, finite-range, translation-invariant interactions at any
temperature. In this setting, we show that Gibbs states satisfy uniform
exponential decay of correlations and, moreover, the mutual information between
two regions decays exponentially with their distance, irrespective of the
temperature. In order to prove the latter, we show that exponential decay of
correlations of the infinite-chain thermal states, exponential uniform
clustering and exponential decay of the mutual information are equivalent for
1D quantum spin systems with local, finite-range interactions at any
temperature. In particular, Araki's seminal results yields that the three
conditions hold in the translation-invariant case. The methods we use are based
on the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy and on techniques developed by

just a single camera, which cannot be straightforwardly generalized to multiple

equipped to millions of cars with varying camera geometries. Even within a
single car, intrinsics vary due to manufacturing tolerances. Deep learning
models are sensitive to these changes, and it is practically infeasible to
train and test on each camera variant. As a result, we present novel
camera-geometry adaptive multi-scale convolutions which utilize the camera
parameters as a conditional input, enabling the model to generalize to
previously unseen fisheye cameras. Additionally, we improve the distance
estimation by pairwise and patchwise vector-based self-attention encoder
networks. We evaluate our approach on the Fisheye WoodScape surround-view

Here we present ameasurement of deltams using B0s2DsPi decays produced in

excitement of, university research-level work. Initiatives where students
engage in independent research linked to cutting-edge physics within their
school over several months might help mitigate this, potentially facilitating
the uptake of science in higher education. However, how such initiatives are
best supported remains unclear and understudied. This paper evaluates a
provision framework, `Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), using
survey data from participating 14-18 year-old students and their teachers to
understand their experience of the programme. The results show that PRiSE
appears to provide much more positive experiences than typical university
outreach initiatives due to the nature of the opportunities afforded over
several months, which schools would not be able to provide without external
input. The intensive support offered is deemed necessary, with all elements
appearing equally important. Based on additional feedback from independent
researchers and engagement professionals, we also suggest the framework could
be adopted at other institutions and applied to their own areas of scientific
research, something which has already started to occur.

the band structure and the weight distributions of eigenstates, we demonstrate
that the attachment of a metallic thin-film on the 3DTI can shift the
topologically non-trivial state into the metal layers due to the hybridization
of bands around the original Dirac point. By introducing the magnetic exchange
interaction in the thin-film layers, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity
and magnetic anisotropy of the bilayer structure to suggest the appearance of
wider gap realizing QAH effect than usual materials, such as magnetically doped
thin-films of 3DTI and 3DTI/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures. Our
results indicate that the 3DTI/thin-film FMM bilayer structure may implement
the QAH effect even at room temperature, which will pave a way to the
experimental realization of other exotic topological quantum phenomena.

actor-critic deep RL algorithm. BAC mathematically formulates the behavior of
the policy through autoencoders by providing an accurate estimation of how
frequently each state-action pair was visited while taking into consideration
state dynamics that play a crucial role in determining the trajectories
produced by the policy. The agent is encouraged to change its behavior
consistently towards less-visited state-action pairs while attaining good
performance by maximizing the expected discounted sum of rewards, resulting in
an efficient exploration of the environment and good exploitation of all high
reward regions. One prominent aspect of our approach is that it is applicable
to both stochastic and deterministic actors in contrast to maximum entropy deep
reinforcement learning algorithms. Results show considerably better
performances of BAC when compared to several cutting-edge learning algorithms.

Taking an uniform approach, this paper gives an operadic study of compatibility
conditions for nonsymmetric operads with unary and binary operations, and
homogeneous quadratic and cubic relations. This generalizes the previous
studies for binary quadratic operads. We consider three compatibility
conditions, namely the linear compatibility, matching compatibility and total
compatibility, with increasingly strict restraints among the replicated copies.
The linear compatibility is in Koszul dual to the total compatibility, while
the matching compatibility is self dual. Further, each compatibility can be
expressed in terms of either one or both of the two Manin square products.

enhancement ($\Delta \alpha$) due to spin pumping in NiFe/Pt bilayers. The
bilayers, which have negligible interfacial spin memory loss, are studied as a
function of the Pt layer thickness ($t_{\text{Pt}}$) and temperature (100-293
K). Within the framework of diffusive spin pumping theory, we demonstrate that
Dyakonov-Perel (DP) or Elliot-Yaffet (EY) spin relaxation mechanisms acting
alone are incompatible with our observations. In contrast, if we consider that
the relation between spin relaxation characteristic time ($\tau_{\text{s}}$)
and momentum relaxation characteristic time ($\tau_{\text{p}}$) is determined
by a superposition of DP and EY mechanisms, the qualitative and quantitative
agreement with experimental results is excellent. Remarkably, we found that
$\tau_{\text{p}}$ must be determined by the out-of-plane electrical resistivity
($\rho$) of the Pt film and hence its spin diffusion length
($\lambda_{\text{Pt}}$) is independent of $t_{\text{Pt}}$. Our work settles the
controversy regarding the $t_{\text{Pt}}$ dependence of $\lambda_{\text{Pt}}$
by demonstrating its fundamental connection with $\rho$ considered along the

strongly influenced by the coupled-channel dynamics. Due to the small mass
difference of the $\rm N \Lambda$ and $\rm N \Sigma$ systems, the sizeable
coupling strength of the $\rm N \Sigma\leftrightarrow N \Lambda$ processes
constitutes a crucial element in the determination of the N$\Lambda$
interaction. In this letter we present the most precise measurements on the
interaction of p$\Lambda$ pairs, from zero relative momentum up to the opening
of the $\rm N \Sigma$ channel. The correlation function in the relative
momentum space for
$\mathrm{p}\Lambda\oplus\overline{\mathrm{p}}\overline{\Lambda}$ pairs measured
in high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}~=~13$ TeV at the LHC
is reported. The opening of the inelastic N$\Sigma$ channels is visible in the
extracted correlation function as a cusp-like structure occurring at relative
momentum $k^{*}$ = 289 MeV/$c$. This represents the first direct experimental
observation of the $\rm N \Sigma\rightarrow N \Lambda$ coupled channel in the
p$\Lambda$ system. The correlation function is compared with recent chiral
effective field theory calculations, based on different strengths of the $\rm N
\Sigma\leftrightarrow N \Lambda$ transition potential. A weaker coupling, as
possibly supported by the present measurement, would require a more repulsive
three-body NN$\Lambda$ interaction for a proper description of the $\Lambda$
in-medium properties, which has implications on the nuclear equation of state
and for the presence of hyperons inside neutron stars.

between interlocutors engaged in a collaborative learning task, where they are
not only evaluated on how well they performed, but also on how much they
learnt. The main contribution of this work is to propose new automatic measures
to study alignment; focusing on verbal (lexical) alignment, and behavioral
alignment (when an instruction given by one was followed with concrete actions
by another). A second contribution of our work is to study how spontaneous
speech phenomena are used in the process of alignment. Lastly, we make public
the dataset to study alignment in educational dialogues. Our results show that
all teams verbally and behaviourally align to some degree regardless of their
performance and learning, and our measures capture that teams that did not
succeed in the task were simply slower to collaborate. Thus we find that teams
that performed better, were faster to align. Furthermore, our methodology
captures a productive period that includes the time where the interlocutors
came up with their best solutions. We also find that well-performing teams
verbalise the marker ""oh"" more when they are behaviourally aligned, compared to
other times in the dialogue; showing that this marker is an important cue in
alignment. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the role of
""oh"" as an information management marker in a behavioral context (i.e. in
connection to actions taken in a physical environment), compared to only a
verbal one. Our measures contribute to the research in the field of educational

highly thinned ice core sections, where the identification of paleoclimate
signals is particularly challenging. For this, state-of-the-art imaging by
laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has the
potential to be revolutionary due to its combination of micron-scale 2D
chemical information with visual features. However, the quantitative study of
record preservation in chemical images raises new questions that call for the
expertise of the computer vision community. To illustrate this new
inter-disciplinary frontier, we describe a selected set of key questions. One
critical task is to assess the paleoclimate significance of single line
profiles along the main core axis, which we show is a scale-dependent problem
for which advanced image analysis methods are critical. Another important issue
is the evaluation of post-depositional layer changes, for which the chemical
images provide rich information. Accordingly, the time is ripe to begin an
intensified exchange among the two scientific communities of computer vision
and ice core science. The collaborative building of a new framework for
investigating high-resolution chemical images with automated image analysis
techniques will also benefit the already wide-spread application of LA-ICP-MS
chemical imaging in the geosciences.

their 6-month-long projects, the 14-18 year-old school students report having

corroborated by teachers. There is evidence that the projects helped increase
students' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations (generally

involvement. Longitudinal evaluation 3 years later has revealed that these
projects have been lasting experiences for students which they have benefited
and drawn upon in their subsequent university education. Data on students'
destinations suggests that their involvement in research projects has made them
more likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be
expected. Cases of co-created novel physics research resulting from PRiSE also
has seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on the student co-authors but
participating students from other schools also. Teachers have also been
positively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced
their own knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous

`research in schools' initiatives may have a role to play in aiding the
increased uptake and diversity of physics and/or STEM in higher education as
well as meaningfully enhancing the STEM environment within schools.

the kilonova/macronova ejecta may explain the X-ray excess but exceeds the
radio observations if the spectrum is the same. We propose a fallback accretion
model that a part of ejecta from the neutron star merger falls back and forms a
disk around the central compact object. In the super-Eddington accretion phase,
the X-ray luminosity stays near the Eddington limit of a few solar masses and
the radio is weak, as observed. This will be followed by a power law decay. The
duration of the constant luminosity phase conveys the initial fallback
timescale $t_0$ in the past. The current multi-year duration requires $t_0 >
3$--$30$ sec, suggesting that the disk wind rather than the dynamical ejecta
falls back after the jet launch. Future observations in the next decades will
probe the timescale of $t_0 \sim 10$--$10^4$ sec, around the time of extended
emission in short gamma-ray bursts. The fallback accretion has not been halted
by the $r$-process heating, implying that fission is weak on the year scale. We
predict that the X-ray counterpart will disappear in a few decades due to the
$r$-process halting or the depletion of fallback matter.

Although several existing works have attempted to shift tagging systems from

when and why it works, which limits the applicability of the larger-context

can work.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough comparative study on four proposed

index of TS$_{\rm var}=1002$. A quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a
periodicity of $\sim$460 days is detected in the global 95\% false-alarm level.
These $\gamma$-ray emission features are similar to that of blazars. Its
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) can be attributed to the
radiations of the relativistic electrons accelerated in the core region and the
extended region. The SED modeling shows that the $\gamma$-rays are from the
core region, which has a Doppler boosting factor of $\delta\sim10.8$ and
relativistically moves with a small viewing angle, being similar to blazar
jets. On the base of the analysis results, we propose that the episodic
activity of the central engine in CTD 135 results in a blazar-like jet and the
bubble-like lobes as the Fermi bubbles in the Galaxy. The strong $\gamma$-ray
emission with obvious variability is from the jet radiations and the symmetric
radio structure is attributed to the bubbles. The jet radiation power and disk
luminosity in units of Eddington luminosity of CTD 135 follow the same relation

(PRiSE), which features projects in space science, astronomy, and particle
physics. Comparing the schools involved with PRiSE to those of other similar
schemes and UK national statistics, we find that PRiSE has engaged a much more
diverse set of schools with significantly more disadvantaged groups than is
typical. While drop-off occurs within the protracted programme, we find no
evidence of systematic biases present. The majority of schools that complete
projects return for multiple years of the programme, with this repeated buy-in
from schools again being unpatterned by typical societal inequalities.
Therefore, schools' ability to succeed at independent research projects appears
independent of background within the PRiSE framework. Qualitative feedback from
teachers show that the diversity and equity of the programme, which they
attribute to the level of support offered through PRiSE's framework, is valued
and they have highlighted further ways of making the projects potentially even
more accessible. Researcher-involvement, uncommon in many other programmes,

measuring their luminosity distance and redshift. Such standard sirens are also
useful to probe theories beyond general relativity with a modified
gravitational-wave propagation. Many of previous studies on the latter assume
multi-messenger observations so that the luminosity distance can be measured
with gravitational waves while the redshift is obtained by identifying sources'
host galaxies from electromagnetic counterparts. Given that gravitational-wave
events of binary neutron star coalescences with associated electromagnetic
counterpart detections are expected to be rather rare, it is important to
examine the possibility of using standard sirens with gravitational-wave
observations alone to probe gravity. In this paper, we achieve this by
extracting the redshift from the tidal measurement of binary neutron stars that
was originally proposed within the context of gravitational-wave cosmology
(another approach is to correlate ""dark sirens"" with galaxy catalogs that we do
not consider here). We consider not only observations with ground-based
detectors (e.g. Einstein Telescope) but also multi-band observations between
ground-based and space-based (e.g. DECIGO) interferometers. We find that such
multi-band observations with the tidal information can constrain a parametric
non-Einsteinian deviation in the luminosity distance (due to the modified
friction in the gravitational wave evolution) more stringently than the case
with electromagnetic counterparts by a factor of a few. We also map the
above-projected constraints on the parametric deviation to those on specific
theories and phenomenological models beyond general relativity to put the

increases, suggesting vacuum fluctuations may not always be subdominant to
thermal fluctuations and opening up the possibility of experimental observation

inadequate resources in computing limit their capabilities. Specifically, with
the emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs), not only is the demand for the
computing power of IoT devices increasing but also privacy concerns are pushing
computations towards the edge. To overcome inadequate resources, several
studies have proposed the distribution of work among IoT devices. These
promising methods harvest the aggregated computing power of the idle IoT
devices in an environment. However, since such a distributed system strongly
relies on each device, unstable latencies, and intermittent failures, the

test examples. In practice, this leads to poor robust generalization, i.e.,
adversarial robustness does not generalize well to new examples. In this paper,
we study the relationship between robust generalization and flatness of the
robust loss landscape in weight space, i.e., whether robust loss changes
significantly when perturbing weights. To this end, we propose average- and
worst-case metrics to measure flatness in the robust loss landscape and show a
correlation between good robust generalization and flatness. For example,
throughout training, flatness reduces significantly during overfitting such
that early stopping effectively finds flatter minima in the robust loss
landscape. Similarly, AT variants achieving higher adversarial robustness also
correspond to flatter minima. This holds for many popular choices, e.g.,
AT-AWP, TRADES, MART, AT with self-supervision or additional unlabeled
examples, as well as simple regularization techniques, e.g., AutoAugment,
weight decay or label noise. For fair comparison across these approaches, our
flatness measures are specifically designed to be scale-invariant and we
conduct extensive experiments to validate our findings.

  Communications",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main challenge in visible light communications (VLC) is the low
modulation bandwidth of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This forms a barrier
towards achieving high data rates. Moreover, the implementation of high order
modulation schemes is restricted by the requirements of intensity modulation
(IM) and direct detection (DD), which demand the use of real unipolar signals.
In this paper, we propose a novel amplitude, phase and quadrant (APQ)
modulation scheme that fits into the IM/DD restrictions in VLC systems. The
proposed scheme decomposes the complex and bipolar symbols of high order
modulations into three different symbols that carry the amplitude, phase and
quadrant information of the intended symbol. The constructed symbols are
assigned different power levels and are transmitted simultaneously, i.e.
exploiting the entire bandwidth and time resources. The receiving terminal
performs successive interference cancellation to extract and decode the three
different symbols, and then uses them to decide the intended complex bipolar
symbol. We evaluate the performance of the proposed APQ scheme in terms of
symbol-error-rate and achievable system throughput for different setup
scenarios. The obtained results are compared with generalized spatial shift
keying (GSSK). The presented results show that APQ offers a higher reliability
compared to GSSK across the simulation area, while providing lower hardware
complexity.

structure-property relations in the material by analyzing the effect of
microstructure parameters on the macroscopic properties. In computational
homogenization, the microstructure is thus explicitly modeled inside the
macrostructure, leading to a coupled two-scale formulation. Unfortunately, the
high computational costs of such multiscale simulations often render the
solution of design, optimization, or inverse problems infeasible. To address
this issue, we propose in this work a non-intrusive reduced basis method to
construct inexpensive surrogates for parametrized microscale problems; the
method is specifically well-suited for multiscale simulations since the coupled
simulation is decoupled into two independent problems: (1) solving the
microscopic problem for different (loading or material) parameters and learning
a surrogate model from the data; and (2) solving the macroscopic problem with
the learned material model. The proposed method has three key features. First,
the microscopic stress field can be fully recovered. Second, the method is able
to accurately predict the stress field for a wide range of material parameters;
furthermore, the derivatives of the effective stress with respect to the
material parameters are available and can be readily utilized in solving
optimization problems. Finally, it is more data efficient, i.e. requiring less
training data, as compared to directly performing a regression on the effective
stress. For the microstructures in the two test problems considered, the mean
approximation error of the effective stress is as low as 0.1% despite using a
relatively small training dataset. Embedded into the macroscopic problem, the
reduced order model leads to an online speed up of approximately three orders
of magnitude while maintaining a high accuracy as compared to the FE$^2$
solver.

from the loop using a ghost mode in which the human-in-the-loop is coached to

undetected area between EEG electrodes, an improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation
algorithm is developed for EEG channels information completion, which allows us
to extract a wider range of adjacent space features. Then, motivated by the
spatial symmetric mechanism of human brain, we fold the input EEG channels data
with five different symmetrical strategies, which enable the proposed network
to extract the information of space features of EEG signals more effectively.
Finally, a 3DCNN-based spatial, temporal extraction, and a multi-voting

With this network, the spatial features of different symmetric folding signals
can be extracted simultaneously, which greatly improves the robustness and

  Fluorescence Sensor and Machine Learning Techniques",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the highest quality of olive oil and is
characterized by highly beneficial nutritional properties. The large increase
in both consumption and fraud, for example through adulteration, creates new
challenges and an increasing demand for developing new quality assessment
methodologies that are easier and cheaper to perform. As of today, the
determination of olive oil quality is performed by producers through chemical
analysis and organoleptic evaluation. The chemical analysis requires the
advanced equipment and chemical knowledge of certified laboratories, and has
therefore a limited accessibility. In this work a minimalist, portable and
low-cost sensor is presented, which can perform olive oil quality assessment
using fluorescence spectroscopy. The potential of the proposed technology is
explored by analyzing several olive oils of different quality levels, EVOO,
virgin olive oil (VOO), and lampante olive oil (LOO). The spectral data were
analyzed using a large number of machine learning methods, including artificial
neural networks. The analysis performed in this work demonstrates the
possibility of performing classification of olive oil in the three mentioned
classes with an accuracy of 100$\%$. These results confirm that this minimalist
low-cost sensor has the potential of substituting expensive and complex
chemical analysis.

neutron-gamma discrimination problem. But most of them are limited to off-line
calculation due to the computation amount and FPGA performance. In order to
realize real time discriminating neutron and gamma, a new algorithm based on
the traditional pulse shape discrimination methods was proposed in this paper.
The new algorithm takes into account the physical properties of the pulse
signal, which greatly reduces the computation and dead time without losing the
precision, and can work on FPGA directly. It has a good performance in the
actual experiment based on CLLB scintillation detector.

graph $\Theta$ over an algebraically closed field $K$. All irreducible
representations, and the corresponding maximal ideals of $K[HK_{\Theta}]$, are
characterized in case this algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. The latter
condition corresponds to a simple condition that can be expressed in terms of
the graph $\Theta$. The result shows a surprising similarity to the classical
results on representations of finite semigroups; namely every representation
either comes form an idempotent in the Hecke-Kiselman monoid $HK_{\Theta}$ (and
hence it is $1$-dimensional), or it comes from certain semigroup of matrix type
(which is an order in a completely $0$-simple semigroup over an infinite cyclic
group). The case when $\Theta$ is an oriented cycle plays a crucial role; the
prime spectrum of $K[HK_{\Theta}]$ is completely characterized in this case.

mathematical results concerning the probability distribution of image pixel

smallest bounded region within an image is estimated for segmenting an image,
from which, the equilibrium distribution of intensities can be recovered. From
the estimated bounded regions, properties of the sub-optimal and equilibrium
distributions of intensities are derived, which leads to an image compression
methodology whereby only slightly more than half of all pixels are required for
a worst-case reconstruction of the original image. A custom deep belief network

wave propagation in a fiber-reinforced hyperelastic tube that is subjected to
an axial pre-stretch and internal pressure. We obtain the dispersion relations
for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric waves and discuss their accuracy by
comparing them with the exact dispersion relations. The bending effect is also
examined by comparing the dispersion curves based on the present theory and
membrane theory. It is shown that the present theory is more accurate than the
membrane theory in studying wave propagation and the bending effect plays an
important role in some wave modes for relatively large wavenumbers. The effects
of the pressure, axial pre-stretch and fiber angle on the dispersion relations
are displayed. These results provide the necessary validation for using the
refined dynamic finite-strain shell theory and wave propagation to determine
arterial properties.

with the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models such as BERT, have
revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), pushing the
state of the art for a number of NLP tasks. A rich family of variations of
these models has been proposed, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, and XLNet, but
fundamentally, they all remain limited in their ability to model certain kinds
of information, and they cannot cope with certain information sources, which
was easy for pre-existing models. Thus, here we aim to shed light on some
important theoretical limitations of pre-trained BERT-style models that are
inherent in the general Transformer architecture. First, we demonstrate in
practice on two general types of tasks -- segmentation and segment labeling --
and on four datasets that these limitations are indeed harmful and that
addressing them, even in some very simple and naive ways, can yield sizable
improvements over vanilla RoBERTa and XLNet models. Then, we offer a more
general discussion on desiderata for future additions to the Transformer
architecture that would increase its expressiveness, which we hope could help
in the design of the next generation of deep NLP architectures.

attention of both researchers and network providers. NFV decouples network
functions from specialized hardware devices and virtualizes these network
functions as software instances called virtualized network functions (VNFs).
NFV leads to various benefits, including more flexibility, high resource
utilization, and easy upgrades and maintenances. Despite recent works in this
field, placement and chaining of VNFs need more attention. More specifically,
some of the existing works have considered only the placement of VNFs and
ignored the chaining part. So, they have not provided an integrated view of
host or bandwidth resources and propagation delay of paths. In this paper, we
solve the VNF placement and chaining problem as an optimization problem based
on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our goal is to minimize the
required number of used servers, the average propagation delay of paths, and
the average utilization of links while meeting network demands and constraints.
Based on the obtained results, the algorithm proposed in this study can find
feasible and high-quality solutions.
