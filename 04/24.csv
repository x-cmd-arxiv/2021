speech naturalness. It can be used to evaluate Text-To-Speech or Voice
Conversion systems and works language independently. The model is trained
end-to-end and based on a CNN-LSTM network that previously showed to give good
results for speech quality estimation. We trained and tested the model on 16
different datasets, such as from the Blizzard Challenge and the Voice
Conversion Challenge. Further, we show that the reliability of deep
learning-based naturalness prediction can be improved by transfer learning from
speech quality prediction models that are trained on objective POLQA scores.
The proposed model is made publicly available and can, for example, be used to
evaluate different TTS system configurations.

severe damage to the people and the society. In the context of this severe
situation, an effective drug discovery method to generate potential drugs is
extremely meaningful. In this paper, we provide a methodology of discovering
potential drugs for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Corona-Virus 2 (commonly known as SARS-CoV-2). We proposed a new model called
Genetic Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoder (GCGVAE) to solve this
problem. We trained our model based on the data of various viruses' protein
structure, including that of the SARS, HIV, Hep3, and MERS, and used it to
generate possible drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Several optimization algorithms,
including valency masking and genetic algorithm, are deployed to fine tune our
model. According to the simulation, our generated molecules have great
effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. We quantitatively calculated the scores
of our generated molecules and compared it with the scores of existing drugs,
and the result shows our generated molecules scores much better than those
existing drugs. Moreover, our model can be also applied to generate effective
drugs for treating other viruses given their protein structure, which could be
used to generate drugs for future viruses.

stochastic systems. Specifically, we formulate and solve the ideal
full-information and output-feedback problems, obtaining perfect, but
non-causal, asymptotic regulation. A characterisation of the problem
solvability is deduced. We point out that the ideal problems cannot be solved
in practice because they unrealistically require that the Brownian motion
affecting the system is available for feedback. Drawing from the ideal
solution, we formulate and solve approximate versions of the full-information
and output-feedback problems, which do not yield perfect asymptotic tracking
but can be solved in a realistic scenario. These solutions rely on two key
ideas: first we introduce a discrete-time a-posteriori estimator of the
variations of the Brownian motion obtained causally by sampling the system
state or output; second we introduce a hybrid state observer and a hybrid
regulator scheme which employ the estimated Brownian variations. The
approximate solution tends to the ideal as the sampling period tends to zero.
The proposed theory is validated by the regulation of a circuit subject to
electromagnetic noise.

  Misperception (Technical Report)","40 pages, 6 figures, under review Journal of AI Research (JAIR)",,,,"cs.GT cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strategic deception is an act of manipulating the opponent's perception to
gain strategic advantages. In this paper, we study synthesis of deceptive
winning strategies in two-player turn-based zero-sum reachability games on
graphs with one-sided incomplete information of action sets. In particular, we
consider the class of games in which Player 1 (P1) starts with a non-empty set
of private actions, which she may 'reveal' to Player 2 (P2) during the course
of the game. P2 is equipped with an inference mechanism using which he updates
his perception of P1's action set whenever a new action is revealed. Under this
information structure, the objective of P1 is to reach a set of goal states in
the game graph while that of P2 is to prevent it. We address the question: how
can P1 leverage her information advantages to deceive P2 into choosing actions
that in turn benefit P1? To this end, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to
capture the reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Analyzing the
game qualitatively, we design algorithms to synthesize deceptive sure and
almost-sure winning regions, and establish two key results: (1) under
sure-winning condition, deceptive winning strategy is equivalent to the
non-deceptive winning strategy - i.e. use of deception has no advantages, (2)
under almost-sure winning condition, the deceptive winning strategy could be
more powerful than the non-deceptive strategy. We illustrate our algorithms
using a capture-the-flag game, and demonstrate the use of proposed approach to
a larger class of games with temporal logic objectives.

performance. Future systems will be increasingly heterogeneous, integrating
multiple specialized and programmable accelerators, each with different memory
demands. Traditionally, communication between accelerators has been
inefficient, typically orchestrated through explicit DMA transfers between
different address spaces. More recently, industry has proposed unified coherent
memory which enables implicit data movement and more data reuse, but often
these interfaces limit the coherence flexibility available to heterogeneous
systems. This paper demonstrates the benefits of fine-grained coherence
specialization for heterogeneous systems. We propose an architecture that
enables low-complexity independent specialization of each individual coherence
request in heterogeneous workloads by building upon a simple and flexible
baseline coherence interface, Spandex. We then describe how to optimize
individual memory requests to improve cache reuse and performance-critical
memory latency in emerging heterogeneous workloads. Collectively, our
techniques enable significant gains, reducing execution time by up to 61% or
network traffic by up to 99% while adding minimal complexity to the Spandex
protocol.

PSR J0837$-$2454. Based on its high latitude ($b = 9.8^{\circ}$) and dispersion
measure (DM $ = 143$~pc~cm$^{-3}$), the pulsar appears to be at a $z$-height of
$>$1 kpc above the Galactic plane, but near the edge of our Galaxy. This is
many times the observed scale height of the canonical pulsar population, which
suggests this pulsar may have been born far out of the plane. If accurate, the
young age and high $z$-height imply that this is the first pulsar known to be
born from a runaway O/B star. In follow-up imaging with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA), we detect the pulsar with a flux density $S_{1400} = 0.18
\pm 0.05$ mJy. We do not detect an obvious supernova remnant around the pulsar
in our ATCA data, but we detect a co-located, low-surface-brightness region of
$\sim$1.5$^\circ$ extent in archival Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA
Survey data. We also detect co-located H$\alpha$ emission from the Southern
H$\alpha$ Sky Survey Atlas. Distance estimates based on these two detections
come out to $\sim$0.9 kpc and $\sim$0.2 kpc respectively, both of which are
much smaller than the distance predicted by the NE2001 model ($6.3$ kpc) and
YMW model ($>25$ kpc) and place the pulsar much closer to the plane of the
Galaxy. If the pulsar/remnant association holds, this result also highlights
the inherent difficulty in the classification of transients as ""Galactic""

  Modulation with Noise",,,"10.1109/JLT.2021.3061938",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase noise can be modulated onto the output of a laser with an electro-optic
phase modulator (EOM) to create a highly incoherent broadened source with low
intensity noise. This technique leaves a small but finite fraction of the
coherent carrier power that can be highly detrimental in applications requiring
incoherent light. This paper shows that the carrier suppression in a laser
broadened by this technique can be calculated for an arbitrary noise
probability density function. The carrier suppression can be varied
experimentally by adjusting the noise voltage standard deviation $Gv_{\sigma}$
and saturation voltage $V_{sat}$ of the amplifier that amplifies the noise
source that drives the EOM. Simulations show that suppressions better than -30
dB are attainable for reasonable tolerances in $Gv_{\sigma}$, for example an
EOM with a $V_{\pi}$ of 4.7 V, a $V_{sat}$ of 6.3V, and $Gv_{\sigma}/V_{\pi} =
0.73\pm0.03$. Even greater tolerances can be achieved with a higher $V_{sat}$
(21 V), lower $V_\pi$ (3.5 V), and $Gv_{\sigma}/V_{\pi} \approx 3.2 \pm 2.3$.
This model aids in selecting these parameters such that the carrier suppression
is resilient to fluctuations in these voltages due to temperature variations
and aging of the components. The model predictions are validated by testing a
fiber optic gyroscope interrogated with a broadened laser for various
$Gv_{\sigma}$ and $V_{sat}$ and inferring the carrier suppression from its
measured noise. A -44-dB carrier suppression was observed for a nonlinear
amplifier with $Gv_{\sigma}$ = 3.43 V, $V_{sat}$ = 6.3 V, and an EOM with
$V_{\pi}$ = 4.7 V, in agreement with predictions.

a nonlinear optimization problem to compute these plans and is able to run in
real-time by assuming contact locations are given a-priori, either by a user or

more general demand to provide personalized services to groups instead of
individuals. In order to capture group-level preference features from
individuals, existing methods were mostly established via aggregation and face
two aspects of challenges: secure data management workflow is absent, and
implicit preference feedbacks is ignored. To tackle current difficulties, this
paper proposes secure Artificial Intelligence of Things for implicit Group
Recommendations (SAIoT-GR). As for hardware module, a secure IoT structure is
developed as the bottom support platform. As for software module, collaborative
Bayesian network model and non-cooperative game are can be introduced as
algorithms. Such a secure AIoT architecture is able to maximize the advantages
of the two modules. In addition, a large number of experiments are carried out
to evaluate the performance of the SAIoT-GR in terms of efficiency and

brand, and other aspects of the marketing mix is fundamental to a wide swath of
marketing problems, including targeting and pricing. Companies that operate
across many product categories have a unique opportunity, insofar as they can
use purchasing data from one category to augment their insights in another.
Such cross-category insights are especially crucial in situations where
purchasing data may be rich in one category, and scarce in another. An
important aspect of how consumers behave across categories is dynamics:
preferences are not stable over time, and changes in individual-level
preference parameters in one category may be indicative of changes in other
categories, especially if those changes are driven by external factors. Yet,
despite the rich history of modeling cross-category preferences, the marketing
literature lacks a framework that flexibly accounts for \textit{correlated
dynamics}, or the cross-category interlinkages of individual-level sensitivity
dynamics. In this work, we propose such a framework, leveraging
individual-level, latent, multi-output Gaussian processes to build a
nonparametric Bayesian choice model that allows information sharing of
preference parameters across customers, time, and categories. We apply our
model to grocery purchase data, and show that our model detects interesting
dynamics of customers' price sensitivities across multiple categories.
Managerially, we show that capturing correlated dynamics yields substantial
predictive gains, relative to benchmarks. Moreover, we find that capturing
correlated dynamics can have implications for understanding changes in
consumers preferences over time, and developing targeted marketing strategies
based on those dynamics.

Ru, all with and without an additional PTFE protection layer using a novel
method and under the same set of experimental conditions. Our results
demonstrate that doping Pd with Au results in significantly faster
hydrogenation kinetics, with response times up to five times shorter than Pd
through enhanced diffusion and a reduction of the activation energy. The
kinetics of non-Pd based materials turns out to be significantly slower and
mainly limited by the diffusion through the capping layer itself. Surprisingly,
the additional PTFE layer was only found to improve the kinetics of Pd-based
capping materials and has no significant effect on the kinetics of Pt, Ni and

Skeletor uses strong priors learn from on 25 million frames to correct skeleton

exceeds the plasma frequency exhibit novel transport properties that are not
well understood. As a representative example, we compute the friction force
acting on a massive test charge moving through a strongly coupled and strongly
magnetized one-component plasma using a generalized Boltzmann kinetic theory.
Recent works studying the weakly coupled regime have shown that strong
magnetization leads to a transverse component of the friction force that is
perpendicular to both the Lorentz force and velocity of the test charge; in
addition to the stopping power component aligned antiparallel to the velocity.
Recent molecular dynamics simulations have also shown that strong Coulomb
coupling in addition to strong magnetization gives rise to a third component of
the friction force in the direction of the Lorentz force. Here, we show that
the generalized Boltzmann kinetic theory captures these effects, and generally
agrees well with the molecular dynamics simulations over a broad range of
Coulomb coupling and magnetization strength regimes. The theory is also used to
show that a ""gyro"" component of the friction in the direction of the Lorentz
force arises due to asymmetries associated with gyromotion during short-range
collisions. Computing the average motion of the test charge through the
background plasma, the transverse force is found to strongly influence the
trajectory by changing the gyroradius and the gyro friction force is found to
slightly change the gyrofrequency of the test charge resulting in a phase
shift.

symmetry, carries a flavor charge and plays the role of a flavon field. The
$U(1)_F$ flavor symmetry is then broken by a VEV of the flavon field, which
leads to a small parameter and generates the mass hierarchy between the top and
bottom quarks. A light flavon below the TeV scale can be naturally introduced,
which provides a fully testable model for the origin of flavor hierarchy. A
light flavon also leads to substantial flavor changing neutral currents, which
are strongly constrained by the flavor precision tests. The direct search of
additional scalar bosons can also be conducted in HL-LHC and future hadron
colliders.

anonymization methods lower the performance of trained face detectors, faces
anonymized using GANs cause far smaller performance degradation than
conventional methods. As the most important finding, the best-performing GAN,
DeepPrivacy, removes identifiable faces for a face detector trained on
anonymized data, resulting in a modest decrease from 91.0 to 88.3 mAP. In the

  Newton's Second Law","20 pages",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A longstanding problem in mathematical physics is the rigorous derivation of
the incompressible Euler equation from Newtonian mechanics. Recently, Han-Kwan
and Iacobelli arXiv:2006.14924 showed that in the monokinetic regime, one can
directly obtain the Euler equation from a system of $N$ particles interacting
in $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geq 2$, via Newton's second law through a supercritical
mean-field limit. Namely, the coupling constant $\lambda$ in front of the pair
potential, which is Coulombic, scales like $N^{-\theta}$ for some $\theta \in
(0,1)$, in contrast to the usual mean-field scaling $\lambda\sim N^{-1}$.
Assuming $\theta\in (1-\frac{2}{d(d+1)},1)$, they showed that the empirical
measure of the system is effectively described by the solution to the Euler
equation as $N\rightarrow\infty$. Han-Kwan and Iacobelli asked if their range
for $\theta$ was optimal. We answer this question in the negative by showing
the validity of the incompressible Euler equation in the limit
$N\rightarrow\infty$ for $\theta \in (1-\frac{2}{d},1)$. For reasons of
scaling, this range appears optimal in all dimensions. Our proof is based on
Serfaty's modulated-energy method, but compared to that of Han-Kwan and
Iacobelli, crucially uses an improved ""renormalized commutator"" estimate to
obtain the larger range for $\theta$.

the main mechanism that connects these two effects is still not completely
understood. The aim of this work is to identify, from the terms of the
electromotive force, the dominant physical process responsible for enhancing
the reconnection rate in turbulent plasmas. We employ full three-dimensional
numerical simulations of turbulence driven by stochastic reconnection and
estimate the production and dissipation of turbulent energy and cross-helicity,
the amount of produced residual helicity, and determine the relation between
these quantities and the reconnection rate. We observe the development of the
electromotive force in the studied models with plasma-$\beta = 0.1 - 2$ and the
Lundquist number $S=10^{-5}-10^{-4}$. The turbulent energy and residual
helicity develop in the large-scale current sheet, with the latter decreasing
the effects of turbulent magnetic diffusion. We demonstrate that the stochastic
reconnection, apart from the turbulence, can produce a significant amount of
cross-helicity as well. The cross-helicity to turbulent energy ratio, however,
has no correlation with the reconnection rate. We show that its sufficiently
large value is not a necessary condition for fast reconnection to occur. The
results suggest that cross-helicity is inherent to turbulent fields, but the
reconnection rate enhancement is possibly caused by the effects of magnetic
turbulent diffusion and controlled by the residual helicity.

problem has been investigated extensively in the literature, a comprehensive
understanding of the impact of the different one- and, in particular,
two-particle local correlation functions of DMFT on the AF transition
temperature is still missing. We have, hence, performed a fluctuation analysis
of $T_N$ with respect to different local bosonic fluctuations (charge, spin,
particle-particle) contained in the two-particle vertex of DMFT. Our results
indicate that, beyond weak coupling, the screening of the DMFT vertex by local
fluctuations leads to an enhancement of $T_N$ with respect to a random phase
approximation (RPA) like calculation where this vertex is replaced by the bare
interaction. The overall suppression of $T_N$ in DMFT with respect to RPA is
then solely due to the incoherence introduced by the DMFT self-energy in the
one-particle Green's functions. This illustrates the Janus-faced role of the
local moment formation in the DMFT solution of the Hubbard model, which leads

considered in arrangements, as in the Nelson-Oppen method.
  Reasoning about arrangements of variables is exponential in the worst case,
so reducing the number of variables that are considered has the potential to
improve performance significantly.
  We show preliminary evidence for this in practice by demonstrating a speed-up

mesoscopic level, with physiological and anatomical evidence pointing to it as
likely substrate of long-term memory. In order to investigate some of its
properties, a model of multimodular autoassociator is studied. Each of the many
modules represents a neocortical functional ensemble of recurrently connected
neurons and operates as a Hebbian autoassociator, storing a number of local
features which it can recall upon cue. The global memory patterns are made of
combinations of features sparsely distributed across the modules. Intermodular
connections are modelled as a finite-connectivity random graph. Any pair of
features in any respective pair of modules is allowed to be involved in several
memory patterns; the coarse-grained modular network dynamics is defined in such
a way as to overcome the consequent ambiguity of associations. Effects of
long-range homeostatic synaptic scaling on network performance are also
assessed.
  The dynamical process of cued retrieval almost saturates a natural upper
bound while producing negligible spurious activation. The extent of finite-size
effects on storage capacity is quantitatively evaluated. In the limit of
infinite size, the functional relationship between storage capacity and number
of features per module reduces to that which other authors found by methods
from equilibrium statistical mechanics, which suggests that the origin of the
functional form is of a combinatorial nature. In contrast with its apparent
inevitability at intramodular level, long-range synaptic scaling results to be
of minor relevance to both retrieval and storage capacity, casting doubt on its
existence in the neocortex. A conjecture is also posited about how statistical
fluctuation of connectivity across the network may underpin spontaneous
emergence of semantic hierarchies through learning.

estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are found to be
underestimated when compared with mass estimates from isochrones based on

than 1.5 $M_\odot$, they are also present up to and beyond the maximum mass

$\sim$ -1.5 dex near the RGB tip. The data also suggest a decrease in A(Li)

schemes that require fast CT scanners to capture multiple, rapid revolutions
around the scene in order to generate high quality results. However, if the
scene is moving too fast, then the sampling occurs along a limited view and is
difficult to reconstruct due to spatiotemporal ambiguities. In this work, we
design a reconstruction pipeline using implicit neural representations coupled
with a novel parametric motion field warping to perform limited view 4D-CT
reconstruction of rapidly deforming scenes. Importantly, we utilize a
differentiable analysis-by-synthesis approach to compare with captured x-ray
sinogram data in a self-supervised fashion. Thus, our resulting optimization
method requires no training data to reconstruct the scene. We demonstrate that
our proposed system robustly reconstructs scenes containing deformable and

demonstrate an ability to reconstruct continuous spatiotemporal representations
of our scenes and upsample them to arbitrary volumes and frame rates

this duality, we study non-trivially deformed strongly coupled quantum field

dual. In these cases the non-monotonicity of the D-brane distributions is
reflected in the properties of the renormalization group flow: none of the
$c$-functions proposed in the literature are monotonic. This further suggests
that the non-monotonic behavior of the $c$-functions within previously known
anisotropic backgrounds does not originate from the breaking of Lorentz
invariance. We surmise that NEC violations induced by quantum corrections also

relations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and
their formation history. We trained a Gaussian Mixture Model on typical
exoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to
identify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation
histories of the planets associated with them. Using cluster affiliation as
labels, we trained a Random Forest classifier to predict planet species from
properties of the originating protoplanetary disk. Without presupposing any
planet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population.
They roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant
planets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as
""icy cores"". These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the
formation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy
of >90%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of
planetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form
only in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with
purely analytical predictions. Including N-body interactions between the
planets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that
frequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths. The impact of
gravitational interactions highlights the need for N-body integrators for
realistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets. (abridged)

instability are invoked as the possible progenitors of supermassive black
holes. Their mass and angular momentum at the onset of the instability are key
in many respects, in particular regarding the possibility for observational
signatures of direct collapse. Here, we study the stability of rotating,
rapidly accreting SMSs against GR and derive the properties of these stars at
death. On the basis of hylotropic structures, relevant for rapidly accreting
SMSs, we define rotation profiles under the assumption of local angular
momentum conservation in radiative regions, which allows for differential
rotation. We find that rotation favours the stability of rapidly accreting SMSs
as soon as the accreted angular momentum represents a fraction f > 0.1% of the
Keplerian angular momentum. For f = 0.3%-0.5% the maximum masses consistent
with GR stability are increased by an order of magnitude compared to the
non-rotating case. For f = 1%, the GR instability cannot be reached if the
stellar mass does not exceed 10^7-10^8 Msun. These results imply that, like in
the non-rotating case, the final masses of the progenitors of direct collapse
black holes range in distinct intervals depending on the scenario considered:
10^5 Msun < M < 10^6 Msun for primordial atomically cooled haloes; 10^6 Msun <
M < 10^9 Msun for metal-rich galaxy mergers. The models suggest that the
centrifugal barrier is inefficient to prevent the direct formation of a
supermassive black hole at the collapse of a SMS. Moreover, the conditions of
galaxy mergers appear as more favorable than those of atomically cooled haloes
for detectable gravitational wave emission and ultra-long gamma-ray bursts at
black hole formation.

Exploration Survey (DELVE) DR1 and \emph{Gaia} EDR3. We discover that the
stream extends over $\sim 29 ^{\circ}$ on the sky (increasing the known length
by $18^{\circ}$), which is comparable to the kinematically cold Phoenix, ATLAS,

gradient along the Jet stream of 0.2 kpc/deg, with distances ranging from
$D_\odot \sim 27-34$ kpc. We use natural splines to simultaneously fit the
stream track, width, and intensity to quantitatively characterize density
variations in the Jet stream, including a large gap, and identify substructure
off the main track of the stream. Furthermore, we report the first measurement
of the proper motion of the Jet stream and find that it is well-aligned with
the stream track suggesting the stream has likely not been significantly
perturbed perpendicular to the line of sight. Finally, we fit the stream with a
dynamical model and find that the stream is on a retrograde orbit, and is well
fit by a gravitational potential including the Milky Way and Large Magellanic
Cloud. These results indicate the Jet stream is an excellent candidate for
future studies with deeper photometry, astrometry, and spectroscopy to study
the potential of the Milky Way and probe perturbations from baryonic and dark
matter substructure.

fundamental stellar and circumstellar parameters and statistical properties

contribute to the study of HAeBes from the largest sample of such sources to
date, for which stellar and circumstellar properties have been determined
homogeneously from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry. Multiwavelength photometry was compiled
for 209 bona fide HAeBes for which Gaia EDR3 distances were estimated. Using
the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), photospheric models were fit to
the optical SEDs to derive stellar parameters, and the excesses at infrared
(IR) and longer wavelengths were characterized to derive several circumstellar
properties. The stellar temperature, luminosity, radius, mass, and age were
derived for each star based on optical photometry. In addition, their IR SEDs
were classified according to two different schemes, and their mass accretion
rates, disk masses, and the sizes of the inner dust holes were also estimated
uniformly. The initial mass function fits the stellar mass distribution of the
sample within 2 < M_star/M_sun < 12. In this aspect, the sample is therefore
representative of the HAeBe regime and can be used for statistical purposes
when it is taken into account that the boundaries are not well probed. A
statistical analysis was carried out mainly focused on the different
circumstellar properties of Herbig Ae (HAe) and Be (HBe) stars. The complete

taxonomy is a significant challenge in e-commerce search for two reasons: 1)
Training data exhibits severe class imbalance problem due to biased click
behavior, and 2) queries with little customer feedback (e.g., tail queries) are
not well-represented in the training set, and cause difficulties for query
understanding. To address these problems, we propose a deep learning model,
DeepCAT, which learns joint word-category representations to enhance the query
understanding process. We believe learning category interactions helps to
improve the performance of category mapping on minority classes, tail and torso
queries. DeepCAT contains a novel word-category representation model that
trains the category representations based on word-category co-occurrences in
the training set. The category representation is then leveraged to introduce a
new loss function to estimate the category-category co-occurrences for refining
joint word-category embeddings. To demonstrate our model's effectiveness on
minority categories and tail queries, we conduct two sets of experiments. The
results show that DeepCAT reaches a 10% improvement on minority classes and a
7.1% improvement on tail queries over a state-of-the-art label embedding model.
Our findings suggest a promising direction for improving e-commerce search by
semantic modeling of taxonomy hierarchies.

we present a framework for measuring model robustness for an important but
difficult text classification task - deceptive news detection. We evaluate
model robustness to out-of-domain data, modality-specific features, and
languages other than English.
  Our investigation focuses on three type of models: LSTM models trained on
multiple datasets(Cross-Domain), several fusion LSTM models trained with images
and text and evaluated with three state-of-the-art embeddings, BERT ELMo, and
GloVe (Cross-Modality), and character-level CNN models trained on multiple

additional image content as input, ELMo embeddings yield significantly fewer

analyzes deception model robustness but also provides a framework of these
analyses that can be applied to new models or extended datasets in the future.

for a young cluster in Sh 2-208 (S208) located in one of the lowest-metallicity
HII regions in the Galaxy, ${\rm [O/H]} = -0.8$ dex. Previous studies suggested
that the cluster is $\sim$0.5-Myr old and has a distance of $D = 4$ kpc, which
is consistent with the astrometric distance from Gaia EDR3. In $\sim$$3.5
\times 4$-arcmin field, 96 sources were detected in at least one MIR band at
$\ge$10$\sigma$, covering intermediate-mass stars with $\sim$1.0-$M_\odot$ mass
detection limit. Total 41 probable cluster members were identified based on the
spatial distributions of spectral-energy-distribution slopes derived from the
NIR $K_S$ and IRAC bands and extinctions of the sources. The cumulative
distribution of the SED slopes for the S208 cluster was not significantly
different from those of other clusters in solar-metallicity environments with
approximately the same age for intermediate-mass stars, if one also considers
non-detected MIR sources identified as S208 cluster members from NIR
observations. This suggests that the degree of dust growth/settling does not
significantly change with metallicities as different as $\sim$1 dex. The
fraction of stars with MIR disk emissions for the cluster members with
$\ge$1-$M_\odot$ mass was 64%-93%, which is comparable to the results in
solar-metallicity environments. Although this may suggest that dominant
disk-dispersal mechanisms for intermediate-mass stars have either no, or very
weak, dependence on metallicity, it can be argued alternatively that this may
suggest that the disk dispersal process does not work effectively at this young
stage.

  Study of NaCl(aq) on Graphite",,,"10.1039/d1sc02289j",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphite is a ubiquitous electrode material with particular promise for use
in e.g., energy storage and desalination devices, but very little is known
about the properties of the graphite-electrolyte double layer at
technologically relevant concentrations. Here, the (electrified)
graphite-NaCl(aq) interface was examined using constant chemical potential
molecular dynamics simulations; this approach avoids ion depletion (due to
surface adsorption) and maintains a constant concentration of ions beyond the
surface. Specific Na+ adsorption at the graphite basal surface causes charging
of the interface in the absence of an applied potential. At moderate bulk
concentrations, this leads to accumulation of counter-ions in a diffuse layer
to balance the effective surface charge, consistent with established models of
the electrical double layer (DL). Beyond 0.6 M, however, a combination of
over-screening and ion crowding in the DL results in alternating compact layers
of ion density perpendicular to the interface. The transition to this regime is
marked by an increasing DL size and anomalous negative shifts to the potential
of zero charge with incremental changes to the bulk concentration. Our
observations are supported by changes to the position of the differential
capacitance minimum measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Furthermore, a striking level of agreement between the differential capacitance
from simulations and experiments allows us to critically assess the accepted
norm that electrochemical capacitance measurements report simply on the density
of states of the graphite material. Finally, ion crowding at the highest
concentrations (beyond 5 M) leads to the formation of liquid-like NaCl clusters
confined to highly non-ideal regions of the double layer, where ion diffusion
is up to five times slower than in the bulk.

black hole entropy and the existing more massive white dwarfs than the

virtue of recent masses and radii of white dwarfs. We consider the modification
generated by introducing the minimal length proposal on the degenerate Fermi
gas equation of state (EOS) and on the hydrostatic equation. For the latter, we
applied Verlinde's proposal regarding entropic gravity to derived the quantum
corrected Newtonian gravity which in turn responsible for modifying the
hydrostatic equation. Through the chi-square analysis of the models, we have
found that the observation data favor the quadratic dan linear GUP models
without mass limit. However, for the quadratic-linear GUP model, we can obtain
the positive value of the free parameter $\gamma_0$ as well as we can get mass
limit more massive than the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In the linear-quadratic
GUP model, the formation of stable massive white dwarfs than the Chandrasekhar
limit is possible only if both parameters are not equal.

traditional model-based controllers for lower-limb exoskeletons often fail to
stabilize the robot or accurately track the desired behaviors under model

(NN) based online adaptive regulator that compensates for the unknown changes
in model parameters and external disturbances by modifying the nominal joint
trajectory. A gradient descent-based delta rule is implemented to update the
weights of a single layer NN, which can be efficiently performed online by
design. We demonstrate the performance of the presented regulator on ATALANTE,
a fully actuated lower limb exoskeleton designed for paraplegic patients. The
simulation results show that the proposed approach noticeably improves
stability and the tracking performance of the system, despite significant
changes in model parameters and large adversarial pushes.

quickly design and generate data in a much more flexible and customizable way.
Moreover, it is packaged as an Unreal plug-in, which makes it more comfortable

of the quark-mixing Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The precision of
these measurements is currently limited by theoretical uncertainties in
electroweak radiative corrections (EWRC) arising from so-called box diagrams,
which involve the exchange of two gauge bosons. Two photon exchange (TPE) is
the most experimentally accessible of such processes, making it a natural
choice for providing constraints on the theoretical frameworks used for
calculating EWRC. The cross section asymmetry between elastic $e^+/e^-$
scattering is directly sensitive to this, as the TPE contribution to the cross
section has opposite sign for electrons and positrons. While charge asymmetry
measurements have been performed on proton targets, no such data exists for
nuclear targets. Proposed here is a measurement of the $e^+/e^-$ charge
asymmetry on various nuclei relevant to $\beta$-decay measurements used for CKM
matrix extraction. Determining the size of TPE through these processes can
provide important constraints on EWRC.

deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this paper opens the door to
advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully

boulders larger than 1 m that show the characteristic 1-micron pyroxene
absorption band in the four-color MapCam data from the OSIRIS-REx mission. We
confirm the presence of exogenic boulders similar to eucrites and find that
mixtures of eucrites with carbonaceous material is also a possible composition
for some boulders. Some of the exogenic boulders have spectral properties
similar to those of ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites, although the laboratory
spectra of these meteorites have a higher albedo than those measured on Bennu,
which could be explained by either a grain size effect, the presence of impact
melt, or optical mixing with carbonaceous material owing to dust coating. Our
Monte Carlo simulations predict that the median amount of OC mass added to the
parent body of Bennu is 0.055% and 0.037% of the volume of a 100- and

rates for the STAs. Furthermore, in order to avoid reception failures in a
large portion of STAs, this paper proposes deep reinforcement learning
(DRL)-based data rate adaptation framework that uses a sim-to-real approach.
Therein, information of reception success/failure at broadcast recipient STAs,
that could not be notified to the broadcast AP in real deployments, are made
available by simulations beforehand, thereby forming data rate adaptation
strategies. Numerical results show that utilizing overheard uplink frames of
recipients makes it feasible to manage data rates in ACK-less broadcast WLANs,
and using the sim-to-real DRL framework can decrease reception failures.

However, assessing these visual, interactive projects requires time and
laborious manual effort, and it is therefore difficult to offer automated or
real-time feedback to students as they work. In this paper, we introduce
SnapCheck, a dynamic testing framework for Snap that enables instructors to
author test cases with Condition-Action templates. The goal of SnapCheck is to
allow instructors or researchers to author property-based test cases that can
automatically assess students' interactive programs with high accuracy. Our
evaluation of SnapCheck on 162 code snapshots from a Pong game assignment in an
introductory programming course shows that our automated testing framework
achieves at least 98% accuracy over all rubric items, showing potentials to use
SnapCheck for auto-grading and providing formative feedback to students.

forcing. This is of particular interest in real-life applications where forcing
and/or data have a strong stochastic component. The prototype model studied
here is a stochastic viscous wave equation, which arises in modeling the
interaction between Stokes flow and an elastic membrane. To account for
stochastic perturbations, the viscous wave equation is perturbed by spacetime
white noise scaled by a nonlinear Lipschitz function, which depends on the
solution. We prove the existence of a unique function-valued stochastic mild
solution to the corresponding Cauchy problem in spatial dimensions one and two.
Additionally, we show that up to a modification, the stochastic mild solution
is $\alpha$-H\""{o}lder continuous for almost every realization of the
solution's sample path, where $\alpha\in[0,1)$ for spatial dimension $n=1$, and
$\alpha \in [0,1/2)$ for spatial dimension $n=2$. This result contrasts the
known results for the heat and wave equations perturbed by spacetime white
noise, including the damped wave equation perturbed by spacetime white noise,
for which a function-valued mild solution exists only in spatial dimension one
and not higher. Our results show that dissipation due to fluid viscosity, which
is in the form of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator applied to the time
derivative of the membrane displacement, sufficiently regularizes the roughness
of white noise in the stochastic viscous wave equation to allow the stochastic
mild solution to exist even in dimension two, which is the physical dimension
of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on
well-posedness for a stochastically perturbed fluid-structure interaction

a large number of three-dimensional Hartree-Fock+BCS calculations at densities
leading to the crust-core transition. We survey the shape parameter space of

surfaces. The bi-continuous phase, in which both the neutron gas and nuclear
matter extend continuously in all dimensions and therefore protons are
delocalized, appears over a large range of depths. Our results support the idea
that nuclear pasta is a glassy system. Multiple pasta configurations coexist in
a given layer of the crust. At a characteristic temperature, of order
$10^8$-$10^9$K, different phases become frozen into domains whose sizes we
estimate to be 1-50 times the lattice spacing and over which the local density
and electron fraction can vary. Above this temperature, there is very little
long-range order and matter is an amorphous solid. Electron scattering off
domain boundaries may contribute to the disorder resistivity of the pasta
phases. Annealing of the domains may occur during cooling; repopulating of
local minima during crustal heating might lead to temperature dependent
transport properties in the deep layers of the crust. We identify 4 distinct
regions: (1) nuclear pasta first appears as a local minima, but spherical
nuclei are the ground state; (2) nuclear pasta become the absolute minimum, but
spherical nuclei are still a local minimum (3) only nuclear pasta appears in
local minima, and protons are still localized in at least one dimension (4)
only pasta appears, and protons are delocalized. The whole pasta region can
occupy up to 70% of the crust by mass and 40% by thickness, and the layer in
which protons are delocalized could occupy 45% of the crust mass and 25% of its

while the obliquity component is very sensitive to the thermal model of the
asteroid.
  Here we develop a semi-analytic theory for the obliquity component of YORP.
We integrate an approximate thermal model over the surface of an asteroid, and
find an analytic expression for the obliquity component in terms of two YORP
coefficients.
  This approach allows us to investigate the overall evolution of asteroid
rotation state, and to generalize the results previously obtained in the case
of zero thermal inertia.
  The proposed theory also explains how a non-zero obliquity component of YORP
originates even for a symmetric asteroid due to its finite thermal inertia. In
many cases, this causes equatorial planes of asteroids to align with their
orbital planes.
  The studied non-trivial behavior of YORP as a function of thermal model
allows for a new kind of rotational equilibria, which can have important

revealed significant dynamic range fluctuations and a ""distributional mismatch""

segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for
performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we
define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One
algorithm is model-based and can be derived from an optimization problem
involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on
feedback in the form of a prediction error, and can also be used for
forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the
feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are
absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a
running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the
segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting
signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In
particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from

extended in [\textit{Journal of Nonlinear Science.,} Vol. 26, Iss. 1, pp.
83--119, 2016] by Grabovsky and the author), predicts that the critical
buckling load of a thin shell under dead loading is closely related to the
Korn's constant (in Korn's first inequality) of the shell under the Dirichlet
boundary conditions resulting from the loading program. It is known that under
zero Dirichlet boundary conditions on the thin part of the boundary of
positive, negative, and zero (one principal curvature vanishing, and one apart
from zero) Gaussian curvature shells, the optimal Korn constant in Korn's first
inequality scales like the thickness to the power of $-1, -4/3,$ and $-3/2$
respectively. In this work we analyse the scaling of the optimal constant in
Korn's first inequality for elliptic shells that contain a finite number of
points where both principal curvatures vanish. We prove that the presence of at
least one such point on the shell leads to the scaling drop from the thickness
to the power of $-1$ to the thickness to the power of $-3/2.$ To our best
knowledge, this is the first result in the direction for constant-sign
curvature shells, that do not contain a developable region. In addition, under
the assumption that a suitable trivial branch exists, we prove that in fact the

objects of arbitrary sizes, including tiny objects as small as $2\times 2$
pixels. Such tiny objects appear frequently in remotely sensed images, and
present a challenge to recent object detection algorithms. More importantly,
current object detection methods have been designed originally to accommodate
axis-aligned bounding box detection, and therefore fail to accurately localize
oriented boxes that best describe freely rotated objects. In contrast, the
proposed CNN-based approach uses potential pixel information at multiple scale
levels without the need for any external resources, such as anchor boxes.The
method encodes the precise location and orientation of features of the target
objects at grid cell locations. Unlike existing methods which regress the
bounding box location and dimension,the proposed method learns all the required
information by classification, which has the added benefit of enabling oriented
bounding box detection without any extra computation. It thus infers the
bounding boxes only at inference time by finding the minimum surrounding box
for every set of the same predicted class labels. Moreover, a
rotation-invariant feature representation is applied to each scale, which
imposes a regularization constraint to enforce covering the 360 degree range of
in-plane rotation of the training samples to share similar features.
Evaluations on the xView and DOTA datasets show that the proposed method
uniformly improves performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

{\pi}-conjugated salts, such as borates, carbonates. Meanwhile, to maintain a
large optical anisotropy. We uncover that the {\pi}-conjugated confinement is a

concept drift occurrences in previously seen classes and adapts clusters
accordingly. The proposed architecture is thus capable of both remembering

separate loss functions. The design enables to handle arbitrary subsets and
capture the similarity of subsets on single features, thus achieving accurate
pattern exploration, which in most cases is searching for subsets having
similar values on few features. Moreover, each subnet is a fully-connected
neural network with one hidden layer. The simple structure brings high training
efficiency. We integrate the SEN into a visualization system that achieves a
3-step workflow. Specifically, analysts (1) partition the given dataset into
subsets, (2) select portions in a projected latent space created using the SEN,
and (3) determine the existence of patterns within selected subsets. Generally,
the system combines visualizations, interactions, automatic methods, and
quantitative measures to balance the exploration flexibility and operation

follow a universal rule; it occurs at about one-third from the posterior end of

hydrodynamic mechanisms that shaped this convergent design and its potential
benefit to fish in terms of swimming speed and efficiency are not well
understood. It is also unclear to what extent this bending is active or follows
passively from the interaction of a flexible posterior with the fluid
environment. Here, we use a self-propelled two-link model, with fluid-structure
interactions described in the context of the vortex sheet method, to analyze
the effects of both active and passive body bending on the swimming
performance. We find that passive bending is more efficient but could reduce
swimming speed compared to rigid flapping, but the addition of active bending
could enhance both speed and efficiency. Importantly, we find that the phase
difference between the posterior and anterior sections of the body is an
important kinematic factor that influences performance, and that active
antiphase flexion, consistent with the passive flexion phase, can
simultaneously enhance speed and efficiency in a region of the design space
that overlaps with biological observations. Our results are consistent with the
hypothesis that fish that actively bend their bodies in a fashion that exploits
passive hydrodynamics can at once improve speed and efficiency.

performance (in terms of minimizing the beampattern matching errors or
maximizing the minimum weighted beampattern gains), subject to the
communication users' minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
requirements and the BS's transmit power constraints. In particular, we
consider two types of communication receivers, namely Type-I and Type-II

interference from the {\emph{a-priori}} known dedicated radar signals,
respectively. Under both Type-I and Type-II receivers, the beampattern matching

optimally solved via applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique
together with the rigorous proof of the tightness of SDR for both Type-I and

optimality, radar signals are not required with Type-I receivers under some

performance with Type-II receivers. Numerical results show that the minimum
weighted beampattern gain maximization leads to significantly higher
beampattern gains at the worst-case sensing angles with a much lower

of this technique in deriving possible age spreads within a star cluster. We
test how well an internal age spread can be resolved as a function of cluster
age, population mass fraction, and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. For this test,
the two ages (Age (SSP1) and Age (SSP2)) are free parameters along with the
mass fraction of SSP1. We perform the analysis on 118,800 mock star clusters
covering all ages in the range 6.8 < log (age/yr) < 10.2, with mass fractions
from 10% to 90% for two age gaps (0.2 dex and 0.5 dex). Random noise is added
to the model spectra to achieve S/N ratios between 50 to 100 per wavelength
pixel. We find that the mean of the derived Age (SSP1) generally matches the
real Age (SSP1) to within 0.1 dex up to ages around log (age/yr) = 9.5. The
precision decreases for log (age/yr) > 9.6 for any mass fraction or S/N, due to
the similarity of SED shapes for those ages. In terms of the recovery of age
spreads, we find that the derived age spreads are often larger than the real
ones, especially for log(age/yr) < 8.0 and high mass fractions of SSP1.
Increasing the age gap in the mock clusters improves the derived parameters,

studied. We consider the thermal feedback effects of the produced particles on
the effective dissipation rate of the inflaton field, which can lead to
enhanced production of particles. We parameterize the temperature dependence of
the dissipation rate in terms of a Taylor expansion containing the vacuum decay
rate and the thermal terms. By solving the Boltzmann equations for the energy
densities of the inflaton and radiation, we provide analytic estimates for a
general power law dependence on the temperature. In this way we describe the
entire reheating process. The maximum temperature of the reheating process and
its dependence on model parameters are studied in different cases. The impact
of the thermal feedback effects on the expansion history of the universe and
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is discussed. We also discuss the range
of validity of our approach.

on elastic electron-proton scattering have been a subject of high experimental
and theoretical interest since the polarization transfer measurements of the
proton electromagnetic form factor ratio $G_E^p/G_M^p$ at large momentum
transfer $Q^2$ conclusively established the strong decrease of this ratio with
$Q^2$ for $Q^2 \gtrsim 1$ GeV$^2$. This result is incompatible with previous
extractions of this quantity from cross section measurements using the
Rosenbluth Separation technique. Much experimental attention has been focused
on extracting the two-photon exchange (TPE) effect through the unpolarized
$e^+p/e^-p$ cross section ratio, but polarization transfer in polarized elastic
scattering can also reveal evidence of hard two-photon exchange. Furthermore,
it has a different sensitivity to the generalized TPE form factors, meaning
that measurements provide new information that cannot be gleaned from
unpolarized scattering alone. Both $\epsilon$-dependence of polarization
transfer at fixed $Q^2$, and deviations between electron-proton and
positron-proton scattering are key signatures of hard TPE. A polarized positron
beam at Jefferson Lab would present a unique opportunity to make the first
measurement of positron polarization transfer, and comparison with
electron-scattering data would place valuable constraints on hard TPE. Here, we
propose a measurement program in Hall A that combines the Super BigBite
Spectrometer for measuring recoil proton polarization, with a non-magnetic
calorimetric detector for triggering on elastically scattered positrons. Though
the reduced beam current of the positron beam will restrict the kinematic
reach, this measurement will have very small systematic uncertainties, making
it a clean probe of TPE.

reduces the overall computation. Prior works implement channel pruning in an
unexplainable manner, which tends to reduce the final classification errors
while failing to consider the internal influence of each channel. In this
paper, we conduct channel pruning in a white box. Through deep visualization of
feature maps activated by different channels, we observe that different
channels have a varying contribution to different categories in image
classification. Inspired by this, we choose to preserve channels contributing
to most categories. Specifically, to model the contribution of each channel to
differentiating categories, we develop a class-wise mask for each channel,
implemented in a dynamic training manner w.r.t. the input image's category. On
the basis of the learned class-wise mask, we perform a global voting mechanism
to remove channels with less category discrimination. Lastly, a fine-tuning
process is conducted to recover the performance of the pruned model. To our
best knowledge, it is the first time that CNN interpretability theory is
considered to guide channel pruning. Extensive experiments on representative
image classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our White-Box over
many state-of-the-arts. For instance, on CIFAR-10, it reduces 65.23% FLOPs with
even 0.62% accuracy improvement for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, White-Box
achieves a 45.6% FLOPs reduction with only a small loss of 0.83% in the top-1
accuracy for ResNet-50.

discrete time-slots based on their importance to visit the facility. Naturally,
the formulation applies to several similar problems. We consider {\em
indivisible} job requests that take single or multiple slots to complete. The
salient properties of our approach are: it (a)~ensures social distancing by
ensuring a maximum population in a given time-slot at the facility, (b)~aims to
prioritize individuals based on the importance of the jobs, (c)~maintains
truthfulness of the reported importance by adding a {\em cooling-off} period
after their allocated time-slot, during which the individual cannot re-access
the same facility, (d)~guarantees voluntary participation of the citizens, and

We show that the problem becomes NP-complete for indivisible multi-slot
demands, and provide a polynomial-time mechanism that is truthful, individually
rational, and approximately optimal. Experiments with data collected from a
store show that visitors with more important (single-slot) jobs are allocated
more preferred slots, which comes at the cost of a longer cooling-off period
and significantly reduces social congestion. For the multi-slot jobs, our
mechanism yields reasonable approximation while reducing the computation time
significantly.

framework to disentangle the latent factors arising in a real-world graph.
However, it relies on disentangling information heavily from a local range
(i.e., a node and its 1-hop neighbors), while the local information in many
cases can be uneven and incomplete, hindering the interpretabiliy power and
model performance of DisenGCN. In this paper, we introduce a novel Local and
Global Disentangled Graph Convolutional Network (LGD-GCN) to capture both local
and global information for graph disentanglement. LGD-GCN performs a
statistical mixture modeling to derive a factor-aware latent continuous space,
and then constructs different structures w.r.t. different factors from the
revealed space. In this way, the global factor-specific information can be
efficiently and selectively encoded via a message passing along these built
structures, strengthening the intra-factor consistency. We also propose a novel
diversity promoting regularizer employed with the latent space modeling, to
encourage inter-factor diversity. Evaluations of the proposed LGD-GCN on the
synthetic and real-world datasets show a better interpretability and improved
performance in node classification over the existing competitive models.

are discontinuous at $T_c$ in accordance with Ehrenfest's classification of
phase transitions. Moreover, we have found a sign change in $\partial
C/\partial T$ close to the critical temperature. As to the quantum critical
point, $C$ and its derivatives are regular as a function of the control

pixels into clusters, has drawn significant attention in practical
applications. Recently, many graph-based clustering methods, which construct an
adjacent graph to model the data relationship, have shown dominant performance.
However, the high dimensionality of HSI data makes it hard to construct the
pairwise adjacent graph. Besides, abundant spatial structures are often
overlooked during the clustering procedure. In order to better handle the high
dimensionality problem and preserve the spatial structures, this paper proposes
a novel unsupervised approach called spatial-spectral clustering with anchor
graph (SSCAG) for HSI data clustering. The SSCAG has the following
contributions: 1) the anchor graph-based strategy is used to construct a
tractable large graph for HSI data, which effectively exploits all data points
and reduces the computational complexity; 2) a new similarity metric is
presented to embed the spatial-spectral information into the combined adjacent
graph, which can mine the intrinsic property structure of HSI data; 3) an
effective neighbors assignment strategy is adopted in the optimization, which
performs the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the adjacent graph to get
solutions efficiently. Extensive experiments on three public HSI datasets show
that the proposed SSCAG is competitive against the state-of-the-art approaches.

irreversible consequences such as loss of human lives and mission failures.
Therefore, C3I systems have become a focal point for cyber adversaries.
Moreover, technological advancements and modernization of C3I systems have
significantly increased the potential risk of cyber-attacks on C3I systems.
Consequently, cyber adversaries leverage highly sophisticated attack vectors to

Simultaneously, images of the moving brain were acquired at 2193 images/s,
using a custom imaging sequence with 8 interleaved ultrasound transmit-receive

furnishes an alternative mechanism for the black hole echoes. Physically, the
latter may correspond to an uneven matter distribution inside the surrounding
halo. To demonstrate the results, we first numerically investigate the temporal
evolution of the scalar perturbations around a black hole that possesses a
nonsmooth effective potential. It is shown that the phenomenon persists even
though the discontinuity can be located further away from the horizon with
rather insignificant strength. Besides, we show that the echoes in the present
model can be derived analytically based on the modified pole structure of the
associated Green function. The asymptotical properties of the quasinormal mode
spectrum and the echoes are found to be closely connected, as both features can
be attributed to the same origin. In particular, the period of the echoes in
the time domain $T$ is shown to be related to the asymptotic spacing between
successive poles along the real axis in the frequency domain
$\Delta(\Re\omega)$, by a simple relation
$\lim\limits_{\Re\omega\to+\infty}\Delta(\Re\omega) = 2\pi/T$. Moreover, we
discuss possible distinguishment between different echo mechanisms. The
potential astrophysical implications of the present findings are also
addressed.

both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric
to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The
ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge
during the learning process to serve as a sound basis for explainability.
X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation at

for the practical deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper discusses the
engineering of reliable agents via the integration of deep RL with
constraint-based augmentation models to guide the RL agent towards safe

explore, such that its effectiveness to solve the given problem is not

constraints, the outside models can provide guidance to still work reliably. We
discuss integration points for constraint guidance within the RL process and
perform experiments on two case studies: a strictly constrained card game and a

that constraint-guidance does both provide reliability improvements and safer

external complex potential is well-known to support continuous families of
localized stationary modes: the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potentials and the Wadati
potentials. Recently Y. Kominis and coauthors [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals,
118, 222-233 (2019)] have suggested that the continuous families can be also
found in complex potentials of the form $W(x)=W_{1}(x)+iCW_{1,x}(x)$, where $C$
is an arbitrary real and $W_1(x)$ is a real-valued and bounded differentiable
function. Here we study in detail nonlinear stationary modes that emerge in
complex potentials of this type (for brevity, we call them W-dW potentials).
First, we assume that the potential is small and employ asymptotic methods to
construct a family of nonlinear modes. Our asymptotic procedure stops at the
terms of the $\varepsilon^2$ order, where small $\varepsilon$ characterizes
amplitude of the potential. We therefore conjecture that no continuous families
of authentic nonlinear modes exist in this case, but ""pseudo-modes"" that
satisfy the equation up to $\varepsilon^2$-error can indeed be found in W-dW
potentials. Second, we consider the particular case of a W-dW potential well of
finite depth and support our hypothesis with qualitative and numerical
arguments. Third, we simulate the nonlinear dynamics of found pseudo-modes and
observe that, if the amplitude of W-dW potential is small, then the
pseudo-modes are robust and display persistent oscillations around a certain
position predicted by the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we study the authentic
stationary modes which do not form a continuous family, but exist as isolated
points. Numerical simulations reveal dynamical instability of these solutions.

to show a fully mixed bi-modal distribution of position angles across the cloud
(Goodman et al. 1990). We study the Gaia trigonometric distances to each of
these stars and reveal that the two components in position angles trace two
different dust clouds along the line of sight. One component, which shows a
polarization angle of -37.6 deg +/- 35.2 deg and a higher polarization fraction
of 2.0 +/- 1.7%, primarily traces the Perseus molecular cloud at a distance of
300 pc. The other component, which shows a polarization angle of +66.8 deg +/-
19.1 deg and a lower polarization fraction of 0.8 +/- 0.6%, traces a foreground
cloud at a distance of 150 pc. The foreground cloud is faint, with a maximum
visual extinction of < 1 mag. We identify that foreground cloud as the outer
edge of the Taurus molecular cloud. Between the Perseus and Taurus molecular
clouds, we identify a lower-density ellipsoidal dust cavity with a size of 100
-- 160 pc. This dust cavity locates at l = 170 deg, b = -20 deg, and d = 240
pc, which corresponds to an HI shell generally associated with the Per OB2

revealed by local measurements of the parts of a composite system. In this
paper, we study nonlocality arising from a set of orthogonal states that cannot
be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). Such a set is deemed nonlocal, for a joint measurement on the whole
system is necessary for perfect discrimination of the states with certainty. On
the other hand, a set of orthogonal states that can be perfectly distinguished
by LOCC is believed to be devoid of nonlocal properties. Here, we show that
there exist orthogonal sets that are locally distinguishable but without local
redundancy (i.e., they become nonorthogonal on discarding one or more
subsystems) whose nonlocality can be activated by local measurements. In
particular, a state chosen from such a set can be locally converted, with
certainty, into another state, the identity of which can now only be
ascertained by global measurement and no longer by LOCC. In other words, a
locally distinguishable set without local redundancy may be locally converted
into a locally indistinguishable set with certainty. We also suggest an
application, namely, local hiding of information, that allows us to locally
hide locally available information without losing any part. Once hidden, the
information in its entirety can only be retrieved using entanglement.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The visual relationship recognition (VRR) task aims at understanding the
pairwise visual relationships between interacting objects in an image. These
relationships typically have a long-tail distribution due to their
compositional nature. This problem gets more severe when the vocabulary becomes
large, rendering this task very challenging. This paper shows that modeling an
effective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical
to tackling the compositionality and long-tail challenges in VRR. The method,
called RelTransformer, represents each image as a fully-connected scene graph
and restructures the whole scene into the relation-triplet and global-scene
contexts. It directly passes the message from each element in the
relation-triplet and global-scene contexts to the target relation via
self-attention. We also design a learnable memory to augment the long-tail
relation representation learning. Through extensive experiments, we find that
our model generalizes well on many VRR benchmarks. Our model outperforms the
best-performing models on two large-scale long-tail VRR benchmarks, VG8K-LT
(+2.0% overall acc) and GQA-LT (+26.0% overall acc), both having a highly
skewed distribution towards the tail. It also achieves strong results on the

efficient framework, Piggyback GAN, which learns the current task by building a

reducing the corresponding $N$-body operators (where $N$ is the number of

exhibits a pole as the string approaches flavor D6 branes. We identify this as

On the other hand, a similar analysis for $ \mathcal{N}=(1,0) $ SCFTs in $6d$

dispersion relations at strong coupling. Based on semiclassical calculations,
we set an argument that explains either of these cases.

GW signals emitted by the mergers of massive black hole binaries. Luminosity
distance information can be obtained from GW observations, and one can perform
cosmological inference if redshift information can also be extracted, which
would be straightforward if an electromagnetic counterpart exists. In this
paper, we concentrate on the conservative scenario where the EM counterparts
are not available, and comprehensively study if cosmological parameters can be
inferred through a statistical approach, utilizing the non-uniform distribution
of galaxies as well as the black hole mass-host galaxy bulge luminosity
relationship. By adopting different massive black hole binary merger models,
and assuming different detector configurations, we conclude that the
statistical inference of cosmological parameters is indeed possible. TianQin is
expected to constrain the Hubble constant to a relative error of about 4%-7%,
depending on the underlying model. The multidetector network of TianQin and
LISA can significantly improve the precision of cosmological parameters. In the
most favorable model, it is possible to achieve a level of 1.7% with a network
of TianQin and LISA. We find that without EM counterparts, constraints on all
other parameters need a larger number of events or more precise sky
localization of GW sources, which can be achieved by the multidetector network
or under a favorable model for massive black hole mergers. However, in the
optimistic case, where EM counterparts are available, one can obtain useful
constraints on all cosmological parameters in the Lambda-CDM cosmology,
regardless of the population model. Moreover, we can also constrain the
equation of state of the dark energy without the EM counterparts, and it is
even possible to study the evolution of EoS of the DE when the EM counterparts

environment which is qualitatively different compared to the solar wind or the
interstellar medium. The key differences are the finite sizes of the
magnetospheres limited by their physical boundaries, the presence of a strong
planetary background magnetic field and spatially very inhomogeneous plasma
properties within the magnetospheres. Typical turbulent fluctuations possess
amplitudes much smaller than the background field and are characterized by
Alfv\'en times, which can be smaller than the non-linear interaction time
scales. The magnetospheres of the outer planets are thus interesting
laboratories of plasma turbulence. In Jupiter's and Saturn's magnetospheres,
turbulence is well established thanks to the in-situ measurements by several
spacecraft, in particular by the Galileo and Cassini orbiter. In contrast, the
fluctuations in Uranus' and Neptune's magnetospheres are poorly understood due
to the lack of sufficient data. Turbulence in the outer planets' magnetospheres
have important effects on the systems as a whole. The dissipation of the
turbulent fluctuations through wave-particle interaction is a significant heat
source, which can explain the large magnetospheric plasma temperatures.

critical for building a cheap surrogate model that adequately approximates an

applications, the input space can often be non-rectangular because of
constraints on the input variables. One solution to generate designs in a
constrained space is to first generate uniformly distributed samples in the
feasible region, and then use them as the candidate set to construct the
designs. Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo (SCMC) is the state-of-the-art
technique for candidate generation, but it still requires large number of
constraint evaluations, which is problematic especially when the constraints
are expensive to evaluate. Thus, to reduce constraint evaluations and improve

A typical example is the actin cortex which surrounds most animal cells. It
shows elastic properties for short time scales and behaves viscous for longer
time scales. Hence, realistic simulations of cell shape dynamics require a
model capturing the entire elastic to viscous spectrum. However, currently
there are no numerical methods to simulate deforming viscoelastic surfaces.
Thus models for the cell cortex, or other viscoelastic surfaces, are usually
based on assumptions or simplifications which limit their applicability. In
this paper we develop a first numerical approach for simulation of deforming
viscoelastic surfaces. To this end, we derive the surface equivalent of the
upper convected Maxwell model using the GENERIC formulation of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. The model distinguishes between shear dynamics and dilatational
surface dynamics. The viscoelastic surface is embedded in a viscous fluid
modelled by the Navier-Stokes equation. Both systems are solved using Finite
Elements. The fluid and surface are combined using an Arbitrary
Lagrange-Eulerian (ALE) Method that conserves the surface grid spacing during
rotations and translations of the surface. We verify this numerical
implementation against analytic solutions and find good agreement. To
demonstrate its potential we simulate the experimentally observed tumbling and
tank-treading of vesicles in shear flow. We also supply a phase-diagram to
demonstrate the influence of the viscoelastic parameters on the behaviour of a
vesicle in shear flow. Finally, we explore cytokinesis as a future application
of the numerical method by simulating the start of cytokinesis using a
spatially dependent function for the surface tension.

general expressions for entropy production, free energy, and entropy extraction
rates are derived to a Brownian particle that walks in an overdamped and
underdamped media. Via the well known stochastic approaches to underdamped and
overdamped media, the thermodynamic expressions first derived at trajectory
level then generalized to an ensemble level. To study the non-equilibrium
thermodynamic features of a Brownian particle that hops in a medium where its
viscosity varies on time, a Brownian particle that walks on a periodic
isothermal medium (in the presence or absence of load) is considered. The exact
analytical results depict that in the absence of load $f=0$, the entropy
production rate ${\dot e}_{p}$ approaches the entropy extraction rate ${\dot
h}_{d}=0$. This is reasonable since any system which is in contact with a
uniform temperature should obey the detail balance condition in a long time
limit. In the presence of load and when the viscous friction decreases either
spatially or temporally, the entropy $S(t)$ monotonously increases with time
and saturates to a constant value as $t$ further steps up. The entropy
production rate ${\dot e}_{p}$ decreases in time and at steady state (in the
presence of load), ${\dot e}_{p}={\dot h}_{d}>0$. On the contrary, when the
viscous friction increases either spatially or temporally, the rate of entropy
production as well as the rate of entropy extraction monotonously steps up
showing that such systems are inherently irreversible.

offline setting, wherein all the data is assumed to be available for analysis.
Defensive measures for online learning, where data points arrive sequentially,

Anonymized data collected by the Mexican federal government comprises more than
80 million contributors (individuals and companies) and almost 7 billion
monthly-aggregations of invoices among contributors between January 2015 and
December 2018. This data includes a list of almost ten thousand contributors
already identified as tax evaders, due to their activities fabricating invoices
for non-existing products or services so that recipients can evade taxes.
Harnessing this extensive dataset, we build monthly and yearly temporal
networks where nodes are contributors and directed links are invoices produced
in a given time slice. Exploring the properties of the network neighborhoods
around tax evaders, we show that their interaction patterns differ from those
of the majority of contributors. In particular, invoicing loops between tax
evaders and their clients are over-represented. With this insight, we use two
machine-learning methods to classify other contributors as suspects of tax
evasion: deep neural networks and random forests. We train each method with a
portion of the tax evader list and test it with the rest, obtaining more than
0.9 accuracy with both methods. By using the complete dataset of contributors,
each method classifies more than 100 thousand suspects of tax evasion, with
more than 40 thousand suspects classified by both methods. We further reduce
the number of suspects by focusing on those with a short network distance from
known tax evaders. We thus obtain a list of highly suspicious contributors
sorted by the amount of evaded tax, valuable information for the authorities to
further investigate illegal tax activity in Mexico. With our methods, we
estimate previously undetected tax evasion in the order of \$10 billion USD per
year by about 10 thousand contributors.

analysis for the velocity shows a crossover time $t^*$ at which the velocity is
size independent. Based on a two-variable scaling analysis, we extract the
exponents, which are different from all universality classes we are aware of.
Especially noting that the dynamic and roughness exponents are $z_w=1.55\pm
0.05$, and $\alpha_w=1.05\pm 0.05$ at the criticality, we conclude that the
system is different from both EW and KPZ universality classes. Our analysis
shows therefore that making the noise long-range-correlated, drives the system
out of EW universality class. The simulations on the tilted lattice shows that
the non-linearity term ($\lambda$ term in the KPZ equations) goes to zero in

percolation, Ising model and random Coulomb potential (RCP). The first two
models are short range interaction (SRI), whereas the last one includes coulomb
like interactions which is pretty long range (long-range interactions, LRI). By
examining various dynamical observables we show that the critical exponents of
SRI IP are robust against the control parameters (temperature in the Ising
model and occupation probability in site percolation), whereas its properties
in the LRI (RCP) supports are completely different from the normal IP (i.e. on
the regular lattice). Especially the fractal dimension of the external frontier
of the largest hole converges to $1.099\pm 0.008$ for RCP IP, whereas it is
nearly $\frac{4}{3}$ for SRI IP being compatible with normal IP. Additionally a
novel dynamical crossover is seen in the RCP IP according to which the time
dependence of all of the observables is divided to three parts: the power-law
(small times), the logarithmic (mid time), and the linear (long time) regimes.
The second crossover time is shown to go to infinity in the thermodynamic
limit, whereas the first crossover time is nearly unchanged, signaling the
dominance of the logarithmic regime. The observables become nearly constant in

because of the various sizes of filters comparing with single-layer CNN and

exactly a shift to an online learning model but a transition to a new approach
called Emergency Remote Teaching. It is a temporary strategy to keep activities
going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of
universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and
students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles
for students to continue engaged. Before the pandemic, hackathons --
short-lived events (1 to 3 days) where participants intensively collaboration
to develop software prototypes -- were starting to be explored as an
alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical
skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an

  Envelopment Analysis",,,,,"cs.CY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) appears more than just an instrument of
measurement. DEA models can be seen as a mathematical structure for democratic
voicing within decisional contexts. Such an important aspect of DEA is enhanced
through the performance evaluation of a group of professors in a virtual
Business college. We show that the outcomes of the analysis can be very useful
to support decision processes at many levels. There are three categories of
professors: Assistant professors, Associate professors, and Full professors.
The evaluation process of these professors is investigated through two
different cases. The first case handles each category of professors as a
separate sample representing an independent population. The results show that
the mean efficiency scores fall between 0.85 and 0.93 for all professors no
matters their category. In spite of enabling more fairness, such an approach
suffers from its exclusive character, which is contrary to the democratic
spirit of DEA. The second case tries to cope with this deficiency through the
assessment of the faculty members as a single sample drawn from the same
population, i.e., Assistant professors, Associate professors, and Full
professors are treated equally, only on the ground of their respective inputs
and outputs, no matters their academic rank. A clear efficiency decline is
reported, basically due to the very nature of DEA as a procedure that is more
efficiency than output focused.
