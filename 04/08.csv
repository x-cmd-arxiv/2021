pressure fluctuation on Rydberg atoms and their possible observable effects.
The excitation and de-excitation of a Rydberg atom provide an explicit model
for the time averaging of the radiation pressure, as the atomic polarizability
becomes time dependent, first increasing and then decreasing again by several
orders of magnitude. This switched polarizability can induce large vacuum
pressure fluctuations, which can in turn temporarily transfer linear momentum
to the atom and cause a recoil which might be observable.

Drivers are distributed at
random on some interval. Riders arrive in some (possibly adversarial) order at
randomly drawn points. The platform observes the location of the drivers, and
can match newly arrived riders immediately, or can wait for more riders to
arrive. Unmatched riders incur a waiting cost $c$ per period. The platform can
match riders and drivers, irrevocably. The cost of matching a driver to a rider
is equal to the distance between them. We quantify the value of slightly
increasing supply. We prove that when there are $(1+\epsilon)$ drivers per
rider (for any $\epsilon > 0$), the cost of matching returned by a simple
greedy algorithm which pairs each arriving rider to the closest available
driver is $O(\log^3(n))$, where $n$ is the number of riders. On the other hand,
with equal number of drivers and riders, even the \emph{ex post} optimal

neighbor search. Several of the most popular and empirically successful
algorithms are, at their core, a simple walk along a pruned near neighbor

benchmarks for applications such as embedding search. However, graph traversal
applications often suffer from poor memory access patterns, and near neighbor
search is no exception to this rule. Our measurements show that popular search
indices such as the hierarchical navigable small-world graph (HNSW) can have
poor cache miss performance. To address this problem, we apply graph reordering
algorithms to near neighbor graphs. Graph reordering is a memory layout
optimization that groups commonly-accessed nodes together in memory. We present
exhaustive experiments applying several reordering algorithms to a leading
graph-based near neighbor method based on the HNSW index. We find that
reordering improves the query time by up to 40%, and we demonstrate that the
time needed to reorder the graph is negligible compared to the time required to
construct the index.

We
use the six functor formalism to give an intrinsic definition of the stable

computational tools include cdh-descent for normal crossing divisors, Euler
classes, Gysin maps, and homotopy purity. Under $\ell$-adic realization, the
motive at infinity recovers a formula for vanishing cycles due to
Rapoport-Zink; similar results hold for Steenbrink's limiting Hodge structures

stable motivic homotopy type at infinity of an algebraic variety recovers the
singular complex at infinity of the corresponding analytic space. We coin the
notion of homotopically smooth morphisms with respect to a motivic
$\infty$-category and use it to show a generalization to virtual vector bundles
of Morel-Voevodsky's purity theorem, which yields an escalated form of Atiyah
duality with compact support. Further we study a quadratic refinement of
intersection degrees taking values in motivic cohomotopy groups. For relative
surfaces, we show the stable motivic homotopy type at infinity witnesses a
quadratic version of Mumford's plumbing construction for smooth complex
algebraic surfaces. Our main results are also valid for $\ell$-adic sheaves,
mixed Hodge modules, and more generally motivic $\infty$-categories.

orbits of the SMBH along with the surrounding nuclear star cluster (NSC) for a
barred model of the Galaxy using modern constraints on the components of the
SMBH Galactocentric velocity. Is is shown that the range of oscillations of the
SMBH + NSC in a regular Galactic field in the plane of the Galaxy allowed by
these constraints strongly depends on the set of central components of the
Galactic potential. If the central components are represented only by a
bulge/bar, for a point estimate of the SMBH Galactocentric velocity, the
oscillation amplitude does not exceed 7 pc in the case that a classical bulge
is present and reaches 25 pc if there is no bulge; with SMBH velocity
components within the $2\sigma$ significance level, the amplitude can reach 15

disk (NSD), even in the absence of a bulge, the oscillation amplitude is only 5
pc for the point estimate of the SMBH velocity, and 10 pc for the $2\sigma$

On one hand, social workers carefully use social media to support people
experiencing sex trafficking. On the other hand, traffickers use social media
to groom and recruit people into trafficking situations. There is the
opportunity to use social media data to better provide support for people
experiencing trafficking.
  While AI and Machine Learning (ML) have been used in work against sex
trafficking, they predominantly focus on detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material.
Work using social media data has not been done with the intention to provide
community level support to people of all ages experiencing trafficking. Within
this context, this thesis explores the use of semi-supervised classification to
identify social media posts that are a part of the sex industry.
  Several methods were explored for ML. However, the primary method used was
semi-supervised learning, which has the benefit of providing automated
classification with a limited set of labelled data. Social media posts were
embedded into low-dimensional vectors using FastText and Doc2Vec models. The
data were then clustered using k-means clustering, and cross-validation was
used to determine label propagation accuracy.
  The results of the semi-supervised algorithm were encouraging. The FastText
CBOW model provided 98.6% accuracy to over 12,000 posts in clusters where label
propagation was applied. The results of this thesis suggest that further
semi-supervised learning, in conjunction with manual labeling, may allow for
the entire dataset containing over 50,000 posts to be accurately labeled.
  A fully labeled dataset could be used to develop a tool to identify an
overview of where and when social media is used within the sex industry. This
could be used to help determine better ways to provide support to people
experiencing trafficking.

a $d$-dimensional model of interacting bosons of d components. At

leads to emergent higher-rank symmetry and higher-moment conservation at the

couple to a single generation of fermions via a global flavor symmetry breaking
mechanism. Given this strategy, we propose a MeV flavor-specific scalar model
in dimension-$5$ operator series, which explains the muon g-2 anomaly and
proton radius puzzle by coupling with the muon and down-quark at the same time.
The framework is consistent with the null result of high-intensity searches.
Specifically, the supernova constraints for muon couplings become weakened by
including the contribution of down-quark interaction. The parameter space for
explaining muon $g-2$ discrepancy is available when $10\%$ energy deposition is
required in the energy explosion process in the supernova, but this is ruled
out by the $1\%$ energy deposition requirement. We also investigate the
searches for mediator and dark matter and the resulting constraints on viable
parameter space such as nuclear physics constraints, direct detection for light
boosted dark matter, and possible CMB constraints. When compared to
conventional dark matter production, light dark matter production has two
additional modifications: bound state formation and early kinetic equilibrium
decoupling. We are now looking into the implications of these effects on the
relic density of light dark matter.

uncertainties for the Run-1 data set of the Fermilab Muon g-2 Experiment. Two
corrections to the measured muon precession frequency $\omega_a^m$ are
associated with well-known effects owing to the use of electrostatic quadrupole
(ESQ) vertical focusing in the storage ring. An average vertically oriented
motional magnetic field is felt by relativistic muons passing transversely
through the radial electric field components created by the ESQ system. The
correction depends on the stored momentum distribution and the tunes of the
ring, which has relatively weak vertical focusing. Vertical betatron motions
imply that the muons do not orbit the ring in a plane exactly orthogonal to the
vertical magnetic field direction. A correction is necessary to account for an
average pitch angle associated with their trajectories. A third small
correction is necessary because muons that escape the ring during the storage
time are slightly biased in initial spin phase compared to the parent
distribution. Finally, because two high-voltage resistors in the ESQ network
had longer than designed RC time constants, the vertical and horizontal
centroids and envelopes of the stored muon beam drifted slightly, but
coherently, during each storage ring fill. This led to the discovery of an
important phase-acceptance relationship that requires a correction. The sum of
the corrections to $\omega_a^m$ is 0.50 $\pm$ 0.09 ppm; the uncertainty is
small compared to the 0.43 ppm statistical precision of $\omega_a^m$.

by Fermilab in the 2HDM with a discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in which an inert Higgs
doublet field ($H,~A,~H^\pm$) has the lepton flavor violation $\mu$-$\tau$

the Yukawa matrices to be real and symmetrical. Considering relevant
theoretical and experimental constraints, especially for the multi-lepton

$2\sigma$ range in the region of 5 GeV $<m_H<20$ GeV, 130 GeV $<

that, unlike homogeneous architecture, gradient Gyroid not only shows novel

absorption are predictable and designable, which demonstrates its highly

species, what is the number $U$ of hitherto unseen species that would be
observed if $\lambda n$ new samples were collected? This is an important
problem in many scientific endeavors, and it has been the subject of recent
works introducing non-parametric estimators of $U$ that are minimax
near-optimal and consistent all the way up to $\lambda \asymp\log n$. These
works do not rely on any assumption on the underlying unknown distribution $p$
of the population, and therefore, while providing a theory in its greatest
generality, worst-case distributions may severely hamper the estimation of $U$
in concrete applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of
strengthening the non-parametric framework for estimating $U$. Inspired by the
estimation of rare probabilities in extreme value theory, and motivated by the
ubiquitous power-law type distributions in many natural and social phenomena,
we make use of a semi-parametric assumption regular variation of index $\alpha
\in (0,1)$ for the tail behaviour of $p$. Under this assumption, we introduce
an estimator of $U$ that is simple, linear in the sampling information,
computationally efficient, and scalable to massive datasets. Then, uniformly
over our class of regularly varying tail distributions, we show that the
proposed estimator has provable guarantees: i) it is minimax near-optimal, up
to a power of $\log n$ factor; ii) it is consistent all of the way up to
$\log\lambda \asymp n^{\alpha/2}/\sqrt{\log n}$, and this range is the best
possible. This work presents the first study on the estimation of the unseen
under regularly varying tail distributions. A numerical illustration of our
methodology is presented for synthetic data and real data.

that a (slightly) smaller number of high-quality attempts will likely yield
more goals than a slew of low-quality ones. This observation has driven a
change in shooting behavior. Teams are passing up on shots from outside the
penalty box, in the hopes of generating a better shot closer to goal later on.
This paper evaluates whether this decrease in long-distance shots is warranted.
Therefore, we propose a novel generic framework to reason about decision-making
in soccer by combining techniques from machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI). First, we model how a team has behaved offensively over the
course of two seasons by learning a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from event
stream data. Second, we use reasoning techniques arising from the AI literature
on verification to each team's MDP. This allows us to reason about the efficacy
of certain potential decisions by posing counterfactual questions to the MDP.
Our key conclusion is that teams would score more goals if they shot more often
from outside the penalty box in a small number of team-specific locations. The
proposed framework can easily be extended and applied to analyze other aspects
of the game.

deterministic and stochastic models for contagious diseases. Deterministic
models for contagious diseases are prone to predict global stability. Small
natural birth and death rates in comparison to disease parameters like the
contact rate and the removal rate ensures that the globally stable endemic
equilibrium corresponds to a tiny average proportion of infected individuals.
Asymptotic equilibrium levels corresponding to low numbers of individuals
invalidate the deterministic results.
  Diffusion effects force frequency functions of the stochastic model to
possess similar stability properties as the deterministic model. Particular
simulations of the stochastic model predict, however, oscillatory patterns.
Small and isolated populations show longer periods, more violent oscillations,
and larger probabilities of extinction.
  We prove that evolution maximizes the infectiousness of the disease as
measured by the ability to increase the proportion of infected individuals.
This holds provided the stochastic oscillations are moderate enough to keep the
proportion of susceptible individuals near a deterministic equilibrium.
  We close our paper with a discussion of the herd-immunity concept and stress
its close relation to vaccination-programs.

simultaneously perform both tasks without compromising the accuracy of either

3PM gravitational eikonal for two colliding massive scalars from the classical
limit of the corresponding elastic two-loop amplitude. We employ the eikonal
phase to obtain the physical deflection angle and to show how its
non-relativistic (NR) and ultra-relativistic (UR) regimes are smoothly
connected. Such a smooth interpolation rests on keeping contributions to the
loop integrals originating from the full soft region, rather than restricting
it to its potential sub-region. This task is efficiently carried out by using
the method of differential equations with complete near-static boundary
conditions. In contrast to the potential-region result, the physical deflection
angle includes radiation-reaction contributions that are essential for
recovering the finite and universal UR limit implied by general analyticity and
crossing arguments. We finally discuss the real emission of massless states,
which accounts for the imaginary part of the 3PM eikonal and for the
dissipation of energy-momentum. Adopting a direct approach based on unitarity
and on the classical limit of the inelastic tree-level amplitude, we are able
to treat $\mathcal N=8$ and General Relativity on the same footing, and to
complete the conservative 3PM eikonal in Einstein's gravity by the addition of
the radiation-reaction contribution. We also show how this approach can be used
to compute waveforms, as well as the differential and integrated spectra, for
the different radiated massless fields.

using only two detector buckets in coincidence, where one small-area detector

just under the patient bed. For proof of concept, we used two Hamamatsu TOF PET
detector modules (C13500-4075YC-12) featuring 12x12 array of 4.2x4.2x20 mm3 LFS

diameter, representing lymph nodes, and placed it inside a 10-liter warm
background water phantom. Experimental results show that with sub-minute data
acquisition, 6 mm diameter spheres can be identified in the image when a lesion
phantom with 10:1 activity ratio to background is used. Simulation results are
in good agreement with the experimental data, by resolving 6 mm diameters
lesions with 60 seconds acquisition time, in 25 cm deep background water
phantom with 10:1 activity ratio. The image quality improves as the CTR
improves in the simulation, and with decreasing background water phantom depth
or lesion to background activity ratio, in the experiment. With the results
presented here we conclude that limited angle TOF PET detector is a major step
forward for intraoperative applications in that, improved lesion detectability
is beyond what the conventional Gamma- and NIR-based probes could achieve.

the higgsino threshold correction is suppressed. On the contrary, if the

mathematical formulation takes the form of an optimal control problem (OCP)

Principle (PMP) approaches by parameterizing the value function with an NN. Our
approach enables us to obtain approximately optimal controls in real-time

trained, generating a control at a given space-time location takes
milliseconds; in contrast, efficient nonlinear programming methods typically
perform the same task in seconds. We train the NN offline using the objective
function of the control problem and penalty terms that enforce the HJB
equations. Therefore, our training algorithm does not involve data generated by
another algorithm. By training on a distribution of initial states, we ensure
the controls' optimality on a large portion of the state-space. Our grid-free
approach scales efficiently to dimensions where grids become impractical or
infeasible. We apply our approach to several multi-agent collision-avoidance

of constraints from the Higgs data, we consider the aligned two-Higgs-doublet
scheme and its effects on muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, $a_{\mu}$,
including both one-loop and two-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams. Thanks to a
sizable trilinear scalar coupling, the Barr-Zee type diagrams mediated by the
Higgs triplet fields have a dominant effect on $a_{\mu}$. In particular, unlike
the usual two-Higgs-doublet models that require exotic Higgs bosons light in
mass, the masses of the corresponding particles in the model are of ${\cal
O}(100)$~GeV. The doubly-charged Higgs boson presents a different decay pattern
from the usual Higgs triplet model and thus calls for a new collider search
strategy, such as multi-$\tau$ searches at the LHC.

photon pile-up, which can dramatically change the statistical inference of
physical parameters from these observations. While dead time is difficult to
take into account in a statistically consistent manner, simulating dead

inferring physical properties from dead time-affected observations fall into a
class of problems common across many scientific disciplines. There is a growing
number of methods to address them under the name of Simulation-Based Inference
(SBI), aided by new developments in density estimation and statistical machine

results of an application of this approach to NuSTAR observations of the

Motivated by the recent determination of the anomalous muon magnetic moment
performed at Fermilab, we derive the constraints on such a model obtained from
the magnetic moment determinations and the measurements of the proton and
cesium weak charge, $Q_W$, performed at low-energy transfer. In order to do so,
we revisit the determination of the cesium $Q_W$ from the atomic parity

neutron rms radius of $^{133}\text{Cs}$, by determining the latter from a
practically model-independent extrapolation from the recent average neutron rms
radius of $^{208}\text{Pb}$ performed by the PREX-2 Collaboration. From a
combined fit of all the aforementioned experimental results, we obtain rather
precise limits on the mass and the kinetic mixing parameter of the $Z_d$ boson,

Intensity variation of high-energy positrons from muon decays directly encodes

magnetic field is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance probes calibrated
in terms of the equivalent proton spin precession frequency

DM and singlet-dominated Higgs bosons can form a secluded DM sector with
$\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to h_s A_s$ responsible for the measured DM
relic abundance. when $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \gtrsim 150~{\rm GeV}$ and the
Yukawa coupling $\kappa$ is around $0.2$. This sector communicates with the SM
sector by weak singlet-doublet Higgs mixing, so the scatterings of the
singlino-dominated DM with nucleons are suppressed. Furthermore, due to the
singlet nature of the DM and the complex mass hierarchy, sparticle decay chains
in the GNMSSM are lengthened in comparison with the prediction of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. These characteristics lead to sparticle
detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being rather tricky. This study
surveys a specific scenario of the GNMSSM, which extends the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM by adding an explicit $\mu$-term, to reveal the features.
It indicates that the theory can readily explain the discrepancy of the muon
anomalous magnetic moment without conflicting with the experimental results in
DM and Higgs physics, and the LHC searches for sparticles.

(such as NA64$\mu$) will be able to measure the coupling of the hidden photon
to the muon sector in the region compatible with $(g-2)_\mu$, and will have
some sensitivity to the hidden photon's mass. We then study how experiments
looking for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at
spallation sources will provide crucial additional information on the kinetic
mixing of the hidden photon. When combined with NA64$\mu$ results, the
exclusion limits (or reconstructed regions) of future CE$\nu$NS detectors will
also allow for a better measurement of the mediator mass. Finally, the
observation of nuclear recoils from solar neutrinos in dark matter direct
detection experiments will provide unique information about the coupling of the
hidden photon to the tau sector. The signal expected for

exhibit small cross-correlation sidelobes, to enhance sensing performance by
separating them at the matched filter outputs. The waveforms also require small
auto-correlation sidelobes to avoid masking of weak targets by the range
sidelobes of strong targets and to mitigate deleterious effects of distributed
clutter. In light of these requirements, in this paper, we design a set of
phase-only (constant modulus) sequences that exhibit near-optimal properties in
terms of Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) and Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL). At the
design stage, we adopt weighted lp-norm of auto- and cross-correlation
sidelobes as the objective function and minimize it for a general p value,
using block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM). Considering the
limitation of radar amplifiers, we design unimodular sequences which make the
design problem non-convex and NP-hard. To tackle the problem, in every
iteration of the BSUM algorithm, we introduce different local approximation
functions and optimize them concerning a block, containing a code entry or a
code vector. The numerical results show that the performance of the optimized
set of sequences outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts, in both terms
of PSL values and computational time.

surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model,
like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of
the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate
significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated
transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in the
posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised
learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling
articulated deformations without template-based surface registration.
Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling
pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit
function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose
correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local
pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and
improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is

binary-stripped stars core tend to be less compact, with a more prominent,

behavior between these two modes of evolution would have important implications
for supernovae statistics, including the final neutron star masses, explosion

catalog mocks to estimate uncertainties, and measure the angular clustering
statistics of LoTSS galaxies, which fit the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology reasonably
well. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian analysis to
recover the best galaxy biasing scheme and multi-component source fraction for
LoTSS DR1 above $1$ mJy assuming different possible redshift templates. After
masking some noisy and uneven patches and with suitable flux density cuts, the
LOFAR survey appears qualified for large-scale cosmological studies. The
upcoming data releases from LOFAR are expected to be deeper and wider, and will
therefore provide improved cosmological measurements.

galaxy is $>10^{8.5}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The distribution of dark subhaloes is
significantly more concentrated in WDM due to the absence of low mass, recently
accreted substructures that typically inhabit the outer parts of a MW halo in
CDM. We show that subhaloes of mass $[10^{7},10^{8}]\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and
within 30kpc of the centre are the stripped remnants of larger haloes in both

anticipate from the overall WDM subhalo population. We estimate that
differences between CDM and WDM concentration-mass relations can be probed for
subhalo-stream impact parameters $<2$kpc. Finally, we find that the impact of
WDM on planes of satellites is likely negligible. Comprehensive comparisons

R 144 was reported to be a binary, making it potentially the most massive
binary thus observed. We perform a comprehensive spectral, photometric,
orbital, and polarimetric analysis of R 144.
  R 144 is an eccentric (e=0.51) 74.2-d binary comprising two relatively
evolved (age~2 Myr), H-rich WR stars. The hotter primary (WN5/6h, T=50 kK) and
the cooler secondary (WN6/7h,T=45kK) have nearly equal masses. The combination
of low rotation and H-depletion observed in the system is well reproduced by
contemporary evolution models that include boosted mass-loss at the upper-mass
end. The systemic velocity of R 144 and its relative isolation suggest that it
was ejected as a runaway from the neighbouring R 136 cluster. The optical
light-curve shows a clear orbital modulation that can be well explained as a
combination of two processes: excess emission stemming from wind-wind
collisions and double wind eclipses. Our light-curve model implies an orbital
inclination of i=60.4+-1.5deg, resulting in accurately constrained dynamical
masses of 74+-4 and 69+-4 Msun. Assuming that both binary components are core
H-burning, these masses are difficult to reconcile with the derived
luminosities (logL1,2 = 6.44, 6.39 [Lsun]), which correspond to evolutionary
masses of the order of 110 and 100Msun, respectively. Taken at face value, our
results imply that both stars have high classical Eddington factors of Gamma_e
= 0.78+-0.1. If the stars are on the main sequence, their derived radii
(~25Rsun) suggest that they are only slightly inflated, even at this high
Eddington factor. Alternatively, the stars could be core-He burning, strongly
inflated from the regular size of classical Wolf-Rayet stars (~1Rsun), a
scenario that could help resolve the observed mass discrepancy.

Their abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources,
with column densities that are typically an order of magnitude lower than those
of O-bearing species. The largest variations, of an order of magnitude, are
seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do not
correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties,
the N-bearing species have similar excitation temperatures to those of
O-bearing species ($\sim$ 100 $\sim$ 300 K). The similarity of most abundances
with respect to HNCO, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN, hints at a shared
chemical history, especially the high D/H ratio in cold regions prior to star
formation. However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the
sensitivity of the chemistry to local conditions such as temperature (e.g.
NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting areas of the
molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The two
sources discussed here add to the small number of sources with such a detailed
chemical analysis on Solar System scales. Future JWST data will allow a direct
comparison between the ice and gas abundances of N-bearing species.

star formation. To test this paradigm in the context of modern cosmological
simulations, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation to investigate the impact of
individual merger events on quenching (i.e. star formation rate at least 3sig
below the star-forming main sequence) within 500Myr after the coalescence
phase.The rate of quenching amongst recently merged galaxies is compared with a
control sample that is matched in redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate
(SFR), black hole mass and environment.We find quenching to be uncommon among
the descendants of post-merger galaxies, with only 5% of galaxies quenching
within 500 Myr after the merger.Despite this low absolute rate, we find that
quenching occurs in post-mergers at twice the rate of the control galaxies.The
fraction of quenched post-merger descendants 1.5 Gyr after the merger becomes
statistically indistinguishable from that of non-post-mergers, suggesting that
mergers could speed up the quenching process in those post-mergers whose
progenitors had physical conditions able to sustain effective active galactic
nuclei (AGN) kinetic feedback, thus capable of removing gas from galaxies.Our
results indicate that although quenching does not commonly occur promptly after
coalescence, mergers nonetheless do promote the cessation of star formation in
some post-mergers. We find that, in IllustrisTNG, it is the implementation of
the AGN kinetic feedback that is responsible for quenching post-mergers, as
well as non-post-merger controls.As a result of the released kinetic energy,
galaxies experience gas loss and eventually, they will quench.Galaxies with an
initially low gas fraction show a preferable pre-disposition towards
quenching.The primary distinguishing factor between quenched and star-forming
galaxies is gas fraction, with a sharp boundary at fgas=0.1 in TNG.

explore the possibility that the '$S_8$-tension' is due to a non-thermal hot
dark matter (HDM) fractional contribution to the universe energy density
leading to a power suppression at small-scales in the matter power spectrum.
Any HDM models can be characterized by its effective mass $ m_{sp}^{\rm eff}$
and its contribution to the relativistic degrees of freedom at CMB decoupling
$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Taking the specific example of a sterile particle
produced from the decay of the inflaton during a matter dominated era, we find
that from Planck only the tension can be reduced below $2\sigma$, but Planck
does not favor a non-zero ${m_{sp}^{\rm eff},\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$. In
combination with a measurement of $S_8$ from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the
$S_8$-tension would hint at the existence of a particle of mass $ m_{sp}^{\rm

close to the boundary of $AdS_5$ or in the minus eight picture. Our strategy
for the computation was to apply eight picture raising operators in the minus
eight picture vertices. In the process, a huge number of terms are generated
and we have developed numerical techniques to perform intermediary
simplifications. Alternatively, the same numerical techniques can be used to
compute the vertices directly in the zero picture by constructing a basis of

computations for tracking the progress of gate-based quantum computers, this
work proposes a Quantum Annealing Single-qubit Assessment (QASA) protocol for
quantifying the performance of individual qubits in quantum annealing
computers. The proposed protocol scales to large quantum annealers with
thousands of qubits and provides unique insights into the distribution of qubit
properties within a particular hardware device. The efficacy of the QASA
protocol is demonstrated by analyzing the properties of a D-Wave 2000Q system,
revealing unanticipated correlations in the qubit performance of that device. A
study repeating the QASA protocol at different annealing times highlights how
the method can be utilized to understand the impact of annealing parameters on
qubit performance. Overall, the proposed QASA protocol provides a useful tool
for assessing the performance of current and emerging quantum annealing

transfer effects. We present the first study of the evolution of Ly$\alpha$
emitters (LAE) during the epoch of reionisation based on a full
radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation that is able to capture both
the large-scale process of reionisation and the small-scale properties of
galaxies. We predict the Ly$\alpha$ emission of galaxies in the $10^3$ cMpc$^3$
SPHINX simulation at $6\leq z\leq9$ by computing the full Ly$\alpha$ radiation
transfer from ISM to IGM scales. SPHINX is able to reproduce many observational
constraints such as the UV/Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions and stellar mass
functions at z $\geq$ 6 for the dynamical range probed by our simulation
($M_{\rm 1500}\gtrsim-18$, $L_{\rm Ly\alpha}\lesssim10^{42}$ erg/s,
$M_{\star}\lesssim10^9$ M$_{\odot}$). As intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission and
internal Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions barely evolve from $z=6$ to 9, the
observed suppression of Ly$\alpha$ luminosities with increasing redshift is
fully attributed to IGM absorption. For most observable galaxies ($M_{\rm
1500}\lesssim-16$), the Ly$\alpha$ line profiles are slightly shifted to the
red due to internal radiative transfer effects which mitigates the effect of
IGM absorption. Overall, the enhanced Ly$\alpha$ suppression during
reionisation traces the IGM neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}$ well but the
predicted amplitude of this reduction is a strong function of the Ly$\alpha$
peak shift, which is set at ISM/CGM scales. We find that a large number of LAEs
could be detectable in very deep surveys during reionisation when $x_{\rm HI}$
is still $\approx 50\%$.

effect of cosmic ray propagation. We use the AMS-02 measurements of electrons

$\Psi\Psi \rightarrow \mu^{-}\mu^{+}$, which rules out part of the parameter
space of the large $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ charged dark matter model to account for

knowledge while rejecting unknown classes which are absent in the labeled

set a threshold to reject unknown samples based on validation or a pre-defined
ratio of unknown samples, but this strategy is not practical. In this paper, we
propose a method to learn the threshold using source samples and to adapt it to
the target domain. Our idea is that a minimum inter-class distance in the
source domain should be a good threshold to decide between known or unknown in
the target. To learn the inter-and intra-class distance, we propose to train a
one-vs-all classifier for each class using labeled source data. Then, we adapt
the open-set classifier to the target domain by minimizing class entropy. The
resulting framework is the simplest of all baselines of UNDA and is insensitive
to the value of a hyper-parameter yet outperforms baselines with a large
margin.

information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. To facilitate efficient system
design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all the IRS elements, we
partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization
framework comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage.
In the offline stage, the IRS elements of each tile are jointly designed to
support a set of different phase shift configurations, referred to as
transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set
for each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to
minimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the
beamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the
quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy
harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm
design is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we
solve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which
entails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality
and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm
capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our
simulation results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power
savings compared to several baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that
by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission modes, the proposed
scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large
IRSs.

dimensions: aircraft scheduling, crew scheduling, and passenger scheduling, in
that order. However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first
two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative
effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another
dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management
include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for
airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human
specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of
information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address
all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need
to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with
quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions
amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective
insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that
effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic
paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all
problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent
multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and
distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for
simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective

stars (hot Jupiters) have been probed for nearly two decades. They allow us to
investigate the chemical and physical properties of planetary atmospheres under
extreme irradiation conditions. Previous observations of hot Jupiters as they
transit in front of their host stars have revealed the frequent presence of
water vapour and carbon monoxide in their atmospheres; this has been studied in
terms of scaled solar composition under the usual assumption of chemical
equilibrium. Both molecules as well as hydrogen cyanide were found in the
atmosphere of HD 209458b, a well studied hot Jupiter (with equilibrium
temperature around 1,500 kelvin), whereas ammonia was tentatively detected
there and subsequently refuted. Here we report observations of HD 209458b that
indicate the presence of water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide
(HCN), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and acetylene (C2H2), with statistical
significance of 5.3 to 9.9 standard deviations per molecule. Atmospheric models
in radiative and chemical equilibrium that account for the detected species
indicate a carbon-rich chemistry with a carbon-to-oxygen ratio close to or
greater than 1, higher than the solar value (0.55). According to existing
models relating the atmospheric chemistry to planet formation and migration
scenarios, this would suggest that HD 209458b formed far from its present
location and subsequently migrated inwards. Other hot Jupiters may also show a
richer chemistry than has been previously found, which would bring into
question the frequently made assumption that they have solar-like and
oxygen-rich compositions.

queries: join-correlation queries. Given a column $Q$ and a join column $K_Q$
from a query table $\mathcal{T}_Q$, retrieve tables $\mathcal{T}_X$ in a
dataset collection such that $\mathcal{T}_X$ is joinable with $\mathcal{T}_Q$
on $K_Q$ and there is a column $C \in \mathcal{T}_X$ such that $Q$ is
correlated with $C$. A na\""ive approach to evaluate these queries, which first
finds joinable tables and then explicitly joins and computes correlations
between $Q$ and all columns of the discovered tables, is prohibitively
expensive. To efficiently support correlated column discovery, we 1) propose a
sketching method that enables the construction of an index for a large number
of tables and that provides accurate estimates for join-correlation queries,
and 2) explore different scoring strategies that effectively rank the query
results based on how well the columns are correlated with the query. We carry
out a detailed experimental evaluation, using both synthetic and real data,
which shows that our sketches attain high accuracy and the scoring strategies
lead to high-quality rankings.

demonstrated for images to date. Part of the reason lies in the lack of a
common domain, for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds,
where a universal perturbation can be defined. In this paper, we offer a change
in perspective and demonstrate the existence of universal attacks for geometric
data (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in
the spectral domain, where the attacks take the form of small perturbations to
short eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geometry is then synthesized via
shape-from-spectrum recovery. Our attacks are universal, in that they transfer
across different shapes, different representations (meshes and point clouds),
and generalize to previously unseen data.

environment. A key issue is to discharge anthropogenic air contamination such
as CO2 gas or, more seriously, airborne respiratory droplets. Here, by
employing direct numerical simulations, we study the mechanical displacement
ventilation with the realistic range of air changes per hour (ACH) from 1 to
10. For this ventilation scheme, a cool lower zone is established beneath the
warm upper zone with the interface height h depending on ACH. For weak
ventilation, we find the scalings relation of the interface height h ~
ACH^{3/5}, as suggested by Hunt & Linden (Build. Environ., vol. 34, 1999, pp.
707-720). Also, the CO2 concentration decreases with ACH within this regime.
However, for too strong ventilation, the interface height h becomes insensitive
to ACH, and the CO2 concentration remains unchanged. Our results are in
contrast to the general belief that stronger flow is more helpful to remove
contaminants. We work out the physical mechanism governing the transition
between the low ACH and the high ACH regimes. It is determined by the relative
strength of the kinetic energy from the inflow, potential energy from the
stably-stratified layers, and energy loss due to drag. Our findings provide a
physics-based guideline to optimize displacement ventilation.

However, the integration of heterogeneous IoT, edge, and cloud technologies and
the design of end-to-end applications that seamlessly work across multiple

resource management and the need to ensure that the right type and scale of

evolutionary algorithms is the so-called method of fitness levels by Wegener.
It uses a partition of the search space into a sequence of levels which are
traversed by the algorithm in increasing order, possibly skipping levels. An
easy, but often strong upper bound for the run time can then be derived by
adding the reciprocals of the probabilities to leave the levels (or upper
bounds for these). Unfortunately, a similarly effective method for proving
lower bounds has not yet been established. The strongest such method, proposed
by Sudholt (2013), requires a careful choice of the viscosity parameters
$\gamma_{i,j}$, $0 \le i < j \le n$.
  In this paper we present two new variants of the method, one for upper and
one for lower bounds. Besides the level leaving probabilities, they only rely
on the probabilities that levels are visited at all. We show that these can be
computed or estimated without greater difficulties and apply our method to
reprove the following known results in an easy and natural way. (i) The precise
run time of the (1+1) EA on \textsc{LeadingOnes}. (ii) A lower bound for the
run time of the (1+1) EA on \textsc{OneMax}, tight apart from an $O(n)$ term.
(iii) A lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on long $k$-paths. We also
prove a tighter lower bound for the run time of the (1+1) EA on jump functions
by showing that, regardless of the jump size, only with probability $O(2^{-n})$
the algorithm can avoid to jump over the valley of low fitness.

states at the interface with a trivial insulator. In quasi-one-dimensional TI
nanoribbon structures the wave function of surface charges extends
phase-coherently along the perimeter of the nanoribbon, resulting in a
quantization of transverse surface modes. Furthermore, as the inherent
spin-momentum locking results in a Berry phase offset of $\pi$ of
self-interfering charge carriers an energy gap within the surface state
dispersion appears and all states become spin-degenerate. We investigate and
compare the magnetic field dependent surface state dispersion in selectively
deposited Bi$_2$Te$_3$ TI micro- and nanoribbon structures by analysing the
gate voltage dependent magnetoconductance at cryogenic temperatures. While in
wide microribbon devices the field effect mainly changes the amount of bulk
charges close to the top surface we identify coherent transverse surface states
along the perimeter of the nanoribbon devices responding to a change in top
gate potential. We quantify the energetic spacing in between these quantized
transverse subbands by using an electrostatic model that treats an initial
difference in charge carrier densities on the top and bottom surface as well as
remaining bulk charges. In the gate voltage dependent transconductance we find
oscillations that change their relative phase by $\pi$ at half-integer values
of the magnetic flux quantum applied coaxial to the nanoribbon, which is a
signature for a magnetic flux dependent topological phase transition in narrow,
selectively deposited TI nanoribbon devices.

Microcalorimeter gamma spectroscopy is intended to provide nondestructive

the need for sampling, chemical separations, and mass spectrometry to meet
safeguards and security goals. Key milestones were the development of the SOFIA
instrument (Spectrometer Optimized for Facility Integrated Applications) and
the SAPPY software (Spectral Analysis Program in PYthon). SOFIA is a compact
instrument that combines advances in large multiplexed transition-edge sensor
arrays with optimized cryogenic performance to overcome many practical
limitations of previous systems. With a 256-pixel multiplexed detector array
capable of 5000 counts per second, measurement time can be comparable to
high-purity germanium detectors. SAPPY was developed to determine isotopic
ratios in data from SOFIA and other microcalorimeter instruments with an
approach similar to the widely-used FRAM software. SAPPY provides a flexible
framework with rigorous uncertainty analysis for both microcalorimeter and HPGe

of biological forms, from a fertilized egg to a functioning embryo, remains a
central challenge to applied physics and theoretical biology. Rather than refer
to principles of self-organization and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
describe a developing embryo from its active cellular constituents, a purely
geometric theory is constructed that references the properties of the ambient
space that the embryo occupies. In 1975 the Fields laureate Ren\'{e} Thom
developed a system of techniques and local dynamical models that are capable of
reconstructing the local dynamic of an embryo at each new growth event of the
system. Each new growth event (the development of a limb, for example) is a
topological change in the dynamic of the system that can be classified only
according to the properties of space. The local models can be non-conservative
flows with robust attractor behavior that serve as organizing centers for
systems development. Hamiltonian flows can also be considered with novel,
self-reproducing vague attractor behavior. The set of growth events become an
unfolding space related to the differentiable manifold of states. The set of
growth events, which Thom refers to as the catastrophe set, has special
algebraic properties which permit these models to be low dimensional--the local
model contains few parameters. We present Thom's work as a research program
outlining a framework for the construction of these local models, and,
ultimately, the synthesis of these models into a full theoretical description
of a developing biological organism. We give examples of the application of
selected models to key growth events in the process of gastrulation.

an exceptionally high two-pixel spatial resolution of 400km. The size and
duration of small-scale structures is determined in the HRIEUV data, while
their height is estimated from triangulation with the simultaneous SDO/AIA
data. This is the first stereoscopy of small scale brightenings at high
resolution. We observed small localised brightenings (""campfires"") in a quiet
Sun region with lengthscales between 400km and 4000km and durations between 10
and 200s. The smallest and weakest of these HRIEUV brightenings have not been
observed before. Simultaneous HRILYA observations do not show localised
brightening events, but the locations of the HRIEUV events correspond clearly
to the chromospheric network. Comparison with simultaneous AIA images shows
that most events can also be identified in the 17.1nm, 19.3nm, 21.1nm, and
30.4nm passbands of AIA, although they appear weaker and blurred. DEM analysis
indicates coronal temperatures peaking at log(T)~6.1-6.15. We determined the
height of a few campfires, which is between 1000 and 5000km above the
photosphere. We conclude that ""campfires"" are mostly coronal in nature and are
rooted in the magnetic flux concentrations of the chromospheric network. We
interpret these events as a new extension to the flare/microflare/nanoflare
family. Given their low height, the EUI ""campfires"" could be a new element of
the fine structure of the transition region/low corona: apexes of small-scale
loops that are internally heated to coronal temperatures.

unknown parameters which appear in complex models of phenomena in the
biomedical, physical and social sciences. However, model complexity often leads
to parameter-to-data maps which are expensive to evaluate and are only
available through noisy approximations. This paper is concerned with the use of
interacting particle systems for the solution of the resulting inverse problems
for parameters. Of particular interest is the case where the available forward
model evaluations are subject to rapid fluctuations, in parameter space,
superimposed on the smoothly varying large scale parametric structure of
interest. {A motivating example from climate science is presented, and ensemble
Kalman methods (which do not use the derivative of the parameter-to-data map)
are shown, empirically, to perform well. Multiscale analysis is then used to
analyze the behaviour of interacting particle system algorithms when rapid
fluctuations, which we refer to as noise, pollute the large scale parametric
dependence of the parameter-to-data map. Ensemble Kalman methods and
Langevin-based methods} (the latter use the derivative of the parameter-to-data
map) are compared in this light. The ensemble Kalman methods are shown to
behave favourably in the presence of noise in the parameter-to-data map,
whereas Langevin methods are adversely affected. On the other hand, Langevin
methods have the correct equilibrium distribution in the setting of noise-free
forward models, whilst ensemble Kalman methods only provide an uncontrolled
approximation, except in the linear case. Therefore a new class of algorithms,
ensemble Gaussian process samplers, which combine the benefits of both ensemble
Kalman and Langevin methods, are introduced and shown to perform favourably.

associated with electroosmotic flow, the control of which is pivotal in several

consequence of surface charges that alter the ion distribution in the pore
lumen. Here we present a purely geometrical mechanism to induce ionic
selectivity and electroosmotic flow in uncharged nanopores and we tested it via
molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach exploits the accumulation of
charges, driven by an external electric field, in a coaxial cavity that
decorates the membrane close to the pore entrance. The selectivity was shown to
depend on the applied voltage and results to be completely inverted when
reverting the voltage. The simultaneous inversion of ionic selectivity and
electric field direction causes a unidirectional electroosmotic flow. We
developed a quantitatively accurate theoretical model for designing pore
geometry to achieve the desired electroosmotic velocity. Finally, we
demonstrate that unidirectional electroosmosis also occurs for a biological
pore whose structure presents a coaxial cavity surrounding the pore
constriction. The capability to induce ion selectivity without altering the
pore lumen shape or the surface charge may open the way to a more flexible
design of selective membranes.

them to instance segmentation of cells in datasets from different modalities.
In our experiments, we show CPNs that outperform U-Nets and Mask R-CNNs in

suitable for real-time applications. The trained models generalize well across
different domains of cell types. Since the main assumption of the framework are
closed object contours, it is applicable to a wide range of detection problems
also outside the biomedical domain. An implementation of the model architecture

  effect size from a heteroscedastic meta-analysis study",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The DerSimonian-Laird (DL) weighted average method has been widely used for
estimation of a pooled effect size from an aggregated data meta-analysis study.
It is mainly criticized for its underestimation of the standard error of the
pooled effect size in the presence of heterogeneous study effect sizes. The
uncertainty in the estimation of the between-study variance is not accounted
for in the calculation of this standard error. Due to this negative property,
many alternative estimation approaches have been proposed in literature. One
approach was developed by Hardy and Thompson (HT), who implemented a profile
likelihood approach instead of the moment-based approach of DL. Others have
further extended the likelihood approach and proposed higher-order likelihood
inferences (e.g., Bartlett-type corrections). Likelihood-based methods better
address the uncertainty in estimating the between-study variance than the DL
method, but all these methods assume that the within-study standard deviations
are known and equal to the observed standard error of the study effect sizes.
Here we treat the observed standard errors as estimators for the within-study
variability and we propose a bivariate likelihood approach that jointly
estimates the pooled effect size, the between-study variance, and the
potentially heteroscedastic within-study variances. We study the performance of
the proposed method by means of simulation, and compare it to DL, HT, and the
higher-order likelihood methods. Our proposed approach appears to be less
sensitive to the number of studies, and less biased in case of
heteroscedasticity.

Metropolis-Hastings, apply the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to each local

any situation where the observation and state equations are nonlinearly
connected. The other method tends to be faster, but is applied specifically to
binary data (using the probit link function). The performance of these methods
of estimation, in the context of the proposed dynamic Gaussian mixture model,
is evaluated through simulated datasets. Also, an application to an array

are equivariant under the isometry group take into account the symmetry of the
metric space. For some models there exists an optimal equivariant estimator,
which necessarily will perform as well or better than other common equivariant
estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator or the sample Fr\'echet

in a few cases provide explicit expressions for it. In other models the
isometry group is not large enough relative to the parametric family of
distributions for there to exist a minimum risk equivariant estimator. In such

local (instance level) and global (dataset level) methods, such as
Permutational Variable Importance, Shapley Values (SHAP), Local Interpretable
Model Explanations (LIME), Break Down and so on. However, these methods do not
use information about the correlation between features which significantly
reduce the explainability of the model behaviour. In this work, we propose new
methods to support model analysis by exploiting the information about the
correlation between variables. The dataset level aspect importance measure is
inspired by the block permutations procedure, while the instance level aspect
importance measure is inspired by the LIME method. We show how to analyze
groups of variables (aspects) both when they are proposed by the user and when
they should be determined automatically based on the hierarchical structure of
correlations between variables. Additionally, we present the new type of model
visualisation, triplot, which exploits a hierarchical structure of variable
grouping to produce a high information density model visualisation. This
visualisation provides a consistent illustration for either local or global
model and data exploration. We also show an example of real-world data with 5k
instances and 37 features in which a significant correlation between variables
affects the interpretation of the effect of variable importance. The proposed
method is, to our knowledge, the first to allow direct use of the correlation

perspective and performs a comprehensive analysis. Our results show that many
current backdoor attacks exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, which persist
across different datasets and resolutions. We further demonstrate these
high-frequency artifacts enable a simple way to detect existing backdoor
triggers at a detection rate of 98.50% without prior knowledge of the attack
details and the target model. Acknowledging previous attacks' weaknesses, we
propose a practical way to create smooth backdoor triggers without
high-frequency artifacts and study their detectability. We show that existing
defense works can benefit by incorporating these smooth triggers into their
design consideration. Moreover, we show that the detector tuned over stronger
smooth triggers can generalize well to unseen weak smooth triggers. In short,
our work emphasizes the importance of considering frequency analysis when
designing both backdoor attacks and defenses in deep learning.

In
this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive
information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage
problems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data
during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when
class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order
to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the
pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However,
converted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters
have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we
encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule.
Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be
interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN
eliminates data and class leakage issues with a slight performance drop (less
than ~2) and significant energy-efficiency gain (about 55x) compared to the
standard ANN. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including
CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of
privacy-preserving SNN training.

transients. We find that the amount of $^{56}$Ni synthesised in these mergers
grows as a strong function of the WD mass, reaching typically $0.05$ and up to
$0.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ per merger. Photodisintegration leads to similar amounts
of $^4$He and about a ten times smaller amount of $^1$H. The nuclear yields
from these mergers, in particular those of $^{55}$Mn, may contribute
significantly to Galactic chemical evolution. The transients expected from ONe
WD-NS mergers are dominantly red/infrared, evolve on month-long timescales and
reach bolometric magnitudes of up to -16.5. The current surveys must have
already detected these transients or are, alternatively, putting strong
constraints on merger scenarios. The properties of the expected transients from
WD-NS mergers best agree with faint type Iax supernovae. The Vera Rubin

find that the likely main challenge has been effectively modelling the nuclear
statistical equilibrium regime in such mergers.

efficiency is reached close to a condition of flow separation, which makes its
prediction very crucial in industry. Providing that wall-based quantities can
be measured, we know today how to obtain good predictions for two and
three-dimensional steady and periodic flows. In these flows, the separation is
defined on a fixed line attached to a material surface. The last case to
elucidate is the one where this line is no longer attached to the wall but on
the contrary is contained within the flow. This moving separation is probably,
however, the most common case of separation in natural flows and industrial
applications. Since this case has received less attention during the past few
years, we propose in this study to examine some properties of moving separation
in two-dimensional, unsteady flows where the separation does not leave a
signature on the wall. Since in this framework separation can be extracted by
using a Lagrangian frame where the separation profile can be viewed as a
hyperbolic unstable manifold, we propose a method to extract the separation
point defined by the Lagrangian saddle point that belongs to this unstable
manifold. In practice, the separation point and profile are initially extracted
by detecting the most attracting Lagrangian coherent structure near the wall,
and can then be advected in time for following instants. It is found that
saddle points, which initially act as separation points in the viscous wall
flow region, remarkably preserve their hyperbolicity even if they are ejected
from the wall toward the inviscid region. Two test cases are studied, the
creeping flow of a rotating and translating cylinder close to a wall, and the
unsteady separation in the boundary layer generated by a planar jet impinging
onto a plane wall.

space-based gravitational-wave detectors. In recent work, tidal resonances in
binary orbital evolution induced by the tidal field of nearby stars or black
holes have been identified as being potentially significant in the context of
extreme mass-ratio inspirals. These resonances occur when the three orbital
frequencies describing the orbit are commensurate. During the resonance, the
orbital parameters of the small body experience a jump leading to a shift in
the phase of the gravitational waveform. In this paper, we treat the tidal
perturber as stationary and restricted to the equatorial plane, and present a
first study of how common and important such resonances are over the entire
orbital parameter space. We find that a large proportion of inspirals encounter
a low-order resonance in the observationally important regime. While the
instantaneous effect of a tidal resonance is small, its effect on the
accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI system can be
significant due to its many cycles in band; we estimate that the effect is
detectable for a significant fraction of sources. We also provide fitting
formulae for the induced change in the constants of motion of the orbit due to
the tidal resonance for several low-order resonances.

independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as
pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors,
under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of

pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in
the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and
in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The
constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated
pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules

Presenting two new Petri net slicing algorithms to isolate those places and
transitions of a Petri net (the slice) that may contribute tokens to one or
more places given (the slicing criterion). Method: The two algorithms proposed
are formalized. The maximality of the first algorithm and the minimality of the
second algorithm are formally proven. Both algorithms, together with three
other state-of-the-art algorithms, have been implemented and integrated into a
single tool so that we have been able to carry out a fair empirical evaluation.
Results: Besides the two new Petri net slicing algorithms, a public, free, and

empirical evaluation of the new algorithms and the slices they produce are also
presented. Conclusions: The first algorithm collects all places and transitions
that may contribute tokens (in any computation) to the slicing criterion, while
the second algorithm collects the places and transitions needed to fire the
shortest transition sequence that contributes tokens to some place in the
slicing criterion. Therefore, the net computed by the first algorithm can
reproduce any computation that contributes tokens to any place of interest. In
contrast, the second algorithm loses this possibility, but it often produces a
much more reduced subnet (which still can reproduce some computations that
contribute tokens to some places of interest). The first algorithm is proven
maximal, and the second one is proven minimal.

recast in terms of special functions. Until now all known formulas for the
partition function in terms of special functions have been restricted to the
important special case of the isotropic Ising model with symmetric couplings.
Indeed, the anisotropic model is more challenging because there are two
couplings and hence two reduced temperatures, one for each of the two axes of
the square lattice. Hence, standard special functions of one variable are
inadequate to the task. Here, we reformulate the partition function of the
anisotropic Ising model in terms of the Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function, which is
a double hypergeometric function in two variables that is more general than the
Appell hypergeometric functions. Finally, we present hypergeometric formulas

universe remains elusive, mainly due to the observational difficulty in
accessing the Lyman continuum (LyC) at these redshifts. It is thus important to
identify low-redshift LyC-leaking galaxies that can be used as laboratories to
investigate the physical processes that allow LyC photons to escape. The
weakness of the [S II] nebular emission lines relative to typical star-forming
galaxies has been proposed as a LyC predictor. In this paper, we show that the
[S II]-deficiency is an effective method to select LyC-leaking candidates using
data from the Low-redshift LyC Survey, which has detected flux below the Lyman
edge in 35 out of 66 star-forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that LyC leakers tend to be more [S
II]-deficient and that the fraction of their detections increases as [S
II]-deficiency becomes more prominent. Correlational studies suggest that [S
II]-deficiency complements other LyC diagnostics (such as strong Lyman-$\alpha$
emission and high [O III]/[O II]). Our results verify an additional technique
by which reionization-era galaxies could be studied.

to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth

our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our

a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling
analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small
pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the
best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct
rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline

analysis technique used to determine the chemical composition of target

Recently, there has been a rise in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques
for LIBS data processing. However, ML for LIBS is challenging as: (i) the
predictive models must be lightweight since they need to be deployed in highly
resource-constrained and battery-operated portable LIBS systems; and (ii) since
these systems can be remote, the models must be able to self-adapt to any
domain shift in input distributions which could be due to the lack of different
types of inputs in training data or dynamic environmental/sensor noise. This
on-device retraining of model should not only be fast but also unsupervised due
to the absence of new labeled data in remote LIBS systems. We introduce a
lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for LIBS that can be adapted
on-device without requiring labels for new input data. It shows 89.3% average
accuracy during data streaming, and up to 2.1% better accuracy compared to an
MLP model that does not support adaptation. Finally, we also characterize the

material that each stockpile provides to a given parcel is dependent on a set
of mine schedule conditions and customer demands. Therefore, the problem can be
formulated as a continuous optimization problem. In the real-world application,
there are several constraints required to guarantee parcels that meet the
demand of downstream customers. It is a challenge in solving the stockpile
blending problems since its scale can be very large. We introduce two repaired
operators for the problems to convert the infeasible solutions into the
solutions without violating the two tight constraints. Besides, we introduce a
multi-component fitness function for solving the large-scale stockpile blending
problem which can maximize the volume of metal over the plan and maintain the
balance between stockpiles according to the usage of metal. Furthermore, we
investigate the well-known approach in this paper, which is used to solve
optimization problems over continuous space, namely the differential evolution
(DE) algorithm. The experimental results show that the DE algorithm combined

attention as a computationally fast tool to study dynamical processes in warm

typically, employ many approximations to achieve computational efficiency while
implementing semi-empirical scaling parameters to retain accuracy. We
investigate three of the main approximations ubiquitous to WPMD: a restricted
basis set, approximations to exchange, and the lack of correlation. We examine
each of these approximations in atomic and molecular hydrogen in addition to a
dense hydrogen plasma. We find that the biggest improvement to WPMD comes from
combining a two Gaussian basis with a semi-empirical correction based on the
valence-bond wave function. A single parameter scales this correction to match
experimental pressures of dense hydrogen. Ultimately, we find that
semi-empirical scaling parameters are necessary to correct for the main
approximations in WPMD. However, reducing the scaling parameters for more
ab-initio terms gives more accurate results and displays the underlying physics
more readily.

Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component analysis, in the

projected data. While much work has been done in developing new indexes in the
literature, less has been done on understanding the optimisation. Index
functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima as well as an optimal
maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection frames, which
complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used
for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful. The
guided tour is especially useful for exploration, because it conducts geodesic
interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected
data changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual
diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation procedure, based on the
provision of a new data object which collects information throughout the
optimisation. It has helped to diagnose and fix several problems with

RIS-based communication systems' practical implementation may face challenges

degrees of the incoming light incidence angle, the proposed LCoS design has
minimal RIS depth, implying less LC's material. The performance results show
that the number of bit per unit bandwidth is upper-bounded and grows with the

the heavy ions are identified with the conditions where only the traversing
heavy ion's initial total mass is different. Our work has demonstrated that a
difference in the initial total mass of the moving heavy ions is able to induce
completely different collective behaviors of the plasma. The simulation is
performed via the hybrid model, in which the ions and electrons are treated as
classical particles and mass-less fluid, respectively. Due to the imbalance of
the electric and magnetic force on the heavy ions, these particles will evolve
into different collective patterns at the later time. These patterns manifest a
rather different stopping behavior of the moving ions and an opposite drifting
direction of the electron fluid at the rim of the expanding plasma. Further
numerical and analytical calculations show that the imbalance depends not only
on the number densities of the plasma ions, but also on the spatial variations
of the magnetic fields. Our work reveals that the collective behavior of the

deterministic integrable systems). More specifically, the article starts with a
survey of results for the four basic beta-gamma models (i.e. the inverse-gamma,
gamma, inverse-beta and beta random polymers), highlighting how the maps

that, unlike in the positive-temperature case, the change of variables required
is degenerate in general, and so whilst the argument yields stationary
solutions, it does not provide a complete characterisation of them. On the
other hand, this degeneracy does allow us to explain the appearance of atoms in
the stationary measures of certain zero-temperature models. We also derive from

surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where a
distributed IRS enabled NOMA transmission framework is proposed to serve users
securely in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Considering that
eavesdropper's instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is challenging to
acquire in practice, we utilize secrecy outage probability (SOP) as the
security metric. A problem of maximizing the minimum secrecy rate among users,
subject to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding constraints
and SOP constraints, by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming at the BS and
phase shifts of IRSs, is formulated. For special case with a single-antenna BS,
we derive the exact closed-form SOP expressions and propose a novel
ring-penalty based successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to design
power allocation and phase shifts jointly. While for the more general and
challenging case with a multi-antenna BS, we adopt the Bernstein-type
inequality to approximate the SOP constraints by a deterministic convex form.
To proceed, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed
to solve the considered problem. Numerical results validate the advantages of
the proposed algorithms over the baseline schemes. Particularly, two
interesting phenomena on distributed IRS deployment are revealed: 1) the
secrecy rate peak is achieved only when distributed IRSs share the reflecting
elements equally; and 2) the distributed IRS deployment does not always
outperform the centralized IRS deployment, due to the tradeoff between the
number of IRSs and the reflecting elements equipped at each IRS.

David Cohen-Steiner, Weihao Kong, Christian Sohler, and Gregory Valiant (2018),
which obtains a solution with runtime independent of $n$, but exponential in
$1/\epsilon$. We conjecture that the trade-off between dimension dependence and
accuracy is inherent.
  Our method is simple and works well experimentally. It is based on a
Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method that employees randomized
estimators for the matrix trace. We prove that, for any Hermitian $A$, this
moment matching method returns an $\epsilon$ approximation to the spectral
density using just $O({1}/{\epsilon})$ matrix-vector products with $A$. By
leveraging stability properties of the Chebyshev polynomial three-term
recurrence, we then prove that the method is amenable to the use of coarse
approximate matrix-vector products. Our sublinear time algorithm follows from
combining this result with a novel sampling algorithm for approximating
matrix-vector products with a normalized graph adjacency matrix.
  Of independent interest, we show a similar result for the widely used

presented GTA, a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection

but few antiferromagnets show large strain induced by a magnetic field. On the
basis of linear strain measurements of sintered samples of triangular
antiferromagnet ACrS2 (A = Cu, Ag, and Au) in magnetic fields up to 9 T, the
AgCrS2 sample was found to show a large strain, yielding a large volume change
over 700 ppm, which is one of the largest volume changes measured to date for
an antiferromagnet. This large strain appeared only at the N\'eel temperature
of 42 K and was not restored to its initial state when the applied magnetic
field was decreased to zero; however, it was initialized by cooling the sample
to far below the N\'eel temperature. These results suggest that the coexistence
of magnetically ordered and paramagnetic phases at the first-order phase
transition plays an important role. AuCrS2 showed a magnetic-field-induced
strain with similar features, although it was smaller than that in AgCrS2.

dimensional elastic scattering based on the Helmholtz decomposition of elastic

Helmholtz and Maxwell equations. An FFT-accelerated separation of variables
solver is proposed to efficiently invert boundary integral formulations of the
coupled system for elastic scattering from axisymmetric rigid bodies. In
particular, by combining the regularization properties of the singular boundary
integral operators and the FFT-based fast evaluation of modal Green's
functions, our numerical solver can rapidly solve the resulting integral
equations with a high-order accuracy. Several numerical examples are provided
to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, including

presented to validate its asymptotic preserving property. A hybrid strategy to
compute the nonlinear weights in the HWENO reconstruction is introduced to save
computational cost. Extensive one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments
are performed to verify the accuracy, asymptotic preserving property and

Specifically, the platform knows more information regarding worker average

Workers will utilize the announced information to determine the likelihood that

than regular pulses from these sources. The only GRP-associated emission
outside radio wavelengths is from the Crab Pulsar, where optical emission is
enhanced by a few percent during GRPs. We observed the Crab Pulsar
simultaneously at X-ray and radio wavelengths, finding enhancement of the X-ray

in-network optimization. The network first parameterizes the face rig as a
compact latent code with a neural decoder, and then estimates the latent code

personalized face rig, our method goes beyond static reconstructions and
enables downstream applications such as video retargeting. In-network
optimization explicitly enforces constraints derived from the first principles,
thus introduces additional priors than regression-based methods. Finally,
data-driven priors from deep learning are utilized to constrain the ill-posed
monocular setting and ease the optimization difficulty. Experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy, reasonable robustness

transferable in black box environments, allowing an adversary to attack
multiple deep learning models with a single perturbation crafted for a

receiver architecture to mitigate the effects of adversarial interference in
various black box attack environments. We begin by evaluating the architecture
uncertainty environment, where we show that adversarial attacks crafted to fool
specific AMC DL architectures are not directly transferable to different DL

show that adversarial attacks crafted on time domain and frequency domain

we develop our Assorted Deep Ensemble (ADE) defense, which is an ensemble of

obtains substantial improvements in AMC classification performance compared

with tunable coupler architectures, which reduce always-on residual couplings.
Using these techniques, we demonstrate iSWAP and CZ gates between two qubits
coupled via a tunable coupler with average process fidelities as high as
$99.3\%$ and $97.9\%$, respectively. The flexibility in activating
parametric-resonance gates combined with a tunable coupler architecture

magnetization reversal switching field of a bar nanomagnet usually rely on
modifying its aspect ratio, such as its length, width and/or thickness. Here,
we show that the switching field of a bar nanomagnet saturates when extending

approaches discards the contextual information of images which are strong cues
for 3D pose estimation. Meanwhile, some other methods predict the joints
directly from monocular images but adopt a 2.5D output representation $P^{2.5D}

root-relative 3D space. Thus, the ground-truth information (e.g., the depth of
root joint from the camera) is normally utilized to transform the 2.5D output
to the 3D space, which limits the applicability in practice. In this work, we
propose a novel end-to-end framework that not only exploits the contextual

first argue for a change in how AL algorithms should be evaluated. Although
unlabeled data is readily available in pool-based AL, AL algorithms are usually
evaluated by measuring the increase in supervised learning (SL) performance at

the classifier's uncertainty on unlabeled data and penalizes redundant samples

impressive performance due to the powerful representation extracted using deep
neural networks while prioritizing categorical separability. However,
self-reconstruction loss of an AE ignores rich useful relation information and
might lead to indiscriminative representation, which inevitably degrades the
clustering performance. It is also challenging to learn high-level similarity
without feeding semantic labels. Another unsolved problem facing DSC is the
huge memory cost due to $n\times n$ similarity matrix, which is incurred by the
self-expression layer between an encoder and decoder. To tackle these problems,
we use pairwise similarity to weigh the reconstruction loss to capture local
structure information, while a similarity is learned by the self-expression
layer. Pseudo-graphs and pseudo-labels, which allow benefiting from uncertain
knowledge acquired during network training, are further employed to supervise
similarity learning. Joint learning and iterative training facilitate to obtain
an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. By combining with the $k$-nearest
neighbors algorithm, we further show that our method can address the
large-scale and out-of-sample problems.

and emergence processes of the solar magnetic field. Previous studies on the
size distribution have primarily focused on either the whole group or
individual spot areas. In this paper, we investigate the organization of spot
areas within sunspot groups. In particular, we analyze the ratio, $\rm{R}$, of
the area of the biggest spot ($\rm{A_{big\_spot}}$) inside a group, to the
total area of that group ($\rm{A_{group}}$). We use sunspot observations from
Kislovodsk, Pulkovo and Debrecen observatories, together covering solar cycles
17 to 24. We find that at the time when the group area reaches its maximum, the
single biggest spot in a group typically occupies about 60% of the group area.
For half of all groups, $\rm R$ lies in the range between roughly 50% and 70%.
We also find R to change with the group area, $\rm{A_{group}}$, such that
$\rm{R}$ reaches a maximum of about 0.65 for groups with $\rm{A_{group}}\approx
200\mu$Hem and then remains at about 0.6 for lager groups. Our findings imply a
scale invariant emergence pattern, providing an observational constraint on the
emergence process. Furthermore, extrapolation of our results to larger sunspot
groups may have a bearing on the giant unresolved starspot features found in
Doppler images of highly active sun-like stars. Our results suggest that such
giant features are composed of multiple spots, with the largest spot occupying
roughly 55--75% of the total group area (i.e. of the area of the giant
starspots seen in Doppler images).

requires huge iterations before the generator's providing good-quality samples.
Although there are several studies to tackle this problem, there is still no
universal solution. In this paper, we investigated the effect of sample mixing
methods, that is, Mixup, CutMix, and newly proposed Smoothed Regional Mix
(SRMix), to alleviate this problem. The sample-mixing methods are known to
enhance the accuracy and robustness in the wide range of classification
problems, and can naturally be applicable to GANs because the role of the
discriminator can be interpreted as the classification between real and fake
samples. We also proposed a new formalism applying the sample-mixing methods to
GANs with the saturated losses which do not have a clear ""label"" of real and
fake. We performed a vast amount of numerical experiments using LSUN and CelebA
datasets. The results showed that Mixup and SRMix improved the quality of the
generated images in terms of FID in most cases, in particular, SRMix showed the
best improvement in most cases. Our analysis indicates that the mixed-samples
can provide different properties from the vanilla fake samples, and the mixing
pattern strongly affects the decision of the discriminators. The generated
images of Mixup have good high-level feature but low-level feature is not so
impressible. On the other hand, CutMix showed the opposite tendency. Our SRMix
showed the middle tendency, that is, showed good high and low level features.
We believe that our finding provides a new perspective to accelerate the GANs
convergence and improve the quality of generated samples.

observations of the atomic-${\rm [CI]}$(1-0) and molecular-$^{12}$CO(1-0)
emission lines at the spatial resolution of $\approx0.3$"" (or $\approx$ 100
pc). These emissions reveal that NGC7469 hosts a circumnuclear gas disc (CND)
with a ring-like structure and a two-arm/bi-symmetric spiral pattern within it,
surrounded by a starbursting ring. The CND has a relatively low
$\sigma/V\approx0.35$ ($r\sim0.5$"") and $\sim0.19$ ($r>0.5""$), suggesting that
the gas is dynamically settled and suitable for dynamically deriving the mass
of its central source. As is expected from X-ray dominated region (XDR) effects
that dramatically increase an atomic carbon abundance by dissociating CO
molecules, we suggest that the atomic [CI](1-0) emission is a better probe of
SMBH masses than CO emission in AGNs. Our dynamical model using the ${\rm
[CI]}$(1-0) kinematics yields a $M_{\rm

F547M}=2.25^{+0.40}_{-0.43}$ (M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$). The model using the CO(1-0)
kinematics also gives a consistent $M_{\rm BH}$ with a larger uncertainty, up
to an order of magnitude, i.e.\ $M_{\rm
BH}=1.60^{+11.52}_{-1.45}\times10^7$M$_\odot$. This newly dynamical $M_{\rm
BH}$ is $\approx$ 2 times higher than the mass determined from the
reverberation mapped (RM) method using emissions arising in the unresolved
broad-line region (BLR). Given this new $M_{\rm BH}$, we are able to constrain
the specific RM dimensionless scaling factor of $f=7.2^{+4.2}_{-3.4}$ for the
AGN BLR in NGC7469. The gas within the unresolved BLR thus has a Keplerian
virial velocity component and the inclination of
$i\approx11.0^\circ$$_{-2.5}^{+2.2}$, confirming its face-on orientation in a
Seyfert 1 AGN by assuming a geometrically thin BLR model.

layout, we propose to exploit the local correlation module to model the
topological relationship between targets and their surrounding environment,
which can enhance the discriminative power of our model in crowded scenes.
Specifically, we establish dense correspondences of each spatial location and
its context, and explicitly constrain the correlation volumes through
self-supervised learning. To exploit the temporal context, existing approaches
generally utilize two or more adjacent frames to construct an enhanced feature
representation, but the dynamic motion scene is inherently difficult to depict
via CNNs. Instead, our paper proposes a learnable correlation operator to
establish frame-to-frame matches over convolutional feature maps in the
different layers to align and propagate temporal context. With extensive

effectiveness of correlation learning with the superior performance and obtains

vision. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness after cataract, but
glaucoma being more dangerous as it is not curable. Early diagnoses and
treatment of glaucoma can help to slow the progression of glaucoma and its
damages. For the detection of glaucoma, the Cup to Disc ratio (CDR) provides
significant information. The CDR depends heavily on the accurate segmentation
of cup and disc regions. In this paper, we have proposed a modified M-Net with
bidirectional convolution long short-term memory (LSTM), based on joint cup and
disc segmentation. The proposed network combines features of encoder and
decoder, with bidirectional LSTM. Our proposed model segments cup and disc
regions based on which the abnormalities in cup to disc ratio can be observed.

investigating solar and heliospheric physics using a payload of instruments
designed for both remote and in-situ sensing. Similar to the recently launched
Parker Solar Probe, and unlike earlier missions, Solar Orbiter carries
instruments designed to measure the low frequency DC electric fields. In this
paper we assess the quality of the low-frequency DC electric field measured by
the Radio and Plasma Waves instrument (RPW) on Solar Orbiter. In particular we
investigate the possibility of using Solar Orbiter's DC electric and magnetic
field data to estimate the solar wind speed. We use deHoffmann-Teller (HT)
analysis based on measurements of the electric and magnetic fields to find the
velocity of solar wind current sheets which minimizes a single component of the
electric field. By comparing the HT velocity to proton velocity measured by the
Proton and Alpha particle Sensor (PAS) we develop a simple model for the
effective antenna length, $L_\text{eff}$ of the E-field probes. We then use the
HT method to estimate the speed of the solar wind. Using the HT method, we find
that the observed variations in $E_y$ are often in excellent agreement with the
variations in the magnetic field. The magnitude of $E_y$, however, is uncertain
due to the fact that the $L_\text{eff}$ depends on the plasma environment. We
derive an empirical model relating $L_\text{eff}$ to the Debye length, which we
can use to improve the estimate of $E_y$ and consequently the estimated solar
wind speed. The low frequency electric field provided by RPW is of high
quality. Using deHoffmann-Teller analysis, Solar Orbiter's magnetic and
electric field measurements can be used to estimate the solar wind speed when
plasma data is unavailable.

ubiquitous in biotechnology and medical diagnostics today. The development and
optimization of these assays generally focuses on three aspects: immobilization
chemistry, ligand-receptor interaction and concentrations of ligands, buffers
and sample. A fourth aspect, the transport of the analyte to the surface, is
more rarely delved into during assay design and analysis. Improving transport
is generally limited to the agitation of reagents, a mode of flow generation
inherently difficult to control, often resulting in inconsistent reaction

role of transport becomes decisive. This perspective develops an intuitive and
practical understanding of transport in conventional agitation systems and in
microfluidics, the latter underpinning many new life science technologies. We
give rules of thumb to guide the user on system behavior, such as advection
regimes and shear stress, and derive estimates for relevant quantities that

the simple case of equal mass collisions of two Earth-like $0.5\,M_\oplus$
proto-planets showing that the choice of EOS has a profound impact on the
outcome of such collisions as well as on the numerical convergence with
resolution. In simulations where the Tillotson EOS is used, impacts generate an
excess amount of vapour due to the lack of a thermodynamically consistent
treatment of phase transitions and mixtures. In oblique collisions this
enhances the artificial angular momentum (AM) transport from the planet to the
circum-planetary disc reducing the planet's rotation period over time. Even at
a resolution of $1.3 \times 10^6$ particles the result is not converged. In
head-on collisions the lack of a proper treatment of the solid/liquid-vapour
phase transition allows the bound material to expand to very low densities
which in turn results in very slow numerical convergence of the critical
specific impact energy for catastrophic disruption $Q_{RD}^*$ with increasing
resolution as reported in prior work. The simulations where ANEOS is used for
oblique impacts are already converged at a modest resolution of $10^5$
particles, while head-on collisions converge when they evidence the post-shock
formation of a dense iron-rich ring, which promotes gravitational
re-accumulation of material. Once sufficient resolution is reached to resolve
the liquid-vapour phase transition of iron in the ANEOS case, and this ring is
resolved, the value of $Q_{RD}^*$ has then converged.

on using a single photon as a measured system. However, we find that using weak
coherent light instead of a single photon can also amplify the mirror's
position displacement of one photon. In the WVA regime (Weak Value
Amplification regime), the weak value of one photon can lie outside the
eigenvalue spectrum, proportional to the difference of the mirror's position
displacement between the successful and failed postselection and its successful
postselection probability is dependent of the mean photon number of the
coherent light and improved by adjusting it accordingly. Outside the WVA
regime, the amplification limit can reach the level of the vacuum fluctuations,
and when the mean photon number and the optomechanical coupling parameter are
selected appropriately, its successful postselection probability becomes
higher, which is beneficial to observe the maximum amplification value under
the current experimental conditions. This result breaks the constraint that it
is difficult to detect outside the WVA regime. This opens up a new regime for
the study of a single photon nonlinearity in optomechanical system.

with rapidly changing dynamics, an equidistant discretization is often
inadvisable as it either results in prohibitively large errors or computational
effort. To this end, adaptive schemes, such as solvers based on Runge--Kutta
pairs, have been developed which adapt the step size based on local error
estimations at each step. While the classical schemes apply very generally and
are highly efficient on regular systems, they can behave sub-optimal when an
inefficient step rejection mechanism is triggered by structurally complex
systems such as chaotic systems. To overcome these issues, we propose a method
to tailor numerical schemes to the problem class at hand. This is achieved by
combining simple, classical quadrature rules or ODE solvers with data-driven
time-stepping controllers. Compared with learning solution operators to ODEs
directly, it generalises better to unseen initial data as our approach employs
classical numerical schemes as base methods. At the same time it can make use
of identified structures of a problem class and, therefore, outperforms
state-of-the-art adaptive schemes. Several examples demonstrate superior

resolution in the context of super-advanced alien civilizations. In this sense
it can be regarded as to be the weak Fermi paradox (WFP). By assuming that
superadvanced extraterrestrials (ET) exist and are capable of constructing a
huge ring-like megastructure around a pulsar or a main sequence star (MSS) to
consume its emitted energy, we consider the stability problem of the ring,
studying the out of plane dynamics. It has been shown that for normal pulsars
the oscillation timescale, thus the timescale of the spectral variability is of
the order of several days, whereas for MSS it can vary from minutes up to
hundreds of years. We have shown that by means of the high resolving power and
sensitivity, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope can
detect either cold ($T=300$ K) or hot ($T=4000$ K) megastructures throughout
the whole galaxy even for very small oscillation amplitudes of rings. As it is
shown the observed variability can have characteristics similar to those of
some other variables, which can be considered as one of the resolutions of the
WFP.

magnetic flux ropes from solar eruptions. The twist of magnetic field lines
around the rope axis reveals information about flux rope formation processes
and geoeffectivity. During propagation, MC flux ropes may erode via
reconnection with the ambient solar wind. Any erosion reduces the magnetic flux
and helicity of the ropes, and changes their cross-sectional twist profiles.
This study relates twist profiles in MC flux ropes observed at 1 AU to the
amount of erosion undergone by the MCs in interplanetary space. The twist
profiles of two well-identified MC flux ropes associated with the clear
appearance of post eruption arcades in the solar corona are analysed. To infer
the amount of erosion, the magnetic flux content of the ropes in the solar
atmosphere is estimated, and compared to estimates at 1 AU. The first MC shows
a monotonically decreasing twist from the axis to periphery, while the second
displays high twist at the axis, rising twist near the edges, and lower twist
in between. The first MC displays a larger reduction in magnetic flux between
the Sun and 1 AU, suggesting more erosion, than that seen in the second MC. In
the second cloud, rising twist at the rope edges may have been due to an
envelope of overlying coronal field lines with relatively high twist, formed by
reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope in the low corona. This high-twist
envelope remained almost intact from the Sun to 1 AU due to the low erosion
levels. In contrast, the high-twist envelope of the first cloud may have been
entirely peeled away via erosion by the time it reaches 1 AU.

becomes a useful method due to not only its ability to recognize patterns but
also its statistical excellency to examine the amount of information carried by
different types of data inputs. Among possible data types, entanglement-related
quantities, such as Majorana correlation matrices (MCMs), one-particle
entanglement spectra (OPES), and entanglement eigenvectors (OPEEs), have been
proved effective, however, are to date mostly restricted to one dimension.
Here, we propose practical input data forms based on those quantities to study
TPTs and to compare the efficiency of each form on classic two-dimensional
chiral $p$-wave superconductors via the deep learning approach. First, we find
that different input forms, either matrices or tensors both originated from
real MCMs, can affect the precise locations of the predicted transition points.
Next, due to the complex nature of OPEEs, we extract three spatially dependent
quantities from OPEEs, one related to the ""intensity"", and the other two
related to ""phases"" of particle and hole components. We show that similar to
taking OPES directly as inputs, solely using ""intensity"" quantity can only
distinguish topological phases from trivial ones, whereas using either whole
MCMs or complete OPEE-extracted quantities can provide sufficient information
for deep learning to distinguish between phases of matter with different $U(1)$
gauges or Chern numbers. Finally, we discuss certain characteristic features in
the deep learning approach and, in particular, they reveal that our trained
models indeed learn physically meaningful features, which confirms the
potential use even at high dimensions.

initial dislocation sources. In the condition of comparably large pillar size
and abundant initial mobile dislocations, overall yield and flow stresses are
controlled by the longest, available mobile dislocation. An inverse correlation
of the yield and flow stresses with the length of the longest dislocation is
established, and its extrapolation agrees well with experimental yield stress
data. The experimentally reported subtle differences in yield and flow stresses
between pillars with and without the twin boundary are thus likely related to
the maximum lengths of the mobile dislocations. In the condition of comparably
small pillar size, for which a reduction of mobile dislocations during heat
treatment and mechanical loading occurs, the mechanical response of pillars
with and without the twin boundary can be clearly distinguished. Dislocation
starvation during deformation is more clearly present in pillars without the
twin boundary than in pillars with the twin boundary because the twin boundary
acts as a pinning surface for the dislocation network.

Unfortunately, many of these publications do not make neither the code nor the

reproducibility issues and dubious model comparisons. For that reason, and
following a recent code of best practices for reporting experimental results,
we present an extensive study of the state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures for the segmentation of mitochondria on EM volumes, and evaluate
the impact in performance of different variations of 2D and 3D U-Net-like
models for this task. To better understand the contribution of each component,
a common set of pre- and post-processing operations has been implemented and
tested with each approach. Moreover, an exhaustive sweep of hyperparameters
values for all architectures have been performed and each configuration has
been run multiple times to report the mean and standard deviation values of the
evaluation metrics. Using this methodology, we found very stable architectures
and hyperparameter configurations that consistently obtain state-of-the-art
results in the well-known EPFL Hippocampus mitochondria segmentation dataset.
Furthermore, we have benchmarked our proposed models on two other available

much research attention in searching for novel methods for attack-resilient

have been shown to be capable of bypassing bad data detection (BDD), while
arbitrarily compromising the integrity of state estimators and robust
controller even with very sparse measurements corruption. Moreover, based on
the inherent sparsity of pragmatic attack signals, $\ell_1$-minimization scheme
has been used extensively to improve the design of attack-resilient estimators.
For this, the theoretical maximum for the percentage of compromised nodes that
can be accommodated has been shown to be $50\%$. In order to guarantee correct
state recoveries for larger percentage of attacked nodes, researchers have
begun to incorporate prior information into the underlying resilient observer
design framework. For the most pragmatic cases, this prior information is often
obtained through some data-driven machine learning process. Existing results
have shown strong positive correlation between the tolerated attack percentages
and the precision of the prior information. In this paper, we present a pruning
method to improve the precision of the prior information, given corresponding
stochastic uncertainty characteristics of the underlying machine learning
model. Then a weighted $\ell_1$-minimization is proposed based on the pruned
prior. The theoretical and simulation results show that the pruning method
significantly improves the observer performance for much larger attack
percentages, even when moderately accurate machine learning model used.

intra-connected and loosely inter-connected structures containing query
vertices. Attributed Community Search (ACS), a related problem, is more
challenging since it finds communities with both cohesive structures and
homogeneous vertex attributes. However, most methods for the CS task rely on
inflexible pre-defined structures and studies for ACS treat each attribute
independently. Moreover, the most popular ACS strategies decompose ACS into two
separate sub-problems, i.e., the CS task and subsequent attribute filtering
task. However, in real-world graphs, the community structure and the vertex
attributes are closely correlated to each other. This correlation is vital for
the ACS problem. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Network models for both
CS and ACS problems, i.e., Query Driven-GNN and Attributed Query Driven-GNN. In
QD-GNN, we combine the local query-dependent structure and global graph
embedding. In order to extend QD-GNN to handle attributes, we model vertex
attributes as a bipartite graph and capture the relation between attributes by
constructing GNNs on this bipartite graph. With a Feature Fusion operator,
AQD-GNN processes the structure and attribute simultaneously and predicts
communities according to each attributed query. Experiments on real-world
graphs with ground-truth communities demonstrate that the proposed models
outperform existing CS and ACS algorithms in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. More recently, an interactive setting for CS is proposed that
allows users to adjust the predicted communities. We further verify our
approaches under the interactive setting and extend to the attributed context.
Our method achieves 2.37% and 6.29% improvements in F1-score than the
state-of-the-art model without attributes and with attributes respectively.

user. To do so really good results are obtained by dynamic analysis of
software, but it requires complex environments. In order to achieve the same
level of precision we analyze the machine code and investigate the frequencies
of ngrams of opcodes in order to detect singular code blocks. This allow us to
construct a database of infected code blocks. Then, because attacker may modify
and organized differently the infected injected code in their new malware, we
perform not only a semantic comparison of the tested software with the database
of infected code blocks but also a structured comparison. To do such comparison
we compute subgraph isomorphism. It allows us to characterize precisely if the
tested software is a malware and if so in witch family it belongs. Our method
is tested both on a laboratory database and a set of real data. It achieves an
almost perfect detection rate.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) end-to-end (E2E) models have
drawn more and more attention in the field of automatic speech recognition
(ASR). AED models, however, still have drawbacks when deploying in commercial
applications. Autoregressive beam search decoding makes it inefficient for
high-concurrency applications. It is also inconvenient to integrate external
word-level language models. The most important thing is that AED models are
difficult for streaming recognition due to global attention mechanism. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework, namely WNARS, using hybrid CTC-attention
AED models and weighted finite-state transducers (WFST) to solve these problems
together. We switch from autoregressive beam search to CTC branch decoding,
which performs first-pass decoding with WFST in chunk-wise streaming way. The
decoder branch then performs second-pass rescoring on the generated hypotheses
non-autoregressively. On the AISHELL-1 task, our WNARS achieves a character
error rate of 5.22% with 640ms latency, to the best of our knowledge, which is
the state-of-the-art performance for online ASR. Further experiments on our
10,000-hour Mandarin task show the proposed method achieves more than 20%
improvements with 50% latency compared to a strong TDNN-BLSTM lattice-free MMI
baseline.

the human visual system. It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on
segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the
preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed
at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules.
This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to
effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper,
we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two
positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data,
instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel
perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall
answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge
of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual
question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by
generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution
is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each
generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow
insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual
organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping
network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our
agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines. A human study
however indicates that ours uses astronomically more data to learn when
compared to an average human, necessitating future research (with or without
our dataset).

$C$: given access to $C$, determine whether it implements a unitary that is
$a$-close or $b$-far from a subgroup $\mathcal{G}$ of the unitary group. It
encompasses the problem of exact testing, property testing and tolerant
testing. In this work, we study these problems with the group $\mathcal{G}$ as
the trivial subgroup (i.e. identity testing) or the Pauli or Clifford group and
their $q$-ary extension, and a $\textit{promise}$ version of these problems
where $C$ is promised to be in some subgroup of the unitaries that contains
$\mathcal{G}$ (e.g. identity testing for Clifford circuits).
  Our main result is an equivalence between Pauli testing, Clifford testing and
Identity testing. We derive the equivalence between Clifford and Identity
testing by showing a structural property of the Clifford unitaries. Namely,
that their (normalized) trace lies in the discrete set $\{2^{-k/2}: k \in
\mathbb{N}\} \cup \{0\}$, regardless of the dimension. We also state and prove
the analogous property for the $q$-ary Cliffords. This result allows us to
analyze a very simple single-query identity test under the Clifford/Pauli
promise. To prove the equivalence between Pauli and Identity testing, we
analyze the conjugation action of a non-Pauli unitary on the Pauli group and
show that its distance from the Pauli group affects the number of fixed points.
We believe that these results are of interest, independent of their application
to establish the equivalences.
  We use the equivalences to compare (and thus establish) computational
hardness for the problems of Pauli and Clifford testing.

defense. In this paper, we review representative techniques in honeypots,
honeytokens, and moving target defense, spanning from the late 1980s to the
year 2021. Techniques from these three domains complement with each other and
may be leveraged to build a holistic deception based defense. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there has not been a work that provides a systematic
retrospect of these three domains all together and investigates their
integrated usage for orchestrated deceptions. Our paper aims to fill this gap.
By utilizing a tailored cyber kill chain model which can reflect the current
threat landscape and a four-layer deception stack, a two-dimensional taxonomy
is developed, based on which the deception techniques are classified. The
taxonomy literally answers which phases of a cyber attack campaign the
techniques can disrupt and which layers of the deception stack they belong to.
Cyber defenders may use the taxonomy as a reference to design an organized and
comprehensive deception plan, or to prioritize deception efforts for a budget
conscious solution. We also discuss two important points for achieving active
and resilient cyber defense, namely deception in depth and deception lifecycle,
where several notable proposals are illustrated. Finally, some outlooks on
future research directions are presented, including dynamic integration of
different deception techniques, quantified deception effects and deception
operation cost, hardware-supported deception techniques, as well as techniques

demonstrate that for an arbitrary level of degeneracy the plasma supports
existence of axially symmetric 2D solitons which are stable against small
perturbations. The solitons exist if the power trapped in the structures, being
the growing function of soliton amplitude, is above a certain critical value
but below the value determining by electron cavitation. The robustness of
obtained soliton solutions was verified by simulating the dynamics of initial
Gaussian beams with parameters close to the solitonic ones. After few
diffraction lengths the beam attains the profile close to the profile of the
ground state soliton and propagates for a long distance without detectable
distortion. The simulations have been performed for the input Gaussian beams
with parameters far from ground state solutions. It is shown that the beam
parameters are oscillating near the parameters of the ground soliton solution
and thus the formation of oscillating waveguide structures takes place.

While low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) will never independently evolve into a
binary BH system, and binary evolution effects can play an important role
explaining the different BH masses found through studies of X-ray binaries and
gravitational wave events, (electromagnetic) selection effects may also play a
role in this discrepancy. Assuming BH LMXBs originate in the Galactic Plane, we
show that the spatial distribution of the current sample of confirmed and
candidate BH LMXBs are both biased to sources that lie at a large distance from
the Plane. Specifically, most of the confirmed and candidate BH LMXBs are found
at a Galactic height larger than 3 times the scale height for massive star
formation. In addition, the confirmed BH LMXBs are found at larger distances to
the Galactic Center than the candidate BH LMXBs. Interstellar absorption makes
candidate BH LMXBs in the Plane and those in the Bulge too faint for a
dynamical mass measurement using current instrumentation. Given the observed
and theoretical evidence for BH natal and/or Blaauw kicks, their relation with
BH mass and binary orbital period, and the relation between outburst recurrence

modeling and inference. Modern languages support programmable inference, which
allows users to customize inference algorithms by incorporating guide programs
to improve inference performance. For Bayesian inference to be sound, guide
programs must be compatible with model programs. One pervasive but challenging
condition for model-guide compatibility is absolute continuity, which requires
that the model and guide programs define probability distributions with the
same support.
  This paper presents a new probabilistic programming language that guarantees
absolute continuity, and features general programming constructs, such as
branching and recursion. Model and guide programs are implemented as coroutines
that communicate with each other to synchronize the set of random variables
they sample during their execution. Novel guide types describe and enforce
communication protocols between coroutines. If the model and guide are
well-typed using the same protocol, then they are guaranteed to enjoy absolute
continuity. An efficient algorithm infers guide types from code so that users
do not have to specify the types. The new programming language is evaluated
with an implementation that includes the type-inference algorithm and a
prototype compiler that targets Pyro. Experiments show that our language is
capable of expressing a variety of probabilistic models with nontrivial control
flow and recursion, and that the coroutine-based computation does not introduce
significant overhead in actual Bayesian inference.

that the transformers are becoming increasingly popular also in computer

discuss several self-supervised training mechanisms to obtain a pretext model.
The architectural flexibility of SiT allows us to use it as an autoencoder and
work with multiple self-supervised tasks seamlessly. We show that a pretrained
SiT can be finetuned for a downstream classification task on small scale
datasets, consisting of a few thousand images rather than several millions. The
proposed approach is evaluated on standard datasets using common protocols. The
results demonstrate the strength of the transformers and their suitability for

interval along with the flow quantities prediction (u,v,p). Results over
dataset samples as well as unseen shapes show a strong positive correlation of
this reconstruction score to the mean-squared error of the flow prediction.

the provided input shows too large deviation from the training data, making the

  5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Addressing shifts in data distributions is an important prerequisite for the
deployment of deep learning models to real-world settings. A general approach
to this problem involves the adjustment of models to a new domain through
transfer learning. However, in many cases, this is not applicable in a post-hoc
manner to deployed models and further parameter adjustments jeopardize safety
certifications that were established beforehand. In such a context, we propose
to deal with changes in the data distribution via guided data homogenization
which shifts the burden of adaptation from the model to the data. This approach
makes use of information about the training data contained implicitly in the
deep learning model to learn a domain transfer function. This allows for a
targeted deployment of models to unknown scenarios without changing the model
itself. We demonstrate the potential of data homogenization through experiments
on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets.

lack of a high-peak-power isolated attosecond pulse source. Therefore,
currently, generating an intense attosecond pulse would be one of the highest
priority goals. In this paper, we review a TW-class parallel three-channel
waveform synthesizer for generating a gigawatt-scale soft-x-ray isolated
attosecond pulse (IAP) using high-order harmonics generation (HHG).
Simultaneously, using several stabilization methods, namely, the
low-repetition-rate laser carrier-envelope phase stabilization, Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, balanced optical cross-correlator, and beam-pointing
stabilizer, we demonstrate a stable 50-mJ three-channel optical-waveform
synthesizer with a peak power at the multi-TW level. This optical-waveform
synthesizer is capable of creating a stable intense optical field for
generating an intense continuum harmonic beam thanks to the successful
stabilization of all the parameters. Furthermore, the precision control of
shot-to-shot reproducible synthesized waveforms is achieved. Through the HHG
process employing a loose-focusing geometry, an intense shot-to-shot stable
supercontinuum (50-70 eV) is generated in an argon gas cell. This continuum
spectrum supports an IAP with a transform-limited duration of 170 as and a
submicrojoule pulse energy, which allows the generation of a GW-scale IAP.
Another supercontinuum in the soft-x-ray region with higher photon energy of
approximately 100-130 eV is also generated in neon gas from the synthesizer.
The transform-limited pulse duration is 106 as. According to this work, the
enhancement of HHG output through optimized waveform synthesis is
experimentally proved. The high-energy multicycle pulse with 10-Hz repetition
rate is proved to have the same controllability for optimized waveform
synthesis for HHG as few- or subcycle pulses from a 1-kHz laser.

investigated for more than 60 years. Local vacancies as in graphene or in Heavy
Fermions can induce decoupled bound states that lead to the formation of local
moments. In this paper, we address the puzzling question how these local
moments can be screened and what determines the additionally emerging low
temperature scale. We review the initial problem for half-filled conduction
bands from two complementary perspectives: By a single-particle supercell
analysis in the uncorrelated limit and by the Lieb-Mathis theorem for systems
with a large Coulomb interaction $U$. We proof that the stable local moments
are subject to screening by three different mechanisms. Firstly the local
moments are delocalized by a finite $U$ beyond the single-particle bound state.
We find a Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition governed by an exponentially
suppressed low energy scale of a counterintuitive Kondo form with $J_{\rm eff}
\propto U^n$ for small $U$, where $n>1$ depends on the precise model. Secondly,
we show that away from half-filling the local moment phase becomes unstable and
is replaced by two types of singlet phases that are adiabatically connected. At
a critical value for the band center, the physics is governed by an
exponentially suppressed Kondo scale approaching the strong coupling phase that
is replaced by an singlet formation via antiferromagnetic RKKY interaction for
large deviation from the critical values. Thirdly, we show that the local
magnetic moment can be screened by a Kondo hole orbital at finite energy, even
though the orbital occupation is negligible: An additional low energy scale
emerges below which the localized moment is quenched. Similarities to the
experimental findings in Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$Pd$_3$ are pointed out.

map, four ionized clumps (i.e., Ia-Id) are identified toward the central hub,
and are powered by massive OB-stars. The Herschel temperature map depicts the
warm dust emission (i.e., Td ~23-39 K) toward the hub. High resolution Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm continuum map (resolution
~0"".82 X 0"".58) reveals three cores (c1-c3; mass ~80-130 Msun) toward the
ionized clumps Ia, and another one (c4; mass ~70 Msun) toward the ionized clump
Ib. A compact near-infrared (NIR) emission feature (extent ~0.2 pc) is
investigated toward the ionized clump Ia excited by an O8V-type star, and
contains at least three embedded K-band stars. In the direction of the ionized

the cores c1-c3. All these findings together illustrate the existence of a
small cluster of massive stars in the central hub. Considering the detection of
the hub-filament morphology and the spatial locations of the mm cores, a global
non-isotropic collapse (GNIC) scenario appears to be applicable in G25.4NW,

GWs are supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries which have sub-pc-scale orbits.
On the other hand, a SMBH binary which is in an earlier phase and has pc-scale
orbit emits ultra-low-frequency ($\lesssim 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{Hz}$) GWs cannot be
detected with the conventional methodology of PTA. Such binaries tend to obtain
high eccentricity, possibly $\sim 0.9$. In this paper, we develop a formalism

toward ultra-low frequencies considering the waveform expected from an
eccentric SMBH binary. GWs from an eccentric binaries are contributed from
higher harmonics and, therefore, have a different waveform those from a
circular binary. Furthermore, we apply our formalism to several hypothetical
SMBH binaries at the center of nearby galaxies, including M87, using the
constraints from NANOGrav's 11-year data set. For a hypothetical SMBH binary at

intrinsic parameters control the parts of the scene that are focused or
blurred, the viewers' perception of depth in the scene and the position of the

trajectory and lens parameters in order to follow the desired relative
trajectory and image composition as the targets move through the scene.

contrast to what is deduced from the data, that such a cluster should present
strong and extended tidal tails by more than 6 Gyr ago (right after the first
third of its life), exceeding 1 kpc of length, and should be roughly disrupted
by current time. We analyzed each of our initial conditions, such as initial
mass and density parameters, as well as the dark matter shape, and we argue
that the most likely reason for such discrepancy between the data and our
simulations is related to the fact that we consider a purely baryonic cluster
in the beginning of each model we test. We discuss that if our globular cluster
was initially embedded in a dark matter minihalo, the latter could act as a
protecting envelope, which prevents the tidal stripping of the luminous matter,
while being itself gradually disrupted and removed in the course of the cluster
evolution. This could explain why an insignificant amount of dark matter is
required to describe the velocity dispersion in NGC~6397, up to at least a few
half-mass radii.

considerably. However, test case reduction itself can be a time consuming task,
especially if done manually. Therefore, automated minimization techniques have
been proposed, the minimizing Delta Debugging (DDMIN) and the Hierarchical
Delta Debugging (HDD) algorithms being the most well known. DDMIN does not need
any information about the structure of the test case, thus it works for any
kind of input. If the structure is known, however, it can be utilized to create
smaller test cases faster. This is exemplified by HDD, which works on
tree-structured inputs, pruning subtrees at each level of the tree with the
help of DDMIN.
  In this paper, we propose to extend HDD with a reduction method that does not
prune subtrees, but replaces them with compatible subtrees further down the

further reduce the size of test cases by as much as 80% compared to the

precise voxel-wise semantics from a single-view depth or RGBD image. It is a
crucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work,
we present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network
(\textit{SISNet}), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level
semantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape
details as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily
mixed-up. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely
completed semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the
reconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative
scene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion.
Specifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for
effectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be
voxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS,
fine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and
thus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion. Utilizing such an
iterative mechanism, the scene and instance completion benefits each other to
achieve higher completion accuracy. Extensively experiments show that our
proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both real

image reconstruction has been proposed and thoroughly inspected by the applied
mathematics community. Among them, the pioneering prototype often taught and
learned in basic courses in mathematical image processing is the celebrated
Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model \cite{ROF} which relies on the minimisation of
the edge-preserving Total Variation (TV) semi-norm as regularisation term.
Despite its (often limiting) simplicity, this model is still very much employed
in many applications and used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of
modern learning-based image reconstruction approaches, thanks to its thorough
analytical and numerical understanding. Among the many extensions to TV
proposed over the years, a large class is based on the concept of \emph{space
variance}. Space-variant models can indeed overcome the intrinsic inability of
TV to describe \emph{local} features (strength, sharpness, directionality) by
means of an adaptive mathematical modelling which accommodates local
regularisation weighting, variable smoothness and anisotropy. Those ideas can
further be cast in the flexible Bayesian framework of generalised Gaussian
distributions and combined with maximum likelihood and hierarchical
optimisation approaches for efficient hyper-parameter estimation. In this work,
we review and connect the major contributions in the field of space-variant
TV-type image reconstruction models, focusing, in particular, on their Bayesian
interpretation which paves the way to new exciting and unexplored research
directions.

a task, where models are prone to exploit biases in datasets to find shortcuts
instead of performing high-level reasoning. Classical methods address this by
removing biases from training data, or adding branches to models to detect and
remove biases. In this paper, we argue that uncertainty in vision is a
dominating factor preventing the successful learning of reasoning in vision and
language problems. We train a visual oracle and in a large scale study provide
experimental evidence that it is much less prone to exploiting spurious dataset
biases compared to standard models. We propose to study the attention
mechanisms at work in the visual oracle and compare them with a SOTA
Transformer-based model. We provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of
reasoning patterns obtained with an online visualization tool which we make
publicly available (https://reasoningpatterns.github.io). We exploit these
insights by transferring reasoning patterns from the oracle to a SOTA
Transformer-based VQA model taking standard noisy visual inputs via
fine-tuning. In experiments we report higher overall accuracy, as well as
accuracy on infrequent answers for each question type, which provides evidence
for improved generalization and a decrease of the dependency on dataset biases.

end, we present a two-step pose estimation framework to attain 6DoF object
poses from 2D object bounding-boxes. In the first step, the framework learns to
segment objects from real and synthetic data in a weakly-supervised fashion,
and the segmentation masks will act as a prior for pose estimation. In the
second step, we design a dual-scale pose estimation network, namely
DSC-PoseNet, to predict object poses by employing a differential renderer. To
be specific, our DSC-PoseNet firstly predicts object poses in the original
image scale by comparing the segmentation masks and the rendered visible object
masks. Then, we resize object regions to a fixed scale to estimate poses once
again. In this fashion, we eliminate large scale variations and focus on
rotation estimation, thus facilitating pose estimation. Moreover, we exploit
the initial pose estimation to generate pseudo ground-truth to train our
DSC-PoseNet in a self-supervised manner. The estimation results in these two
scales are ensembled as our final pose estimation. Extensive experiments on

inter-cloud and intra-cloud interference, constitutes a practical solution to

multi-cloud radio access network model (MC-RAN), where each cloud is connected
to a distinct set of base stations (BSs) via limited capacity fronthaul links.
The BSs are equipped with local cache storage and baseband processing
capabilities, as a means to alleviate the fronthaul congestion problem. The
paper then investigates the problem of jointly assigning users to clouds and
determining their beamforming vectors so as to maximize the network-wide energy
efficiency (EE) subject to fronthaul capacity and transmit power constraints.
This paper solves such a mixed discrete-continuous, non-convex optimization
problem using fractional programming (FP) and successive inner-convex
approximation (SICA) techniques to deal with the non-convexity of the
continuous part of the problem, and $l_0$-norm approximation to account for the
binary association part. A highlight of the proposed algorithm is its
capability of being implemented in a distributed fashion across the network's

detect transitions towards highly volatile regimes, hence improving tail-risk

detection is implemented via vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive

agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Since market regime switches are
unobservable processes that describe the latent change of market behaviour, the
ability of correctly detecting market regimes is validated in two ways:
firstly, randomly generated data are used to assess a correct classification
when regimes are known; secondly, a na\""{i}ve trading strategy filtered with

backdoored model will misclassify the trigger-embedded inputs into an
attacker-chosen target label while performing normally on other benign inputs.
There are already numerous works on backdoor attacks on neural networks, but
only a few works consider graph neural networks (GNNs). As such, there is no
intensive research on explaining the impact of trigger injecting position on
the performance of backdoor attacks on GNNs.
  To bridge this gap, we conduct an experimental investigation on the
performance of backdoor attacks on GNNs. We apply two powerful GNN
explainability approaches to select the optimal trigger injecting position to
achieve two attacker objectives -- high attack success rate and low clean
accuracy drop. Our empirical results on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art
neural network models demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in
selecting trigger injecting position for backdoor attacks on GNNs. For
instance, on the node classification task, the backdoor attack with trigger
injecting position selected by GraphLIME reaches over $84 \%$ attack success
rate with less than $2.5 \%$ accuracy drop

inertial warm positive ions and negative dust grains has been investigated. A
Burgers' equation is derived by employing the reductive perturbation method.
Under consideration of inertial warm positive ions and negative dust grains,
both positive and negative shock structures are numerically observed in the
presence of super-thermal electrons. The effects of oblique angle ($\delta$),
spectral index ($\kappa$), kinematic viscosity ($\eta$), number density and
charge state of the plasma species on the formation of the DIASHWs are
examined. It is found that the positive and negative shock wave potentials
increase with the oblique angle. It is also observed that the magnitude of the
amplitude of positive and negative shock waves is not affected by the variation
of the kinematic viscosity of plasma species but the steepness of the positive
and negative shock waves decreases with kinematic viscosity of plasma species.
The implications of our findings in space and laboratory plasmas are briefly
discussed.

semiclassical approach a broad Landau level or magnetic miniband at epsilon_M
is a manifestation of the so called self-intersecting orbit signifying an
abrupt transition from the semiclassical trajectories enclosing the $\Gamma$
point to the trajectories enclosing the K point in the momentum space.
Remarkably, the saddle point virtually does not affect the diamagnetic response
of graphene, which is caused mostly by electron states in the vicinity of the

  Proving",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synchronous model is a type of formal models for modelling and specifying
reactive systems. It has a great advantage over other real-time models that its
modelling paradigm supports a deterministic concurrent behaviour of systems.
Various approaches have been utilized for verification of synchronous models
based on different techniques, such as model checking, SAT/SMT sovling, term
rewriting, type inference and so on. In this paper, we propose a verification
approach for synchronous models based on compositional reasoning and term
rewriting. Specifically, we initially propose a variation of dynamic logic,
called synchronous dynamic logic (SDL). SDL extends the regular program model
of first-order dynamic logic (FODL) with necessary primitives to capture the
notion of synchrony and synchronous communication between parallel programs,
and enriches FODL formulas with temporal dynamic logical formulas to specify
safety properties -- a type of properties mainly concerned in reactive systems.
To rightly capture the synchronous communications, we define a constructive
semantics for the program model of SDL. We build a sound and relatively
complete proof system for SDL. Compared to previous verification approaches,
SDL provides a divide and conquer way to analyze and verify synchronous models
based on compositional reasoning of the syntactic structure of the programs of
SDL. To illustrate the usefulness of SDL, we apply SDL to specify and verify a
small example in the synchronous model SyncChart, which shows the potential of
SDL to be used in practice.

systems to organize knowledge and facilitate downstream tasks. One critical
challenge is that, as data and business scope grow in real applications,
existing taxonomies need to be expanded to incorporate new concepts. Previous
works on taxonomy expansion process the new concepts independently and
simultaneously, ignoring the potential relationships among them and the
appropriate order of inserting operations. However, in reality, the new
concepts tend to be mutually correlated and form local hypernym-hyponym
structures. In such a scenario, ignoring the dependencies of new concepts and
the order of insertion may trigger error propagation. For example, existing
taxonomy expansion systems may insert hyponyms to existing taxonomies before
their hypernym, leading to sub-optimal expanded taxonomies. To complement
existing taxonomy expansion systems, we propose TaxoOrder, a novel
self-supervised framework that simultaneously discovers the local
hypernym-hyponym structure among new concepts and decides the order of
insertion. TaxoOrder can be directly plugged into any taxonomy expansion system
and improve the quality of expanded taxonomies. Experiments on the real-world
dataset validate the effectiveness of TaxoOrder to enhance taxonomy expansion
systems, leading to better-resulting taxonomies with comparison to baselines
under various evaluation metrics.

extensive numerical studies of three example systems: the Chirikov standard
map, the family of Robnik billiards, and the family of lemon billiards. The
filling of the cells is compared to the random model of chaotic diffusion,
introduced in Robnik et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 30, L803 (1997)] for the
description of transport in the phase spaces of ergodic systems. The model is
based on the assumption of completely uncorrelated cell visits because of the
strongly chaotic dynamics of the orbit and the distribution of recurrence times
is exponential. In generic systems the stickiness induces correlations in the
cell visits. The distribution of recurrence times exhibits a separation of
timescales because of the dynamical trapping. We model the recurrence time
distributions to cells inside sticky areas as a mixture of exponential
distributions with different decay times. We introduce the variable S, which is
the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of the recurrence times
as a measure of stickiness. We use S to globally assess the distributions of
recurrence times. We find that in the bulk of the chaotic sea S=1, while S>1 in
areas of stickiness. We present the results in the form of animated grayscale
plots of the variable S in the largest chaotic component for the three example

rather small masses and/or large couplings and enhanced chirality flips, which
can lead to conflicts with limits from LHC and dark matter experiments. Our
results show that the new measurement excludes a large number of models and
provides crucial constraints on others. Two-Higgs doublet and leptoquark models
provide viable explanations of $a_\mu$ only in specific versions and in

networks. Popular hand-designed activation functions like Rectified Linear
Unit(ReLU) and its variants show promising performance in various tasks and
models. Swish, the automatically discovered activation function, has been
proposed and outperforms ReLU on many challenging datasets. However, it has two
main drawbacks. First, the tree-based search space is highly discrete and
restricted, which is difficult for searching. Second, the sample-based
searching method is inefficient, making it infeasible to find specialized
activation functions for each dataset or neural architecture. To tackle these
drawbacks, we propose a new activation function called Piecewise Linear
Unit(PWLU), which incorporates a carefully designed formulation and learning
method. It can learn specialized activation functions and achieves SOTA
performance on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and COCO. For example, on
ImageNet classification dataset, PWLU improves 0.9%/0.53%/1.0%/1.7%/1.0% top-1
accuracy over Swish for
ResNet-18/ResNet-50/MobileNet-V2/MobileNet-V3/EfficientNet-B0. PWLU is also
easy to implement and efficient at inference, which can be widely applied in
real-world applications.

formamidinium have attracted interest due to their improved stability and
capability to tune their properties varying the composition. In this work we
report on the local variation of the structural and electronic properties in
mixed A-site cation MA/FA lead iodide perovskites FAXMA1-XPBI3 evaluated from
static first-principles calculations in certain structures where the
orientations of organic cations result from examining the energy landscape of
some compositions. The cation replacement at the A-site to form the solid
solution causes an increase tilting of the inorganic PbI6 octahedra: in the
FA-rich compounds the replacement of FA by a smaller cation like MA is to
compensate the reduced space filling offered by the smaller cation, whereas in
the MA-rich compounds is to expand the space needed for the larger cation. In
fact, the effect of octahedron tiltings exceeds that of unit-cell size in
determining the band gap for these organic cation mixtures. Our calculations
indicate that the key role played by hydrogen bonds with iodine anions in pure
compounds is preserved in the cation mixed perovskites. It is found that MA-I
bonds remain stronger than FA-I bonds throughout the composition range
regardless of the unit-cell expansion as the FA content increases. Our
calculations reveal how the hydrogen bonds stabilize the no-bonding I-5p
orbitals, spatially perpendicular to the Pb-I-Pb bond axis, lowering their
energy when the H-I interaction occurs, which would explain the well-known role
of hydrogen bonding in the structural stabilization of hybrid perovskites.
These results contribute to the understanding on the role played by cation
mixing at A sites in the physics of lead halide perovskites.

means of the all-optical ultrafast multi-pulse time-resolved spectroscopy. We
show that the structural coherence of the low-T broken symmetry state is
strongly suppressed on a sub-picosecond timescale above a threshold excitation
fluence resulting in a structurally inhomogeneous transient state which
persists for several-tens of picoseconds before reverting to the low-T
disordered weakly conducting state. The electronic order shows a transient gap
filling at a significantly lower fluence threshold. The data suggest that the
photoinduced-transition dynamics to the high-T metallic phase is governed by
first-order-transition nucleation kinetics that prevents the complete ultrafast
structural transition even when the absorbed energy significantly exceeds the
equilibrium enthalpy difference to the high-T metallic phase. In contrast, the
dynamically-decoupled electronic order is transiently suppressed on a
sub-picosecond timescale rather independently due to a photoinduced Mott
transition.

be linked to the wild dependence that particle transport has on the fine
details of the billiard table. Here we address this relation through a detailed
numerical study of the statistics of displacement in a family of polygonal
channel billiards with parallel walls. We show that transport is characterised
by strong anomalous diffusion, with a mean square displacement that scales in
time faster than linear, and with a probability density of the displacement
exhibiting exponential tails and ballistic fronts. In channels of finite length
the distribution of first-passage times is characterised by fat tails, with a
mean first-passage time that diverges when the aperture angle is rational.
These findings have non trivial consequences for a variety of experiments.

be real if the Hamiltonian had an antilinear symmetry such as $PT$ stimulated
new insight into the underlying structure of quantum mechanics. Specifically,
it lead to the realization that Hilbert space could be richer than the
established Dirac approach of constructing inner products out of ket vectors
and their Hermitian conjugate bra vectors. With antilinear symmetry one must
instead build inner products out of ket vectors and their antilinear
conjugates, and it is these inner products that would be time independent in
the non-Hermitian but antilinearly symmetric case even as the standard Dirac
inner products would not be. Moreover, and in a sense quite remarkably,
antilinear symmetry could address not only the temporal behavior of the inner
product but also the issue of its overall sign, with antilinear symmetry being
capable of yielding a positive inner product in situations where the standard
Dirac inner product is found to have ghostlike negative signature. Antilinear
symmetry thus solves the ghost problem in quantum field theory by showing that
when a theory has ghost states it is being formulated in the wrong Hilbert
space, with antilinear symmetry providing a Hilbert space that is ghost free.
Antilinear symmetry does not actually get rid of the ghost states. Rather, it
shows that the reasoning that led one to think that ghosts were present in the
first place is faulty.

ratio range $\eta = {R_i}/{R_o} \in [0.3,0.9]$. This study focuses on the
dependence of flow properties on the radius ratio $\eta$. The temperature and
velocity fields reveal that different curvatures of the inner and outer
cylinders of the ACRBC system lead to asymmetric movements of hot and cold
plumes under the action of Coriolis force, resulting in the formation of zonal
flow. The physical mechanism of zonal flow is verified by the dependence of the
drift frequency of the large-scale circulation rolls and the space- and
time-averaged azimuthal velocity on $\eta$. We find that the larger $\eta$ is,
the weaker the zonal flow becomes. We show that the heat transport efficiency
increases with $\eta$. It is also found that the bulk temperature deviates from
the arithmetic mean temperature and the deviation increases as $\eta$
decreases. This effect can be explained by a simple model that accounts for the
curvature effects and the radially-dependent centrifugal force in ACRBC.

wireless networks with multi-connectivity, where users connect to their closest
$k$ base stations. It is important to know how many users a particular base
station serves, which gives the degree of that base station. To obtain these
degree distributions, we investigate the distribution of area sizes of the

Poisson distributed, we investigate the amount of users connected to a certain
$B$-point, which is equal to the degree of this point. In the simple case where
the $B$-points are placed in an hexagonal grid, we show that all $k$-th order
Voronoi areas are equal and thus all degrees follow a Poisson distribution.
However, this observation does not hold for Poisson distributed $B$-points, for

distribution in the 2-dimensional case with a compound Poisson-Gamma degree
distribution and show that this one-parameter fit performs well for different
values of $k$. Moreover, we show that for increasing $k$, these degree
distributions become more concentrated around the mean. This means that
$k$-connected $AB$ random graphs balance the loads of $B$-type nodes more
evenly as $k$ increases. Finally, we provide a case study on real data of base
stations. We show that with little shadowing in the distances between users and
base stations, the Poisson distribution does not capture the degree
distribution of these data, especially for $k>1$. However, under strong
shadowing, our degree approximations perform quite good even for these
non-Poissonian location data.

  We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about relevant human
challenges and their causes in software engineering. We establish a reusable
set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team
virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of
members with different nationalities.
  We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency
and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ""within teams"" as
well as ""between teams and clients"", compiled from previous empiric work, blog
posts and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if
mitigation measures were already in place. Respondents were also asked to
provide information about their team setup. The survey also measured Schwartz
human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional
challenges at their workplace.
  We report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of
challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two
categories of challenges; ""interpersonal"" and ""intrapersonal"". We found no
evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some
significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and
certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3
different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just
one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to
increase the frequency of some human challenges.

density are essential for the effective miniaturization of future electronic
devices. Among different EESSs available in the market, dielectric capacitors
relying on swift electronic and ionic polarization-based mechanisms to store

intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to energy dissipations prevent
ceramic-based dielectric capacitors from reaching high recoverable energy
density levels. Interestingly, relaxor ferroelectric-based dielectric
capacitors, because of their low remnant polarization, show relatively high
energy density and thus display great potential for applications requiring high
energy density properties. Here, some of the main strategies to improve the
energy density properties of perovskite lead-free relaxor systems are reviewed.
This includes (i) chemical modification at different crystallographic sites,
(ii) chemical additives that do not target lattice sites and (iii) novel
processing approaches dedicated to bulk ceramics, thick and thin films,
respectively. Recent advancements are summarized concerning the search for
relaxor materials with superior energy density properties and the appropriate
choice of both composition and processing route to match various needs in the
application. Finally, future trends in computationally-aided materials design

This paper proposes a novel algorithm for automated vertebrae segmentation via
3D volumetric spine CT images. The proposed model is based on the structure of
encoder to decoder, using layer normalization to optimize mini-batch training
performance. To address the concern of the information loss between encoder and
decoder, we designed an Atrous Residual Path to pass more features from encoder
to decoder instead of an easy shortcut connection. The proposed model also
applied the attention module in the decoder part to extract features from
variant scales. The proposed model is evaluated on a publicly available dataset
by a variety of metrics. The experimental results show that our model achieves
competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art medical semantic

(ISF) is a prominent, degree-long structure of dense gas and dust, with clear
signs of recent and on-going high-mass star formation. We used the ArTeMiS
bolometer camera at APEX to map a 0.6x0.2 deg^2 region covering OMC-1, OMC-2,
OMC-3 at 350 and 450 micron. We combined these data with Herschel-SPIRE maps to
recover extended emission. The combined Herschel-ArTeMiS maps provide details
on the distribution of dense, cold material, with a high spatial dynamic range,
from our 8'' resolution (0.016 pc) up to the size of the map ~10-15 deg. By
combining Herschel and ArTeMiS data at 160, 250, 350 and 450 micron, we
constructed high-resolution temperature and H2 column density maps. We
extracted radial profiles from the column density map in several,
representative portions of the ISF, that we fitted with Gaussian and Plummer
models to derive their intrinsic widths. We also compared the distribution of
material traced by ArTeMiS with that seen in the higher density tracer
N2H+(1-0) recently observed with the ALMA interferometer. All the radial
profiles that we extracted show clear deviation from a Gaussian, with evidence
for an inner plateau, previously not seen using Herschel-only data. We measure
intrinsic half-power widths in the range 0.06 to 0.11 pc. This is significantly
larger than the Gaussian widths measured for fibers seen in N2H+, which
probably traces only the dense innermost regions of the large-scale filament.
These half-power widths are within a factor of two of the value of 0.1 pc found
for a large sample of nearby filaments in various low-mass star-forming
regions, which tends to indicate that the physical conditions governing the
fragmentation of prestellar cores within transcritical or supercritical
filaments are the same over a large range of masses per unit length.

It consists of permanent magnets. The specific combination of focusing

sum-throughput in an IoT system underlaying a cellular network, through optimal
channel and power allocation. NOMA is used to manage the interference between
cellular users and full-duplex (FD) IoT devices. To this aim, mutual successive
interference cancellation (SIC) conditions are identified to allow
simultaneously the removal of the D2D devices interference at the level of the
base station and the removal of the cellular users (CU) interference at the
level of D2D devices. To optimally solve the joint channel and power allocation
(PA) problem, a time-efficient solution of the PA problem in the FD context is
elaborated. By means of graphical representation, the complex non-convex PA
problem is efficiently solved in constant time complexity. This enables the
global optimal resolution by successively solving the separate PA and channel
assignment problems. The performance of the proposed strategy is compared
against the classical state-of-the-art FD and HD scenarios, where SIC is not
applied between CUs and IoT devices. The results show that important gains can
be achieved by applying mutual SIC NOMA in the IoT-cellular context, in either

peak occurred $\sim15$ days post-explosion. A second and more prominent peak is
reached in all bands at $\sim45$ days past explosion, followed by and fast
decline from $\sim60$ days. During the first 30 days, the spectra of SN 2019cad
show the typical features of a type Ic SN, however, after 40 days, a blue
continuum with prominent lines of Si II ${\lambda}6355$ and C II
${\lambda}6580$ is observed again. Comparing the bolometric light curve to

$\mathcal{S}$/$\mathcal{T}$ protocol has unique advantages such as offering

Popular few-shot learning algorithms extract a transferable embedding from seen

recognition is the complex structure of videos. Some existing solutions sample
frames from a video and aggregate their embeddings to form a video-level

explicit sequence matching between two videos and define their distance as
matching cost, imposing too strong restrictions on sequence ordering. In this
paper, we propose Compromised Metric via Optimal Transport (CMOT) to combine
the advantages of these two solutions. CMOT simultaneously considers semantic
and temporal information in videos under Optimal Transport framework, and is
discriminative for both content-sensitive and ordering-sensitive tasks. In
detail, given two videos, we sample segments from them and cast the calculation
of their distance as an optimal transport problem between two segment
sequences. To preserve the inherent temporal ordering information, we
additionally amend the ground cost matrix by penalizing it with the positional
distance between a pair of segments. Empirical results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of CMOT.

the hidden biases in their creation have led to a demand for regulation to
address such issues. Yet blindly regulating an innovation process that is not
well understood, may stifle this process and reduce benefits that society may
gain from the generated technology, even under the best intentions. In this
paper, starting from a baseline model that captures the fundamental dynamics of
a race for domain supremacy using AI technology, we demonstrate how socially
unwanted outcomes may be produced when sanctioning is applied unconditionally
to risk-taking, i.e. potentially unsafe, behaviours. As an alternative to
resolve the detrimental effect of over-regulation, we propose a voluntary
commitment approach wherein technologists have the freedom of choice between
independently pursuing their course of actions or establishing binding
agreements to act safely, with sanctioning of those that do not abide to what
they pledged. Overall, this work reveals for the first time how voluntary
commitments, with sanctions either by peers or an institution, leads to
socially beneficial outcomes in all scenarios envisageable in a short-term race
towards domain supremacy through AI technology. These results are directly
relevant for the design of governance and regulatory policies that aim to

correlate the splitting in $v_1$ of heavy quarks with different charges to some
main features of the magnetic field, and in particular its values at formation
and freeze-out time.
  We further found that the slope of the splitting $d\Delta v_1/dy_z|_{y_z=0}$
of positively and negatively charged particles at high $p_T$ can be formulated
as $d\Delta v_1/dy_z|_{y_z=0}=-\alpha \frac{\partial \ln f}{\partial

constrained by the $y$ component of magnetic fields and the sign of $\alpha$ is
simply determined by the difference $\Delta[tB_y(t)]$ in the center of
colliding systems at the formation time of particles and at the time when
particles leave the effective range of electromagnetic fields or freeze out.
The formula is derived from general considerations and is confirmed by several
related numerical simulations; it supplies a useful guide to quantify the
effect of different magnetic field configurations and provides an evidence of
why the measurement of $\Delta v_1$ of charm, bottom and leptons from $Z^0$

this review. A generic Hamiltonian formulation for systems with space-dependent
balanced loss and gain is discussed. It is shown that the loss-gain terms may
be removed completely through appropriate co-ordinate transformations with its
effect manifested in modifying the strength of the velocity-mediated coupling.
The effect of the Lorentz interaction in improving the stability of classical
solutions as well as allowing a possibility of defining the corresponding
quantum problem consistently on the real line, instead of within Stokes wedges,
is also discussed. Several exactly solvable models based on translational and
rotational symmetry are discussed which include coupled cubic oscillators,
Landau Hamiltonian etc. The role of PT-symmetry on the existence of periodic
solution in systems with balanced loss and gain is critically analyzed. A few
non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian as well as non-Hamiltonian systems with balanced
loss and gain, which include mechanical as well as extended system, are shown
to admit periodic solutions. An example of Hamiltonian chaos within the
framework of a non-PT-symmetric system of coupled Duffing oscillator with
balanced loss-gain and/or positional non-conservative forces is discussed. It
is conjectured that a non-PT-symmetric system with balanced loss-gain and
without any velocity mediated interaction may admit periodic solution if the
linear part of the equations of motion is necessarily PT-symmetric -- the
nonlinear interaction may or may not be PT-symmetric. Further, systems with
velocity mediated interaction need not be PT-symmetric at all in order to admit
periodic solutions. Results related to nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac
equations with balanced loss and gain are mentioned briefly. A class of

doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), but with polynomial cost
(compared with the exponential cost of the latter). Here, we address whether
this similarity holds for excited states, by exploring the symmetric
dissociation of the linear \ce{H4} molecule. When ground-state Hartree-Fock
(HF) orbitals are employed, pCCD and DOCI excited-state energies do not match,
a feature that is assigned to the poor HF reference. In contrast, by optimizing
the orbitals at the pCCD level (oo-pCCD) specifically for each excited state,
the discrepancies between pCCD and DOCI decrease by one or two orders of
magnitude. Therefore, the pCCD and DOCI methodologies still provide comparable
energies for excited states, but only if suitable, state-specific orbitals are
adopted. We also assessed whether a pCCD approach could be used to directly
target doubly-excited states, without having to resort to the
equation-of-motion (EOM) formalism. In our $\Delta$oo-pCCD model, excitation
energies were extracted from the energy difference between separate oo-pCCD
calculations for the ground state and the targeted excited state. For a set

simple astrosphere models, more elaborate approaches have recently been used to
explain differing observable structures. Aims. By placing perturbations of an
otherwise homogeneous interstellar medium in front of the astrospheric bow
shock of the runaway blue supergiant $\lambda$ Cephei, the observable structure
of the model astrosphere is significantly altered, providing insight into the
origin of perturbed bow shock images. Methods. Three-dimensional single-fluid
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of stationary astrospheres were subjected to
various types of perturbations and simulated until stationarity was reached
again. As examples, simple perturbations of the available MHD parameters
(number density, bulk velocity, temperature, and magnetic field) as well as a
more complex perturbation were chosen. Synthetic observations were generated by
line-of-sight integration of the model data, producing H$\alpha$, $70\,\mu$m
dust emission, and bremsstrahlung maps of the perturbed astrosphere's
evolution. Results. The resulting shock structures and observational images
differ strongly depending on the type of the injected perturbation and the
viewing angles, forming arc-like protrusions or bifurcations of the bow shock
structure, as well as rings, arcs, and irregular structures detached from the
bow shock.

to be at some level kinematically synchronized with the rotation of field red

the sky as a tilted edge-on disk, with a velocity dispersion perpendicular to

this gap by extracting phoneme identities to help speech enhancement.
Specifically, we propose a phoneme-based distribution regularization (PbDr) for
speech enhancement, which incorporates frame-wise phoneme information into
speech enhancement network in a conditional manner. As different phonemes
always lead to different feature distributions in frequency, we propose to
learn a parameter pair, i.e. scale and bias, through a phoneme classification
vector to modulate the speech enhancement network. The modulation parameter
pair includes not only frame-wise but also frequency-wise conditions, which
effectively map features to phoneme-related distributions. In this way, we
explicitly regularize speech enhancement features by recognition vectors.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PbDr module can
not only boost the perceptual quality for speech enhancement but also the
recognition accuracy of an ASR system on the enhanced speech. This PbDr module
could be readily incorporated into other speech enhancement networks as well.

disc. Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are performed and
post-processed by three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations. In our
disc model, the planet eccentricity reaches ~0.25, which induces strong
asymmetries in the gas density inside the cavity. These asymmetries are
enhanced by photodissociation and form large-scale asymmetries in 12CO J=3-2
integrated intensity maps. They are shown to be detectable for an angular
resolution and a noise level similar to those achieved in ALMA observations.
Furthermore, the planet eccentricity renders the gas inside the cavity
eccentric, which manifests as a narrowing, stretching and twisting of
iso-velocity contours in velocity maps of 12CO J=3-2. The planet eccentricity
does not, however, give rise to detectable signatures in 13CO and C18O J=3-2
inside the cavity because of low column densities. Outside the cavity, the gas
maintains near-circular orbits, and the vertically extended optically thick CO
emission displays a four-lobed pattern in integrated intensity maps for disc
inclinations > 30 degrees. The lack of large and small dust inside the cavity
in our model further implies that synthetic images of the continuum emission in

not show significant differences when the planet is eccentric or still circular

The decomposition factors the distance of objects into the most representative

between the two heights, leading to robust distance prediction when both
predicted heights are inaccurate. The decomposition also enables us to trace
the causes of the distance uncertainty for different scenarios. Such
decomposition makes the distance prediction interpretable, accurate, and
robust. Our method directly predicts 3D bounding boxes from RGB images with a
compact architecture, making the training and inference simple and efficient.
The experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art

this work, we report a generalized video extraction method using the affine
motion modeling, enabling to tackle multiple types of complex motion and their
mixing. In its workflow, the moving objects are first segemented in the alpha

series of affine transformations of a reference frame, and introduce the
$l0$-norm total variation regularization to attenuate the ringing artifact. The
differentiable affine operators are employed to realize gradient-descent
optimization of the affine model, which follows a novel coarse-to-fine strategy
to further reduce artifacts. As a result, both the affine parameters and sharp

transformation to recover the sharp video frames. The stepwise retrieval
maintains the nature to bypass the frame order ambiguity. Experiments on both

MagNet, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambiguity by looking at the

Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage,
recovering the previously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and
the segmentation output is progressively refined through the processing stages.

the proposed approach partitions the network into a set of subnetworks,
dualizes the coupling constraints (giving the LD function), and maximizes the
LD function with respect to the dual variables of the coupling constraints
(giving the desired LD bound). The dual variables that maximize the LD are
obtained by using a proximal bundle method. We show that the bound is less

thanks to the realization that a traversable wormhole could be converted to a
time machine. This also implied that one could only travel back to the time of
the conversion. This paper addresses these issues, as well as the concomitant
causality violations, by starting with a physically acceptable model, a
spacetime that is anti-de Sitter due to an extra time-like dimension, thereby
allowing the existence of closed time-like curves. By assuming that the extra
dimension is independent of the radial coordinate, the wormhole retains its
basic geometric properties regardless of its location and can therefore serve
as a shortcut for any closed time-like curve, which, in turn, can extend
indefinitely into the past. The same independence of the radial coordinate
suggests that the wormhole could connect a region in the present to a local
region that (1) lies in the past and (2) does not contain any closed time-like
curves. Previous studies have suggested that if such a region is sufficiently
localized, it may be possible to avoid a causality violation.

compete with current LIB in terms of energy density or environmental

its performance substantially. Therefore, if the assumed evolutions of the MgS

Haas-Van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements, we studied the anisotropy of
magnetoresistance (MR) of ReO$_3$ with a simple cubic structure, an ""ordinary""
nonmagnetic metal considered previously. We found that ReO$_3$ exhibits almost
all the characteristics of XMR semimetals: the nearly quadratic field
dependence of MR, a field-induced upturn in resistivity followed by a plateau
at low temperatures, high mobilities of charge carriers. It was found that for
magnetic field \emph{H} applied along the \emph{c} axis, the MR exhibits an
unsaturated \emph{H}$^{1.75}$ dependence, which was argued to arise from the
complete carrier compensation supported by the Hall resistivity measurements.
For \emph{H} applied along the direction of 15$^\circ$ relative to the \emph{c}
axis, an unsaturated \emph{H}$^{1.90}$ dependence of MR up to
9.43~$\times$~$10^3$$\%$ at 10~K and 9~T was observed, which was explained by
the existence of electron open orbits extending along the $k_{x}$ direction.
Two mechanisms responsible for XMR observed usually in the semimetals occur
also in the simple metal ReO$_3$ due to its peculiar FS (two closed electron
pockets and one open electron pocket), once again indicating that the details
of FS topology are a key factor for the observed XMR in materials.

color-octet Fock states are considered. Total and differential decay widths for
the inclusive decays $Z \to \eta_Q+X$ are presented. It is found that the
decays $Z\to \eta_Q +X$ are dominated by the $^3S_1^{[8]}$ component, so the
decays can be inversely adopted to determine the values of the long-distance
matrix elements $\langle {\cal O}^{\eta_{c}}(^{3}S_{1}^{[8]})\rangle$ and
$\langle {\cal O}^{\eta_{b}}(^{3}S_{1}^{[8]})\rangle$, respectively. Our
numerical results show that at an $e^+e^-$ collider running at the $Z$ pole
with a high luminosity around $10^{35}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$ (a super $Z$
factory), there are about $4.5\times 10^7$ $\eta_c$ meson events and $6.1\times

recover the original input image from intermediate outputs that can be

the intermediate outputs are protected with a small accuracy loss. In this
paper, we provide the first systematic study to reveal insights regarding the
effectiveness of differential privacy for collaborative inference against the

for three collaborative inference models with four datasets (SVHN, GTSRB,

computation resources than can entirely be satisfied on local IoT devices.
Cloud computing is traditionally used to provide unlimited computation
resources at distant servers. However, such remote computation may not address
the short-delay constraints that many of today's IoT applications require. Edge
computing allows offloading computing close to end users to overcome
computation and delay issues. Nonetheless, the edge servers may suffer from
computing inefficiencies. Indeed, some IoT applications are invoked multiple
times by multiple devices. These invocations are often used with the same or
similar input data, which leads to the same computational output (results).
Still, the edge server willfully executes all received redundant tasks. In this
work, we investigate the use of the computation reuse concept at the edge
server. We design a network-based computation reuse architecture for IoT
applications. The architecture stores previously executed results and reuses
them to satisfy newly arrived similar tasks instead of performing computation
from scratch. By doing so, we eliminate redundant computation, optimize
resource utilization, and decrease task completion time. We implemented the

vision algorithms. However, the derivatives of the eigenvectors tend to be
numerically unstable, whether using the SVD to compute them analytically or
using the Power Iteration (PI) method to approximate them. This instability
arises in the presence of eigenvalues that are close to each other. This makes
integrating eigendecomposition into deep networks difficult and often results
in poor convergence, particularly when dealing with large matrices.
  While this can be mitigated by partitioning the data into small arbitrary
groups, doing so has no theoretical basis and makes it impossible to exploit
the full power of eigendecomposition. In previous work, we mitigated this using
SVD during the forward pass and PI to compute the gradients during the backward
pass. However, the iterative deflation procedure required to compute multiple
eigenvectors using PI tends to accumulate errors and yield inaccurate
gradients. Here, we show that the Taylor expansion of the SVD gradient is
theoretically equivalent to the gradient obtained using PI without relying in

semiconductor driven out of equilibrium by resonant and nonresonant laser
pulses, highlighting the effects of phonon-induced decoherence and relaxation.
{\em Resonant} excitations initially yield a replica of the {\em valence} band
shifted upward by the energy of the exciton peak in photoabsorption. This phase
is eventually destroyed by phonon-induced decoherence: the valence-band replica
lowers in energy by the Stokes shift, locating at the energy of the exciton
peak in photoluminescence, and its width grows due to phonon dressing. {\em
Nonresonant} excitations initially yield a map of the conduction band. Then
electrons transfer their excess energy to the lattice and bind with the holes
left behind to form excitons. In this relaxed regime a replica of the {\em
conduction} band appears inside the gap. At fixed momentum the lineshape of the
conduction-band replica versus the photoelectron energy is proportional to the
exciton wavefunction in ""energy space"" and it is highly asymmetric. Although
the two-band model represents an oversimplified description of real materials
the highlighted features are qualitative in nature; hence they provide useful
insights into time-resolved ARPES spectra and their physical interpretation.

temporal ensembling and uncertainty-guided self-learning to benefit from

inside the superconducting gap, whose energy depends on the strength of the
coupling to the impurity and on the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level.
We consider DOS exhibiting a logarithmic or a power-law divergence at the Fermi
level due to Van Hove singularities (VHS) and high-order Van Hove singularities
(HOVHS), respectively. We find that the energy of the YSR states has the same
functional form as in the constant DOS scenario, with the effect of the
singularity being an enhancement of the effective coupling constants. In
particular, the critical magnetic coupling strength at which the Shiba
transition occurs is always lowered by a factor
$1/\rho(\Delta/E_{\mathrm{c}}$), where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap,
$E_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the bandwidth, and $\rho(E)$ is the factor in DOS which
diverges at $E=0$ for a VHS or HOVHS. Further, since the critical magnetic
coupling is significantly reduced, a new regime becomes accessible where the
transition point is controlled by the non-magnetic coupling constant.
Interestingly, the slope of the Shiba energy curve at the Shiba transition is
independent of impurity parameters and purely reflects the band structure.
Additionally, we find that our main conclusions remain valid even when the
Fermi level is not precisely tuned to the Van Hove singularity, but instead
lies on an energy range of order the superconducting gap. Our results show that
tuning a superconducting material towards a VHS or HOVHS enhances the
possibilities for engineering YSR states, and for characterizing the
superconductor itself.

This
new formalism aims at deriving an effective Lindblad equation to compute the

determined from numerical ab initio calculations, based on the spinfoam
formalism. This theoretical proposal is illustrated by means of examples. The
decoherence effect can induce the relaxation of the quantum gravitational state
toward a sate of a small area. This is analogue to the well-known Purcell
relaxation of QED, for which the qubits are replaced by the spin-network

these systems are computed, and several issues with the thermal time hypothesis
are underlined. Moreover, the results suggest that further approximations can
be performed to study reduced dynamics of quantum space-time.

tight binary system of a white dwarf (WD) and a main sequence (MS) star to
enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) with each other, and then unbinds the
WD-MS common envelope. The WD-MS binary system, now with the WD inside the MS
envelope, does not have sufficient orbital energy to unbind their common
envelope. However, as they approach the center of the giant star Roche lobe
overflow to the core of the giant star and/or merger of the WD with the core
remove a large fraction of the WD-MS common envelope or all of it. Namely, the
energy source for unbinding the WD-MS tight common envelope is the triple-star
CEE. For that we term this scenario a parasite CEE. Overall, the destruction of
the MS star absorbs energy from the triple-star system, a process that might
lead to WD-core merger during the triple-star CEE. The parasite CEE leaves
behind either one massive WD that in some cases might explode as a peculiar
type Ia supernova or two close WDs that at later time might explode as a type
Ia supernova. We very crudely estimate the rate of the parasite CEE to be a
fraction of ~0.001 out of all evolved triple stars.

and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations.
We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale

different distributions, the rank transformation offers a convenient and robust

sampling distribution of the resulting empirical angular measure is
challenging. It is the purpose of the paper to establish finite-sample bounds
for the maximal deviations between the empirical and true angular measures,
uniformly over classes of Borel sets of controlled combinatorial complexity.
The bounds are valid with high probability and, up to logarithmic factors,
scale as the square root of the effective sample size. The bounds are applied
to provide performance guarantees for two statistical learning procedures
tailored to extreme regions of the input space and built upon the empirical

reproducibility and robustness of research claims in social and behavioral
sciences (SBS), much of which has involved resource-intensive replication
projects. In this paper, we investigate prediction of the reproducibility of
SBS papers using machine learning methods based on a set of features. We
propose a framework that extracts five types of features from scholarly work
that can be used to support assessments of reproducibility of published
research claims. Bibliometric features, venue features, and author features are
collected from public APIs or extracted using open source machine learning
libraries with customized parsers. Statistical features, such as p-values, are
extracted by recognizing patterns in the body text. Semantic features, such as
funding information, are obtained from public APIs or are extracted using
natural language processing models. We analyze pairwise correlations between
individual features and their importance for predicting a set of human-assessed
ground truth labels. In doing so, we identify a subset of 9 top features that
play relatively more important roles in predicting the reproducibility of SBS
papers in our corpus. Results are verified by comparing performances of 10
supervised predictive classifiers trained on different sets of features.

unintentional sulphur vacancies and surface gas adsorption.The synthesis and
characterization of 2D MoS$_2$ semiconductor of p-type are crucial for the
development of relevant p-n junction devices, as well as the practical
applications of 2D MoS$_2$ in the next-generation CMOS integrated circuit.
Here, we synthesize high-quality, wafer-scale, 2D p-type MoS$_2$
(Mo$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$S$_2$) with various niobium (Nb) mole fractions from 0 to 7.6%
by a creative two-step method. The dielectric functions of 2D Mo1-xNbxS2 are
accurately determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. We find that the
increasing fraction of Nb dopant in 2D MoS$_2$ can modulate and promote the
combination of A and B exciton peaks of 2D MoS$_2$. The direct causes of this
impurity-tunable combination are interpreted as the joint influence of
decreasing peak A and broadening peak B. We explain the broadening peak B as
the multiple transitions from the impurity-induced valance bands to the
conductive band minimum at K point of Brillouin zone by comparing and analyzing
the simulated electronic structure of intrinsic and 2D Nb-doped MoS$_2$. A
p-type FET based on the 2D Nb-doped MoS$_2$ was fabricated for
characterization, and its working performance is expected to be adjustable as a
function of concentration of Nb dopant according to our theoretical research.

correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has a
remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image. Surprisingly,
however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades
significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight
networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive
experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual
connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and
ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style
transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose
a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the
feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results
demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of
stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that
the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of
learned weights for the task of style transfer.

been on the end-to-end approach where a single model can predict intents
directly from speech inputs without intermediate transcripts. However, this
approach presents some challenges. First, since speech can be considered as
personally identifiable information, in some cases only automatic speech
recognition (ASR) transcripts are accessible. Second, intent-labeled speech
data is scarce. To address the first challenge, we propose a novel system that
can predict intents from flexible types of inputs: speech, ASR transcripts, or
both. We demonstrate strong performance for either modality separately, and
when both speech and ASR transcripts are available, through system combination,
we achieve better results than using a single input modality. To address the
second challenge, we leverage a semantically robust pre-trained BERT model and
adopt a cross-modal system that co-trains text embeddings and acoustic
embeddings in a shared latent space. We further enhance this system by
utilizing an acoustic module pre-trained on LibriSpeech and domain-adapting the
text module on our target datasets. Our experiments show significant advantages
for these pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, resulting in a system that
achieves competitive intent-classification performance on Snips SLU and Fluent

of the concept of action-at-a-distance, which is at the foundation of nonlocal
elasticity. In contrast to existing approaches that adopts an integral
stress-strain constitutive relation, the displacement-driven approach is
predicated on an integral strain-displacement relation. The most remarkable
consequence of this reformulation is that the (total) strain energy is
guaranteed to be convex and positive-definite without imposing any constraint
on the symmetry of the kernels. This feature is critical to enable the
application of nonlocal formulations to general continua exhibiting asymmetric
interactions; ultimately a manifestation of material heterogeneity. Remarkably,
the proposed approach also enables a strong satisfaction of the locality
recovery condition and of the laws of thermodynamics, which are not foregone
conclusions in most classical nonlocal elasticity theories. Additionally, the
formulation is frame-invariant and the nonlocal operator remains physically
consistent at boundaries. The study is complemented by a detailed analysis of
the dynamic response of the nonlocal continuum and of its intrinsic dispersion
leading to the consideration that the choice of nonlocal kernels should depend
on the specific material. Examples of exponential or power-law kernels are
presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of the method to different
classes of nonlocal media. The ability to admit generalized kernels reinforces
the generalized nature of the displacement-driven approach over existing
integral methodologies, which typically lead to simplified differential models
based on exponential kernels. The theoretical formulation is also leveraged to
simulate the static response of nonlocal beams and plates illustrating the
intrinsic consistency of the approach, which is free from unwanted boundary
effects.

ontology is found. In addition, ontologies' terms and relationships at lower
levels can be semantically enriched by ontologies' terms properties and
relationships from the higher levels. Some TestTDO's terms and are extended
primarily from SituationCO (Situation Core Ontology), and ProcessCO (Process

applications alike. Video coding standards such as H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC are
widely deployed in the market to enable efficient use of bandwidth and storage
for many video applications. To reduce the coding artifacts and improve the
compression efficiency, neural network based loop filtering of the
reconstructed video has been developed in the literature. However, loop
filtering is a challenging task due to the variation in video content and
sampling densities. In this paper, we propose a on-line scaling based
multi-density attention network for loop filtering in video compression. The
core of our approach lies in several aspects: (a) parallel multi-resolution
convolution streams for extracting multi-density features, (b) single attention
branch to learn the sample correlations and generate mask maps, (c) a
channel-mutual attention procedure to fuse the data from multiple branches, (d)
on-line scaling technique to further optimize the output results of network
according to the actual signal. The proposed multi-density attention network
learns rich features from multiple sampling densities and performs robustly on
video content of different resolutions. Moreover, the online scaling process
enhances the signal adaptability of the off-line pre-trained model.
Experimental results show that 10.18% bit-rate reduction at the same video
quality can be achieved over the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard.
The objective performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods and the subjective quality improvement is obvious in
terms of detail preservation and artifact alleviation.

parameter reduction, the computation required remains the same. Interestingly,
we found in experiments that distributions of feature embeddings from different
Transformer layers are similar when PSS is integrated: a property termed as
Layer Consistency (LC) in this paper. Given this similarity of feature
distributions, we assume that feature embeddings from different layers would
have similar representing power. In this work, Layer Consistency enables us to
adopt Transformer-based models in a more efficient manner: the number of

Shallow Layer Inference (SLI) could be applied to reduce the number of layers

  in IoT",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abnormality detection is essential to the performance of safety-critical and
latency-constrained systems. However, as systems are becoming increasingly
complicated with a large quantity of heterogeneous data, conventional
statistical change point detection methods are becoming less effective and
efficient. Although Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are
increasingly employed to handle heterogeneous data, they still lack theoretic
assurable performance and explainability. This paper integrates zero-bias DNN
and Quickest Event Detection algorithms to provide a holistic framework for
quick and reliable detection of both abnormalities and time-dependent abnormal
events in the Internet of Things (IoT). We first use the zero-bias dense layer
to increase the explainability of DNN. We provide a solution to convert
zero-bias DNN classifiers into performance assured binary abnormality
detectors. Using the converted abnormality detector, we then present a
sequential quickest detection scheme that provides the theoretically assured
lowest abnormal event detection delay under false alarm constraints. Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using both massive signal
records from real-world aviation communication systems and simulated data. Code
