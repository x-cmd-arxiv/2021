remnants are commonly considered to be the main place where high-energy cosmic
rays are accelerated. Nevertheless, current models predict cosmic-ray spectra
that do not match observations and the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism
is still undetermined. On the other hand, the contribution of other kinds of
sources to the Galactic cosmic-ray population is still unclear, and merits
investigation. In this work we explore a novel mechanism through which
microquasars might produce cosmic rays. In this scenario, microquasar jets
generate relativistic neutrons, which escape and decay outside the system;
protons and electrons, created when these neutrons decay, escape to the
interstellar medium as cosmic rays. The most promising scenarios arise in
extremely luminous systems ($L_\mathrm{jet} \sim 10^{40}\,\mathrm{erg \,
s}^{-1}$), in which the fraction of jet power deposited in cosmic rays can
reach $\sim 0.001$. Slow jets ($\Gamma \lesssim 2$, where $\Gamma$ is the bulk
Lorentz factor) favour neutron production. The resulting cosmic-ray spectrum is
similar for protons and electrons, which share the power in the ratio given by
neutron decay. The spectrum peaks at roughly half the minimum energy of the
relativistic protons in the jet; it is soft (spectral index $\sim 3$) above
this energy, and almost flat below. Values of spectral index steeper than $2$
are possible for cosmic rays in our model and these indeed agree with those
required to explain the spectral signatures of Galactic cosmic rays, although
only the most extreme microquasars provide power comparable to that of a
typical supernova remnant. The mechanism explored in this work may provide
stronger and softer cosmic-ray sources in the early Universe, and therefore
contribute to the heating and reionisation of the intergalactic medium.

other competitors is applied in various sports with several recent examples of
competitive running in formations. In this study, the aerodynamics of a
realistic model of a female runner is calculated by computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations at four running speeds of 15 km/h, 18 km/h, 21 km/h,
and 36 km/h. Aerodynamic power fractions of the total energy expenditure are
found to be in the range of 2.6-8.5%. Additionally, four exemplary formations
are analysed with respect to their drafting potential and resulting drag values
are compared for the main runner and her pacers. The best of the formations
achieves a total drag reduction on the main runner of 75.6%. Moreover, there
are large variations in the drag reduction between the considered formations of
up to 42% with respect to the baseline single-runner case. We conclude that
major drag reduction of more than 70% can already be achieved with fairly
simple formations, while certain factors, such as runners on the sides, can
have a detrimental effect on drag reduction due to local acceleration of the
passing flow. Using an empirical model for mechanical power output during
running, gains of metabolic power and performance predictions are evaluated for
all considered formations. Improvements in running economy are up to 3.5% for
the best formation, leading to velocity gains of 2.3%. This translates to 154 s
(~2.6 min) saved over a marathon distance. Consequently, direct conclusions are
drawn from the obtained data for ideal drafting of long-distance running in
highly packed formations.

issue has been studied in pioneering works, especially for scattering-type
architectures, for deformation vector fields $\tau(x)$ with some regularity -
at least $C^1$. Here we address this issue for any field $\tau\in
L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, without any additional regularity
assumption, hence including the case of wild irregular deformations such as a
noise on the pixel location of an image. We prove that for signals in
multiresolution approximation spaces $U_s$ at scale $s$, whenever the network
is Lipschitz continuous (regardless of its architecture), stability in $L^2$
holds in the regime $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\ll 1$, essentially as a consequence
of the uncertainty principle. When $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\gg 1$ instability can
occur even for well-structured DCNNs such as the wavelet scattering networks,
and we provide a sharp upper bound for the asymptotic growth rate. The
stability results are then extended to signals in the Besov space
$B^{d/2}_{2,1}$ tailored to the given multiresolution approximation. We also
consider the case of more general time-frequency deformations. Finally, we
provide stochastic versions of the aforementioned results, namely we study the
issue of stability in mean when $\tau(x)$ is modeled as a random field (not
bounded, in general) with with identically distributed variables $|\tau(x)|$,
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$.

features from correlated fading channels to assist the pilot assignment in
multi-sector mMTC systems under pilot reuse of orthogonal sequences. In order
to reduce pilot collisions and to enable pilot reuse, we propose to extract
features from the channel covariance matrices that reflect the level of
orthogonality between the UEs channels. Two features are investigated:
covariance matrix distance (CMD) feature and CMD-aided channel charting (CC)

The proposed UNIFY framework utilizes a grid-cell-based layer to provide

individual execution as well as simultaneous execution of both layers for
optimal adaption to varying environments in autonomous driving applications.

  In this work, we find the momentum term can amplify the inconsistency bias in

The convergence rate for both non-convex and strongly-convex scenarios is

present the first music audio captioning model, MusCaps, consisting of an

modality fusion, decoding strategy and the use of attention - contribute only
marginally. Our model represents a shift away from classification-based music

We demonstrate based on density functional theory that it is important to

magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and the higher-order exchange
interactions. The energy barriers for electric-field assisted skyrmion writing

the damping coefficient is proportional to the square root of the Tikhonov

acid-suppression drugs in the context of COVID-19, with an eye on the
variability (and confusion) across the reported findings--at least as regards
the popular antacid famotidine. The inconsistencies reflect contradictory
conclusions from independent clinical-based studies that took roughly similar
approaches, in terms of experimental design (retrospective, cohort-based, etc.)
and statistical analyses (propensity-score matching and stratification, etc.).
The confusion has significant ramifications in choosing therapeutic
interventions: e.g., do potential benefits of famotidine indicate its use in a
particular COVID-19 case? Beyond this pressing therapeutic issue, conflicting
information on famotidine must be resolved before its integration in
ontological and knowledge graph-based frameworks, which in turn are useful in
drug repurposing efforts. To begin systematically structuring the rapidly
accumulating information, in the hopes of clarifying and reconciling the
discrepancies, we consider the contradictory information along three proposed
'axes': (1) a context-of-disease axis, (2) a degree-of-[therapeutic]-benefit
axis, and (3) a mechanism-of-action axis. We suspect that incongruencies in how
these axes have been (implicitly) treated in past studies has led to the
contradictory indications for famotidine and COVID-19. We also trace the
evolution of information on acid-suppression agents as regards the
transmission, severity, and mortality of COVID-19, given the many literature
reports that have accumulated. By grouping the studies conceptually and
thematically, we identify three eras in the progression of our understanding of
famotidine and COVID-19. Harmonizing these findings is a key goal for both
clinical standards-of-care (COVID and beyond) as well as ontological and
knowledge graph-based approaches.

efficient integration of WFL in the sixth generation of wireless networks (6G).
To this end, in this second part we introduce and optimize a novel
communication protocol for WFL networks, that is based on non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA). More specifically, the Compute-then-Transmit NOMA
(CT-NOMA) protocol is introduced, where users terminate concurrently the local
model training and then simultaneously transmit the trained parameters to the
central server. Moreover, two different detection schemes for the mitigation of
inter-user interference in NOMA are considered and evaluated, which correspond
to fixed and variable decoding order during the successive interference
cancellation process. Furthermore, the computation and communication resources
are jointly optimized for both considered schemes, with the aim to minimize the
total delay during a WFL communication round. Finally, the simulation results
verify the effectiveness of CT-NOMA in terms of delay reduction, compared to
the considered benchmark that is based on time-division multiple access.

hypothesize the effect of natural disasters on entrepreneurship activity
depends on the amount of foreign aid received. Second, we hypothesize that
natural disasters and foreign aid either encourages or discourages
entrepreneurship activity depending on two important institutional conditions:
the quality of government and economic freedom. The findings from our panel of
85 countries from 2006 to 2016 indicate that natural disasters are negatively
associated with entrepreneurship activity, but both foreign aid and economic
freedom attenuate this effect. In addition, we observe that foreign aid is
positively associated with entrepreneurship activity but only in countries with
high quality government. Hence, we conclude that the effect of natural
disasters on entrepreneurship depends crucially on the quality of government,
economic freedom, and foreign aid. Our findings provide new insights into how
natural disasters and foreign aid affect entrepreneurship and highlight the
important role of the institutional context.

the mean and variance of the magnification factor, which are applicable to
Gaussian source profiles and arbitrary non-uniform macro lens models, and hence
can save the need to perform expensive numerical simulations. The results are
given as single and double lens-plane integrals with simple, non-oscillatory

Employing numerical ray-shooting experiments, we examine the case of a highly
magnified source near a macro fold caustic, and demonstrate the excellent
accuracy of this semi-analytic approximation in the regime of multiple micro

achievable near a macro caustic is fundamentally limited by the masses and

problem in the presence of labor income, as introduced in Biffis, Gozzi and

1906-1938.) and Dybvig and Liu (""Lifetime consumption and investment:
retirement and constrained borrowing"", Journal of Economic Theory, 145, pp.
885-907). In particular, in Biffis, Gozzi and Prosdocimi the influence of past
wages on the future ones is modelled linearly in the evolution equation of
labor income, through a given weight function. The optimisation relies on the
resolution of an infinite dimensional HJB equation. We improve the state of art
in three ways. First, we allow the weight to be a Radon measure. This
accommodates for more realistic weighting of the sticky wages, like, e.g., on a
discrete temporal grid according to some periodic income. Second, there is a
general correlation structure between labor income and stocks market. This
naturally affects the optimal hedging demand, which may increase or decrease
according to the correlation sign. Third, we allow the weight to change with
time, possibly lacking perfect identification. The uncertainty is specified by
a given set of Radon measures $K$, in which the weight process takes values.
This renders the inevitable uncertainty on how the past affects the future, and
includes the standard case of error bounds on a specific estimate for the
weight. Under uncertainty averse preferences, the decision maker takes a maxmin
approach to the problem. Our analysis confirms the intuition: in the infinite
dimensional setting, the optimal policy remains the best investment strategy
under the worst case weight.

One natural problem
is to look for a spanning tree $T$ of a given graph $G$ such that $\Lambda(T)$
is as large as possible. This problem is called maximum leaf number, and it is
a well-known NP-hard problem. Throughout recent decades, this problem has
received considerable attention, ranging from pure graph theoretic questions to
practical problems related to the construction of wireless networks.
  Recently, a similar but stronger notion was defined by Bradshaw,
Masa\v{r}\'ik, and Stacho [Flexible List Colorings in Graphs with Special
Degeneracy Conditions, ISAAC 2020]. They introduced a new invariant for a graph
$G$, called the robust connectivity and written $\kappa_\rho(G)$, defined as
the minimum value $\frac{|R \cap \Lambda (T)|}{|R|}$ taken over all nonempty
subsets $R\subseteq V(G)$, where $T = T(R)$ is a spanning tree on $G$ chosen to
maximize $|R \cap \Lambda(T)|$. Large robust connectivity was originally used
to show flexible choosability in non-regular graphs.
  In this paper, we investigate some interesting properties of robust
connectivity for graphs embedded in surfaces. We prove a tight asymptotic bound
of $\Omega(\gamma^{-\frac{1}{r}})$ for the robust connectivity of $r$-connected
graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$. Moreover, we give a surprising connection
between the robust connectivity of graphs with an edge-maximal embedding in a
surface and the surface connectivity of that surface, which describes to what
extent large induced subgraphs of embedded graphs can be cut out from the
surface without splitting the surface into multiple parts. For planar graphs,
this connection provides an equivalent formulation of a long-standing
conjecture of Albertson and Berman [A conjecture on planar graphs, 1979], which
states that every planar graph on $n$ vertices contains an induced forest of
size at least $n/2$.

We propose a new class of metrics and show that under such metrics, the
convergence is free of the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Such a feature is
critical for high-dimensional analysis and stands in contrast to classical
metrics ({\it e.g.}, the Wasserstein distance). The proposed metrics originate
from the maximum mean discrepancy, which we generalize by proposing specific
criteria for selecting test function spaces to guarantee the property of being
free of CoD. Therefore, we call this class of metrics the generalized maximum
mean discrepancy (GMMD). Examples of the selected test function spaces include
the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, Barron space, and flow-induced function
spaces. Three applications of the proposed metrics are presented: 1. The
convergence of empirical measure in the case of random variables; 2. The
convergence of $n$-particle system to the solution to McKean-Vlasov stochastic
differential equation; 3. The construction of an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium
for a homogeneous $n$-player game by its mean-field limit. As a byproduct, we
prove that, given a distribution close to the target distribution measured by
GMMD and a certain representation of the target distribution, we can generate a
distribution close to the target one in terms of the Wasserstein distance and
relative entropy. Overall, we show that the proposed class of metrics is a
powerful tool to analyze the convergence of empirical measures in high
dimensions without CoD.

both the decision-maker and the individuals. However, there has hardly been any
focus on precarity which is the term that encapsulates the instability in
people's lives. That is, a negative outcome can overspread to other decisions
and measures of well-being. Studying precarity necessitates a shift in focus -
from the point of view of the decision-maker to the perspective of the decision
subject. This centering of the subject is an important direction that unlocks
the importance of parting with aggregate measures to examine the long-term
effects of decision making. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a
modeling framework that simulates the effects of compounded decision-making on

decisions on different income classes of the underlying population and how

compressive plasma oscillation in a hot coronal loop triggered by a C-class
flare near one of its foot points as first studied by Kumar et al. We
investigate the oscillation properties in both the 131{\,}{\AA} and 94{\,}{\AA}
channels and find that what appears as a pure sloshing oscillation in the
131{\,}{\AA} channel actually transforms into a standing wave in the
94{\,}{\AA} channel at a later time. This is the first clear evidence of such
transformation confirming the results of a recent numerical study which
suggests that these two oscillations are not independent phenomena. We
introduce a new analytical expression to properly fit the sloshing phase of an
oscillation and extract the oscillation properties. For the AIA 131{\,}{\AA}
channel, the obtained oscillation period and damping time are 608$\pm$4{\,}s
and 431$\pm$20{\,}s, respectively during the sloshing phase. The corresponding
values for the AIA 94{\,}{\AA} channel are 617$\pm$3{\,}s and 828$\pm$50{\,}s.
During the standing phase that is observed only in the AIA 94{\,}{\AA} channel,
the oscillation period and damping time have increased to 791$\pm$5{\,}s and
1598$\pm$138{\,}s, respectively. The plasma temperature obtained from the DEM
analysis indicates substantial cooling of the plasma during the oscillation.
Considering this, we show that the observed oscillation properties and the
associated changes are compatible with damping due to thermal conduction. We
further demonstrate that the absence of a standing phase in the 131{\,}{\AA}
channel is a consequence of cooling plasma besides the faster decay of
oscillation in this channel.

efficient construction and maintenance of expression equivalence classes

global minimality cannot be confirmed. We present a new approach called
rewrite-guided synthesis (ReGiS), in which a unique interplay between SyGuS and
equality saturation-based rewriting helps to overcome these problems, resulting
in an efficient, scalable framework for expression optimization.

couples all generators together to model the whole denoising process, while the

brings about new methods for learning from data that exhibit the advantages of

  We use DL within PGM to build flexible models endowed with an interpretable
latent structure. One model class we develop extends exponential family PCA
using neural networks to improve predictive performance while enforcing the
interpretability of the latent factors. Another model class we introduce
enables accounting for long-term dependencies when modeling sequential data,
which is a challenge when using purely DL or PGM approaches. Finally, DPGM
successfully solves several outstanding problems of probabilistic topic models,
a widely used family of models in PGM.
  DPGM also brings about new algorithms for learning with complex data. We
develop reweighted expectation maximization, an algorithm that unifies several
existing maximum likelihood-based algorithms for learning models parameterized

maximization, a canonical inference algorithm in PGM. We also develop
entropy-regularized adversarial learning, a learning paradigm that deviates

vertices is called a matching problem, and finding the maximum matching is a
fundamental problem in the theory of distributed graph algorithms. Although
local algorithms for the approximate maximum matching problem have been widely
studied, exact algorithms has not been much studied. In fact, no exact maximum
matching algorithm that is faster than the trivial upper bound of O(n^2) rounds
is known for the general instance. In this paper, we propose a randomized
O(s_{max}^{3/2}+log n)-round algorithm in the CONGEST model, where s_{\max} is
the size of maximum matching. This is the first exact maximum matching
algorithm in o(n^2) rounds for general instances in the CONGEST model. The key
technical ingredient of our result is a distributed algorithms of finding an
augmenting path in O(s_{\max}) rounds, which is based on a novel technique of
constructing a sparse certificate of augmenting paths, which is a subgraph of
the input graph preserving at least one augmenting path. To establish a highly
parallel construction of sparse certificates, we also propose a new
characterization of sparse certificates, which might also be of independent
interest.

formation is prevalent in a wider region of the LDN 1147/1158, LDN 1172/1174,

be located toward these clouds. Various star formation studies indicate ongoing
low-mass star formation inside this region. Sources associated with less
near-infrared (IR) excess and less H-alpha emission raise the possibility that
more low-mass YSOs, which were not identified in previous studies, are present
in this region. The aim is to conduct a search for additional young sources
that are kinematically associated with the known YSOs and to characterize their
properties. Based on the Gaia DR2 distances and proper motions, we found that
BD+68 1118, HD 200775, and PV Cep are spatially and kinematically associated

color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. We estimated a distance of 340+/-7 pc
to the whole association that contains BD+68 1118, HD 200775, and PV Cep. Based
on the distance and proper motions of all the known YSOs, a total of 74
additional co-moving sources are found, of which 39 form a loose association
surrounding BD+68 1118. These sources are predominantly M-type with ages of
$\sim$10 Myr and no or very little near-IR excess emission. The positive
expansion coefficients obtained via the projected internal motions of the
sources surrounding BD+68 1118 and HD 200775 show that these sources are
expanding with respect to their HAeBe stars. A spatio-temporal gradient of
these sources toward the center of the Cepheus Flare Shell supports the concept

promises no risks of undefined behaviors if developers use safe APIs only.
Fuzzing is a practical approach for examining the robustness of programs.
However, existing fuzzing tools are not directly applicable to library APIs due
to the absence of fuzz targets. It mainly relies on human efforts to design
fuzz targets case by case which is labor-intensive. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a novel automated fuzz target generation approach for
fuzzing Rust libraries via API dependency graph traversal. We identify several
essential requirements for library fuzzing, including validity and
effectiveness of fuzz targets, high API coverage, and efficiency. To meet these
requirements, we first employ breadth-first search with pruning to find API
sequences under a length threshold, then we backward search longer sequences
for uncovered APIs, and finally we optimize the sequence set as a set covering
problem. We implement our fuzz target generator and conduct fuzzing experiments
with AFL++ on several real-world popular Rust projects. Our tool finally
generates 7 to 118 fuzz targets for each library with API coverage up to 0.92.
We exercise each target with a threshold of 24 hours and find 30
previously-unknown bugs from seven libraries.

exact phase of evolution, which requires more data to refine, SLR stars are
either (i) less than $\sim 2$~Myr or (ii) less than $\sim40$~Myr past the main
core helium flash (CHeF). Our observations set a strong upper limit for the
time of the inferred Li-enrichment phase of $< 40$~Myr post-CHeF, lending
support to the idea that lithium is produced around the time of the CHeF. In
contrast, the more evolved RC stars ($> 40$~Myr post-CHeF) generally have low
lithium abundances (A(Li)~$<1.0$~dex). Between the young, super-Li-rich phase,
and the mostly old, Li-poor RC phase, there is an average reduction of lithium
by about 3 orders of magnitude. This Li-destruction may occur rapidly. We find
the situation to be less clear with stars having Li abundances between the two
extremes of super-Li-rich and Li-poor. This group, the `Li-rich' stars ($3.2

computation, that work is recoverable for efficient computations. However,
practical physical computers, such as modern digital computers or biochemical
systems, are subject to constraints that make them inefficient -- irreversibly
dissipating significant energy. Recent results show that the dissipation in
such systems is bounded by the nonreciprocity of the embedded computation. We
investigate the consequences of this bound for different types of memory,
showing that different memory devices are better suited for different
computations. This correspondence comes from the time-reversal symmetries of
the memory, which depend on whether information is stored positionally or
magnetically. This establishes that the time symmetries of the memory device
play an essential roll in determining energetics. The energetic consequences of
time symmetries are particularly pronounced in nearly deterministic
computations, where the cost of computing diverges as minus log of the error
rate. We identify the coefficient of that divergence as the dissipation
divergence. We find that the dissipation divergence may be zero for a
computation when implemented in one type of memory while it's maximal when
implemented with another. Given flexibility in the type of memory, the
dissipation divergence is bounded below by the average state compression of the
computation. Moreover, we show how to explicitly construct the memory to
achieve this minimal dissipation. As a result, we find that logically
reversible computations are indeed thermodynamically efficient, but logical
irreversibility comes at a much higher cost than previously anticipated.

predicted by the field-theoretic renormalization group analysis for a
self-organized critical system with turbulent motion of the environment. The
system is modelled by the anisotropic stochastic equation for a ""running
sandpile"" introduced by Hwa and Kardar in [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 62}:
1813 (1989)]. The turbulent motion is described by the isotropic
Kazantsev-Kraichnan ""rapid-change"" velocity ensemble for an incompressible
fluid. The original Hwa-Kardar equation allows for independent scaling of the
spatial coordinates $x_{\parallel}$ (the coordinate along the preferred
dimension) and ${\bf x_{\bot}}$ (the coordinates in the orthogonal subspace to
the preferred direction) that becomes impossible once the isotropic velocity
ensemble is coupled to the equation. However, it is found that one of the
regimes of the system's critical behaviour (the one where the isotropic
turbulent motion is irrelevant) recovers the anisotropic scaling through
""dimensional transmutation."" The latter manifests as a dimensionless ratio
acquiring nontrivial canonical dimension. The critical regime where both the
velocity ensemble and the nonlinearity of the Hwa-Kardar equation are relevant
simultaneously is also characterized by ""atypical"" scaling. While the ordinary
scaling with fixed infra-red irrelevant parameters is impossible in this
regime, the ""restricted"" scaling where the times, the coordinates, and the
dimensionless ratio are scaled becomes possible. This result brings to mind
scaling hypotheses modifications (Stell's weak scaling or Fisher's generalized
scaling) for systems with significantly different characteristic scales.

the Milky Way and in five representative globular clusters. We find that the
distribution of Al in metal-rich stars of $\omega$ Cen closely follows what is
observed in the Galaxy. Other $\alpha-$elements and C, N, O, and Ce are also
compared to the Milky Way, and significantly elevated abundances are observed
over what is found in the thick disk for almost all elements. However, we also
find some stars with high metallicity and low [Al/Fe], suggesting that $\omega$
Cen could be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy, but the existence of these
peculiar stars needs an independent confirmation. We also confirm the increase
in the sum of CNO as a function of metallicity previously reported in the
literature and find that the [C/N] ratio appears to show opposite correlations
between Al-poor and Al-rich stars as a function of metallicity.

crucial for promoting a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime
communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore
base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate,
while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the
state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G)
networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we
explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure
deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network
on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem
for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality
of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the
large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and
thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based
on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard
mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear
equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation
and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link
scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme
can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system
overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a
prominent performance close to the optimal solution.

radial velocity measurements obtained using SONG, SOPHIE, FIES, NRES, and
EXPRES, which show a reflex motion of $K=294.1\pm1.1$ m s$^{-1}$. A joint
analysis of the TESS and ground-based photometry and radial velocity
measurements reveals that TOI-1431b has a mass of $M_{p}=3.12\pm0.18$

eclipse with a depth of $127^{+4}_{-5}$ppm as well as the full phase curve of
the planet's thermal emission in the red-optical. This has allowed us to

localization-delocalization transitions for which some of the critical
exponents are known exactly. Not known, however, is the multifractal spectrum,
$\tau_q$, which describes the system-size scaling of inverse participation
ratios $P_q$, i.e., the $q$-moments of critical wavefunction amplitudes. We
here report simulations based on the class C Chalker-Coddington network and
demonstrate that $\tau_q$ is (essentially) a quartic polynomial in $q$.
Analytical results fix all prefactors except the quartic curvature that we
obtain as $\gamma=(2.22\pm{0.15})\cdot10^{-3}$. In order to achieve the
necessary accuracy in the presence of sizable corrections to scaling, we have
analyzed the evolution with system size of the entire $P_q$-distribution

function exhibits a (single-parameter) scaling collapse already in the
pre-asymptotic regime, where finite-size corrections are not negligible. This
observation motivates us to propose a novel approach for extracting $\tau_q$

scenario, where massive unlabeled data are assumed to be given as input all at

is often impractical if not infeasible since many real-world tasks rely on
sequential learning, e.g., data are decentralized or collected in a streaming
fashion. In this paper, we conduct the first thorough and dedicated
investigation on self-supervised pre-training with streaming data, aiming to
shed light on the model behavior under this overlooked setup. Specifically, we
pre-train over 500 models on four categories of pre-training streaming data
from ImageNet and DomainNet and evaluate them on three types of downstream
tasks and 12 different downstream datasets. Our studies show that, somehow
beyond our expectation, with simple data replay or parameter regularization,
sequential self-supervised pre-training turns out to be an efficient
alternative for joint pre-training, as the performances of the former are
mostly on par with those of the latter. Moreover, catastrophic forgetting, a
common issue in sequential supervised learning, is much alleviated in
sequential self-supervised learning (SSL), which is well justified through our
comprehensive empirical analysis on representations and the sharpness of minima
in the loss landscape. Our findings, therefore, suggest that, in practice, for
SSL, the cumbersome joint training can be replaced mainly by sequential
learning, which in turn enables a much broader spectrum of potential
application scenarios.

the mask-updating is handcrafted and independent with image structural

with several distinct merits. Instead of using a hard 0-1 mask, a learnable
attention map module is introduced for learning feature re-normalization and
mask-updating in an end-to-end manner. Learnable reverse attention maps are
further proposed in the decoder for emphasizing on filling in unknown pixels

Bell nonlocality by possessing an asymmetric property. For multipartite EPR
steering, the monogamous situation, where two observers cannot simultaneously
steer the state of the third party, has been investigated rigorously both in
theory and experiment. In contrast to the monogamous situation, the
shareability of EPR steering in reduced subsystems allows the state of one
party to be steered by two or more observers and thus reveals more
configurations of multipartite EPR steering. However, the experimental
implementation of such a kind of shareability has still been absent until now.
Here, in an optical experiment, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration
of the shareability of EPR steering without the constraint of monogamy in a
three-qubit system. Moreover, based on the reduced bipartite EPR steering
detection results, we verify the genuine three-qubit entanglement results. This
work provides a complementary viewpoint for understanding multipartite EPR

4\emph{H}-SiC. The zero-field splitting parameter $D$, the inhomogeneous
dephasing time $T_2^{*}$, the coherence time $T_2$, and the depolarization time
$T_1$ are extensively explored in a temperature range from 5 to 300 K. Two
samples implanted with different nitrogen molecule ion fluences ($\rm
{N_2}^{+}$, $1\times 10^{14}/\rm cm^{2}$ and $1\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}$) are
investigated, whose spin properties are shown to have similar
temperature-dependent behaviors. Still, the sample implanted with a lower ion
fluence has longer $T_{2}$ and $T_{1}$. We provide possible theoretical
explanations for the observed temperature-dependent dynamics. Our work promotes
the understanding of the temperature dependence of spin properties in
solid-state systems, which can be helpful for constructing wide
temperature-range thermometers based on the mature semiconductor material.

a nonlocal free energy. Second, we construct efficient time stepping schemes
satisfying the same dissipation law at the discrete level. In particular, we
prove that the proposed schemes are unconditionally stable for quite general
meshes. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is verified by a series
of numerical experiments.

samples. The practical choices are without-replacement sampling orders, which
are empirically faster and more cache-friendly than uniform-iid-sampling but
often have inferior theoretical guarantees. Without-replacement sampling is
well understood only for SGD without variance reduction. In this paper, we will
improve the convergence analysis and rates of variance reduction under
without-replacement sampling orders for composite finite-sum minimization.
  Our results are in two-folds. First, we develop a damped variant of Finito
called Prox-DFinito and establish its convergence rates with random
reshuffling, cyclic sampling, and shuffling-once, under both convex and
strongly convex scenarios. These rates match full-batch gradient descent and
are state-of-the-art compared to the existing results for without-replacement
sampling with variance-reduction. Second, our analysis can gauge how the cyclic
order will influence the rate of cyclic sampling and, thus, allows us to derive
the optimal fixed ordering. In the highly data-heterogeneous scenario,
Prox-DFinito with optimal cyclic sampling can attain a sample-size-independent
convergence rate, which, to our knowledge, is the first result that can match
with uniform-iid-sampling with variance reduction. We also propose a practical
method to discover the optimal cyclic ordering numerically.

determine the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering for balanced

Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a
balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from
the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in
diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more
practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the
fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of
similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster
cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on
fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we
propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based
clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical
approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step
while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack
problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements. Our experiments on
four educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced
clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good

seen limited application to real-life or high-fidelity simulation

supporting the operation of a smart, sustainable and future electrical grid.
This research tests the suitability of the SAC DRL technique through training
and deployment of the agent on an EnergyPlus based environment of the office
building. The SAC DRL was found to learn an optimal control policy that was
able to minimise energy costs by 9.7% compared to the default rule-based
control (RBC) scheme and was able to improve or maintain thermal comfort limits
over a test period of one week. The algorithm was shown to be robust to the
different hyperparameters and this optimal control policy was learnt through
the use of a minimal state space consisting of readily available variables. The
robustness of the algorithm was tested through investigation of the speed of
learning and ability to deploy to different seasons and climates. It was found
that the SAC DRL requires minimal training sample points and outperforms the
RBC after three months of operation and also without disruption to thermal
comfort during this period. The agent is transferable to other climates and
seasons although further retraining or hyperparameter tuning is recommended.

potential parameters and of the boundary conditions on the structure of the
cosmic string. In this way, we obtain a large class of stable stringlike

${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve shows multiple peaks indicating sub-flares. To
understand the possible physical mechanisms behind flux enhancement, we divided
the activity state of the source into several flux-states and carried out
detailed temporal and spectral studies. Timing analysis of lightcurves suggest
that peaks of sub-flares have rise and decay time on the order of days, with
flux-doubling time $\sim$ 2-days. The 2-days binned ${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve
shows double-lognormal flux distribution. The broadband
spectral-energy-distribution (SED) for three selected flux states can be well
fitted under synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and external-Compton
(EC) emission mechanisms. We obtained the physical parameters of the jet by the
SED modeling and their confidence intervals through ${\chi}^2$-statistics. Our
SED modeling results suggest that during quiescent-state, ${\gamma}$-ray
spectrum can be well explained by considering the EC-scattering of infra-red
(IR) photons from dusty-torus. However, ${\gamma}$-ray spectra corresponding to
flares demand additional target photons from broad-line-region (BLR) along with
IR. These suggest that during flares, the emission-region is close to the edge
of BLR, while for quiescent-state the emission-region is away from BLR. The
best fit results suggest that marginal increase in magnetic-field during the
flaring-episode can result in the flux enhancement. This is possibly associated

in software development, and how teams' attitudes relate to their performance,
increasing attention is being given to the study of team-related artefacts. In
particular, researchers have conducted numerous studies on a range of team
communication channels to explore links between developers' language use and
the incidence of software bugs in the products they delivered. Comparatively
limited attention has been paid, however, to the full range of software tasks
that are commonly performed during the development and delivery of software
systems, in spite of compelling evidence pointing to the need to understand
teams' attitudes more widely. Objective: We were therefore motivated to study
the relationships between task type and team attitudes, and how attitudes
expressed in teams' communications might be related to their task completion
performance when undertaking a range of activities. Method: Our investigation
involved artefacts from 474 IBM Jazz practitioners assembled in 149 teams
working on around 30,000 software development tasks over a three-year period.
We applied linguistic analysis, standard statistical techniques and directed
content analysis to address our research objective. Results: Our evidence
revealed that teams expressed different attitudes when working on various forms
of software tasks, and they were particularly emotional when working to remedy
defects. That said, teams' expression of attitudes was not found to be a strong
predictor of their task completion performance. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at
reducing bug incidence may positively limit teams' emotional disposition when
resolving bugs, thereby reducing the otherwise high demand for emotionally
stable members. (Abridged)

electron positron annihilation to three-jets process at NNLO for different
values of the number of flavors, $N_f$. To determine the distribution along the
entire renormalization group flow from the highest energies to zero energy we
consider the number of flavors near the upper boundary of the conformal window.
In this regime of number of flavors the theory develops a perturbative infrared
interacting fixed point. We then consider also the QED thrust obtained as the
limit $N_c \rightarrow 0$ of the number of colors. In this case the low energy
limit is governed by an infrared free theory. Using these quantum field
theories limits as theoretical laboratories we arrive at an interesting
comparison between the Conventional Scale Setting - (CSS) and the Principle of
Maximum Conformality (PMC$_\infty$) methods. We show that within the
perturbative regime of the conformal window and also out of the conformal
window the PMC$_\infty$ leads to a higher precision, and that reducing the
number of flavors, from the upper boundary to the lower boundary, through the
phase transition the curves given by the PMC$_\infty$ method preserve with
continuity the position of the peak, showing perfect agreement with the
experimental data already at NNLO.

cases, rather than by existing statutes. However, how exactly does the
precedent influence the outcome of a new case? Answering this question is
crucial for guaranteeing fair and consistent judicial decision-making. We are
the first to approach this question computationally by comparing two
longstanding jurisprudential views; Halsbury's, who believes that the arguments
of the precedent are the main determinant of the outcome, and Goodhart's, who
believes that what matters most is the precedent's facts. We base our study on
the corpus of legal cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR),
which allows us to access not only the case itself, but also cases cited in the
judges' arguments (i.e. the precedent cases). Taking an information-theoretic
view, and modelling the question as a case outcome classification task, we find
that the precedent's arguments share 0.38 nats of information with the case's
outcome, whereas precedent's facts only share 0.18 nats of information (i.e.,
58% less); suggesting Halsbury's view may be more accurate in this specific
court. We found however in a qualitative analysis that there are specific
statues where Goodhart's view dominates, and present some evidence these are
the ones where the legal concept at hand is less straightforward.

We empirically show that in improving generalization performance, label

theory to represent cellular connectivity. The resulting theoretical framework
allows us to exploit the symmetry of multicellular bilayer structures in 2D and
3D, thereby deriving analytical conditions that drive the dynamical system to
form laminar patterns consistent with the formulation of cell polarity.
Critically, the conditions are independent of the precise dynamical details,
thus the framework allows for the utmost generality in understanding the
influence of cellular geometry on patterning in lateral-inhibition systems.
Applying the analytic conditions to mammary organoids suggests that intense
cell signalling polarity is required for the maintenance of stratified
cell-types within a static bilayer using a lateral-inhibition mechanism.
Furthermore, by employing 2D and 3D cell-based models, we highlight that the
cellular polarity conditions derived from static domains have the capacity to
generate laminar patterning in dynamic environments. However, they are
insufficient for the maintenance of patterning when subjected to substantial
morphological perturbations. In agreement with the mathematical implications of
strict signalling polarity induced on the cells, we propose an adhesion
dependent Notch-Delta biological process which has the potential to initiate
bilayer stratification in a developing mammary organoid.

network that captures abstractly the geometry and the interaction dynamics of

capable of demonstrating oscillatory dynamics akin to the conservative systems.
In contrast to limit cycle solutions characteristic of nonlinear systems, the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric oscillations form a continuum of non-isolated orbits.
However, precise sculpturing of the real potential and the gain-loss spatial
profiles required for establishing of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is
practically challenging. The optical devices, such as lasers, exhibit
relaxation dynamics and do not operate as the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems.
Here we demonstrate how these constraints can be overcome. We predict that a
pair of optically trapped polariton condensates (a polariton dimer) can be
excited and operated in the oscillating regime typical of the isolated systems.
This regime can be realized in the presence of both dissipative and
conservative coupling between the condensates and can be maintained at an
arbitrary external pump intensity. Every orbit is characterised by a frequency
comb appearing in the spectrum of a dimer in the presence of the conservative
nonlinearity. Our results pave the way for the creation of the optical
computing devices operating under the constant-wave external pumping.

diversity, drift can cause gene variants to disappear, especially when they are

the drift and mutation in a well-mixed population defines its diversity. The
Moran model captures the effects of these two evolutionary forces and has a
counterpart in social dynamics, known as the Voter model with external opinion
influencers. Two extreme outcomes of the Voter model dynamics are consensus and
coexistence of opinions, which correspond to low and high diversity in the
Moran model. Here we use a Shannon's information-theoretic approach to
characterize the smooth transition between the states of consensus and
coexistence of opinions in the Voter model. Mapping the Moran into the Voter

and pressured WC and TaN are to small to induce superconductivity. Electron
doping can efficiently enhance the EPC strength and the predicted Tcs reach the

TaN is boosted by two orders of magnitude and Tc can even be as high as 27 K,
revealing the crucial role of charge doping in the formation of
superconductivity observed in WC and TaN. In stark contrast, pristine WN
exhibits overwhelmingly strong EPC and can be a good superconductor with a high

synergistic effect of strong Fermi nesting and large deformation potential.
Going down from three-dimension (3D) to three-dimension (2D), WN thin film

importantly, monolayer W3N4 host Dirac nodal lines protected by mirror symmetry

contact wrenches from any contact of the object with the environment. This is
different from the extant literature where only the effect of finger-object
contacts is considered. Exploiting the environmental contact is useful in many
manipulation scenarios either to enhance the dexterity of simple hands or
improve the payload capability of the manipulator. In contrast to most existing
approaches, our approach also takes into account the practical constraint that
the maximum contact force that can be applied at a finger-object contact can be
different for each contact. We can also include the effect of external forces
like gravity, as well as the joint torque constraints of the
fingers/manipulators. Furthermore, for a given motion path as a constant screw
motion or a sequence of constant screw motions, we can discretize the path and

of one speaker to another speaker while keeping the linguistic contents
unchanged. VC task is performed through a three-stage pipeline consisting of
speech analysis, speech feature mapping, and speech reconstruction. Nowadays
the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models are widely in use for speech
feature mapping from source to target speaker. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive learning-based GAN model called ALGAN-VC for an efficient one-to-one
VC of speakers. Our ALGAN-VC framework consists of some approaches to improve
the speech quality and voice similarity between source and target speakers. The
model incorporates a Dense Residual Network (DRN) like architecture to the
generator network for efficient speech feature learning, for source to target
speech feature conversion. We also integrate an adaptive learning mechanism to
compute the loss function for the proposed model. Moreover, we use a boosted
learning rate approach to enhance the learning capability of the proposed

simultaneously for a one-to-one VC. The proposed model is tested on Voice

solutions of the solar atmosphere during flares. We used machine-learning
methods to capture the statistical dependencies between 6 spectral lines
sourced from 21 large solar flares observed by NASA's Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). The techniques are based on an information-theoretic
quantity called mutual information (MI), which captures both linear and
nonlinear correlations between spectral lines. The MI is estimated using both a
categorical and numeric method, and performed separately for a collection of
quiet Sun and flaring observations. Both approaches return consistent results,
indicating weak correlations between spectral lines under quiet Sun conditions,
and substantially enhanced correlations under flaring conditions, with some
line-pairs such as Mg II and C II having a normalized MI score as high as 0.5.
We find that certain spectral lines couple more readily than others, indicating
a coherence in the solar atmosphere over many scale heights during flares, and
that all line-pairs are correlated to the GOES derivative, indicating a
positive relationship between correlation strength and energy input. Our
methods provide a highly stable and flexible framework for quantifying
dependencies between the physical quantities of the solar atmosphere, allowing
us to obtain a three-dimensional picture of its state.

near-space and reentry vehicles, the control of spacecraft by thrusters, the
propelling and cooling of MEMS, etc. Since the continuum flow and rarefied flow
often exist simultaneously, the modeling and prediction for such a multi-scale
flow field is very complicated. One important and efficient way of predicting
the multi-scale flow is constructing numerical methods by adapting the
multi-scale properties of the temporal integral solutions (or equivalent
characteristic line solutions) for the model equations in the gas-kinetic
theory. The model equations can be classified into FP-type and BGK-type, and
the numerical methods can have deterministic form or stochastic particle form.
Since these numerical methods are strictly based on model equations, they are
also restricted by the model equations. The difficulty and complexity in
constructing model equation that has complete asymptotic preserving property
for gas mixture with non-equilibrium internal energy will prevent the further
extension of these methods. Therefore, this paper addresses the question
whether a multi-scale numerical method can be established not on the model
equations, but directly adapts the relaxation rates of macroscopic variables
such as stress and heat flux. Since the algorithm of multi-scale particle
method based on BGK-type equation is clear and simple, its collision step is
modified in this work, where the macroscopic variables firstly evolve according
to their relaxation rates, and then the molecules that participate in
inter-molecular collisions get their after-collision velocities from the
after-evolution macroscopic variables. Therefore, this direct relaxation
process does not depend on the model equations anymore. Finally, the validity
and accuracy of the particle method with direct relaxation process are examined
with five test cases.

in many clinical applications such as diagnosis and treatment planning. Though
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved the state-of-the-art
performance for automatic segmentation, they are often limited by the lack of
clinically acceptable accuracy and robustness in complex cases. Therefore,
interactive segmentation is a practical alternative to these methods. However,
traditional interactive segmentation methods require a large amount of user
interactions, and recently proposed CNN-based interactive segmentation methods
are limited by poor performance on previously unseen objects. To solve these
problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based interactive segmentation
method that not only has high efficiency due to only requiring clicks as user
inputs but also generalizes well to a range of previously unseen objects.
Specifically, we first encode user-provided interior margin points via our
proposed exponentialized geodesic distance that enables a CNN to achieve a good
initial segmentation result of both previously seen and unseen objects, then we
use a novel information fusion method that combines the initial segmentation
with only few additional user clicks to efficiently obtain a refined
segmentation. We validated our proposed framework through extensive experiments
on 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks with a wide range of previous
unseen objects that were not present in the training set. Experimental results
showed that our proposed framework 1) achieves accurate results with fewer user
interactions and less time compared with state-of-the-art interactive

psychological studies and human computer interactions (HCI). However, most
current eye trackers focus on 2D point of gaze (PoG) estimation and cannot
provide accurate gaze depth.Concerning future applications such as HCI with 3D
displays, we propose a novel binocular eye tracking device with stereo stimuli
to provide highly accurate 3D PoG estimation. In our device, the 3D stereo
imaging system can provide users with a friendly and immersive 3D visual
experience without wearing any accessories. The eye capturing system can
directly record the users eye movements under 3D stimuli without disturbance. A
regression based 3D eye tracking model is built based on collected eye movement
data under stereo stimuli. Our model estimates users 2D gaze with features
defined by eye region landmarks and further estimates 3D PoG with a multi
source feature set constructed by comprehensive eye movement features and
disparity features from stereo stimuli. Two test stereo scenes with different
depths of field are designed to verify the model effectiveness. Experimental
results show that the average error for 2D gaze estimation was 0.66\degree and
for 3D PoG estimation, the average errors are 1.85~cm/0.15~m over the workspace
volume 50~cm $\times$ 30~cm $\times$ 75~cm/2.4~m $\times$ 4.0~m $\times$ 7.9~m

  Our solutions are general in nature because all the well known results of 4D
Chaplygin driven cosmology are recovered when $d = 0$. We have drawn the best
fit graph using the data obtained by the differential age method (CC) and it is
seen that the graph favours only one extra dimension. That means the Chaplygin
gas is apparently dominated by a 5D world. Relevant to point out that the final
equation in this case are highly nonlinear in nature. Naturally it is not
possible to obtain explicit solution of the 4D scale factor with time. To
circumvent this difficulty, we consider a first order approximation of the key
equation which has made it possible to get time explicit solution of 4D scale
factor in exact form as well as the expression of extra dimensions. It may be
pointed out that for large four dimensional scale factor this solution mimics
$\Lambda$CDM model. An analysis of flip time is also studied both analytically
and graphically in some detail. It clearly shows that early \emph{flip} occurs
for higher dimensions. It is also seen that the rate of dimensional reduction
is faster for higher dimensions. So we may conclude that the effect of
compactification of extra dimension helps the acceleration.

diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based
controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct
feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and
integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature
descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT
outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when
considering diversity in terms of ""illumination"" of the feature space, DM-ME
outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of
possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to
MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map.

minimizing a discrepancy between the (preconditioned) operator and the matrix

its minimization can be efficiently performed online for each parameter value

efficient and stable solution of ill-conditioned parametric systems and an
effective error estimation/certification without the need to estimate expensive
stability constants. The proposed approach involves heavy computations in both

used modalities in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its many advantages.
However, the existence of harmonics and the limited range of responsive
frequencies in SSVEP make it challenging to further expand the number of
targets without sacrificing other aspects of the interface or putting
additional constraints on the system. This paper introduces a novel
multi-frequency stimulation method for SSVEP and investigates its potential to
effectively and efficiently increase the number of targets presented. The
proposed stimulation method, obtained by the superposition of the stimulation
signals at different frequencies, is size-efficient, allows single-step target
identification, puts no strict constraints on the usable frequency range, can
be suited to self-paced BCIs, and does not require specific light sources. In
addition to the stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, the evoked SSVEP
waveforms include frequencies that are integer linear combinations of the
stimulus frequencies. Results of decoding SSVEPs collected from nine subjects
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with only the frequencies and
harmonics as reference, also demonstrate the potential of using such a
stimulation paradigm in SSVEP-based BCIs.

scenarios, and in a $f(R)$ modified gravity model. Dynamical friction gives
rise to a $R_{\rm t}-M_{\rm t}$ relation differing from that of the standard
spherical collapse. In particular, dynamical friction amplifies the effect of
shear, and vorticity already studied in Del Popolo, Chan, and Mota (2020). A
comparison of the $R_{\rm t}-M_{\rm t}$ relationship for the $\Lambda$CDM, and
those for the dark energy, and modified gravity models shows, that the $R_{\rm

energy models, and small differences are seen when comparing with the $f(R)$
models. The effect of shear, rotation, and dynamical friction is particularly
evident at galactic scales, giving rise to a difference between the $R_{\rm

$\simeq 60\%$. Finally, we show how the new values of the $R_{\rm t}-M_{\rm t}$
influence the constraints to the $w$ parameter of the equation of state.

modulators with low frame rates. In this work, we report the development of a
video-rate dual-modal forward-viewing photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence
endo-microscopy probe based on a MMF and a high-speed digital micromirror

characterised with a real-valued intensity transmission matrix algorithm, and
subsequently, optimal binary patterns were calculated to focus light through
the fibre with wavefront shaping. Raster-scanning of a tightly focused beam
(1.5 {\mu}m diameter) at the distal end of the fibre was performed for imaging.
With the DMD running at 10 kHz, the PA imaging speed and spatial resolution of

confounder and the common cause of the second and third qubits. In contrast,
when two entangled qubits are prepared and one of them is sent over a noisy

between variables through density matrices rather than joint probability

significantly speed up training. In this work, we propose width transfer, a

well across various width optimization algorithms and networks. Specifically,
we can achieve up to 320x reduction in width optimization overhead without
compromising the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, making the additional cost of
width optimization negligible relative to initial training. Our findings not

hypothetical situation of these three celestial bodies in perpetual alignment
in syzygy - the three-body problem on a straight line -, for which the
parameter that controls the distances among the planets was found to be given
by a quintic function. The conclusion was that if the Moon were four times more
distant from the Earth (either in conjunction or in opposition), a motion of
this kind would have been possible to exist, such that the Moon would appear
always connected to the Sun. The second motion considered by Euler was Moon
libration, when these planets are aligned in regular syzygy. Here, perhaps for
the first time, Euler introduces an archaic form of a Fourier sine series
expansion to describe the Moon's wagging motion. However, as Euler himself
recognizes, the calculations turned out very tedious, and led him to greatly
simplify his model in order to obtain some numerical values for the phenomenon.

an optical actuator for compensating the phase noise coming from the optical

reduction of the outside loop phase noise in the passive way. To further
address the residual out-of-loop phase noise coming from the interferometer and
the two-way optical frequency comparison setup, we design a low-noise active
temperature stabilization system. Measurements with a back-to-back system show
that the stability in our stabilization system is $2\times10^{-16}$ at 1 s,
reaching $2\times10^{-20}$ after 10,000 s. Adopting these techniques, we
demonstrate transfer of a laser light through a branching fiber network with 50

visual blockage and hydraulic blockage are considered two distinct terms with
no established quantifiable relation among both. This paper attempts to relate
both terms by proposing the use of deep visual features for prediction of
hydraulic blockage at a given culvert. An end-to-end machine learning pipeline
is propounded which takes an image of culvert as input, extract visual features
using deep learning models, pre-process the visual features and feed into
regression model to predict the corresponding hydraulic blockage. Dataset

models and hardware requirement analysis. From the results ANN used with
MobileNet extracted visual features achieved the best regression performance
with $R^{2}$ score of 0.7855. Positive value of $R^{2}$ score indicated the
presence of correlation between visual features and hydraulic blockage and
suggested that both can be interrelated with each other.

cometae, cuius transitum per eclipticam bis observare licuit', in which Euler
addresses the determination of a comet's parabolic orbit, with the Sun at the
focus, from two astronomical observations from the earth, when the comet
crosses the ecliptic at the ascending and descending nodes. The key point of
the calculation is the solution of a fourth degree polynomial, from which the
determination of the orbital parameters are determined from one of its roots.

  Images","propaganda, disinformation, misinformation, fake news, memes,

Texts and Images: the data, the annotation guidelines, the evaluation setup,
the results, and the participating systems. The task focused on memes and had
three subtasks: (i) detecting the techniques in the text, (ii) detecting the
text spans where the techniques are used, and (iii) detecting techniques in the
entire meme, i.e., both in the text and in the image. It was a popular task,
attracting 71 registrations, and 22 teams that eventually made an official
submission on the test set. The evaluation results for the third subtask
confirmed the importance of both modalities, the text and the image. Moreover,
some teams reported benefits when not just combining the two modalities, e.g.,
by using early or late fusion, but rather modeling the interaction between them
in a joint model.

Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) in order to include extra inflationary
fields. The functioning of the code is first described, how and where
modifications are meant to be done are later explained. In the present study,
we focus on the modifications needed for the implementation of a two-field
inflationary model, with canonical kinetic terms and a polynomial potential
with no cross terms, presenting preliminary results for the effect of the
second field on the spectra. The adaptability of the code is exploited, making
use of the classes and structures of C and the generic Runge-Kutta integration
tool provided by the program.
