disasters are crucial to reduce the sufferings of the affected people. However,
lack of labeled data is a significant bottleneck in learning an effective
categorization system for a disaster. This motivates us to study the problem as
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between a previous disaster with labeled
data (source) and a current disaster (target). However, if the amount of
labeled data available is limited, it restricts the learning capabilities of
the model. To handle this challenge, we utilize limited labeled data along with
abundantly available unlabeled data, generated during a source disaster to
propose a novel two-part graph neural network. The first-part extracts
domain-agnostic global information by constructing a token level graph across
domains and the second-part preserves local instance-level semantics. In our
experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques by $2.74\%$ weighted F$_1$ score on average on two standard public
dataset in the area of disaster management. We also report experimental results
for granular actionable multi-label classification datasets in disaster domain
for the first time, on which we outperform BERT by $3.00\%$ on average w.r.t
weighted F$_1$. Additionally, we show that our approach can retain performance
when very limited labeled data is available.

applied on partial differential equations and financial time series generation.
We investigate if GANs can also be used to approximate one-dimensional Ito
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We propose a scheme that approximates
the path-wise conditional distribution of SDEs for large time steps. Standard
GANs are only able to approximate processes in distribution, yielding a weak
approximation to the SDE. A conditional GAN architecture is proposed that
enables strong approximation. We inform the discriminator of this GAN with the
map between the prior input to the generator and the corresponding output
samples, i.e. we introduce a `supervised GAN'. We compare the input-output map
obtained with the standard GAN and supervised GAN and show experimentally that
the standard GAN may fail to provide a path-wise approximation. The GAN is
trained on a dataset obtained with exact simulation. The architecture was
tested on geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)
process. The supervised GAN outperformed the Euler and Milstein schemes in
strong error on a discretisation with large time steps. It also outperformed
the standard conditional GAN when approximating the conditional distribution.
We also demonstrate how standard GANs may give rise to non-parsimonious
input-output maps that are sensitive to perturbations, which motivates the need
for constraints and regularisation on GAN generators.

programs that require highly structured inputs. Most often, the symbolic
execution engine gets overwhelmed by the sheer number of infeasible paths and
fails to explore enough feasible paths to gain any respectable coverage. In
this paper, we propose a system, InVaSion, that attempts to solve this problem
for forking-based symbolic execution engines. We propose an input specification
language (ISL) that is based on a finite-state automaton but includes guarded
transitions, a set of registers and a set of commands to update the register
states. We demonstrate that our language is expressive enough to handle complex
input specifications, like the Tiff image format, while not requiring
substantial human effort; even the Tiff image specification could be specified
in our language with an automaton of about 35 states. InVaSion translates the
given program and the input specification into a non-deterministic program and
uses symbolic execution to instantiate the non-determinism. This allows our
tool to work with any forking-based symbolic execution engine and with no
requirement of any special theory solver. Over our set of benchmarks, on an
average, InVaSion was able to increase branch coverage from 24.97% to 67.84%

been put into the design of preconditioners for the Helmholtz equation. One
option to derive a preconditioner is to apply a multigrid method on a shifted
operator. In such an approach, the wavenumber is shifted by some imaginary
value. This step is motivated by the observation that the shifted problem can
be more efficiently handled by iterative solvers when compared to the standard
Helmholtz equation. However, up to now, it is not obvious what the best
strategy for the choice of the shift parameter is. It is well known that a good
shift parameter depends sensitively on the wavenumber and the discretization
parameters such as the order and the mesh size. Therefore, we study the choice
of a near optimal complex shift such that an FGMRES solver converges with fewer
iterations. Our goal is to provide a map which returns the near optimal shift
for the preconditioner depending on the wavenumber and the mesh size. In order
to compute this map, a data driven approach is considered: We first generate
many samples, and in a second step, we perform a nonlinear regression on this
data. With this representative map, the near optimal shift can be obtained by a
simple evaluation. Our preconditioner is based on a twogrid V-cycle applied to
the shifted problem, allowing us to implement a semi matrix-free method. The
performance of our preconditioned FGMRES solver is illustrated by several
benchmark problems with heterogeneous wavenumbers in two and three space
dimensions.

conventional paradigm, which uses step-shaped pitch perturbation. We recently
developed a versatile measurement method using a mixture of orthogonal

testing the response, the experimenter presents the modulated signal aurally

conducting this test quickly and interactively. We make the tool available as

nature, pursuer(s) and evader(s) are intelligent agents that can learn from
experience, and dynamics (i.e., Newtonian or Lagrangian) is vital for the
pursuer and the evader in some scenarios. To this end, this paper addresses the
pursuit-evasion game of intelligent agents from the perspective of dynamics. A
bio-inspired dynamics formulation of a pursuit-evasion game and baseline
pursuit and evasion strategies are introduced at first. Then, reinforcement
learning techniques are used to mimic the ability of intelligent agents to
learn from experience. Based on the dynamics formulation and reinforcement
learning techniques, the effects of improving both pursuit and evasion
strategies based on experience on pursuit-evasion games are investigated at two
levels 1) individual runs and 2) ranges of the parameters of pursuit-evasion
games. Results of the investigation are consistent with nature observations and
the natural law - survival of the fittest. More importantly, with respect to
the result of a pursuit-evasion game of agents with baseline strategies, this
study achieves a different result. It is shown that, in a pursuit-evasion game
with a dynamics formulation, an evader is not able to escape from a slightly
faster pursuer with an effective learned pursuit strategy, based on agile
maneuvers and an effective learned evasion strategy.

  A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam typically consists of several
sequences that yield different image contrasts. Each sequence is parameterized
through multiple acquisition parameters that influence image contrast,
signal-to-noise ratio, acquisition time, and/or resolution. Depending on the
clinical indication, different contrasts are required by the radiologist to
make a diagnosis. As MR sequence acquisition is time consuming and acquired
images may be corrupted due to motion, a method to synthesize MR images with
adjustable contrast properties is required.
  Methods
  Therefore, we trained an image-to-image generative adversarial network
conditioned on the MR acquisition parameters repetition time and echo time. Our
approach is motivated by style transfer networks, whereas the ""style"" for an
image is explicitly given in our case, as it is determined by the MR
acquisition parameters our network is conditioned on.
  Results
  This enables us to synthesize MR images with adjustable image contrast. We
evaluated our approach on the fastMRI dataset, a large set of publicly
available MR knee images, and show that our method outperforms a benchmark
pix2pix approach in the translation of non-fat-saturated MR images to
fat-saturated images. Our approach yields a peak signal-to-noise ratio and
structural similarity of 24.48 and 0.66, surpassing the pix2pix benchmark model
significantly.
  Conclusion
  Our model is the first that enables fine-tuned contrast synthesis, which can
be used to synthesize missing MR contrasts or as a data augmentation technique
for AI training in MRI.

Universe and in the context of present-day star formation. Supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) are astrophysical objects whose origin is not well understood;
they weigh millions of solar masses and reside in the centers of galaxies. An
important formation scenario for SMBHs is based on collisions and mergers of
stars in a massive cluster, in which the most massive star moves to the center
of the cluster due to dynamical friction. This increases the rate of collisions
and mergers since massive stars have larger collisional cross sections. This
can lead to runaway growth of a very massive star which may collapse to become
an intermediate-mass black hole. Here we investigate the dynamical evolution of
Miyamoto-Nagai models that allow us to describe dense stellar clusters,
including flattening and different degrees of rotation. We find that the
collisions in these clusters depend mostly on the number of stars and the
initial stellar radii for a given radial size of the cluster. By comparison,
rotation seems to affect the collision rate by at most $20\%$. For flatness, we
compared spherical models with systems that have a scale height of about $10\%$
of their radial extent, in this case finding a change in the collision rate of
less than $25\%$. Overall, we conclude that the parameters only have a minor
effect on the number of collisions. Our results also suggest that rotation
helps to retain more stars in the system, reducing the number of escapers by a
factor of $2-3$ depending on the model and the specific realization. After two
million years, a typical lifetime of a very massive star, we find that about
$630$ collisions occur in typical models with $N=10^4$, $R=100$ $\rm~R_\odot$
and a half-mass radius of $0.1$ $\rm~pc$, leading to a mass of about
$6.3\times10^3$ $\rm~M_\odot$ for the most massive object.

optoelectronic properties, but suffer from several stability issues. The
characterization of the degradation processes is challenging because of the
limitations in the spatio-temporal resolution in experiments and the absence of
efficient computational methods to study the reactive processes. Here, we
present the first effort in developing reactive force fields for large scale
molecular dynamics simulations of the phase instability and the defect-induced
degradation reactions in inorganic CsPbI$_{3}$. We find that the phase
transitions are driven by a combination of the anharmonicity of the perovskite
lattice with the thermal entropy. At relatively low temperatures, the Cs
cations tend to move away from the preferential positions with good contacts
with the surrounding metal halide framework, potentially causing its conversion
to a non-perovskite phase. Our simulations of defective structures reveal that,
although both iodine vacancies and interstitials are very mobile in the
perovskite lattice, the vacancies have a detrimental effect on the stability,
initiating the decomposition reactions of perovskites to PbI$_{2}$. Our work
puts ReaxFF forward as an effective computational framework to study reactive
processes in halide perovskites.

months in an effort to slow the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the
United States, the disease remains a danger in a number of counties as
restrictions are lifted to revive the economy. Making a trade-off between
economic recovery and infection control is a major challenge confronting many
hard-hit counties. Understanding the transmission process and quantifying the
costs of local policies are essential to the task of tackling this challenge.
Here, we investigate the dynamic contact patterns of the populations from
anonymized, geo-localized mobility data and census and demographic data to
create data-driven, agent-based contact networks. We then simulate the epidemic
spread with a time-varying contagion model in ten large metropolitan counties
in the United States and evaluate a combination of mobility reduction, mask
use, and reopening policies. We find that our model captures the
spatial-temporal and heterogeneous case trajectory within various counties
based on dynamic population behaviors. Our results show that a decision-making
tool that considers both economic cost and infection outcomes of policies can
be informative in making decisions of local containment strategies for optimal
balancing of economic slowdown and virus spread.

uncorrelated modulations of the site energies, and thus quantum decoherence,
and localization of the exciton. Current consensus is that under physiological
conditions quantum decoherence occurs on the 10 fs time scale, and quantum
coherence plays little role for the observed picosecond energy transfer
dynamics. In this work, we reaffirm this from a different point of view by
finding that the true onset of electronic quantum coherence only occurs at
extremely low temperatures of ~20 K. We have directly determined the exciton
coherence times by two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of the
Fenna-Matthew-Olson complex over an extensive temperature range with a
supporting theoretical modelling. At 20 K, electronic coherences persist out to
200 fs (close to the antenna) and marginally up to 500 fs at the

(DME) smoothing, where both components of the DC function are replaced by their
respective Moreau envelopes. The resulting smooth approximation is shown to be
Lipschitz differentiable, capture stationary points, local, and global minima
of the original DC function, and enjoy some growth conditions, such as
level-boundedness and coercivity, for broad classes of DC functions. We then
develop four algorithms for solving DC programs with and without linear
constraints based on the DME smoothing. In particular, for a smoothed DC
program without linear constraints, we show that the classic gradient descent
method as well as an inexact variant can obtain a stationary solution in the
limit with a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/2})$, where $K$ is the
number of proximal evaluations of both components. Furthermore, when the DC
program is explicitly constrained in an affine subspace, we combine the
smoothing technique with the augmented Lagrangian function and derive two
variants of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), named LCDC-ALM and composite
LCDC-ALM, focusing on different structures of the DC objective function. We
show that both algorithms find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary solution of

Inspired by the extensive applications of the generative adversarial networks

training framework with the self-attention mechanism to boost the noise
robustness of the ASR system. Generally, it consists of a self-attention speech
enhancement GAN and a self-attention end-to-end ASR model. There are two
highlights which are worth noting in this proposed framework. One is that it
benefits from the advancement of both self-attention mechanism and GANs; while
the other is that the discriminator of GAN plays the role of the global
discriminant network in the stage of the adversarial joint training, which
guides the enhancement front-end to capture more compatible structures for the
subsequent ASR module and thereby offsets the limitation of the separate
training and handcrafted loss functions. With the adversarial joint
optimization, the proposed framework is expected to learn more robust
representations suitable for the ASR task. We execute systematic experiments on

low-rank SVDs that easily fit in memory. We analyze the convergence of the
standard RRSS algorithm and we give examples where the standard algorithm does
not converge. We show that convergence requires a modification of the standard

specifies a consistent choice of sign for the left singular vectors of the
low-rank SVDs in the iteration. Under these conditions, we prove linear
convergence of the singular vectors using a technique motivated by alternating

the singular values and show linear convergence to the soft thresholded
singular values of the original matrix. This last step requires a perturbation

  systems",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Animal brains evolved to optimize behavior in dynamically changing
environments, selecting actions that maximize future rewards. A large body of
experimental work indicates that such optimization changes the wiring of neural
circuits, appropriately mapping environmental input onto behavioral outputs. A
major unsolved scientific question is how optimal wiring adjustments, which
must target the connections responsible for rewards, can be accomplished when
the relation between sensory inputs, action taken, environmental context with
rewards is ambiguous. The computational problem of properly targeting cues,
contexts and actions that lead to reward is known as structural, contextual and
temporal credit assignment respectively. In this review, we survey prior
approaches to these three types of problems and advance the notion that the
brain's specialized neural architectures provide efficient solutions. Within
this framework, the thalamus with its cortical and basal ganglia interactions
serve as a systems-level solution to credit assignment. Specifically, we
propose that thalamocortical interaction is the locus of meta-learning where
the thalamus provides cortical control functions that parametrize the cortical
activity association space. By selecting among these control functions, the
basal ganglia hierarchically guide thalamocortical plasticity across two
timescales to enable meta-learning. The faster timescale establishes contextual
associations to enable rapid behavioral flexibility while the slower one
enables generalization to new contexts. Incorporating different thalamic
control functions under this framework clarifies how thalamocortical-basal
ganglia interactions may simultaneously solve the three credit assignment
problems.

  Network training and solutions to the macroscale transport equations were
computed for two different tissues. The two tissue types (brain and liver)
exhibit markedly different geometrical complexity and spatial scale (cell size

generalizability, and it is able to predict the effectiveness factor with high
fidelity for realistically-structured tissues despite the significantly
different scale and geometry of the two example tissue types; and 2) the
approach results in an upscaled PDE with an effectiveness factor that is
predicted (implicitly) via the trained neural network. This latter result

an approach of detecting anomalies in videos by learning a novel LSTM based

implementations, standard LSTM's forget gate is susceptible to overlooking and
dismissing relevant content in long sequence tasks like abnormality detection.
The forget gate mitigates participation of previous hidden state for
computation of cell state prioritizing current input. In addition, the
hyperbolic tangent activation of standard LSTMs sacrifices performance when a
network gets deeper. To tackle these two limitations, we introduce a bi-gated,
light LSTM cell by discarding the forget gate and introducing sigmoid
activation. Specifically, the LSTM architecture we come up with fully sustains
content from previous hidden state thereby enabling the trained model to be
robust and make context-independent decision during evaluation. Removing the
forget gate results in a simplified and undemanding LSTM cell with improved
performance effectiveness and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations
show that the proposed bi-gated LSTM based network outperforms various LSTM

formulations of solutions to ill-posed problems. The proposed framework
naturally stems from posing the process of learning from incomplete data as a
joint optimization task of the parameters of the model being learned and the

the common envelope (CE) phase is modeled using a standard prescription based
upon the conservation of energy, known as the alpha prescription. In this
prescription, the orbital separation of the secondary and giant core at the end
of the CE phase is taken to be the orbital separation when the envelope becomes
unbound. However, recent observations of planetary nebulae with binary cores
(BPNe), believed to be the immediate products of CE evolution, indicate orbital
periods that are significantly shorter than predicted by population synthesis
models using the alpha prescription. We argue that unbinding the envelope
provides a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to escape a merger during
CE evolution. The spiral-in of the secondary must also be halted. This requires
the additional dynamical constraint that the frictional torque on the secondary
be reduced to approximately zero. In this paper, we undertake a preliminary
examination of the effect of adding this dynamical constraint in population
synthesis calculations of BPNe. We assume that the frictional torque will be
sufficiently reduced when the secondary enters a region within the giant where
the mass-radius profile is flat. We crudely estimate the location of this
region as a function of the core mass based upon existing stellar models of AGB
stars between 1 and 7 solar masses. We calculate a theoretical orbital period
distribution of BPNe using a population synthesis code that incorporates this

evolutionary and developmental constraints under natural selection. We describe
how the optimization techniques used to construct NN models capture some key

performance on visual perceptual tasks, critics worry that these models fail to
illuminate brain function. We take it that a central approach to explanation in
systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the
system is taken to require fleshing out the parts, organization, and activities
of a system, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it
remains somewhat controversial what it means for a model to describe a
mechanism, and whether neural network models qualify as explanatory.
  We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good
examples of mechanistic models, when the right notion of mechanistic mapping is
deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we
describe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria
require us, first, to identify a level of description that is both abstract but
detailed enough to be ""runnable"", and then, to construct model-to-brain
mappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping
across individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are those
already in use in experimental neuroscience, and are of the kind deployed in
the construction of more familiar computational models, just as the principles
of inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed
in the collection and analysis of data across animals.
  In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and
intelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations. Taken
together, mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the
dependencies between form and function illuminated by optimization processes
can help us to understand why brain systems are built they way they are.

threat, since they can be deployed by adding imperceptible perturbations to the
test data of any network, and the risk they introduce cannot be assessed
through the network's original training performance. Denoising and
dimensionality reduction are two distinct methods that have been independently
investigated to combat such attacks. While denoising offers the ability to
tailor the defense to the specific nature of the attack, dimensionality
reduction offers the advantage of potentially removing previously unseen
perturbations, along with reducing the training time of the network being
defended. We propose strategies to combine the advantages of these two defense
mechanisms. First, we propose the cascaded defense, which involves denoising
followed by dimensionality reduction. To reduce the training time of the
defense for a small trade-off in performance, we propose the hidden layer
defense, which involves feeding the output of the encoder of a denoising
autoencoder into the network. Further, we discuss how adaptive attacks against
these defenses could become significantly weak when an alternative defense is
used, or when no defense is used. In this light, we propose a new metric to
evaluate a defense which measures the sensitivity of the adaptive attack to
modifications in the defense. Finally, we present a guideline for building an
ordered repertoire of defenses, a.k.a. a defense infrastructure, that adjusts
to limited computational resources in presence of uncertainty about the attack
strategy.

However, these linear metrics learned by leveraging fixed bounds or margins may
not perform well in real-world applications, especially when data distributions

traditional online metric learning methods, OAML is significantly more
challenging since the learned metric could be non-linear and the model has to
be self-adaptive as more instances are observed. In this paper, we present a
new online metric learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenge by
learning an ANN-based metric with adaptive model complexity from a stream of

waves are right-hand polarized in the plasma frame. In particular, this
signature property is key for the identification of KAW from in situ
measurements of plasma waves. From the theoretical point of view, both the
dispersion relation and the polarization of KAW has been mostly studied in
proton-electron plasmas. However, most astrophysical and space plasmas are
multi-species, and therefore in these systems the dispersion properties of the
KAW may not depend only on the macroscopic parameters of proton and electron
distributions, but also on the parameters of heavier ions. Here, using Vlasov
linear theory we study the dispersion properties of Alfv\'enic modes in
multi-species plasmas composed by electrons, protons, and O$^+$ ions, with
macroscopic plasma parameters relevant to the inner magnetosphere. In
consistency with recent observations, our numerical results show that the
presence of O$^+$ ions allows the existence of KAW in a wider wave-number range
and at smaller wave-normal angles compared to the electron-proton case, but at
the same time isotropic O$^+$ ions tend to reduce (or even inhibiting) the
growth rates of unstable KAW triggered by anisotropic protons. These results
suggest that magnetospheric ions may play an important role on the energy
transfer from large macroscopic scales to sub-ionic and electronic scales,

represented as a matrix operating on the vector of the camera pose. We
demonstrate that the camera movement can further be parametrized by a matrix
Lie algebra that underlies a rotation system in the neural space. The vector
representations are then concatenated and generate the posed 2D image through a

mortality and one of the leading causes of hospitalization. Early detection of
HF symptoms and pro-active management may reduce adverse events. Approach:
Twenty-eight participants were monitored using a smartphone app after discharge
from hospitals, and each clinical event during the enrollment (N=110 clinical
events) was recorded. Motion, social, location, and clinical survey data
collected via the smartphone-based monitoring system were used to develop and
validate an algorithm for predicting or classifying HF decompensation events
(hospitalizations or clinic visit) versus clinic monitoring visits in which
they were determined to be compensated or stable. Models based on single
modality as well as early and late fusion approaches combining patient-reported
outcomes and passive smartphone data were evaluated. Results: The highest AUCPr
for classifying decompensation with a late fusion approach was 0.80 using leave
one subject out cross-validation. Significance: Passively collected data from
smartphones, especially when combined with weekly patient-reported outcomes,
may reflect behavioral and physiological changes due to HF and thus could
enable prediction of HF decompensation.

genome-scale transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, with the hope of
deconvolving cellular dynamic changes in corresponding cell sub-populations to
better understand molecular mechanisms of different development processes.
Several scRNA-seq analysis methods have been proposed to first identify cell
sub-populations by clustering and then separately perform differential
expression analysis to understand gene expression changes. Their corresponding
statistical models and inference algorithms are often designed disjointly. We
develop a new method -- SimCD -- that explicitly models cell heterogeneity and
dynamic differential changes in one unified hierarchical gamma-negative
binomial (hGNB) model, allowing simultaneous cell clustering and differential
expression analysis for scRNA-seq data. Our method naturally defines cell
heterogeneity by dynamic expression changes, which is expected to help achieve
better performances on the two tasks compared to the existing methods that
perform them separately. In addition, SimCD better models dropout (zero
inflation) in scRNA-seq data by both cell- and gene-level factors and obviates
the need for sophisticated pre-processing steps such as normalization, thanks
to the direct modeling of scRNA-seq count data by the rigorous hGNB model with
an efficient Gibbs sampling inference algorithm. Extensive comparisons with the
state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real-world scRNA-seq count data
demonstrate the capability of SimCD to discover cell clusters and capture
dynamic expression changes. Furthermore, SimCD helps identify several known
genes affected by food deprivation in hypothalamic neuron cell subtypes as well
as some new potential markers, suggesting the capability of SimCD for
bio-marker discovery.

the past and future frames. Many state-of-the-art methods achieve promising
results by estimating the optical flow between the known frames and then
generating the backward flows between the middle frame and the known frames.
However, these methods usually suffer from the inaccuracy of estimated optical
flows and require additional models or information to compensate for flow
estimation errors. Following the recent development in using deformable
convolution (DConv) for video interpolation, we propose a light but effective
model, called Pyramid Deformable Warping Network (PDWN). PDWN uses a pyramid
structure to generate DConv offsets of the unknown middle frame with respect to
the known frames through coarse-to-fine successive refinements. Cost volumes
between warped features are calculated at every pyramid level to help the
offset inference. At the finest scale, the two warped frames are adaptively
blended to generate the middle frame. Lastly, a context enhancement network
further enhances the contextual detail of the final output. Ablation studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of the coarse-to-fine offset refinement, cost
volumes, and DConv. Our method achieves better or on-par accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets while the number of model
parameters and the inference time are substantially less than previous models.
Moreover, we present an extension of the proposed framework to use four input
frames, which can achieve significant improvement over using only two input
frames, with only a slight increase in the model size and inference time.

to correlated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the
theory of multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20
years that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a
repeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a
normal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form
games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect
information. Because of the sequential nature and presence of private
information in the game, correlation in extensive-form games possesses
significantly different properties than its counterpart in normal-form games,
many of which are still open research directions. Extensive-form correlated
equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart
to the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games.
Compared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are
significantly more complex, as the correlation device must keep into account
the evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout
the game. Due to that significant added complexity, the existence of uncoupled
learning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research
question for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving
the first uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in
n-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that
each iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree,
and that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics,
the empirical frequency of play is proven to be a O(T^-0.5)-approximate EFCE
with high probability after T game repetitions, and an EFCE almost surely in
the limit.

information (AoI) and total energy consumption of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices is studied. In the considered model, each IoT device monitors a
physical process that follows nonlinear dynamics. As the dynamics of the
physical process vary over time, each device must find an optimal sampling
frequency to sample the real-time dynamics of the physical system and send
sampled information to a base station (BS). Due to limited wireless resources,
the BS can only select a subset of devices to transmit their sampled
information. Thus, edge devices must cooperatively sample their monitored
dynamics based on the local observations and the BS must collect the sampled
information from the devices immediately, hence avoiding the additional time
and energy used for sampling and information transmission. To this end, it is
necessary to jointly optimize the sampling policy of each device and the device
selection scheme of the BS so as to accurately monitor the dynamics of the
physical process using minimum energy. This problem is formulated as an
optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the weighted sum of AoI cost and
energy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose a novel distributed
reinforcement learning (RL) approach for the sampling policy optimization. The
proposed algorithm enables edge devices to cooperatively find the global
optimal sampling policy using their own local observations. Given the sampling
policy, the device selection scheme can be optimized thus minimizing the
weighted sum of AoI and energy consumption of all devices. Simulations with

which plays a critical role in many real-world applications. However, depth map
captured by consumer-grade RGB-D cameras suffers from low spatial resolution.
Guided depth map super-resolution (DSR) is a popular approach to address this
problem, which attempts to restore a high-resolution (HR) depth map from the
input low-resolution (LR) depth and its coupled HR RGB image that serves as the
guidance.
  The most challenging problems for guided DSR are how to correctly select
consistent structures and propagate them, and properly handle inconsistent
ones. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based hierarchical
multi-modal fusion (AHMF) network for guided DSR. Specifically, to effectively
extract and combine relevant information from LR depth and HR guidance, we
propose a multi-modal attention based fusion (MMAF) strategy for hierarchical
convolutional layers, including a feature enhance block to select valuable
features and a feature recalibration block to unify the similarity metrics of
modalities with different appearance characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
bi-directional hierarchical feature collaboration (BHFC) module to fully
leverage low-level spatial information and high-level structure information
among multi-scale features. Experimental results show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
running speed and memory efficiency.

slow down integration. In this paper, we study patches with divergent review

that patches with divergent review scores: (1) account for 15%-37% of patches

transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

formulation contrasts with prior active approaches that minimise the sum of
conditional entropies of the (marginal) state estimates provided by Bayesian
filters. By establishing a novel form of the smoother entropy in terms of the
POMDP belief (or information) state, we show that our active smoothing problem
can be reformulated as a (fully observed) Markov decision process with a value
function that is concave in the belief state. The concavity of the value
function is of particular importance since it enables the approximate solution
of our active smoothing problem using piecewise-linear function approximations
in conjunction with standard POMDP solvers. We illustrate the approximate

large-scale and diverse training data can significantly improve the
generalization of person re-identification. However, the efficiency of learning
deep matchers on large-scale data has not yet been adequately studied. Though
learning with classification parameters or class memory is a popular way, it
incurs large memory and computational costs. In contrast, pairwise deep metric
learning within mini batches would be a better choice. However, the most
popular random sampling method, the well-known PK sampler, is not informative
and efficient for deep metric learning. Though online hard example mining has
improved the learning efficiency to some extent, the mining in mini batches
after random sampling is still limited. This inspires us to explore the use of
hard example mining earlier, in the data sampling stage. To do so, in this
paper, we propose an efficient mini-batch sampling method, called graph
sampling (GS), for large-scale deep metric learning. The basic idea is to build
a nearest neighbor relationship graph for all classes at the beginning of each
epoch. Then, each mini batch is composed of a randomly selected class and its
nearest neighboring classes so as to provide informative and challenging
examples for learning. Together with an adapted competitive baseline, we
improve the state of the art in generalizable person re-identification
significantly, by 25.1% in Rank-1 on MSMT17 when trained on RandPerson.
Besides, the proposed method also outperforms the competitive baseline, by 6.8%

families of such functions naturally emerge in the context of
Higgs--Chern-Simons gravity models, which are found as dimensionally descents
of higher dimensional, purely topological, Chern-Pontryagin non-Abelian
densities. As a proof of concept, we study spherically symmetric scalarized BH
solutions in a particular Einstein-GB-scalar field model, whose coupling is
obtained from this construction, pointing out novel features and caveats
thereof. The possibility of vectorization is also discussed, since this
construction also originates vector fields non-minimally coupled to the GB
invariant.

brought together. Aesthetic experience arises from the aggregation of
underlying visual components. However, most existing deep image aesthetic
assessment (IAA) methods over-simplify the IAA process by failing to model
image aesthetics with clearly-defined visual components as building blocks. As
a result, the connection between resulting aesthetic predictions and underlying
visual components is mostly invisible and hard to be explicitly controlled,
which limits the model in both performance and interpretability. This work aims
to model image aesthetics from the level of visual components. Specifically,
object-level regions detected by a generic object detector are defined as
visual components, namely object-level visual components (OVCs). Then generic
features representing OVCs are aggregated for the aesthetic prediction based
upon proposed object-level and graph attention mechanisms, which dynamically
determines the importance of individual OVCs and relevance between OVC pairs,
respectively. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our framework
over previous relevant methods in terms of SRCC and PLCC on the aesthetic
rating distribution prediction. Besides, quantitative analysis is done towards
model interpretation by observing how OVCs contribute to aesthetic predictions,
whose results are found to be supported by psychology on aesthetics and
photography rules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at
the interpretation of a deep IAA model.

address this challenge, in contrast to traditional AND/OR graph-based planners,
we grow the AND/OR graph online until the target grasp is feasible and thereby

first weak segmentation algorithm provides good results for propagating sparse
user provided labels to other voxels in the same volume. This weak segmentation
algorithm is used to generate dense pseudo labels. A second powerful
deep-learning based segmentation algorithm can learn from these pseudo labels
to generalize the segmentation to other unseen volumes, a task that the weak
segmentation algorithm fails at completely. The proposed volume visualization
uses the deep-learning based segmentation as a component for segmentation-aware
transfer function design. Appropriate ramp parameters can be suggested
automatically through histogram analysis. Finally, our visualization uses
gradient-free ambient occlusion shading to further suppress visual presence of
noise, and to give structural detail desired prominence. The cryo-ET data
studied throughout our technical experiments is based on the highest-quality
tilted series of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions. Our technique shows the high impact

The task of referring expression generation is simplified into the process of
generating diverse spatial relation units. First, we pick out all landmarks in

its updating through a stack model. Then all possible referring expressions are
generated according to different reference frame strategies. Finally, we
evaluate every expression using a probabilistic referring expression resolution

field-reentrant behavior due to the competition with the emergence of magnetic
order at low fields. The upper critical field Hc2 for H // c-axis shows a

superconductivity is reinforced by the strong fluctuations which persist even

Surprisingly, field-induced superconductivity is observed at high fields, where
a spin-polarized state is realized due to the suppression of the magnetic

whereas the magnetic ordered phase at low field seems to be unfavorable. The
huge Hc2 in the spin-polarized state seems to imply a spin-triplet state.

effect of the multiple domain discriminators on MDA: disintegration of
domain-discriminative information, limited computational scalability, and a
large variance in the gradient of the loss during training. We examine the
above issues by situating adversarial DA in the context of information
regularization. This also provides a theoretical justification for using a
single and unified domain discriminator. Based on this idea, we implement a
novel neural architecture called a Multi-source Information-regularized
Adaptation Networks (MIAN). Large-scale experiments demonstrate that MIAN,
despite its structural simplicity, reliably and significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods.

consecutively renews its dynamics. We show that, although resetting renders GBM
stationary, the resulting process remains non-ergodic. Quite surprisingly, the
effect of resetting is pivotal in manifesting the non-ergodic behavior. In
particular, we observe three different long-time regimes: a quenched state, an
unstable and a stable annealed state depending on the resetting strength.
Notably, in the last regime, the system is self-averaging and thus the sample
average will always mimic ergodic behavior establishing a stand alone feature

defense method against strong adversarial attacks, its computational cost is

depending on the optimization setting. To overcome such limitations, we deviate
from the existing input-space-based adversarial training regime and propose a

demonstrate that the L1 norm of feature gradients is implicitly regularized

ensuring reliable performance, compared to the existing single-step adversarial

Li-ion cells are unsatisfactory because they are not compatible with energy
conservation. This work aims to provide a consistent theoretical treatment of
energy transport and losses in such devices. An energy conservation law is
derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model of a Li-ion cell using a
rigorous mathematical approach. The resulting law allows irreversible chemical
energy losses to be located to seven different regions of the cell, namely: (i)
the electrolyte, (ii) the anode particles, (iii) the cathode particles, (iv)
the solid parts of the anode (ohmic losses), (v) the solid parts of the cathode
(ohmic losses), (vi) the surfaces of the anode particles (polarisation losses),
and (vii) the surfaces of the cathode particles (polarisation losses).
Numerical solutions to the DFN model are used to validate the conservation law
in the cases of a drive cycle and constant current discharges, and to compare
the energy losses occurring in different locations. It is indicated how cell
design can be improved, for a specified set of operating conditions, by
comparing the magnitude of energy losses in the different regions of the cell.

used to better visualize disease in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
However, gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised safety
concerns about the use of GBCAs. Therefore, the development of novel approaches
that can decrease or even eliminate GBCA exposure while providing similar
contrast information would be of significant use clinically. \textit{Methods:}
In this work, we present a deep learning based approach for contrast-enhanced
T1 synthesis on brain tumor patients. A 3D high-resolution fully convolutional
network (FCN), which maintains high resolution information through processing
and aggregates multi-scale information in parallel, is designed to map
pre-contrast MRI sequences to contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. Specifically,
three pre-contrast MRI sequences, T1, T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient map
(ADC), are utilized as inputs and the post-contrast T1 sequences are utilized
as target output. To alleviate the data imbalance problem between normal
tissues and the tumor regions, we introduce a local loss to improve the
contribution of the tumor regions, which leads to better enhancement results on
tumors. \textit{Results:} Extensive quantitative and visual assessments are
performed, with our proposed model achieving a PSNR of 28.24dB in the brain and
21.2dB in tumor regions. \textit{Conclusion and Significance:} Our results
suggest the potential of substituting GBCAs with synthetic contrast images

high-speed impingement on a surface is a phenomenon that has been researched
extensively and occurs in a number of industrial settings. The role that
surface deformation plays in an air cushioned impact of a liquid droplet is
considered here. In a two-dimensional framework, assuming small density and
viscosity ratios between the air and the liquid, a reduced system of
integro-differential equations is derived governing the liquid droplet
free-surface shape, the pressure in the thin air film and the deformation of
the surface, assuming the effects of surface tension, compressibility and
gravity to be negligible. The deformation of the surface is first described in
a rather general form, based on previous membrane-type models. The coupled
system is then investigated in two cases: a soft viscoelastic case where the
substrate stiffness and (viscous) damping are considered and a more general
flexible surface where all relevant parameters are retained. Numerical
solutions are presented, highlighting a number of key consequences of substrate
deformability on the pre-impact phase of droplet impact, such as reduction in
pressure buildup, increased air entrapment and considerable delay to touchdown.
Connections (including subtle dependence of the size of entrapped air on the
droplet velocity, reduced pressure peaks and droplet gliding) with recent
experiments and a large deformation analysis are also presented.

illustrate the Carleman linearization of the Markov process, this paper embeds
the Carleman linearization into a nonlinear swing stochastic differential

that culminated in a preceding earthquake of magnitude M6.5 and a subsequent

causative Futagawa-Hinagu fault zone. Monitoring changes in seismicity pattern
along this zone plays a role in understanding the process before and after
major earthquakes. For this purpose, stress-dependent laws in statistical
seismology can be used: the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size law and the
Omori-Utsu aftershock-decay law. We review the results obtained by using these
laws in previous studies to show a zone of high stress near the eventual
epicenters of the M6.5 and M7.3 earthquakes before the start of the Kumamoto
sequence, and after it, showing a decreasing trend in stress along the
Futagawa-Hinagu fault zone. Detailed analysis suggests aseismic slips along the
causative fault zone. The aseismic preslip locally reduced stress just prior to
the M7.3 earthquake near its epicenter. Recently, a system was proposed by
Gulia and Wiemer (2019) that utilizes the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size law
to judge, immediately after a large earthquake, whether it was the mainshock or
a foreshock to a future event. Based on the reviewed results and our new
results, further research that takes into account the spatial variation of
frequency-size distribution, allowing the exploration of the possibility of a
local preslip of a future nearby earthquake, is needed to improve this system.

Disease 2019) pandemic disrupted normal human lives, and motivated by the
urgent need of combating COVID-19, researchers have put significant efforts in
modelling and analysing the disease spread patterns for effective preventive
measures (in addition to developing pharmaceutical solutions, like vaccine). In

extracting and incorporating the knowledge of heterogeneous datasources to

Spatio-temporal data and computing infrastructure using fog/edge based
architecture; and (ii) Spatio-temporal data analytics module to efficiently
extract knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. Typically, we develop a
Pandemic-knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility information

Femtolet and fog/edge based solutions. The experimental evaluations on

  metapopulation formation","35 pages, 21 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea of a metapopulation has become canonical in ecology. Its original
mean field form provides the important intuition that migration and extinction
interact to determine the dynamics of a population composed of subpopulations.
From its conception, it has been evident that the very essence of the
metapopulation paradigm centers on the process of local extinction. We note
that there are two qualitatively distinct types of extinction, gradual and
catastrophic, and explore their impact on the dynamics of metapopulation
formation using discrete iterative maps. First, by modifying the classic
logistic map with the addition of the Allee effect, we show that catastrophic
local extinctions in subpopulations are a pre-requisite of metapopulation
formation. When subpopulations experience gradual extinction, increased
migration rates force synchrony and drive the metapopulation below the Allee
point resulting in migration induced destabilization of the system across
parameter space. Second, a sawtooth map (an extension of the Bernoulli bit
shift map) is employed to simultaneously explore the increasing and decreasing
modes of population behavior. We conclude with four generalizations. 1. At low
migration rates, a metapopulation may go extinct faster than completely
unconnected subpopulations. 2. There exists a gradient between stable
metapopulation formation and population synchrony, with critical transitions
from no metapopulation to metapopulation to synchronization, the latter
frequently inducing metapopulation extinction. 3. Synchronization patterns
emerge through time, resulting in synchrony groups and chimeric populations
existing simultaneously. 4. There are two distinct mechanisms of
synchronization: i. extinction and rescue and, ii.) stretch reversals in a
modification of the classic chaotic stretching and folding.

constraint is captured by iLTL, a variation of linear temporal logic for state
distributions. Our Reinforcement learning method first constructs the belief
MDP of the POMDP, capturing the time evolution of estimated state

the limiting deterministic B\uchi automaton (LDBA) of the temporal logic

a state-dependent constraint on the product belief MDP. Finally, we learn the

the finite transformation strain, is in a nascent state. Beyond the theoretical
difficulties imposed by highly nonlinear material response, a major hindrance
has been the absence of experimental observations that can elucidate the
intricacies that arise in this regime. To address this limitation, our
experimental observations reveal the key morphogenesis steps of Vibrio cholerae
biofilms embedded in hydrogels, as they grow by four orders of magnitude from
their initial size. Using the biofilm growth as a case study, our theoretical
model considers various growth scenarios and employs two different and
complimentary methods -- a minimal analytical model and finite element
computations -- to obtain approximate equilibrium solutions. A particular
emphasis is put on determining the natural growth path of an inclusion that
optimizes its shape in response to the confinement, and the onset of damage in
the matrix, which together explain the observed behavior of biofilms. Beyond
bacterial biofilms, this work sheds light on the role of mechanics in

selection of a network architecture, development of a suitable training set,
and performance of network training. The ability of the trained CNN to predict
a suitable starting model for 2D FWI was compared against other commonly used

error of 6%. When compared to other common approaches, the CNN approach was
able to produce starting models with smaller seismic image and waveform
misfits, both before and after FWI. The ability of the CNN to generalize to
subsurface models which were dissimilar to the ones upon which it was trained

behavior that enables us to characterize the material as a type-I WSM. We study
the structural handedness of the material and correlate it with the distinct
surface Fermi surface at two opposite surfaces following an energy evolution.
The Fermi arc singlet becomes doublet with the onset of spin orbit coupling
that is in accordance with the topological charge of the Weyl Nodes (WNs). A
finite energy separation between WNs of opposite chirality in SrSi$_2$ allows
us to compute circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). Followed by the three band
formula, we show that CPGE is only quantized for Fermi level chosen in the
vicinity of WN residing at higher value of energy. Surprisingly, for the other
WN of opposite chirality in the lower value of energy, CPGE is not found to be
quantized. Such a behavior of CPGE is in complete contrast to the time reversal
breaking WSM where CPGE is quantized to two opposite plateau depending on the
topological charge of the activated WN. We further analyze our finding by
examining the momentum resolved CPGE. Finally we show that two band formula for
CPGE is not able to capture the quantization that is apprehended by the three

The burst detection component targets anomalies between individual timestamps,

crucial to ensure such systems do not become mechanisms of unfair

Moreover, due to the inherent trade-off between fairness measures and accuracy,
it is desirable to learn fairness-enhanced models without significantly
compromising the accuracy. In this paper, we propose Pareto efficient Fairness
(PEF) as a suitable fairness notion for supervised learning, that can ensure
the optimal trade-off between overall loss and other fairness criteria. The
proposed PEF notion is definition-agnostic, meaning that any well-defined
notion of fairness can be reduced to the PEF notion. To efficiently find a PEF
classifier, we cast the fairness-enhanced classification as a bilevel
optimization problem and propose a gradient-based method that can guarantee the
solution belongs to the Pareto frontier with provable guarantees for convex and
non-convex objectives. We also generalize the proposed algorithmic solution to
extract and trace arbitrary solutions from the Pareto frontier for a given
preference over accuracy and fairness measures. This approach is generic and
can be generalized to any multicriteria optimization problem to trace points on
the Pareto frontier curve, which is interesting by its own right. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEF solution and the extracted
Pareto frontier on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Traditionally, the rating assessment process based on the historical profile of

Therefore, most of the corporations, which are lacking in money and time, can't

the relationships between model parameters and outputs are unknown or hard to
track. These models are named as black-box models in general because they can
only be viewed in terms of inputs and outputs, without knowledge of the
internal workings. Optimizing the black-box model parameters has become
increasingly expensive and time consuming as they have become more complex.
Hence, developing effective and efficient black-box model optimization
algorithms has become an important task. One powerful algorithm to solve such
problem is Bayesian optimization, which can effectively estimates the model
parameters that lead to the best performance, and Gaussian Process (GP) has
been one of the most widely used surrogate model in Bayesian optimization.
However, the time complexity of GP scales cubically with respect to the number
of observed model outputs, and GP does not scale well with large parameter
dimension either. Consequently, it has been challenging for GP to optimize
black-box models that need to query many observations and/or have many
parameters. To overcome the drawbacks of GP, in this study, we propose a
general Bayesian optimization algorithm that employs a Neural Process (NP) as
the surrogate model to perform black-box model optimization, namely, Neural
Process for Bayesian Optimization (NPBO). In order to validate the benefits of
NPBO, we compare NPBO with four benchmark approaches on a power system
parameter optimization problem and a series of seven benchmark Bayesian
optimization problems. The results show that the proposed NPBO performs better
than the other four benchmark approaches on the power system parameter
optimization problem and competitively on the seven benchmark problems.

potential. In dS ambient space formalism, the interaction Lagrangian of
scalar-spinor fields was obtained from a new transformation which is very
similar to the guage theory. The interaction of massless minimally coupled
scalar and spinor fields was investigated. The Minkowski limit of the massless
minimally coupled scalar field and massive spinor field interaction in the
ambient space formalism of de Sitter space time is calculated. The interaction
Lagrangian and massless minimally coupled scalar field in the null curvature
limit become zero and the local transformation in the null curvature limit
become a constant phase transformation and the interaction in this limit become
zero. The covariant derivative reduces to ordinary derivative too. Then we
conclude that this interaction is due to the curvature of space time and then
the massless minimally coupled scalar field may be a part of a gravitational
field.

most existing machine learning methods are biased towards the majority class
when the Imbalance Ratio (IR) is high. To address this problem, we propose a
set convolution (SetConv) operation and an episodic training strategy to
extract a single representative for each class, so that classifiers can later
be trained on a balanced class distribution. We prove that our proposed
algorithm is permutation-invariant despite the order of inputs, and experiments
on multiple large-scale benchmark text datasets show the superiority of our
proposed framework when compared to other SOTA methods.

collaborative spectrally congested wireless environments of the DARPA Spectrum
Collaboration Challenge (SC2) via a recently collected dataset. We employ
distributed deep edge learning that is shared among edge nodes and a central
cloud. Using this close-to-practice dataset, we find that widely used federated
learning approaches, specially those that are privacy preserving, are worse
than local training for a wide range of settings. We hence utilize the
synthetic minority oversampling technique to maintain privacy via avoiding the
transfer of local data to the cloud, and utilize knowledge distillation with an
aim to benefit from high cloud computing and storage capabilities. The proposed
framework achieves overall better performance than both local and federated
training approaches, while being robust against catastrophic failures as well
as challenging channel conditions that result in high frame error rates.

  Data-driven Subsampling","5 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic modulation classification can be a core component for intelligent
spectrally efficient wireless communication networks, and deep learning
techniques have recently been shown to deliver superior performance to
conventional model-based strategies, particularly when distinguishing between a
large number of modulation types. However, such deep learning techniques have
also been recently shown to be vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks
that rely on subtle input perturbations, which would be particularly feasible
in a wireless setting via jamming. One such potent attack is the one known as
the Carlini-Wagner attack, which we consider in this work. We further consider
a data-driven subsampling setting, where several recently introduced
deep-learning-based algorithms are employed to select a subset of samples that
lead to reducing the final classifier's training time with minimal loss in
accuracy. In this setting, the attacker has to make an assumption about the
employed subsampling strategy, in order to calculate the loss gradient. Based
on state of the art techniques available to both the attacker and defender, we
evaluate best strategies under various assumptions on the knowledge of the
other party's strategy. Interestingly, in presence of knowledgeable attackers,
we identify computational cost reduction opportunities for the defender with no
or minimal loss in performance.

which knowledge discovery is executed interactively between the user and system
in a human-centered manner. The purpose of this study is to develop a method
for the VA of set data aimed at supporting knowledge discovery and member
selection. A typical target application is a visual support system for team
analysis and member selection, by which users can analyze past teams and
examine candidate lineups for new teams. Because there are several
difficulties, such as the combinatorial explosion problem, developing a VA
system of set data is challenging. In this study, we first define the
requirements that the target system should satisfy and clarify the accompanying
challenges. Then we propose a method for the VA of set data, which satisfies
the requirements. The key idea is to model the generation process of sets and
their outputs using a manifold network model. The proposed method visualizes
the relevant factors as a set of topographic maps on which various information
is visualized. Furthermore, using the topographic maps as a bidirectional
interface, users can indicate their targets of interest in the system on these
maps. We demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to basketball teams,
and compare with a benchmark system for outcome prediction and lineup
reconstruction tasks. Because the method can be adapted to individual
application cases by extending the network structure, it can be a general
method by which practical systems can be built.
