topological insulator EuSn2As2 up to 21.1 GPa through measurements of
synchrotron x-ray diffraction, electrical resistance, magnetic resistance, and
Hall transports combined with first-principles calculations. No evident trace
of a structural phase transition is detected. The Neel temperatures determined
from resistance are increased from 24 to 77 K under pressure, which is resulted
from the enhanced magnetic exchange couplings between Eu2+ ions yielded by our
first-principles calculations. The negative magnetoresistance of EuSn2As2
persists to higher temperatures accordantly. However, the enhancement of the
observed N\'eel temperatures deviates from the calculations obviously above
10.0 GPa. In addition, the magnitude of the magnetoresistance, the Hall
coefficients, and the charge carrier densities show abrupt changes between 6.9
to 10.0 GPa. The abrupt changes probably originate from a pressure induced
valence change of Eu ions from a divalent state to a divalent and trivalent
mixed state. Our results provide insights into variation of the magnetism of
EuSn2As2 and similar antiferromagnetic topological insulators under pressure.

disconnection between the labeled and unlabeled target samples as well as
misalignment between unlabeled target samples and the source domain. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach called Cross-domain Adaptive Clustering to
address this problem. To achieve both inter-domain and intra-domain adaptation,
we first introduce an adversarial adaptive clustering loss to group features of
unlabeled target data into clusters and perform cluster-wise feature alignment
across the source and target domains. We further apply pseudo labeling to
unlabeled samples in the target domain and retain pseudo-labels with high
confidence. Pseudo labeling expands the number of ``labeled"" samples in each
class in the target domain, and thus produces a more robust and powerful
cluster core for each class to facilitate adversarial learning. Extensive

by e.g. significant differences in control measures and testing policies.
Another difficulty is appropriately controlling the effects of other
potentially important factors, due to both their mutual correlations and a
limited dataset. To overcome these difficulties, we will here use the basic
reproduction number ($R_0$) that we estimate for USA states using non-linear
dynamics methods. To account for a large number of predictors (many of which
are mutually strongly correlated), combined with a limited dataset, we employ
machine-learning methods. Specifically, to reduce dimensionality without
complicating the variable interpretation, we employ Principal Component
Analysis on subsets of mutually related (and correlated) predictors. Methods
that allow feature (predictor) selection, and ranking their importance, are
then used, including both linear regressions with regularization and feature
selection (Lasso and Elastic Net) and non-parametric methods based on ensembles
of weak-learners (Random Forest and Gradient Boost). Through these
substantially different approaches, we robustly obtain that PM$_{2.5}$ is a
major predictor of $R_0$ in USA states, with corrections from factors such as
other pollutants, prosperity measures, population density, chronic disease
levels, and possibly racial composition. As a rough magnitude estimate, we
obtain that a relative change in $R_0$, with variations in pollution levels
observed in the USA, is typically ~30%, which further underscores the
importance of pollution in COVID-19 transmissibility.

approaches that require matched high-resolution target volume images, our
method greatly reduces the effort to put into practice as the training of a
network requires as little as a single 3D image stack, without a priori
knowledge of the image formation process, registration of training data, or
separate acquisition of target data. This is achieved based on the optimal
transport driven cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that learns
from an unpaired matching between high-resolution 2D images in lateral image

confocal microscopy and light-sheet microscopy, we demonstrate that the trained

details between the imaging planes and removes imaging artifacts.

emerge, such as topological crystalline insulator, topological semimetal, and
superconductivity. For the samples with large Sn compositions (x > 0.5), hole
density increases with In composition (y), which results in the appearance of
superconductivity. On the other hand, for those with small Sn compositions (x <
0.5), increase in In composition reduces the hole density and changes the
carrier type from p-type to n-type. In a narrow region centered at (x, y) =

observatories like LIGO and Virgo to provide prompt warning of merger events
involving neutron stars (including both binary neutron stars and
neutron-star-black-holes), which further depends critically on the
low-frequency sensitivity of LIGO as a typical binary neutron star stays in
this band for minutes. However, the current sub-60 Hz sensitivity of LIGO has
not yet reached its design target and the excess noise can be more than an
order of magnitude below 20 Hz. It is limited by nonlinearly coupled noises
from auxiliary control loops which are also nonstationary, posing challenges to
realistic early-warning pipelines. Nevertheless, machine-learning-based neural
networks provide ways to simultaneously improve the low-frequency sensitivity
and mitigate its nonstationarity, and detect the real-time gravitational-wave
signal with a very short computational time. We propose to achieve this by
inputting both the main gravitational-wave readout and key auxiliary witnesses
to a compound neural network. Using simulated data with characteristic
representing the real LIGO detectors, our machine-learning-based neural
networks can reduce nonlinearly coupled noise by about a factor of 5 and allows
a typical binary neutron star (neutron-star-black-hole) to be detected 100 s
(10 s) before the merger at a distance of 40 Mpc (160 Mpc). If one can further
reduce the noise to the fundamental limit, our neural networks can achieve
detection out to a distance of 80 Mpc and 240 Mpc for binary neutron stars and
neutron-star-black-holes, respectively. It thus demonstrates that utilizing
machine-learning-based neural networks is a promising direction for the timely
detection of the coalescence of electromagnetically bright LIGO/Virgo sources.

embedding extraction into a unified network, has achieved groundbreaking
results in recent years. However, current one-shot trackers solely rely on
single-frame detections to predict candidate bounding boxes, which may be
unreliable when facing disastrous visual degradation, e.g., motion blur,
occlusions. Once a target bounding box is mistakenly classified as background
by the detector, the temporal consistency of its corresponding tracklet will be
no longer maintained. In this paper, we set out to restore the bounding boxes
misclassified as ``fake background'' by proposing a re-check network. The
re-check network innovatively expands the role of ID embedding from data
association to motion forecasting by effectively propagating previous tracklets
to the current frame with a small overhead. Note that the propagation results
are yielded by an independent and efficient embedding search, preventing the
model from over-relying on detection results. Eventually, it helps to reload
the ``fake background'' and repair the broken tracklets. Building on a strong

continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols with
phase-shift keying modulation against collective attacks in the asymptotic
limit. We argue why it is sufficient to consider protocols with a maximum
number of eight signal states and analyse different postselection strategies
for protocols with four (QPSK) and eight (8PSK) signal states for untrusted
ideal and trusted nonideal detectors. We introduce a \emph{cross-shaped}
postselection strategy, and show that both cross-shaped and radial and angular
postselection clearly outperform a radial postselection scheme (and no
postselection) for QPSK protocols. For all strategies studied, we provide
analytical results for the operators defining the respective regions in phase
space. We outline several use-cases of postselection, which can easily be
introduced in the data processing of both new and existing CV-QKD systems:
Motivated by the high computational effort for error-correction, we studied the
case when a large fraction of the raw key is eliminated by postselection and
observed that this can be achieved while increasing the secure key rate.
Postselection can also be used to partially compensate the disadvantage of QPSK
protocols over 8PSK protocols for high transmission distances, while being
experimentally less demanding. Finally, we highlight that postselection can be
used to reduce the key rate gap between scenarios with trusted and untrusted
detectors while relying on less assumptions on Eve's power.

inference. Algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) is emerging as an efficient
approach for fault tolerance in NNs.
  We propose an adaptive approach to ABFT for NN inference that exploits
untapped opportunities in emerging deployment scenarios. GPUs have high
compute-to-memory-bandwidth ratios, while NN layers have a wide range of
arithmetic intensities. This leaves some layers compute bound and others
memory-bandwidth bound, but current approaches to ABFT do not consider these
differences. We first investigate ABFT schemes best suited for each of these
scenarios. We then propose intensity-guided ABFT, an adaptive,
arithmetic-intensity-guided approach that selects the most efficient ABFT
scheme for each NN layer. Intensity-guided ABFT reduces execution-time overhead
by 1.09--5.3$\times$ across many NNs compared to traditional approaches to
ABFT.

processing approach where audio segments of fixed duration are converted to

clustering of the representations in the second stage. In most of the prior
approaches, these two stages are performed in an isolated manner with
independent optimization steps. In this paper, we propose a representation
learning and clustering algorithm that can be iteratively performed for
improved speaker diarization. The representation learning is based on
principles of self-supervised learning while the clustering algorithm is a
graph structural method based on path integral clustering (PIC). The
representation learning step uses the cluster targets from PIC and the
clustering step is performed on embeddings learned from the self-supervised
deep model. This iterative approach is referred to as self-supervised

Often, we can find an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property,

inferring the output of $\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian

InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information
with respect to the algorithm's output. Applying this to Dijkstra's algorithm,
for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with
black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian
optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems,
InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original
algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal

reason about how this shift will take control over students' data away from

Software-as-a-Service offerings to assess how far this migration has already

the other cluster (U.S., U.K., the Netherlands, THE Top100) frequently migrates
universities' core functions and services to public clouds -- starting long

socio-economic factors in the respective countries, including the general

and spin precession which depend on impurity spin relaxation and spin
precession time. For the bulk noise, we consider carbon-13 and nitrogen as
impurities and employ the correlated-cluster expansion to calculate noise.
Carbon-13 noise is a few orders of magnitude larger than nitrogen due to the
higher impurity density in the typical NV center diamond system. We also find
that the noise in the secular approximation underestimates noise under low
applied magnetic field. Overall, the major source of magnetic field noise is
spin precession noise, which is more than five orders of magnitude larger than
the spin flip noise.

deterministic quantum emitters that can generate single photons and entangled
photon pairs in the third telecom window, in order to be compatible with
existing optical fiber networks and on-chip silicon photonic processors.
InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs) are among the leading candidates for this purpose,
due to their high emission efficiency in the required spectral range. However,
fabricating versatile InAs/InP QD-based quantum emitters is challenging,
especially as these QDs typically have asymmetric profiles in the growth plane,
resulting in a substantial bright-exciton fine structure splitting (FSS). This
hinders the generation of entangled photon pairs and thus, compromises the
versatility of InAs/InP QDs. We overcome this by implementing droplet epitaxy
(DE) synthesis of low surface density (2.8$\times$10$^8$ cm$^{-2}$) InAs QDs on
an (001)-oriented InP substrate. The resulting QDs are located in etched pits,
have concave bases, and most importantly, have symmetric in-plane profiles. We
provide an analytical model to explain the kinetics of pit formation and QD
base shape modification. Our theoretical calculations of electronic states
reveal the properties of neutral and charged excitons and biexcitons confined
in such QDs, which agree with the optical investigations of individual QDs. The
optical response of QD ensembles suggests that FSS may indeed be negligible, as
reflected in the vanishing degree of linear polarization. However, single QD
spectrum gathered from an etched mesa shows moderate FSS of (50$\pm$5) $\mu$eV
that we link to destructive changes made in the QD environment during the
post-growth processing. Finally, we show that the studied DE QDs provide a
close-to-ideal single-photon emission purity of (92.5$\pm$7.5) $\%$ in the
third telecom window.

which we train an agent with two reward signals: a standard task performance
reward, plus a normative behavior reward. The normative behavior reward is
derived from a value-aligned prior model previously shown to classify text as
normative or non-normative. We show how variations on a policy shaping
technique can balance these two sources of reward and produce policies that are
both effective and perceived as being more normative. We test our

from contingency tables, are of use when evaluating classification system
performance. While large sample inference methods for these combinations exist,
small sample methods exist only for regions on the multinomial parameter space
instead of the linear combinations. However, in medical classification problems
it is common to have small samples necessitating a small sample confidence
interval on linear combinations of multinomial probabilities. Therefore, in
this paper we derive an exact confidence interval, through the use of fiducial
inference, for linear combinations of multinomial probabilities. Simulation
demonstrates the presented interval's adherence to exact coverage.
Additionally, an adjustment to the exact interval is provided, giving shorter
lengths while still achieving better coverage than large sample methods.
Computational efficiencies in estimation of the exact interval are achieved
through the application of a fast Fourier transform and combining a numerical
solver and stochastic optimizer to find solutions. The exact confidence
interval presented in this paper allows for comparisons between diagnostic
methods previously unavailable, demonstrated through an example of diagnosing
chronic allograph nephropathy in post kidney transplant patients.

In particular we provide sufficient conditions such that asymptotic equivalence

We argue that averaging over feature maps after ReLU activation in each

technique allows for acoustic analysis of intermediate layers that parallels
the acoustic analysis of human speech data: we can extract F0, intensity,
duration, formants, and other acoustic properties from intermediate layers in
order to test where and how CNNs encode various types of information. We
further combine this technique with linear interpolation of a model's latent
space to show a causal relationship between individual variables in the latent
space and activations in a model's intermediate convolutional layers. In
particular, observing the causal effect between linear interpolation and the
resulting changes in intermediate layers can reveal how individual latent
variables get transformed into spikes in activation in intermediate layers. We
train and probe internal representations of two models -- a bare WaveGAN
architecture and a ciwGAN extension which forces the Generator to output
informative data and results in the emergence of linguistically meaningful
representations. Interpretation and visualization is performed for three basic
acoustic properties of speech: periodic vibration (corresponding to vowels),
aperiodic noise vibration (corresponding to fricatives), and silence
(corresponding to stops). The proposal also allows testing of higher-level
morphophonological alternations such as reduplication (copying). In short,
using the proposed technique, we can analyze how linguistically meaningful

measured by the Tibet AS$\gamma$ Collaboration. The flux and spectrum are
consistent with the decay of neutral pions from hadronuclear interactions
between Galactic cosmic rays and the interstellar medium (ISM). We derive the
flux of the Galactic diffuse neutrino emission from the same interaction
process that produces the gamma rays. Our calculation accounts for the effect
of gamma-ray attenuation inside the Milky Way and uncertainties due to the
spectrum and distribution of cosmic rays, gas density, and infrared emission of
the ISM. We find that the contribution from the Galactic plane to the all-sky
neutrino flux is $\lesssim5-10\%$ around 100 TeV. The Galactic and
extragalactic neutrino intensities are comparable in the Galactic plane region.
Our results are consistent with the upper limit reported by the IceCube and
ANTARES Collaborations, and predict that next-generation neutrino experiments

imply either an additional component in the cosmic-ray nucleon spectrum or

the model performance on a budget. One such algorithm is Expected Gradient
Length, which as the name suggests uses the approximate gradient induced per

successfully used for classification and regression, the formulation for
regression remains intuitively driven. Hence, our theoretical contribution
involves deriving this formulation, thereby supporting the experimental
evidence. Subsequently, we show that expected gradient length in regression is
equivalent to Bayesian uncertainty. If certain assumptions are infeasible, our
algorithmic contribution (EGL++) approximates the effect of ensembles with a
single deterministic network. Instead of computing multiple possible inferences
per input, we leverage previously annotated samples to quantify the probability
of previous labels being the true label. Such an approach allows us to extend
expected gradient length to a new task: human pose estimation. We perform
experimental validation on two human pose datasets (MPII and LSP/LSPET),
highlighting the interpretability and competitiveness of EGL++ with different
active learning algorithms for human pose estimation.

of the most extremely luminous (EL; L$_{\rm bol}$ $\ge$ 10$^{14}$ L$_\odot$)
Hot DOGs, at redshifts z ~ 3.0-4.6. The [CII] line is robustly detected in four
objects, tentatively in one, and likely red-shifted out of the spectral window
in the remaining two based on additional data. On average, [CII] is red-shifted
by ~ 780 km/s from rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines. EL Hot DOGs exhibit
consistently very high ionized gas surface densities, with $\Sigma_{\rm [CII]}$
~ 1-2 x 10$^{9}$ L$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$; as high as the most extreme cases seen
in other high-redshift quasars. As a population, EL Hot DOG hosts seem to be
roughly centered on the main-sequence of star forming galaxies, but the
uncertainties are substantial and individual sources can fall above and below.
The average, intrinsic [CII] and dust continuum sizes (FWHMs) are ~ 2.1 kpc and
~ 1.6 kpc, respectively, with a very narrow range of line-to-continuum size
ratios, 1.61 $\pm$ 0.10, suggesting they could be linearly proportional. The
[CII] velocity fields of EL Hot DOGs are diverse: from barely rotating
structures, to resolved hosts with ordered, circular motions, to complex,
disturbed systems that are likely the result of ongoing mergers. In contrast,
all sources display large line-velocity dispersions, FWHM $\gtrsim$ 500 km/s,
which on average are larger than optically and IR-selected quasars at similar
or higher redshifts. We argue that one possible hypothesis for the lack of a
common velocity structure, the systematically large dispersion of the ionized
gas, and the presence of nearby companion galaxies may be that, rather than a
single event, the EL Hot DOG phase could be recurrent.

the attention mechanism remains unclear on why and how it works in SISR. In

attention in attention network (A$^2$N) for more efficient and accurate SISR.
Specifically, A$^2$N consists of a non-attention branch and a coupling
attention branch. A dynamic attention module is proposed to generate weights
for these two branches to suppress unwanted attention adjustments dynamically,
where the weights change adaptively according to the input features. This
allows attention modules to specialize to beneficial examples without otherwise

SBTSR-tree index, an extension to BTSR-tree, which additionally segments the
time series temporally, allowing the construction of tighter bounds. Our
experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that SBTSR-tree
can provide answers much faster for all examined query types. This paper has

hierarchical mergers, where the merging BHs are the remnants of previous BH
merger events. These events may carry important clues about the astrophysical
host environments of the GW sources. In this paper, we present the
distributions of the effective spin parameter ($\chi_\mathrm{eff}$), the
precession spin parameter ($\chi_\mathrm{p}$), and the chirp mass
($m_\mathrm{chirp}$) expected in hierarchical mergers. Under a wide range of
assumptions, hierarchical mergers produce (i) a monotonic increase of the
average of the typical total spin for merging binaries, which we characterize
with ${\bar \chi}_\mathrm{typ}\equiv
\overline{(\chi_\mathrm{eff}^2+\chi_\mathrm{p}^2)^{1/2}}$, up to roughly the
maximum $m_\mathrm{chirp}$ among first-generation (1g) BHs, and (ii) a plateau
at ${\bar \chi}_\mathrm{typ}\sim 0.6$ at higher $m_\mathrm{chirp}$. We suggest
that the maximum mass and typical spin magnitudes for 1g BHs can be estimated
from ${\bar \chi}_\mathrm{typ}$ as a function of $m_\mathrm{chirp}$. The GW
data observed in LIGO/Virgo O1--O3a prefers an increase in ${\bar
\chi}_\mathrm{typ}$ at low $m_\mathrm{chirp}$, which is consistent with the
growth of the BH spin magnitude by hierarchical mergers, at $\sim 2 \sigma$
confidence. A Bayesian analysis suggests that 1g BHs have the maximum mass of
$\sim 15$--$30\,M_\odot$ if the majority of mergers are of high-generation BHs
(not among 1g-1g BHs), which is consistent with mergers in active galactic
nucleus disks and/or nuclear star clusters, while if mergers mainly originate
from globular clusters, 1g BHs are favored to have non-zero spin magnitudes of
$\sim 0.3$. We also forecast that signatures for hierarchical mergers in the
${\bar \chi}_\mathrm{typ}$ distribution can be confidently recovered once the
number of GW events increases to $\gtrsim O(100)$.

In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected,
brightening by a factor of >1000 and >14000 as seen by ALMA and HST,
respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other
closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a
proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to
constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Surprisingly,
optical emission associated with the event peaks at a much lower level with a
time delay. The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for <10
sec. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this
event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar
flares and often originates from short burst-like events.

extended sources is a key component in many studies aiming to answer
fundamental questions about the Universe. To maintain accuracy with increased
precision, it is of vital importance to characterize and understand the impact
of degeneracies inherent in lensing observables. In this work, we present a
formalism to describe the gravitational lensing distortion effects resulting in
curved extended arcs based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the local
lensing Jacobian and their directional differentials. We identify a non-local
and non-linear extended deflector basis that inherits these local properties.
Our parameterization is tightly linked to observable features in extended
sources and allows one to accurately extract the lensing information of
extended images without imposing an explicit global deflector model. We
quantify what degeneracies can be broken based on specific assumptions on the
local lensing nature and assumed intrinsic source shape. Our formalism is
applicable from the weak linear regime, the semi-linear regime all the way up
to the highly non-linear regime of highly magnified arcs of multiple images.
The methodology and implementation presented in this work provides a framework
to assessing systematics, to guide inference efforts in the right choices in
complexity based on the data at hand, and to quantify the lensing information

This stream was recently discovered by Yuan et al. (2020). We detect LMS-1 as a
$60\deg$ long stream to the north of the Galactic bulge, at a distance of $\sim
20$ kpc from the Sun, together with additional components that suggest that the
overall stream is completely wrapped around the inner Galaxy. Using
spectroscopic measurements from LAMOST, SDSS and APOGEE, we infer that the
stream is very metal poor (${\rm \langle [Fe/H]\rangle =-2.1}$) with a
significant metallicity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}=0.4$), and it
possesses a large radial velocity dispersion (${\rm \sigma_v=20 \pm
4\,km\,s^{-1}}$). These estimates together imply that LMS-1 is a dwarf galaxy
stream. The orbit of LMS-1 is close to polar, with an inclination of $75\deg$
to the Galactic plane. Both the orbit and metallicity of LMS-1 are remarkably
similar to the globular clusters NGC 5053, NGC 5024 and the stellar stream

bulge (BPX-shaped bulge). Previous studies suggested that the BPX-shaped bulge
can either be developed by bar buckling or by vertical inner Lindblad resonance
(vILR) heating without buckling. In this paper, we study the observable
consequence of an BPX-shaped bulge built up quickly after bar formation via
vILR heating without buckling, using an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of an
isolated Milky Way-like galaxy. We found that the BPX-shaped bulge is dominated
by stars born prior to bar formation. This is because the bar suppresses star
formation, except for the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) region and its tips. The
stars formed near the bar ends have higher Jacobi energy, and when these stars
lose their angular momentum, their non-circular energy increases to conserve
Jacobi energy. This prevents them from reaching the vILR to be heated to the
BPX region. By contrast, the NSD forms after the bar formation. From this
simulation and general considerations, we expect that the age distributions of
the NSD and BPX-shaped bulge formed without bar buckling do not overlap each
other. Then, the transition age between these components betrays the formation
time of the bar, and is testable in future observations of the Milky Way and
extra-galactic barred galaxies.

cool, metal-enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive
quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity
distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift-space
distortion~(RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around
galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the
redshift-space galaxy-cloud cross-correlation $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$
for ${\sim}10^4$ MgII absorbers around ${\sim}8{\times}10^5$ CMASS galaxies at
$0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. We discover that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong
Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ${\sim}300\,km/s$.
We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density
distributions inside haloes, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively. Thus,
for any model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the
reconstructed $\xi_{1h}$, and self-consistently compare to the observed
$\xi^{s}_{1h}$. We consider four types of cloud kinematics, including an
isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion, a satellite infall model in
which cool clouds reside in the subhaloes, a cloud accretion model in which
clouds follow the cosmic gas accretion, and a tired wind model in which clouds
originate from the galactic wind-driven bubbles. All the four models provide
statistically good fits to the RSD data, but only the tired wind model can
reproduce the observed truncation by propagating ancient wind bubbles at
${\sim}250\,km/s$ on scales ${\sim}400\,kpc/h$. Our method provides an exciting
path to decoding the dynamical origin of metal absorbers from the RSD
measurements with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

Thus, a fragile topological band structure does not present an obstruction to

formation of fermionic bound states of two electrons and one hole, known as
""trions"". The trions form a band whose coupling to the electronic band enables
the gap opening. This result may be relevant to the gapped state indicated by
recent experiments in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at charge
neutrality.

perturbatively. We mostly consider those $T\bar T$ theories that can be
reconstructed from string-like theories upon integrating out the worldsheet
metric. After a quick overview of how this works when we add NSR-like or
GS-like fermions, we obtain a known non-supersymmetric $T\bar T$ deformation of
a $\cN=(1,1)$ theory from the latter, based on the Noether energy-momentum.
This worldsheet reconstruction implies that the latter is actually a
supersymmetric subsector of a $d=3$ GS-like model, implying hidden
supercharges, which we do construct explicitly. This brings us to ask about
different $T\bar T$ deformations, such as manifestly supersymmetric $T\bar T$
and also more generally via the symmetric energy-momentum. We show that, for
theories with fermions, such choices often lead us to doubling of degrees of
freedom, with potential unitarity issues. We show that the extra sector
develops a divergent gap in the ""small deformation"" limit and decouples in the
infrared, although it remains uncertain in what sense these can be considered a
deformation.

ratio estimated from dust continuum emission make this system a perfect
laboratory to investigate the role of self-gravity in the early phases of star
formation. This is particularly interesting if we consider that gravitational
instabilities could be a fundamental first step for the formation of
planetesimals and planets. In this Letter, we model the rotation curve obtained
by CO data of Elias 2-27 with a theoretical rotation curve including both the
disk self-gravity and the star contribution to the gravitational potential. We
compare this model with a purely Keplerian one and with a simple power-law
function. We find that (especially for the $^{13}$CO isotopologue) the rotation
curve is better described by considering not only the star, but also the disk
self-gravity. We are thus able to obtain for the first time a dynamical
estimate of the disk mass of $0.08\pm0.04\,M_{\odot}$ and the star mass of
$0.46\pm0.03\,M_{\odot}$ (in the more general case), the latter being
comparable with previous estimates. From these values, we derive that the disk
is 17$\%$ of the star mass, meaning that it could be prone to gravitational
instabilities. This result would strongly support the hypothesis that the two
spiral arms are generated by gravitational instabilities.

are to investigate the early Universe through the observation of gamma-ray
bursts and to study the gravitational waves electromagnetic counterparts and
neutrino events. On the other hand, its instruments, which include a wide field
of view X-ray (0.3-5 keV) telescope based on lobster-eye focusing optics and a
gamma-ray spectrometer with imaging capabilities in the 2-150 keV range, are
also ideal for carrying out unprecedented studies in time domain astrophysics.
In addition, the presence onboard of a 70 cm near infrared telescope will allow
simultaneous multi-wavelegth studies. Here we present the THESEUS capabilities
for studying the time variability of different classes of sources in parallel
to, and without affecting, the gamma-ray bursts hunt.

clouds is not yet fully understood. We investigate the mechanisms regulating
the formation of stars in different environments within nearby star-forming
galaxies from the PHANGS sample. Methods: Integral field spectroscopic data and
radio-interferometric observations of 18 galaxies were combined to explore the
existence of the resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS), resolved
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (rKS), and resolved molecular gas main sequence
(rMGMS), and we derived their slope and scatter at spatial resolutions from 100
pc to 1 kpc (under various assumptions). Results: All three relations were
recovered at the highest spatial resolution (100 pc). Furthermore, significant
variations in these scaling relations were observed across different galactic
environments. The exclusion of non-detections has a systematic impact on the
inferred slope as a function of the spatial scale. Finally, the scatter of the
$\Sigma_\mathrm{mol. gas + stellar}$ versus $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ correlation
is smaller than that of the rSFMS, but higher than that found for the rKS.
Conclusions: The rMGMS has the tightest relation at a spatial scale of 100 pc
(scatter of 0.34 dex), followed by the rKS (0.41 dex) and then the rSFMS (0.51
dex). This is consistent with expectations from the timescales involved in the
evolutionary cycle of molecular clouds. Surprisingly, the rKS shows the least
variation across galaxies and environments, suggesting a tight link between
molecular gas and subsequent star formation. The scatter of the three relations
decreases at lower spatial resolutions, with the rKS being the tightest (0.27
dex) at a spatial scale of 1 kpc. Variation in the slope of the rSFMS among
galaxies is partially due to different detection fractions of
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ with respect to $\Sigma_\mathrm{stellar}$.

lattice antiferromagnet has been the focus of attention for many decades. A
consensus appears to have emerged in recent numerical studies on the
antiferromagnet with first and second neighbor exchange interactions (the
$J_1$-$J_2$ model): a gapless spin liquid is present for a narrow window of
parameters between the vanishing of the N\'eel order and the onset of a gapped
valence bond solid state. We propose a deconfined critical SU(2) gauge theory
for a transition into a stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with massless Dirac
spinon excitations; on the other side the critical point, the SU(2) spin liquid
(the `$\pi$-flux' phase) is presumed to be unstable to confinement to the
N\'eel phase. We identify a dangerously irrelevant coupling in the critical
SU(2) gauge theory, which contributes a logarithm-squared renormalization. This
critical theory is also not Lorentz invariant, and weakly breaks the SO(5)
symmetry which rotates between the N\'eel and valence bond solid order
parameters. We also propose a distinct deconfined critical U(1) gauge theory
for a transition into the same gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid; on the other
side of the critical point, the U(1) spin liquid (the `staggered flux' phase)
is presumed to be unstable to confinement to the valence bond solid. This
critical theory has no dangerously irrelevant coupling, dynamic critical
exponent $z \neq 1$, and no SO(5) symmetry. All of these phases and critical
points are unified in a SU(2) gauge theory with Higgs fields and fermionic
spinons which can naturally realize the observed sequence of phases with
increasing $J_2/J_1$: N\'eel, gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, and valence
bond solid.

in X-ray binaries, are also anticipated in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This
is the case at low luminosities, when the jet-corona coupling dominates the
energy output in both populations. Previous attempts to extend this framework
to a wider AGN population have been extremely challenging due to heavy hydrogen
absorption of the accretion disc continuum and starlight contamination from the
host galaxies. We present the luminosity-excitation diagram (LED), based on the
[OIV]$_{25.9\mu m}$ and [NeII]$_{12.8\mu m}$ mid-infrared nebular line fluxes.
This tool enables to probe the accretion disc contribution to the ionising
continuum. When applied to a sample of 167 nearby AGN, the LED recovers the
characteristic q-shaped morphology outlined by individual X-ray binaries during
a typical accretion episode, allowing us to tentatively identify the main
accretion states. The soft state would include broad-line Seyferts and about
half of the Seyfert 2 population, showing highly excited gas and radio-quiet
cores consistent with disc-dominated nuclei. The hard state mostly includes
low-luminosity AGN ($\leq 10^{-3}\, \rm{L_{Edd}}$) characterised by
low-excitation radio-loud nuclei and a negligible disc contribution. The
remaining half of Seyfert 2 nuclei and the bright LINERs show low excitation at
high accretion luminosities, and could be identified with the bright-hard and
intermediate states. Their hosts show ongoing star formation in the central
kiloparsecs. We discuss the above scenario, its potential links with the galaxy
evolution picture and the possible presence of accretion state transitions in
AGN, as suggested by the growing population of changing-look quasars.

described by quantum mechanics. This fundamental theory is the ground on which
physicists have built their major mathematical models [1]. Today, the unique
features of quantum objects have led to the advent of promising quantum
technologies [2, 3]. However, the macroscopic world is manifestly classical,
and the nature of the quantum-to-classical crossover remains one of the most
challenging open question of Science to date. In this respect, moving objects
play a specific role [4, 5]. Pioneering experiments over the last few years
have begun exploring quantum behaviour of micron-sized mechanical
systems,either by passively cooling single GHz modes, or by adapting laser
cooling techniques developed in atomic physics to cool specific modes far below
the temperature of their surroundings [6-11]. Here instead we describe a very
different approach, passive cooling of a micromechanical system down to 500
microK, reducing the average number of quanta in the fundamental vibrational
mode at 15 MHz to just 0.3 (with even lower values expected for higher
harmonics); the challenge being to be still able to detect the motion without
disturbing the system noticeably. With such an approach higher harmonics and
the surrounding environment are also cooled, leading to potentially much longer
mechanical coherence times, and enabling experiments questioning mechanical
wave-function collapse [12], potentially from the gravitational background [13,
14], and quantum thermodynamics [15]. Beyond the average behaviour, here we
also report on the fluctuations of the fundamental vibrational mode of the
device in-equilibrium with the cryostat. These reveal a surprisingly complex
interplay with the local environment and allow characteristics of two distinct
thermodynamic baths to be probed.

of modular tests, building up to an end-to-end simulation. The philosophy of
this approach is to validate the software and algorithms used in the Phase I
upper limit analysis on wholly synthetic data satisfying the assumptions of
that analysis, not addressing whether the actual data meet these assumptions.
We discuss the organization of this validation approach, the specific modular
tests performed, and the construction of the end-to-end simulations. We
explicitly discuss the limitations in scope of the current simulation effort.
With mock visibility data generated from a known analytic power spectrum and a
wide range of realistic instrumental effects and foregrounds, we demonstrate
that the current pipeline produces power spectrum estimates that are consistent
with known analytic inputs to within thermal noise levels (at the 2 sigma
level) for k > 0.2 h/Mpc for both bands and fields considered. Our input
spectrum is intentionally amplified to enable a strong `detection' at k ~0.2
h/Mpc -- at the level of ~25 sigma -- with foregrounds dominating on larger
scales, and thermal noise dominating at smaller scales. Our pipeline is able to
detect this amplified input signal after suppressing foregrounds with a dynamic
range (foreground to noise ratio) of > 10^7. Our validation test suite
uncovered several sources of scale-independent signal loss throughout the
pipeline, whose amplitude is well-characterized and accounted for in the final
estimates. We conclude with a discussion of the steps required for the next
round of data analysis.

Machine learning (ML) tackles such a classification problem in a fast and
reproducible way, but is often perceived as a black box. However, ML
interpretability and explainability are active research areas in computer
science, increasingly providing us with tools to alleviate this issue. We
applied ML interpretability tools to a classifier trained to predict AGN type

a support-vector machine on 3346 high-quality, low redshift AGN spectra from
SDSS DR15 with an existing reliable classification as type 1, type 2, or
intermediate type. On a selection of test-set spectra, we computed the gradient
of the predicted class probability and we built saliency maps. We also
visualized the high-dimensional space of AGN spectra using t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), showing where the spectra for which we
computed a saliency map are located. Regions that affect the predicted AGN type
often coincide with physically relevant features, such as spectral lines. t-SNE
visualization shows good separability of type 1 and type 2 spectra, while
intermediate-type spectra either lie in-between as expected or appear mixed
with type 2 spectra. Saliency maps show why a given AGN type was predicted by
our classifier, resulting in a physical interpretation in terms of regions of
the spectrum that affected its decision, making it no longer a black box. These
regions coincide with those used by human experts such as relevant spectral
lines, and are even used in a similar way, with the classifier e.g. effectively
measuring the width of a line by weighing its center and its tails oppositely.

one of two possible states, say $\rho$ and $\sigma$. This task is generally
studied in either the symmetric setting, in which the two possible errors
incurred in the task (the so-called type I and type II errors) are treated on
an equal footing, or the asymmetric setting in which one minimizes the type II
error probability under the constraint that the corresponding type I error
probability is below a given threshold. Here we define a one-parameter family
of binary quantum hypothesis testing tasks, which we call $s$-hypothesis
testing, and in which the relative significance of the two errors are weighted
by a parameter $s$. In particular, $s$-hypothesis testing interpolates
continuously between the regimes of symmetric and asymmetric hypothesis
testing. Moreover, if arbitrarily many identical copies of the system are
assumed to be available, then the minimal error probability of $s$-hypothesis
testing is shown to decay exponentially in the number of copies, with a decay
rate given by a quantum divergence which we denote as $\xi_s(\rho\|\sigma)$,

eight molecules. We correlate the line emission maps to each other and to the

spatial structure of the observed and simulated cloud using the density
probability distribution function (PDF), spatial power spectrum, fractal

observed and simulated data in terms of power spectra and fractal dimensions,
there are key differences in the density PDFs and moments of inertia, which we
attribute to the omission of magnetic fields in the simulations. This

formula which is widely used in modern seismology is presented. The generalized
law is also expressed by an algebraic formula, but it contains an additional
parameter, which makes it possible to more flexibly approximate the
observational data. The alternative approach to the theoretical description of
aftershocks is to use the differential evolution models. To simulate the
averaged dynamics of aftershocks, it is proposed the Verhulst differential
equation, also known as the logistic equation. It is shown that the decrease in
the frequency of aftershocks with time at the first stage of evolution occurs
according to the Omori hyperbola, i.e. in accordance with the original wording
of the law. The paper also proposes a stochastic generalization of the equation
for the evolution of aftershocks. A random function of time is added to the
right-hand side of the logistic equation to simulate noise that affects a
dynamic system. As a result, a stochastic Langevin equation was obtained, which
can be used to simulate fluctuations in the frequency of aftershocks.

events is crucial to natural language understanding. One of the key challenges
of this problem is that when the events of interest are far away in text, the
context in-between often becomes complicated, making it challenging to resolve
the temporal relationship between them. This paper thus proposes a new
Syntax-guided Graph Transformer network (SGT) to mitigate this issue, by (1)
explicitly exploiting the connection between two events based on their
dependency parsing trees, and (2) automatically locating temporal cues between
two events via a novel syntax-guided attention mechanism. Experiments on two
benchmark datasets, MATRES and TB-Dense, show that our approach significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both end-to-end temporal
relation extraction and temporal relation classification; This improvement also
proves to be robust on the contrast set of MATRES. The code is publicly

and unlimited increase of the slip length at low temperatures, while the second
presents a vanishing slip length in this regime. As the temperature increases

spatially distributed optical parameters, typically the absorption and
scattering coefficients. The image reconstruction problem of DOT is an
ill-posed inverse problem, due to the non-linear light propagation in tissues
and limited boundary measurements. The ill-posedness means that the image
reconstruction is sensitive to measurement and modelling errors. The Bayesian
approach for the inverse problem of DOT offers the possibility of incorporating
prior information about the unknowns, rendering the problem less ill-posed. It
also allows marginalisation of modelling errors utilising the so-called
Bayesian approximation error method. A more recent trend in image
reconstruction techniques is the use of deep learning techniques, which have
shown promising results in various applications from image processing to
tomographic reconstructions. In this work, we study the non-linear DOT inverse
problem of estimating the absorption and scattering coefficients utilising a
`model-based' learning approach, essentially intertwining learned components
with the model equations of DOT. The proposed approach was validated with 2D
simulations and 3D experimental data. We demonstrated improved absorption and
scattering estimates for targets with a mix of smooth and sharp image features,
implying that the proposed approach could learn image features that are
difficult to model using standard Gaussian priors. Furthermore, it was shown
that the approach can be utilised in compensating for modelling errors due to
coarse discretisation enabling computationally efficient solutions. Overall,
the approach provided improved computation times compared to a standard
Gauss-Newton iteration.

through a 3D environment based on natural language instructions. One key
challenge in this task is to ground instructions with the current visual
information that the agent perceives. Most of the existing work employs soft
attention over individual words to locate the instruction required for the next
action. However, different words have different functions in a sentence (e.g.,
modifiers convey attributes, verbs convey actions). Syntax information like
dependencies and phrase structures can aid the agent to locate important parts
of the instruction. Hence, in this paper, we propose a navigation agent that
utilizes syntax information derived from a dependency tree to enhance alignment
between the instruction and the current visual scenes. Empirically, our agent
outperforms the baseline model that does not use syntax information on the
Room-to-Room dataset, especially in the unseen environment. Besides, our agent
achieves the new state-of-the-art on Room-Across-Room dataset, which contains
instructions in 3 languages (English, Hindi, and Telugu). We also show that our
agent is better at aligning instructions with the current visual information

densities of species into a phase with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in
which the mean densities are no longer equal. Depending on the value of $J$,
this transition can be either continuous or of the first order. For
sufficiently big negative $J$, the behaviour on the two lattices becomes
markedly different: while for the Bethe lattice there exists a continuous

allows arbitrary computation to be done over encrypted data, providing an
attractive approach to providing such secure inference. While such computation
is often orders of magnitude slower than its plaintext counterpart, the ability
of FHE cryptosystems to do \emph{ciphertext packing} -- that is, encrypting an
entire vector of plaintexts such that operations are evaluated elementwise on

horizon. However, the roll-out of vaccination strategies and their influence on
the pandemic are still open problems. In order to compare the effect of various
strategies proposed by the World Health Organization and other authorities, a
previously developed SEIRS stochastic model of geographical spreading of the
virus is extended by adding a compartment for vaccinated people. The parameters
of the model were fitted to describe the pandemic evolution in Argentina,
Mexico and Spain to analyze the effect of the proposed vaccination strategies.
The mobility parameters allow to simulate different social behaviors (e.g.
lock-down interventions). Schemes in which vaccines are applied homogeneously
in all the country, or limited to the most densely-populated areas, are
simulated and compared. The second strategy is found to be more effective.
Moreover, under the current global shortage of vaccines, it should be remarked
that immunization is enhanced when mobility is reduced. Additionally,
repetition of vaccination campaigns should be timed considering the immunity
lapse of the vaccinated (and recovered) people. Finally, the model is extended
to include the effect of isolation of detected positive cases, shown to be
important to reduce infections.

the common periodicity may be very large, thus making numerical simulations

misaligned hexagonal/hexagonal identical lattices, describing a twisted
graphene bilayer or a graphene monolayer grown on Ni(111), and the case of
hexagonal/square lattices, describing for instance a graphene monolayer grown
on Ni(100) surface. The first one, which has also analytic solutions,

very nice description of the experimental observations can be obtained also

been applied to the Turing model in a heterogeneous environment. It
demonstrated the anticipated modifications to the results obtained in a

multicomponent systems. Our broader mathematical approach results in general
approximation theorems for systems of ODEs. We discuss the cases of exponential

method to detect unseen planets. However, a systematic, statistically
meaningful analysis of such an approach remains missing. The aim of this work
is to devise an automated, statistically robust technique to identify
kinematical perturbations induced by the presence of planets in a gas disc, and
to accurately infer their location. For this purpose, we produce hydro
simulations of planet-disc interactions with different planet masses, 0.3, 1.0
and 3.0 $M_{Jup}$, at a radius of $R=100$ au in the disc, and perform radiative
transfer calculations of CO to simulate observables for 13 planet azimuths.
Using the DISCMINER package, we fit the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian
model of the channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences,
including deviations from Keplerian rotation. The detection technique, based on
line centroid differences, captures localised planet-driven perturbations, and
can distinguish them from axisymmetric velocity perturbations. The method can
detect all three simulated planets, at all azimuths, with an average accuracy
of $\pm3^\circ$ in azimuth and $\pm8$ au in radius. Owing to disc structure and
line-of-sight projection effects, planets at azimuths close to $\pm45^\circ$
yield the highest velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases,
$0^\circ$ and $\pm90^\circ$, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities
range within 40$-$70, 70$-$170 and 130$-$450 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0
$M_{Jup}$ planets. Our analysis indicates that the variance of peak velocities
is boosted near planets due to organised gas motions prompted by their
localised gravitational well. We propose an approach that exploits this
velocity coherence to provide, for the first time, statistically significant
detections of localised planet-driven perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.

are modified linearly with gate voltage (V_g), similar as for the magnetic

perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and nucleation energy induced by VCMA.

decipher the origin and powering mechanism of the galaxy's ionized gas. We
detect ionized gas in a non-disk-like structure rotating in the opposite sense

from full-spectral fitting, we find two kinematically distinct regions of
shocked emission-line gas in IC 1459, which we distinguished using narrow

different origin than that of its counter-rotating stellar component. We
propose that the ionized gas is from late-stage accretion of gas from the group
environment, which occurred long after the formation of the central stellar

mechanisms in IC 1459 but that the dominant excitation mechanism is by
post-asymptotic giant branch stars from its old stellar population.

experimentally verify that just a single layer of this photonic crystal

surfaces and developing biofilms that can determine diseases and infections.
Most bacteria secrete a significant amount of extracellular polymer substances
that are relevant for biofilm stabilization and growth. In this work, we apply
computer simulation and perform experiments to investigate the impact of
polymer size and concentration on early biofilm formation and growth. We
observe as bacterial cells formed loose, disorganized clusters whenever the
effect of diffusion exceeded that of cell growth and division. Addition of
model polymeric molecules induced particle self-assembly and aggregation to
form compact clusters in a polymer size- and concentration-dependent fashion.
We also find that large polymer size or concentration lead to the development
of intriguing stripe-like and dendritic colonies. The results obtained by
Brownian dynamic simulation closely resemble the morphologies that we
experimentally observe in biofilms of a Pseudomonas Putida strain with added
polymers. The analysis of the Brownian dynamic simulation results suggests the
existence of a threshold polymer concentration that distinguishes between two
growth regimes. Below this threshold, the main force driving polymer-induced
compaction is hindrance of bacterial cell diffusion, while collective effects
play a minor role. Above this threshold, especially for large polymers,
polymer-induced compaction is a collective phenomenon driven by depletion
forces. Well above this concentration threshold, severely limited diffusion
drives the formation of filaments and dendritic colonies.

it passes through the shock-induced flow field is investigated. Dedicate camera
optics is used to measure the cross-sectional intensities of the exiting
wavefront at two different planes, simultaneously. A technique is proposed that
uses the lateral displacement of the structured light pattern on both the
planes to estimate the axial intensity derivative, dI/dz, which is the input
for the transport-of intensity equation (TIE) for phase estimation. By doing
this, the need for small defocused distance, dz is avoided in experiments and
hence the demand for a low f/# imaging system is alleviated, and now larger dz
is admissible as the intensity derivative is not estimated through the
conventional finite difference (FD) approximation. The recovered phase from TIE
is used as an input to phase tomography algorithm to obtain the refractive
index followed by density distributions in the flow field quantitatively. The
proposed technique is verified through experiments conducted in hypersonic
shock tunnel for flow Mach No. of 8.5. Estimated cross-sectional densities of
the flow field around the aerodynamic test model are presented and compared

desired tradeoff between noise reduction and binaural cue preservation in
hearing aid applications. The proposed strategy was specially derived for the
preservation of interaural level difference, interaural time difference and
interaural coherence binaural cues. It is defined as a function of the average
input noise power at the microphones, providing robustness against the
influence of joint changes in noise and speech power (Lombard effect), as well
as to signal to noise ratio (SNR) variations. A theoretical framework, based on
the mathematical definition of the homogeneity degree, is presented and applied
to a generic augmented Wiener-based cost function. The theoretical insights
obtained are supported bycomputational simulations and psychoacoustic
experiments using the multichannel Wiener filter with interaural transfer
function preservation technique (MWF-ITF), as a case study. Statistical
analysis indicates that the proposed dynamic structure for the weighting

robustness against changes in the original binaural cues of both speech and
residual noise, at the cost of a small decrease in the noise reduction
performance, as compared to the use of a purely fixed weighting parameter.

interface for instructing human-robot collaboration. A major challenge of the
real-time detection of human grasp intent is the identification of dynamic EMG
from hand movements. Previous studies mainly implemented steady-state EMG
classification with a small number of grasp patterns on dynamic situations,
which are insufficient to generate differentiated control regarding the
muscular activity variation in practice. In order to better detect dynamic
movements, more EMG variability could be integrated into the model. However,
only limited research were concentrated on such detection of dynamic grasp
motions, and most existing assessments on non-static EMG classification either
require supervised ground-truth timestamps of the movement status, or only
contain limited kinematic variations. In this study, we propose a framework for
classifying dynamic EMG signals into gestures, and examine the impact of
different movement phases, using an unsupervised method to segment and label
the action transitions. We collected and utilized data from large gesture
vocabularies with multiple dynamic actions to encode the transitions from one
grasp intent to another based on common sequences of the grasp movements. The
classifier for identifying the gesture label was constructed afterwards based
on the dynamic EMG signal, with no supervised annotation of kinematic movements
required. Finally, we evaluated the performances of several training strategies
using EMG data from different movement phases, and explored the information
revealed from each phase. All experiments were evaluated in a real-time style

related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of

properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to
process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations,
while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters. We show how

Furthermore, QGANs save up to 75% of the training parameters. We believe these

not directly capture either of these goals, and propose new metrics to capture
each goal separately. Under our metrics, we find that TSE overestimates
systematicity of language models, but that models score up to 40% better on
verbs that they predict are likely in context.

  Two methods, called CQAu and CQAw, use the same evolution operator, inspired
by the classical HITS algorithm, but with different initial states; the
computation of hub and authority scores is performed simultaneously. The third
method, called CQG and inspired by classical PageRank, requires instead two
separate runs with different evolution operators, one for hub and one for

ejecta and magnetar engine parameters to previous samples of mostly
lower-redshift SLSNe (spin period $P\approx 0.79-13.61$ ms, magnetic field

the previously found negative correlation between $M_{\rm ej}$ and $P$, with a
pronounced absence of SLSNe with low ejecta mass and rapid spin. Combining our
results for the DES SLSNe with 60 previous SLSNe modeled in the same way, we
find no evidence for redshift evolution in any of the key physical parameters.

associated with significant healthcare burden worldwide. Phenotyping of MDD can
help early diagnosis and consequently may have significant advantages in
patient management. In prior research MDD phenotypes have been extracted from
structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) or using Electroencephalographic
(EEG) data with traditional machine learning models to predict MDD phenotypes.
However, MDD phenotypic information is also documented in free-text EHR data,
such as clinical notes. While clinical notes may provide more accurate
phenotyping information, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms must be
developed to abstract such information. Recent advancements in NLP resulted in
state-of-the-art neural language models, such as Bidirectional Encoder
Representations for Transformers (BERT) model, which is a transformer-based
model that can be pre-trained from a corpus of unsupervised text data and then
fine-tuned on specific tasks. However, such neural language models have been
underutilized in clinical NLP tasks due to the lack of large training datasets.
In the literature, researchers have utilized the distant supervision paradigm
to train machine learning models on clinical text classification tasks to
mitigate the issue of lacking annotated training data. It is still unknown
whether the paradigm is effective for neural language models. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the neural language models in a distant supervision
paradigm to identify MDD phenotypes from clinical notes. The experimental
results indicate that our proposed approach is effective in identifying MDD
phenotypes and that the Bio- Clinical BERT, a specific BERT model for clinical
data, achieved the best performance in comparison with conventional machine
learning models.

Because of the large volume and need for 3D convolutional layers, this task is
very memory intensive. To address this, prior approaches use smaller cropped
images while constraining the model's depth and width. Our 3D U-Net uses a
reversible version of the mobile inverted bottleneck block defined in

eliminating the need to store activations during the forward pass. The inverted

reduce computation by decomposing convolutions into a pointwise convolution and
a depthwise convolution. Further, this block inverts traditional bottleneck

clusters, (Nd-O-Nd) and (Nd-O-La-O-Nd). Extensive RE clustering is observed at
high RE2O3 concentrations, with more than 90% REs converting to dipole- and
exchange-coupled Nd clusters already at [RE2O3] = 0.01 mol%. ESEEM analysis of
the EPR-detectable Nd centers indicates a Na/Si-rich environment (four Na+ per

applications. The design of robust algorithms relies on surrogate losses since
the optimization of the adversarial loss with most hypothesis sets is NP-hard.
But which surrogate losses should be used and when do they benefit from
theoretical guarantees? We present an extensive study of this question,
including a detailed analysis of the H-calibration and H-consistency of
adversarial surrogate losses. We show that, under some general assumptions,
convex loss functions, or the supremum-based convex losses often used in
applications, are not H-calibrated for important hypothesis sets such as
generalized linear models or one-layer neural networks. We then give a
characterization of H-calibration and prove that some surrogate losses are
indeed H-calibrated for the adversarial loss, with these hypothesis sets. Next,
we show that H-calibration is not sufficient to guarantee consistency and prove
that, in the absence of any distributional assumption, no continuous surrogate
loss is consistent in the adversarial setting. This, in particular, proves that
a claim presented in a COLT 2020 publication is inaccurate. (Calibration
results there are correct modulo subtle definition differences, but the
consistency claim does not hold.) Next, we identify natural conditions under
which some surrogate losses that we describe in detail are H-consistent for
hypothesis sets such as generalized linear models and one-layer neural
networks. We also report a series of empirical results with simulated data,
which show that many H-calibrated surrogate losses are indeed not H-consistent,

the only linear mechanism of the acoustic wave generation -- \textit{the linear

the specific/key features of the generation process that should leave traces on

generalization steps derive strided loops that parse input file data and
rewrite concrete loop bounds with expressions over input file header bytes.
These steps enable BIEBER to generalize parses of specific input files to

incrementally and efficiently infers a decision tree that reads file header
bytes to route input files of different types to inferred parsers of the

IR; separate backends (C and Perl in our prototype) can translate the IR into
the same language as the original program (for a safer drop-in replacement), or
automatically port to a different language. An empirical evaluation shows that
BIEBER can successfully regenerate parsers for six file formats (waveform audio

underlay spectrum sharing. To mitigate the secondary co-channel interference
inflected at PUs, stringent secondary transmit power constraints are defined
for the secondary access points (S-APs). A generalized pilots sharing scheme is
used to locally estimate the uplink channels at P-APs/S-APs, and thereby,
conjugate precoders are adopted to serve PUs/SUs in the same time-frequency
resource element. Moreover, the effect of a user-centric AP clustering scheme
is investigated by assigning a suitable set of APs to a particular user. The
impact of estimated downlink (DL) channels at PUs/SUs via DL pilots beamformed

User-fairness for PUs/SUs is achieved by designing efficient transmit power
control policies based on a multi-objective optimization problem formulation of
joint underlay spectrum sharing and max-min criteria. The proposed orthogonal
multiple-access based analytical framework is also extended to facilitate
non-orthogonal multiple-access. Our analysis and numerical results manifest

algorithm dedicated to the reconstruction of the spatial distribution of light
received from off-axis sources, in particular from circumstellar disks.
  Methods. Built on the recent PACO algorithm dedicated to the detection of
point-like sources, the proposed method is based on the local learning of patch
covariances capturing the spatial fluctuations of the stellar leakages. From
this statistical modeling, we develop a regularized image reconstruction
algorithm (REXPACO) following an inverse problem approach based on a forward
image formation model of the off-axis sources in the ADI sequences.
  Results. Injections of fake circumstellar disks in ADI sequences from the
VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS instrument show that both the morphology and the photometry of
the disks are better preserved by REXPACO compared to standard postprocessing
methods like cADI. In particular, the modeling of the spatial covariances
proves usefull in reducing typical ADI artifacts and in better disentangling
the signal of these sources from the residual stellar contamination. The
application to stars hosting circumstellar disks with various morphologies
confirms the ability of REXPACO to produce images of the light distribution
with reduced artifacts. Finally, we show how REXPACO can be combined with PACO
to disentangle the signal of circumstellar disks from the signal of candidate

  Conclusions. REXPACO is a novel post-processing algorithm producing
numerically deblurred images of the circumstellar environment. It exploits the
spatial covariances of the stellar leakages and of the noise to efficiently
eliminate this nuisance term.

crowd features a structure given by its organization into N groups
(participants) each one spatially confined in a set. The overall optimal
control problem consists in driving the ensemble of sets as close as possible
to a given point (the 'exit') while the population in each set minimizes its
control effort subject to its sweeping dynamics with a controlled state
dependent velocity drift. In order to capture the conflict between the goal of
the overall population and those of the various groups, the problem is cast as
a bilevel optimization framework. A key challenge of this problem consists in
bringing together two quite different paradigms: bilevel programming and
sweeping dynamics with a controlled drift. Necessary conditions of optimality
in the form of a Maximum Principle of Pontryagin in the Gamkrelidze framework
are derived. These conditions are then used to solve a simple illustrative
example with two participants, emphasizing the interaction between them.

records that represent the same entity within or across disparate databases. It
is a fundamental task in data integration and increasingly required for
accurate decision making in application domains ranging from health analytics
to national security. Traditional record linkage techniques calculate string
similarities between quasi-identifying (QID) values, such as the names and
addresses of people. Errors, variations, and missing QID values can however
lead to low linkage quality because the similarities between records cannot be
calculated accurately. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel technique
that can accurately link records even when QID values contain errors or
variations, or are missing. We first generate attribute signatures
(concatenated QID values) using an Apriori based selection of suitable QID
attributes, and then relational signatures that encapsulate relationship
information between records. Combined, these signatures can uniquely identify
individual records and facilitate fast and high quality linking of very large
databases through accurate similarity calculations between records. We evaluate
the linkage quality and scalability of our approach using large real-world
databases, showing that it can achieve high linkage quality even when the
databases being linked contain substantial amounts of missing values and

inherent challenges of a conventional electrical packet-switched core of
today's compute clusters. As optical circuit switches (OCS) directly handle the
photon beams without any optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O) conversion and
packet processing, OCS-based network cores have the following desirable
properties: a) agnostic to data-rate, b) negligible/zero power consumption, c)
no need of transceivers, d) negligible forwarding latency, and e) no need for
frequent upgrade. Unfortunately, OCS can only provide point-to-point (unicast)
circuits. They do not have built-in support for one-to-many (multicast)
communication, yet multicast is fundamental to a plethora of data-intensive
applications running on compute clusters nowadays. In this paper, we propose
Shufflecast, a novel optical network architecture for next-generation compute
clusters that can support high-performance multicast satisfying all the
properties of an OCS-based network core. Shufflecast leverages small fanout,
inexpensive, passive optical splitters to connect the Top-of-rack (ToR) switch
ports, ensuring data-rate agnostic, low-power, physical-layer multicast. We
thoroughly analyze Shufflecast's highly scalable data plane, light-weight
control plane, and graceful failure handling. Further, we implement a complete
prototype of Shufflecast in our testbed and extensively evaluate the network.
Shufflecast is more power-efficient than the state-of-the-art multicast
mechanisms. Also, Shufflecast is more cost-efficient than a conventional
packet-switched network. By adding Shufflecast alongside an OCS-based unicast
network, an all-optical network core with the aforementioned desirable
properties supporting both unicast and multicast can be realized.

supervision is an emerging machine learning paradigm based on a simple idea:
instead of labelling data points by hand, we use labelling functions derived

The resulting labels are then aggregated with a generative model that estimates
the accuracy (and possible confusions) of each labelling function. The skweak
toolkit makes it easy to implement a large spectrum of labelling functions
(such as heuristics, gazetteers, neural models or linguistic constraints) on
text data, apply them on a corpus, and aggregate their results in a fully
unsupervised fashion. skweak is especially designed to facilitate the use of
weak supervision for NLP tasks such as text classification and sequence
labelling. We illustrate the use of skweak for NER and sentiment analysis.

few observations. To build a robust predictive model, these sparse data may
need to be augmented with simulated data, especially when the design space is
multi-dimensional. Simulations, however, often suffer from an inherent bias.
Estimation of this bias may be poorly constrained not only because of data
sparsity, but also because traditional predictive models fit only one type of
observed outputs, such as scalars or images, instead of all available output
data modalities, which might have been acquired and simulated at great cost. To
break this limitation and open up the path for multi-modal calibration, we
propose to combine a novel, transfer learning technique for suppressing the
bias with recent developments in deep learning, which allow building predictive
models with multi-modal outputs. First, we train an initial neural network
model on simulated data to learn important correlations between different
output modalities and between simulation inputs and outputs. Then, the model is
partially retrained, or transfer learned, to fit the experiments; a method that
has never been implemented in this type of architecture. Using fewer than 10
inertial confinement fusion experiments for training, transfer learning
systematically improves the simulation predictions while a simple output
calibration, which we design as a baseline, makes the predictions worse. We
also offer extensive cross-validation with real and carefully designed
synthetic data. The method described in this paper can be applied to a wide
range of problems that require transferring knowledge from simulations to the
domain of experiments.

Input to the DNN are two equally sized input matrices: one containing raw

DNN, comprising multiple stacked convolutional layers with an encoding-decoding
structure and feed-forward paths, transforms the input into a full matrix of

ability to accurately reconstruct heterogeneous congestion patterns under
varying input data sparsity. Therefore, a large set of empirical Floating-Car

total, 43 congestion distinct scenarios are observed which comprise moving and
stationary congestion patterns. A data augmentation technique is applied to
generate input-output samples of the data, which makes the DNN shift-invariant

subsequently applied to sparse data of an unseen congestion scenario. The
results show that the DNN is able to apply learned patterns, and reconstructs

However, pivoting gait can easily fail even with a small external disturbance
due to its instability in nature. To cope with this problem, we propose a
controller to robustly control the object motion during the pivoting gait by
introducing two gait modes, i.e., one is the double-support mode, which can
manipulate a relatively light object with faster speed, and the other is the
quadruple-support mode, which can manipulate a relatively heavy object with
lower speed. To control the pivoting gait, a graph model predictive control is
applied taking into account of these two gait modes. By adaptively switching
the gait mode according to the applied external disturbance, a robot can stably
perform the pivoting gait even if the external disturbance is applied to the

ordinary bosons and three types of parabosons which mutually anticommute when
belonging to different type (so far, in the literature, only parastatistics
induced by ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded superalgebras and
producing parafermions have been considered). It is shown how to detect
${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded parabosons in the multi-particle
sector of a quantum model. The difference with respect to a system composed by
ordinary bosons is spotted by measuring some selected observables on certain
given eigenstates. The construction of the multi-particle states is made
through the appropriate braided tensor product. The application of ${\mathbb
Z}_2$- and ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$- gradings produces $9$
inequivalent multi-particle Hilbert spaces of a $4\times 4$ matrix oscillator.
The ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded parabosonic Hilbert space is one

  The most important findings in this paper are as follows: 1) incorrect
regular expression behavior is the dominant root cause of regular expression
bugs (165/356, 46.3%). The remaining root causes are incorrect API usage (9.3%)
and other code issues that require regular expression changes in the fix
(29.5%), 2) fixing regular expression bugs is nontrivial as it takes more time
and more lines of code to fix them compared to the general pull requests, 3)
most (51%) of the regex-related pull requests do not contain test code changes.
Certain regex bug types (e.g., compile error, performance issues, regex
representation) are less likely to include test code changes than others, and
4) the dominant type of test code changes in regex-related pull requests is
test case addition (75%). The results of this study contribute to a broader

Moreover, inspired by ELECTRA, we study a model composed of two blocks; a

the MASK token and considering the whole output during the loss computation are
essential choices to improve performance. Furthermore, we show that it is
possible to efficiently train BERT-like models using a discriminative approach

  Automatic Passenger Counting Validation","23 pages, 9 Figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Automatic passenger counting (APC) in public transport has been introduced in
the 1970s and has been rapidly emerging in recent years. APC systems, like all
other measurement devices, are susceptible to error, which is treated as random
noise and is required to not exceed certain bounds. The demand for very low
errors is especially fueld by applications like revenue sharing, which is in
the billions, annually. As a result, both the requirements as well as the costs
heavily increased. In this work, we address the latter problem and present a
solution to increase the efficiency of initial or recurrent (e.g. yearly or
more frequent) APC validation. Our new approach, the partitioned equivalence
test, is an extension to this widely used statistic hypothesis test and
guarantees the same bounded, low user risk while reducing effort. This can be
used to either cut costs or to extend validation without cost increase. It
involves a pre-classification step, which itsself can be arbitrary, so we
evaluated several use cases: entirely manual and algorithmic, artificial
intelligence assisted workflows. For former, by restructuring the evaluation of
manual counts, our new statistical test can be used as a drop-in replacement
for existing test procedures. The largest savings, however, result from latter
algorithmic use cases: Due to the user risk being as bounded as in the original
equivalence test, no additional requirements are introduced. Algorithms are
allowed to be failable and thus, our test does not require the availability of
general artificial intelligence. All in all, automatic passenger counting as
well as the equivalence test itself can both benefit from our new extension.

learning models when considering real-world scenarios. However, current
available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have
large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this
issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain
enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes,
a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for
COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel
attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve
the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation
results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature
extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination
module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction
learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding
pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain
information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels.
Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets
demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods.
Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in
our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and
self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to
multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical
deployment.

soft thresholding estimators are independently expanded by empirical scaling
values. The scaling values have a common hyper-parameter that is an order of
expansion of an ideal scaling value that achieves hard thresholding. We simply
call this estimator a scaled soft thresholding estimator. The scaled soft
thresholding is a general method that includes the soft thresholding and
non-negative garrote as special cases and gives an another derivation of
adaptive LASSO. We then derived the degree of freedom of the scaled soft
thresholding by means of the Stein's unbiased risk estimate and found that it
is decomposed into the degree of freedom of soft thresholding and the reminder
connecting to hard thresholding. In this meaning, the scaled soft thresholding
gives a natural bridge between soft and hard thresholding methods. Since the
degree of freedom represents the degree of over-fitting, this result implies
that there are two sources of over-fitting in the scaled soft thresholding. The
first source originated from soft thresholding is determined by the number of
un-removed coefficients and is a natural measure of the degree of over-fitting.
We analyzed the second source in a particular case of the scaled soft
thresholding by referring a known result for hard thresholding. We then found
that, in a sparse, large sample and non-parametric setting, the second source
is largely determined by coefficient estimates whose true values are zeros and
has an influence on over-fitting when threshold levels are around noise levels
in those coefficient estimates. In a simple numerical example, these
theoretical implications has well explained the behavior of the degree of
freedom. Moreover, based on the results here and some known facts, we explained
the behaviors of risks of soft, hard and scaled soft thresholding methods.

through to form a stable cone-like inverted state with an elastic singularity
corresponding to the vertex of the conical surface. In a recent study, we found
that this bistability could be destroyed by removing the singularity through
cutting a hole around the vertex, depending on the size and shape of the hole.
This paper extends our recent work and is based on the following observations
in tabletop models of creased disks with circular holes: (i) reducing the
circumference of the creased disk by removing an annular sector could increase
the hole size to be as large as the disk without destroying the bistability,
(ii) with a single crease, the circular hole could be as large as the disk
without loss of the bistability, and (iii) a family of stable inverted states
can be obtained by inverting the disk almost anywhere along the crease. An
inextensible strip model is implemented to investigate these phenomena. We
formulate a minimal facet of the creased disk as a two-point boundary value
problem with the creases modeled as nonlinear hinges, and use numerical
continuation to conduct parametric studies. Specifically, we focus on geometric
parameters which include an angle deficit that determines the circumference of
the disk, the rest crease angle, the number of evenly distributed creases, and
an eccentricity that determines the position of the hole on the crease. Our
numerical results confirm the qualitative observations in (i)-(iii) and further
reveal unexpected results caused by the coupling between these geometric
parameters. Our results demonstrate that by varying the geometry of a simply
creased disk, surprisingly rich nonlinear behaviors can be obtained, which shed
new light on the mechanics and design of origami, kirigami, and morphable
structures.

a certain amount of edges in each color is guaranteed. Indeed, it turns out
that, as soon as such coloring constraints are satisfied and if $n$ is
sufficiently large, then every global amoeba can be found embedded in $K_n$
such that it has half its edges in each color. Even more surprising, every
bipartite global amoeba $G$ is unavoidable in every tonal-variation, meaning
that, for any pair of integers $r, b$ such that $r + b $ is the number of edges
of $G$, there is a subgraph of $K_n$ isomorphic to $G$ with $r$ edges in the
first color and $b$ edges in the second. The feature that makes global amoebas
work are one-by-one edge replacements that leave the structure of the graph
invariant. By means of a group theoretical approach, the dynamics of this
feature can be modeled. As a counterpart to the global amoebas that ""live""

three different recursive constructions of amoebas, two of them yielding
interesting families per se and one of them offering a wide range of

transmit correlation matrices, a class of gains is produced that is denoted
transmit correlation diversity. This idea was conceived for channels in which
transmit correlation matrices have mutually exclusive eigenspaces, allowing
non-interfering training and transmission. This paper broadens the scope of
transmit correlation diversity to the case of partially and fully overlapping
eigenspaces and introduces techniques to harvest these generalized gains. For
the two-user MIMO broadcast channel, we derive achievable degrees of freedom
(DoF) and achievable rate regions with/without channel state information at the
receiver (CSIR). When CSIR is available, the proposed achievable DoF region is
tight in some configurations of the number of receive antennas and the channel
correlation ranks. We then extend the DoF results to the $K$-user case by
analyzing the interference graph that characterizes the overlapping structure
of the eigenspaces. Our achievability results employ a combination of product
superposition in the common part of the eigenspaces, and pre-beamforming (rate
splitting) to create multiple data streams in non-overlapping parts of the
eigenspaces. Massive MIMO is a natural example in which spatially correlated
link gains are likely to occur. We study the achievable downlink sum rate for a
frequency-division duplex massive MIMO system under transmit correlation
diversity.

platforms is becoming increasingly important, which directly contributes to the
final revenue. In order to address the well-known sample selection bias
(\emph{SSB}) and data sparsity (\emph{DS}) issues encountered during CVR
modeling, the abundant labeled macro behaviors ($i.e.$, user's interactions
with items) are used. Nonetheless, we observe that several purchase-related
micro behaviors ($i.e.$, user's interactions with specific components on the
item detail page) can supplement fine-grained cues for \emph{CVR} prediction.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel \emph{CVR} prediction method
by Hierarchically Modeling both Micro and Macro behaviors ($HM^3$).
Specifically, we first construct a complete user sequential behavior graph to
hierarchically represent micro behaviors and macro behaviors as one-hop and
two-hop post-click nodes. Then, we embody $HM^3$ as a multi-head deep neural
network, which predicts six probability variables corresponding to explicit
sub-paths in the graph. They are further combined into the prediction targets
of four auxiliary tasks as well as the final $CVR$ according to the conditional
probability rule defined on the graph. By employing multi-task learning and
leveraging the abundant supervisory labels from micro and macro behaviors,
$HM^3$ can be trained end-to-end and address the \emph{SSB} and \emph{DS}
issues. Extensive experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed $HM^3$ over representative state-of-the-art
methods.

advantages: 1) Pluggable: our system can be easily applied to existing trained
TTS models without re-training. 2) Effective: our system achieves on-par voice

of travelers from/to other regions, we consider two factors. First, we consider
the movements of susceptible (S), exposed (E), and recovered (R) individuals
who may get infected and infect others in the destination region, as well as
infected (I) individuals. Second, people living in a region and moving from
other regions are dealt as separate but interacting groups with respect to

influence of movements before individuals become infected, difficult to detect
by testing at the time of immigration, on the spread of infection. In this

vaccinate with priority. We found a general law that a quantity of vaccines can
be used efficiently by maximizing an index value, the conditional entropy Hc,
when we distribute vaccines to regions. The efficiency of this strategy, which
maximizes Hc, was found to outperform that of vaccinating regions with a larger
effective re-generation number. This law also explains the surprising result

vaccination is processed at a sufficiently high pace, introducing the concept

and remains a research hot spot. Currently, such attack methods are based on
the hypothesis that the substitute model and the victim model learn similar
decision boundaries, and they conventionally apply Sign Method (SM) to
manipulate the gradient as the resultant perturbation. Although SM is
efficient, it only extracts the sign of gradient units but ignores their value
difference, which inevitably leads to a deviation. Therefore, we propose a
novel Staircase Sign Method (S$^2$M) to alleviate this issue, thus boosting
attacks. Technically, our method heuristically divides the gradient sign into
several segments according to the values of the gradient units, and then
assigns each segment with a staircase weight for better crafting adversarial
perturbation. As a result, our adversarial examples perform better in both
white-box and black-box manner without being more visible. Since S$^2$M just
manipulates the resultant gradient, our method can be generally integrated into
the family of FGSM algorithms, and the computational overhead is negligible.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, which significantly improve the transferability (i.e., on
average, \textbf{5.1\%} for normally trained models and \textbf{12.8\%} for
adversarially trained defenses). Our code is available at

these pulses, targeted and untargeted searches have been performed for
multi-wavelength counterparts, including the optical. The objective of this
work is to search for optical transients at the position of 8 well-localized

day, several months, and one year after FRB detection) in order to compare with
known transient optical light curves. We used the Las Cumbres Observatory
Global Telescope Network (LCOGT), which allows us to promptly take images owing
to its network of twenty-three telescopes working around the world. We used a
template subtraction technique on all the images we collected at different
epochs. We have divided the subtractions into two groups, in one group we use
the image of the last epoch as a template and in the other group we use the
image of the first epoch as a template. We have searched for bright optical
transients at the localizations of the FRBs (<1 arcsec) in the template
subtracted images. We have found no optical transients, so we have set limiting
magnitudes of optical counterparts. Typical limiting magnitudes in apparent
(absolute) magnitudes for our LCOGT data are ~22 (-19) mag in the r-band. We
have compared our limiting magnitudes with light curves of superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe), type Ia supernovae (SNe), supernovae associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRB SNe), a kilonova, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We
rule out that FRBs are associated with SLSN at a confidence of ~99.9%. We can
also rule out the brightest sub-types of type Ia SNe, GRB SNe and TDEs (under

critical as people are simultaneously exposed to multiple pollutants during

exposure to these mixtures are important for mitigating harm. We extend
Critical Window Variable Selection (CWVS) to the multipollutant setting by
introducing CWVS for Mixtures (CWVSmix), a hierarchical Bayesian method that
combines smoothed variable selection and temporally correlated weight
parameters to (i) identify critical windows of exposure to mixtures of
time-varying pollutants, (ii) estimate the time-varying relative importance of
each individual pollutant and their first order interactions within the
mixture, and (iii) quantify the impact of the mixtures on health. Through

of these categories in comparison to competing methods. Using these approaches,
we investigate the impact of exposure to multiple ambient air pollutants on the
risk of stillbirth in New Jersey, 2005-2014. We find consistent elevated risk

In many real-world applications, discovering shortest paths between two

shortest-path-graph problem that aims to efficiently compute a shortest path
graph containing exactly all shortest paths between any arbitrary pair of

scale to graphs with millions or billions of vertices and edges. To achieve
high scalability, we propose a novel method, Query-by-Sketch (QbS), which
efficiently leverages offline labelling (i.e., precomputed labels) to guide
online searching through a fast sketching process that summarizes the important
structural aspects of shortest paths in answering shortest-path-graph queries.
We theoretically prove the correctness of this method and analyze its
computational complexity. To empirically verify the efficiency of QbS, we
conduct experiments on 12 real-world datasets, among which the largest dataset
has 1.7 billion vertices and 7.8 billion edges. The experimental results show
that QbS can answer shortest-path graph queries in microseconds for
million-scale graphs and less than half a second for billion-scale graphs.

(EMO) field to evaluate the quality of a solution set. For a solution set with
$\mu$ solutions on a Pareto front, a larger hypervolume means a better solution
set. Investigating the distribution of the solution set with the largest
hypervolume is an important topic in EMO, which is the so-called hypervolume
optimal $\mu$-distribution. Theoretical results have shown that the $\mu$
solutions are uniformly distributed on a linear Pareto front in two dimensions.
However, the $\mu$ solutions are not always uniformly distributed on a
single-line Pareto front in three dimensions. They are only uniform when the
single-line Pareto front has one constant objective. In this paper, we further
investigate the hypervolume optimal $\mu$-distribution in three dimensions. We
consider the line- and plane-based Pareto fronts. For the line-based Pareto
fronts, we extend the single-line Pareto front to two-line and three-line
Pareto fronts, where each line has one constant objective. For the plane-based
Pareto fronts, the linear triangular and inverted triangular Pareto fronts are
considered. First, we show that the $\mu$ solutions are not always uniformly
distributed on the line-based Pareto fronts. The uniformity depends on how the
lines are combined. Then, we show that a uniform solution set on the
plane-based Pareto front is not always optimal for hypervolume maximization. It
is locally optimal with respect to a $(\mu+1)$ selection scheme. Our results
can help researchers in the community to better understand and utilize the

of the major stellar populations in the local halo. Within the sample volume
($|Z|<6$ kpc), stars associated with GSE exhibit a larger proportion of
metal-poor stars at greater $R_{\rm GC}$ ($\Delta \langle{\rm[Fe/H]}\rangle

with a mild anticorrelation of the mean rotational velocity with metallicity

of the GSE progenitor were gradually stripped away, while the prograde orbit of
the merger at infall became radialized by dynamical friction. The metal-rich
GSE stars are causally disconnected from the Splash structure, whose stars are
mostly found on prograde orbits ($>94\%$) and exhibit a more centrally

  Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks for Limb Perfusion Assessment","5 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a common form of arterial occlusive
disease that is challenging to evaluate at the point-of-care. Hand-held
dopplers are the most ubiquitous device used to evaluate circulation and allows
providers to audibly ""listen"" to the blood flow. Providers use the audible
feedback to subjectively assess whether the sound characteristics are
consistent with Monophasic, Biphasic, or Triphasic waveforms. Subjective
assessment of doppler sounds raises suspicion of PAD and leads to further
testing, often delaying definitive treatment. Misdiagnoses are also possible
with subjective interpretation of doppler waveforms. This paper presents a Deep
Learning system that has the ability to predict waveform phasicity through
analysis of hand-held doppler sounds. We collected 268 four-second recordings
on an iPhone taken during a formal vascular lab study in patients with
cardiovascular disease. Our end-to-end system works by converting input sound
into a spectrogram which visually represents frequency changes in temporal
patterns. This conversion enables visual differentiation between the phasicity
classes. With these changes present, a custom trained Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is used for prediction through learned feature extraction. The
performance of the model was evaluated via calculation of the F1 score and
accuracy metrics. The system received an F1 score of 90.57% and an accuracy of
96.23%. Our Deep Learning system is not computationally expensive and has the
ability for integration within several applications. When used in a clinic,
this system has the capability of preventing misdiagnosis and gives
practitioners a second opinion that can be useful in the evaluation of PAD.

quantum computing models and to establish {\it quantum DES} (QDES). The
motivation is twofold: on the one hand, QDES have potential applications when
DES are simulated and processed by quantum computers, where quantum systems are
employed to simulate the evolution of states driven by discrete events, and on
the other hand, QDES may have essential advantages over DES concerning state
complexity for imitating some practical problems. So, the goal of this paper is
to establish a basic framework of QDES by using {\it quantum finite automata}

are established and proved. Then we present a polynomial-time algorithm to
decide whether or not the controllability condition holds. In particular, we

of QDES and to verify the essential advantages of QDES over classical DES in

critical to facilitate novel image generation and better generative
understanding of unseen visual classes, i.e., zero-shot learning (ZSL). By
generating representations of unseen classes based on their semantic
descriptions, e.g., attributes or text, generative ZSL attempts to
differentiate unseen from seen categories. The proposed GRaWD loss is defined
by constructing a dynamic graph that includes the seen class/style centers and
generated samples in the current minibatch. Our loss initiates a random walk
probability from each center through visual generations produced from
hallucinated unseen classes. As a deviation signal, we encourage the random
walk to eventually land after t steps in a feature representation that is
difficult to classify as any of the seen classes. We demonstrate that the
proposed loss can improve unseen class representation quality inductively on
text-based ZSL benchmarks on CUB and NABirds datasets and attribute-based ZSL
benchmarks on AWA2, SUN, and aPY datasets. In addition, we investigate the
ability of the proposed loss to generate meaningful novel visual art on the

benchmark datasets, they need a large amount of external training data as well
as substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient
approach for a video anomaly detection system which is capable of running at
the edge devices, e.g., on a roadside camera. The proposed approach comprises a
pre-processing module that detects changes in the scene and removes the
corrupted frames, a two-stage background modelling module and a two-stage
object detector. Finally, a backtracking anomaly detection algorithm computes a
similarity statistic and decides on the onset time of the anomaly. We also
propose a sequential change detection algorithm that can quickly adapt to a new
scene and detect changes in the similarity statistic. Experimental results on

proposed framework as we achieve an F1-score of 0.9157 along with 8.4027 root

Hierarchical and Conditional Modality Selection (HCMS), a simple yet efficient
multimodal learning framework for efficient video recognition. HCMS operates on
a low-cost modality, i.e., audio clues, by default, and dynamically decides
on-the-fly whether to use computationally-expensive modalities, including
appearance and motion clues, on a per-input basis. This is achieved by the
collaboration of three LSTMs that are organized in a hierarchical manner. In
particular, LSTMs that operate on high-cost modalities contain a gating module,
which takes as inputs lower-level features and historical information to
adaptively determine whether to activate its corresponding modality; otherwise
it simply reuses historical information. We conduct extensive experiments on
two large-scale video benchmarks, FCVID and ActivityNet, and the results
demonstrate the proposed approach can effectively explore multimodal

structure of a chemical substance, many physical and chemical properties can be
predicted by first-principles calculations or machine learning models. Since it
is relatively easy to generate a hypothetical chemically valid formula, crystal
structure prediction becomes an important method for discovering new materials.
In our previous work, we proposed a contact map-based crystal structure
prediction method, which uses global optimization algorithms such as genetic
algorithms to maximize the match between the contact map of the predicted
structure and the contact map of the real crystal structure to search for the
coordinates at the Wyckoff Positions(WP). However, when predicting the crystal
structure with high symmetry, we found that the global optimization algorithm
has difficulty to find an effective combination of WPs that satisfies the
chemical formula, which is mainly caused by the inconsistency between the
dimensionality of the contact map of the predicted crystal structure and the
dimensionality of the contact map of the target crystal structure. This makes
it challenging to predict the crystal structures of high-symmetry crystals. In
order to solve this problem, here we propose to use PyXtal to generate and
filter random crystal structures with given symmetry constraints based on the
information such as chemical formulas and space groups. With contact map as the
optimization goal, we use differential evolution algorithms to search for
non-special coordinates at the Wyckoff positions to realize the structure
prediction of high-symmetry crystal materials. Our experimental results show
that our proposed algorithm CMCrystalHS can effectively solve the problem of
inconsistent contact map dimensions and predict the crystal structures with

forms, ranging from communities dominated by a handful of species to
communities containing a wide variety of metabolically distinct organisms. This
huge range in diversity is not a curiosity - microbial diversity has been
linked to outcomes of substantial ecological and medical importance. However,
the mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are still under debate, as simple
mathematical models only permit as many species to coexist as there are
resources. A plethora of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origins
of microbial diversity, but many of these analyses omit a key property of real
microbial ecosystems: the propensity of the microbes themselves to change their
growth properties within and across generations. In order to explore the impact
of this key property on microbial diversity, we expand upon a recently
developed model of microbial diversity in fluctuating environments. We
implement changes in growth strategy in two distinct ways. First, we consider
the regulation of a cell's enzyme levels within short, ecological times, and
second we consider evolutionary changes driven by mutations across generations.
Interestingly, we find that these two types of microbial responses to the
environment can have drastically different outcomes. Enzyme regulation may
collapse diversity over long enough times while, conversely,
strategy-randomizing mutations can produce a ""rich-get-poorer"" effect that
promotes diversity. This work makes explicit, using a simple serial-dilutions
framework, the conflicting ways that microbial adaptation and evolution can
affect community diversity.

confronting low resolution and low signal-to-noise in the context of the
quantities we want to derive, poses rigorous demands upon the data collected
from observation. Further compounding this challenge is that inferences of
exoplanet properties are built from forward models, which can include errors
due to incomplete or inaccurate assumptions in atmospheric physics and
chemistry. The confluence of observational noise and model error makes
developing techniques to identify predictive features that are robust to both
low s/n and model error increasingly important for exoplanet science. We
demonstrate how both issues can be addressed simultaneously by taking advantage
of underutilized multivariate information already present in current
atmospheric models, including thermodynamic statistics and reaction network
structure. To do so, we provide a case study of the prediction of vertical
mixing (parameterized as eddy diffusion) in hot Jupiter atmospheres and show
how prediction efficacy depends on what model information is used - e.g.
chemical species abundances, network statistics, and/or thermodynamic
statistics. We also show how the variables with the most predictive power vary
with planetary properties such as temperature and metallicity. Our results
demonstrate how inferences built on single metrics do not have utility across
all possible use cases. We also show how statistical measures derived from
network analyses tend to be better predictors when accounting for the
possibility of missing data or observational uncertainty. We discuss future
directions applying multivariate and network model information as a framework
for increasing confidence in inferences aimed at extracting features relevant
to exoplanet atmospheres and future applications to the detection of life on
terrestrial worlds.

tracking data of a user to predict future requested tiles, then renders and

experience (QoE) depends on the overall performance of prediction, computing
(i.e., rendering) and communication. All prior works neglect that users may
have privacy requirement, i.e., not all the current tracking data are allowed
to be uploaded. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-aware VR streaming.
We first establish a dataset that collects the privacy requirement of 66 users
among 18 panoramic videos. The dataset shows that the privacy requirements of
360$^{\circ}$ videos are heterogeneous. Only 41\% of the total watched videos
have no privacy requirement. Based on these findings, we formulate the privacy
requirement as the \textit{degree of privacy} (DoP), and investigate the impact
of DoP on the proactive VR streaming. First, we find that with DoP, the length
of the observation window and prediction window of a tile predictor should be
variable. Then, we jointly optimize the durations for computing and
transmitting the selected tiles as well as the computing and communication
capability, aimed at maximizing the QoE given arbitrary predictor and
configured resources. From the obtained optimal closed-form solution, we find a
resource-saturated region where DoP has no impact on the QoE and a
resource-unsaturated region where the two-fold impacts of DoP are
contradictory. On the one hand, the increase of DoP will degrade the prediction
performance and thus degrade the QoE. On the other hand, the increase of DoP
will improve the capability of computing and communication and thus improve the
QoE. Simulation results using two predictors and a real dataset validate the
analysis and demonstrate the overall impact of DoP on the QoE.

beyond-binary relational facts. Especially, in an n-ary relational fact, the

PlayCharacterIn consists of three roles, ACTOR, CHARACTER and MOVIE. However,
existing approaches are often directly extended from binary relational KBs,
i.e., knowledge graphs, while missing the important semantic property of role.
Therefore, we start from the role level, and propose a Role-Aware Modeling, RAM
for short, for facts in n-ary relational KBs. RAM explores a latent space that
contains basis vectors, and represents roles by linear combinations of these
vectors. This way encourages semantically related roles to have close
representations. RAM further introduces a pattern matrix that captures the
compatibility between the role and all involved entities. To this end, it
presents a multilinear scoring function to measure the plausibility of a fact
composed by certain roles and entities. We show that RAM achieves both
theoretical full expressiveness and computation efficiency, which also provides
an elegant generalization for approaches in binary relational KBs. Experiments
demonstrate that RAM outperforms representative baselines on both n-ary and

involve multiple body parts and movement directions. Along with being
multidimensional, dance movement interaction is plurifrequential, since it can
occur at different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, it is prone to
nonstationarity, due to, for instance, displacements around the dance floor.
Various methodological approaches have been adopted to study entrainment, but
only spectrogram-based techniques allow for an integral analysis thereof. This
article proposes an alternative approach based upon the cross-wavelet
transform, a technique for nonstationary and plurifrequential analysis of
univariate interaction. The presented approach generalizes the cross-wavelet
transform to multidimensional signals. It allows to identify, for different
frequencies of movement, interaction estimates of interaction and
leader-follower dynamics across body parts and movement directions. Further,
the generalized cross-wavelet transform can be used to quantify the
frequency-wise contribution of individual body parts and movement directions to
overall synchrony. The article provides a thorough mathematical description of
the method and includes proofs of its invariance under translation, rotation,
and reflection. Finally, its properties and performance are illustrated via
examples using simulated data and behavioral data collected through a mirror

method presumes an adequate model of the underlying system dynamics, which is
prone to modelling errors and is not necessarily adaptive. This has an
associated initial and ongoing project-specific engineering cost. In this
paper, we present an on- and off-policy multi-objective reinforcement learning
(RL) approach, that does not assume a model a priori, benchmarking this against
a linear MPC (LMPC - to reflect current practice, though non-linear MPC
performs better) - both derived from the general optimal control problem,
highlighting their differences and similarities. In a simple multi-energy
system (MES) configuration case study, we show that a twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) RL agent offers potential to match and
outperform the perfect foresight LMPC benchmark (101.5%). This while the
realistic LMPC, i.e. imperfect predictions, only achieves 98%. While in a more
complex MES system configuration, the RL agent's performance is generally lower
(94.6%), yet still better than the realistic LMPC (88.9%). In both case
studies, the RL agents outperformed the realistic LMPC after a training period

reinforcement learning is a viable optimal control technique for multi-energy

complex features, such as object shapes and textures to solve image recognition
tasks. Recent work indicates that CNNs trained on ImageNet are biased towards
features that encode textures and that these alone are sufficient to generalize
to unseen test data from the same distribution as the training data but often
fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data. It has been shown that
augmenting the training data with different image styles decreases this texture
bias in favor of increased shape bias while at the same time improving
robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blur. Commonly, this is
interpreted as shape bias increasing corruption robustness. However, this
relationship is only hypothesized. We perform a systematic study of different
ways of composing inputs based on natural images, explicit edge information,
and stylization. While stylization is essential for achieving high corruption
robustness, we do not find a clear correlation between shape bias and
robustness. We conclude that the data augmentation caused by style-variation
accounts for the improved corruption robustness and increased shape bias is
only a byproduct.

environment's physical properties and perform complex tasks. A sliding motion
is applied to target objects to generate tactile vibration data. However,
situations exist where such a sliding motion is infeasible due to geometrical
constraints in the environment or an object's fragility which cannot resist
friction forces. This paper explores a novel approach to achieve
vibration-based tactile perception without a sliding motion. To this end, our
key idea is injecting a mechanical vibration into a soft tactile sensor system
and measuring the propagated vibration inside it by a sensor. Soft tactile
sensors are deformed by the contact state, and the touched objects' shape or
texture should change the characteristics of the vibration propagation.
Therefore, the propagated-vibration data are expected to contain useful
information for recognizing touched environments. We developed a prototype
system for a proof-of-concept: a mechanical vibration is applied to a
biomimetic (soft and vibration-based) tactile sensor from a small, mounted
piezoelectric actuator. As a verification experiment, we performed two
classification tasks for sandpaper's grit size and a slit's gap widths using
our approach and compared their accuracies with that of using sliding motions.
Our approach resulted in 70% accuracy for the grit size classification and 99%
accuracy for the gap width classification. These results are comparable to or
better than the comparison methods with a sliding motion.

downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, pre-training

the latest success is the PROP method which has reached new SOTA on a variety
of ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks. The basic idea of PROP is to construct the
\textit{representative words prediction} (ROP) task for pre-training inspired
by the query likelihood model. Despite its exciting performance, the
effectiveness of PROP might be bounded by the classical unigram language model
adopted in the ROP task construction process. To tackle this problem, we
propose a bootstrapped pre-training method (namely B-PROP) based on BERT for
ad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to use the powerful contextual language model
BERT to replace the classical unigram language model for the ROP task
construction, and re-train BERT itself towards the tailored objective for IR.
Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive method, inspired by the
divergence-from-randomness idea, to leverage BERT's self-attention mechanism to
sample representative words from the document. By further fine-tuning on
downstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, our method achieves significant improvements
over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods, and
further pushes forward the SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval tasks.

halo kinematic groups and three of these stellar clouds: the Hercules-Aquila

orbital integrations in a standard Milky Way potential of a local halo sample
extracted from Gaia eDR3, with the goal of predicting the location of the
merger debris elsewhere in the Galaxy. We specifically focus on the regions

distributions with those predicted from the orbits of the nearby debris. We
find that the local halo substructures have families of orbits that tend to
pile up in the regions where the stellar clouds have been found. The distances

predicted from the orbit integrations, particularly for Gaia-Enceladus stars.

interest, usually produce noisy measurements for a large number of gene
expression features from a small number of subjects. One common approach to
analyzing such high-dimensional data is to use linear errors-in-variables
models; however, current methods for fitting such models are computationally
expensive. In this paper, we present two efficient screening procedures, namely
corrected penalized marginal screening and corrected sure independence
screening, to reduce the number of variables for final model building. Both
screening procedures are based on fitting corrected marginal regression models
relating the outcome to each contaminated covariate separately, which can be
computed efficiently even with a large number of features. Under mild
conditions, we show that these procedures achieve screening consistency and
reduce the number of features considerably, even when the number of covariates
grows exponentially with the sample size. Additionally, if the true covariates
are weakly correlated, corrected penalized marginal screening can achieve full
variable selection consistency. Through simulation studies and an analysis of
gene expression data for bone mineral density of Norwegian women, we
demonstrate that the two new screening procedures make estimation of linear
errors-in-variables models computationally scalable in high dimensional
settings, and improve finite sample estimation and selection performance
compared with estimators that do not employ a screening stage.

functional contains a nondifferentiable term like the $L^1$-norm in order to
include sparsity effects which is of utmost relevance, especially time
sparsity, in the context of cancer therapies as applying a control to the

cope with the difficulties originating from the variational inequality in the

corresponding optimality conditions also for the double obstacle case, by
deducing a variational inequality in terms of the associated adjoint state

the prevalence of breast cancer as a leading source of cancer-related death
among women. However, the accurate diagnosis of this disease is expensive,
especially in developing countries. This article concerns a cost-efficient
method for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a
comprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is
utilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs some visually
assessed cytological covariates, which are pertinent to determination of breast
cancer, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample.
Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are explored. Evidence from
numerical studies is reported. The developed procedure can be substantially
more efficient than its competitor in simple random sampling (SRS). In some
situations, the proportion estimation in MSRSS needs around 76% fewer
observations than that in SRS, given a precision level. Thus, using MSRSS may
lead to a considerable reduction in cost with respect to SRS. In many medical
studies, e.g. diagnosing breast cancer based on a full biopsy procedure, exact
quantification is difficult (costly and/or time-consuming), but the potential
sample units can be ranked fairly accurately without actual measurements. In
this setup, multistage ranked set sampling is an appropriate design for
developing cost-efficient statistical methods.

network where every user connects to its k closest base stations. Using a
framework of stochastic geometry and probability theory, we obtain analytic

previous research, our analysis shows that per-user throughput decreases with
increasing k. However, multi-connected networks are more resilient against
failures than single connected networks as reflected with lower outage
probability and lead to higher fairness among the users. Consequently, we
conclude that rather than implementing multi-connectivity for all users, a
network operator should consider it for its users who would benefit from
additional links the most, e.g., cell edge users.

is found to be periodically attracted to and repelled from the
nanoparticle-decorated substrate, with frequencies of around a few kHz. We
identify the competition between solutal and thermal Marangoni forces as origin
of the periodic bouncing. The former arises due to the selective vaporization
of ethanol at the substrate's side of the bubble, leading to a solutal
Marangoni flow towards the hot substrate, which pushes the bubble away. The
latter arises due to the temperature gradient across the bubble, leading to a
thermal Marangoni flow away from the substrate which sucks the bubble towards
it. We study the dependence of the frequency of the bouncing phenomenon from
the control parameters of the system, namely the ethanol fraction and the laser
power for the plasmonic heating. Our findings can be generalized to boiling and

confidentiality and integrity of communication, it prevents network monitoring
systems (NMS) and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) from effectively analyzing
the now encrypted payloads. Therefore, many enterprise networks have deployed
man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies that intercept TLS connections at the network
border to examine packet payloads and thus retain some visibility. However,
recent studies have shown that TLS interception often reduces connection
security and potentially introduces additional attack vectors to the network.
In this paper, we present a cooperative approach in which end-hosts as
cryptographic endpoints selectively provide TLS key material to NMS for
decryption. This enables endpoints to control who can decrypt which content and
lets users retain privacy for chosen connections. We implement a prototype
based on the Zeek NMS that is able to receive key material from hosts, decrypt
TLS connections and perform analyzes on the cleartext. The patch is freely
available and we plan to upstream our changes to Zeek once they are mature
enough. In our evaluation, we discuss how our approach conceptually requires
significantly less computational resources compared to the commonly deployed
MitM proxies. Our experimental results indicate, that TLS decryption increases
a runtime overhead of about 2.5 times of the original runtime on cleartext.
Additionally, we show that the latency for transmitting keys between hosts and
the NMS can be effectively addressed by buffering traffic at the NMS for at
least 40ms, allowing successful decryption of 99.99% of all observed TLS
connections.

phrase-Grounding (WSG) deals with the task of using this data to learn to
localize (or to ground) arbitrary text phrases in images without any additional
annotations. However, most recent SotA methods for WSG assume the existence of
a pre-trained object detector, relying on it to produce the ROIs for
localization. In this work, we focus on the task of Detector-Free WSG (DF-WSG)
to solve WSG without relying on a pre-trained detector. We directly learn
everything from the images and associated free-form text pairs, thus
potentially gaining an advantage on the categories unsupported by the detector.
The key idea behind our proposed Grounding by Separation (GbS) method is
synthesizing `text to image-regions' associations by random alpha-blending of
arbitrary image pairs and using the corresponding texts of the pair as
conditions to recover the alpha map from the blended image via a segmentation
network. At test time, this allows using the query phrase as a condition for a
non-blended query image, thus interpreting the test image as a composition of a
region corresponding to the phrase and the complement region. Using this
approach we demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement, of up to $8.5\%$
over previous DF-WSG SotA, for a range of benchmarks including Flickr30K,
Visual Genome, and ReferIt, as well as a significant complementary improvement
(above $7\%$) over the detector-based approaches for WSG.

problem. Existing solutions usually involve class-balacing strategies or
transfer learing from head- to tail-classes or use two-stages learning strategy
to re-train the classifier. However, the existing methods are difficult to
solve the low quality problem when images are obtained by SAR. To address this
problem, we establish a novel three-stages training strategy, which has
excellent results for processing SAR image datasets with long-tailed
distribution. Specifically, we divide training procedure into three stages. The
first stage is to use all kinds of images for rough-training, so as to get the
rough-training model with rich content. The second stage is to make the rough
model learn the feature expression by using the residual dataset with the class
0 removed. The third stage is to fine tune the model using class-balanced
datasets with all 10 classes (including the overall model fine tuning and
classifier re-optimization). Through this new training strategy, we only use
the information of SAR image dataset and the network model with very small
parameters to achieve the top 1 accuracy of 22.34 in development phase.

several major flares when the source flux was $>10^{-5}\:{\rm

$(9.22\pm1.96)\times10^{-5}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ observed on MJD
55519.33, corresponds to $2.15\times10^{50}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$ isotropic
$\gamma$-ray luminosity. The analysis of Swift XRT and UVOT data revealed a
flux increase, although with smaller amplitudes, also in the X-ray and
optical/UV bands. The X-ray emission of 3C 454.3 is with a hard spectral index
of $\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.16-1.75$, and the flux in the flaring states increased up
to $(1.80\pm0.18)\times10^{-10}{\rm erg\:cm^{-2}\: s^{-1}}$. Through combining
the analyzed data, it was possible to assemble 362 high-quality and
quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of 3C 454.3 in 2008-2018 which
all were modeled within a one-zone leptonic scenario assuming the emission
region is within the broad line region, involving synchrotron, synchrotron
self-Compton and external Compton mechanisms. Such an extensive modeling is the
key for constraining the underlying emission mechanisms in the 3C 454.3 jet and
allows to derive the physical parameters of the jet and investigate their
evolution in time. The modeling suggests that during the flares, along with the
variation of emitting electron parameters, the Doppler boosting factor
increased substantially implying that the emission in these periods has most
likely originated in a faster moving region.

to simulations of disease spread. It is well known that humans spend 80% of
their time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to
three main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost
indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent
indoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in
mobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a
Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at
multiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input
enterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from
smartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the
mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and micro, to design a
multi-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours
to an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding
captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while
Transformers capture long-term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction
performance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first
predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro-mobility,
conditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the
topological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that
WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the
current state-of-art models. Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications
of WiFiMod - (i) predict high-density hot pockets for policy-making decisions
for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic simulation of indoor mobility,
(iii) design personal assistants.

training and the test dataset are sampled from the same distribution. However,
in real-world situations, a difference in the distribution between two
datasets, domain shift, may occur, which becomes a major factor impeding the
generalization performance of the model. The research field to solve this
problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift
problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In
recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches
have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require
sampling of the negative data pair. However, the performance of contrastive
learning fundamentally depends on quality and quantity of negative data pairs.
To address this issue, we propose a new regularization method for domain
generalization based on contrastive learning, self-supervised contrastive
regularization (SelfReg). The proposed approach use only positive data pairs,
thus it resolves various problems caused by negative pair sampling. Moreover,
we propose a class-specific domain perturbation layer (CDPL), which makes it
possible to effectively apply mixup augmentation even when only positive data
pairs are used. The experimental results show that the techniques incorporated
by SelfReg contributed to the performance in a compatible manner. In the recent
benchmark, DomainBed, the proposed method shows comparable performance to the
conventional state-of-the-art alternatives. Codes are available at

intermediate-sized exoplanets have surfaces and where their surfaces are
located. Here we propose that the abundances of trace species in the visible
atmospheres of these sub-Neptunes can be used as proxies for determining the
existence of surfaces and approximate surface conditions. As an example, we
used a state-of-the-art photochemical model to simulate the atmospheric
evolution of K2-18b and investigate its final steady-state composition with
surfaces located at different pressures levels (Psurf). We find the surface
location has a significant impact on the atmospheric abundances of trace
species, making them deviate significantly from their thermochemical
equilibrium and ""no-surface"" conditions. This result arises primarily because
the pressure-temperature conditions at the surface determine whether
photochemically-produced species can be recycled back to their favored
thermochemical-equilibrium forms and transported back to the upper atmosphere.
For an assumed H2-rich atmosphere for K2-18b, we identify seven chemical
species that are most sensitive to the existence of surfaces: ammonia (NH3),
methane (CH4), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), carbon
monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The ratio between the observed and the
no-surface abundances of these species, can help distinguish the existence of a
shallow surface (Psurf < 10 bar), an intermediate surface (10 bar < Psurf < 100
bar), and a deep surface (Psurf > 100 bar). This framework can be applied
together with future observations to other sub-Neptunes of interest.

Directed Reachability (PDR). Each procedure has been adapted in order to use

on the concept of complex coordinate stretching, an efficient mixed
displacement-strain unsplit-field PML formulation for second-order
(displacementbased) linear elastodynamic equations is then proposed for
simulating the propagation and absorption of elastic waves in unbounded
(infinite or semi-infinite) domains. Both time-harmonic (frequency-domain) and
time-dependent (timedomain) PML formulations are derived for two-and
three-dimensional linear elastodynamic problems. Through the introduction of
only a few additional variables governed by low-order auxiliary differential
equations, the resulting mixed timedomain PML formulation is second-order in
time, thereby allowing the use of standard time integration schemes commonly
employed in computational structural dynamics and thus facilitating the
incorporation into existing displacementbased finite element codes. For
computational efficiency, the proposed timedomain PML formulation is
implemented using a hybrid approach that couples a mixed (displacement-strain)
formulation for the PML region with a classical (displacement-based)
formulation for the physical domain of interest, using a standard Galerkin
finite element method (FEM) for spatial discretization and a Newmark time
scheme coupled with a finite difference (Crank-Nicolson) time scheme for time
sampling. Numerical experiments show the performances of the PML method in

propose a learning-based approach for estimating the mass and center of mass

moves through multiple discrete configurations. Measurements are collected when
the robot reaches each discrete configuration and stops. A neural network is
designed to estimate joint torques from encoder discrepancies. Given multiple
samples, we derive the closed-form relation between joint torques and the
object's inertial properties. Based on the derivation, the mass and COM of
object are identified by weighted least squares. In order to improve the
accuracy of inferred inertial properties, an attention model is designed to
generate weights of joints, which indicate the relative importance for each
joint. Our framework requires only encoder measurements without using any
force/torque sensors, but still maintains accurate estimation capability. The
proposed approach has been demonstrated on a 4 degree of freedom (DOF) robot

model of financial markets using a genetic algorithm and a Nelder-Mead with
threshold accepting algorithm following Fabretti. The novelty of the
Farmer-Joshi model is that the dynamics are driven by trade entry and exit
thresholds alone. We recover the known claim that some important stylized facts
observed in financial markets cannot be easily found under calibration -- in
particular those relating to the auto-correlations in the absolute values of
the price fluctuations, and sufficient kurtosis. However, rather than concerns
relating to the calibration method, what is novel here is that we extended the
Farmer-Joshi model to include agent adaptation using an Brock and Hommes
approach to strategy fitness based on trading strategy profitability. We call
this an adaptive Farmer-Joshi model: the model allows trading agents to switch
between strategies by favouring strategies that have been more profitable over
some period of time determined by a free-parameter fixing the profit monitoring
time-horizon. In the adaptive model we are able to calibrate and recover
additional stylized facts, despite apparent degeneracy's. This is achieved by
combining the interactions of trade entry levels with trade strategy switching.
We use this to argue that for low-frequency trading across days, as calibrated
to daily sampled data, feed-backs can be accounted for by strategy die-out
based on intermediate term profitability; we find that the average trade
monitoring horizon is approximately two to three months (or 40 to 60 days) of
trading.

10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a flux level which is fully consistent with
the previous observations performed with $ROSAT$, $Swift$, and $Chandra$. The
measured pulse period $P$ = 46.753(3) s, compared with the previous
measurements, implies a constant spin down at an average rate $\dot P =
5.3\times 10^{-10}$ s s$^{-1}$. The pulse profile is energy dependent, showing
three peaks at low energy and a less structured profile above about 3.5 keV.
The pulsed fraction slightly increases with energy. We described the
time-averaged EPIC spectrum with four different emission models: a partially
covered power law, a cut-off power law, and a power law with an additional
thermal component (either a black body or a collisionally ionized gas). In all
cases we obtained equally good fits, so it was not possible to prefer or reject
any emission model on the statistical basis. However, we disfavour the presence
of the thermal components, since their modeled X-ray flux, resulting from a
region larger than the neutron star surface, would largely dominate the X-ray
emission from the pulsar. The phase-resolved spectral analysis showed that a
simple flux variation cannot explain the source variability and proved that it
is characterized by a spectral variability along the pulse phase. The results
of the $XMM-Newton$ observation confirmed that CXOU J225355.1+624336 is a BeXB
with a low-luminosity ($L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{34-35}$ erg s$^{-1}$), a limited

robotics research, has been a key initiative for addressing a barrier to entry
for new research groups in surgical robotics. In this paper, we present an

tear an n-ary fact into smaller tuples, neglecting the indecomposability of
some n-ary facts. While other frameworks work for certain arity facts only or
ignore the significance of primary triple. In this paper, we represent an n-ary
fact as a whole, simultaneously keeping the integrity of n-ary fact and
maintaining the vital role that the primary triple plays. In addition, we
generalize hyperbolic Poincar\'e embedding from binary to arbitrary arity data,
which has not been studied yet. To tackle the weak expressiveness and high
complexity issue, we propose HYPER^2 which is qualified for capturing the
interaction between entities within and beyond triple through information
aggregation on the tangent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate HYPER^2
achieves superior performance to its translational and deep analogues,
improving SOTA by up to 34.5\% with relatively few dimensions. Moreover, we
study the side effect of literals and we theoretically and experimentally
compare the computational complexity of HYPER^2 against several best performing
baselines, HYPER^2 is 49-61 times quicker than its counterparts.

RENiO3 perovskites, characterized by the presence of spontaneous metal to

excellent performance over a range of communication channels. Polar codes have

rate allocation of the component polar codes follows the natural polarization
inherent in polar codes. MLC based techniques have not yet been studied in

difficult as the spatial bits actually select a channel index for transmission.

technologies have revolutionized prognostics and health management for various
electrical equipment towards data-driven ways. This revolution delivers a
promising solution for the health monitoring problem of heat pump (HP) system,
a vital device widely deployed in modern buildings for heating use, to timely
evaluate its operation status to avoid unexpected downtime. Many HPs were
practically manufactured and installed many years ago, resulting in fewer
sensors available due to technology limitations and cost control at that time.
It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. We propose a hybrid
scheme by integrating industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and intelligent
health monitoring algorithms to handle this challenge. To start with, an IIoT
network is constructed to sense and store measurements. Specifically,
temperature sensors are properly chosen and deployed at the inlet and outlet of
the water tank to measure water temperature. Second, with temperature
information, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm named mixture slow
feature analysis (MSFA) to timely evaluate the health status of the integrated
HP. Characterized by frequent operation switches of different HPs due to the
variable demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating
speeds are observed. Slowness, a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed
of steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern
division and health evaluation. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is
verified through a real integrated HP with five connected HPs installed ten
years ago. The experimental results show that MSFA is capable of accurately
identifying health status of the system, especially failure at a preliminary
stage compared to its competing algorithms.

spatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learning
requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image
reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both
from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),
we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the
Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect
illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field
as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of
these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared
to NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full
3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and
transient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.

from skin cancer. Specifically, spitzoid melanocytic tumors are one of the most
challenging melanocytic lesions due to their ambiguous morphological features.
The gold standard for its diagnosis and prognosis is the analysis of skin
biopsies. In this process, dermatopathologists visualize skin histology slides
under a microscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last
years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool
that could support pathologists in daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, no
automatic CAD systems have yet been proposed for the analysis of spitzoid
lesions. Regarding common melanoma, no proposed system allows both the
selection of the tumoral region and the prediction of the diagnosis as benign
or malignant. Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end
weakly-supervised deep learning model, based on inductive transfer learning
with an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine the embedding
features of the latent space. The framework is composed of a source model in
charge of finding the tumor patch-level patterns, and a target model focuses on
the specific diagnosis of a biopsy. The latter retrains the backbone of the
source model through a multiple instance learning workflow to obtain the
biopsy-level scoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we
perform extensive experiments on a private skin database with spitzoid lesions.
Test results reach an accuracy of 0.9231 and 0.80 for the source and the target
models, respectively. Besides, the heat map findings are directly in line with
the clinicians' medical decision and even highlight, in some cases, patterns of
interest that were overlooked by the pathologist due to the huge workload.

to design graph neural networks (GNNs), which have achieved state-of-the-art

architectures typically need to perform an expensive recursive neighborhood
expansion in multiple rounds and consequently suffer from a scalability issue.
Moreover, most existing neural-message passing schemes are inflexible since
they are restricted to fixed-hop neighborhoods and insensitive to the actual
demands of different nodes. We circumvent these limitations by a novel
feature-message passing framework, called Graph Multi-layer Perceptron (GMLP),
which separates the neural update from the message passing. With such
separation, GMLP significantly improves the scalability and efficiency by
performing the message passing procedure in a pre-compute manner, and is
flexible and adaptive in leveraging node feature messages over various levels
of localities. We further derive novel variants of scalable GNNs under this
framework to achieve the best of both worlds in terms of performance and
efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations on 11 benchmark datasets,
including large-scale datasets like ogbn-products and an industrial dataset,
demonstrating that GMLP achieves not only the state-of-art performance, but

lighting, reflectance, and geometry of a scene from 360$^{\circ}$ stereo
images. Our model takes advantage of the 360$^{\circ}$ input to observe the
entire scene with geometric detail, then jointly estimates the scene's
properties with physical constraints. We first reconstruct a near-field
environment light for predicting the lighting at any 3D location within the
scene. Then we present a deep learning model that leverages the stereo
information to infer the reflectance and surface normal. Lastly, we incorporate
the physical constraints between lighting and geometry to refine the
reflectance of the scene. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show
that our method, benefiting from the 360$^{\circ}$ observation of the scene,
outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods and enables more augmented reality
applications such as mirror-objects insertion.

associated data composed of inputs and outputs are perfectly known. If this is
not the case, then biased estimates will likely be obtained. Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA) is one of the most extensively used mathematical models to
estimate efficiency. It constructs a piecewise linear frontier against which
all observations are compared. Since the frontier is empirically defined, any
deviation resulting from low data quality (imperfect knowledge of data or IKD)
may lead to efficiency under/overestimation. In this study, we model IKD and,
then, apply the so-called Hit \& Run procedure to randomly generate admissible
observations, following some prespecified probability density functions. Sets
used to model IKD limit the domain of data associated with each observation.
Any point belonging to that domain is a candidate to figure out as the
observation for efficiency assessment. Hence, this sampling procedure must run
a sizable number of times (infinite, in theory) in such a way that it populates
the whole sets. The DEA technique is used during the execution of each
iteration to estimate bootstrapped efficiency scores for each observation. We
use some scenarios to show that the proposed routine can outperform some of the
available alternatives. We also explain how efficiency estimations can be used
for statistical inference. An empirical case study based on the Portuguese
public hospitals database (2013-2016) was addressed using the proposed method.

(DH) waves typically occurs in connection, and often simultaneously, with other
types of radio emissions. As type II bursts are signatures of propagating shock
waves that are associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a rich
variety of radio emissions can be expected. However, sometimes DH type II
bursts appear in the dynamic spectra without other or earlier radio signatures.
One explanation for them could be that the flare-CME launch happens on the far
side of the Sun, and the emission is observed only when the source gets high
enough in the solar atmosphere. In this study we have analysed 26 radio type II
bursts that started at DH waves and were well-separated ('isolated') from other
radio emission features. These bursts were identified from all DH type II
bursts observed in 1998-2016, and for 12 events we had observations from at
least two different viewing angles with the instruments onboard Wind and STEREO
satellites. We found that only 30% of the type II bursts had their source
origin on the far side of the Sun, but also that no bursts originated from the
central region of the Sun (longitudes E30 - W40). Almost all of the isolated DH
type II bursts could be associated with a shock near the CME leading front, and
only few were determined to be shocks near the CME flank regions. In this
respect our result differs from earlier findings. Our analysis, which included
inspection of various CME and radio emission characteristics, suggests that the
isolated DH type II bursts could be a special subgroup within DH type II
bursts, where the radio emission requires particular coronal conditions to form
and to die out.

layer deposition (ALD), electron beam evaporation (EBE), plasma enhanced
chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), and magnetron sputtering methods of
material deposition are investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements
reveal quenching of the excitonic emission after all deposition processes. The
reduction in neutral exciton PL is linked to the increased level of charge
doping and associated rise of the trion emission, and/or the localized (bound)
exciton emission. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allows us to clearly
correlate the observed changes of excitonic emission with the increased levels
of lattice disorder and defects. Overall, the EBE process results in the lowest
level of doping and defect densities and preserves the spectral weight of the
exciton emission in the PL, as well as the exciton oscillator strength.
Encapsulation with ALD appears to cause chemical changes, which makes it
distinct from all other techniques. Sputtering is revealed as the most
aggressive deposition method for WS$_2$, fully quenching its optical response.
Our results demonstrate and quantify the effects of direct deposition of
dielectric materials onto monolayer WS$_2$, which can provide a valuable
guidance for the efforts to integrate monolayer TMDCs into functional

many plausible restorations for a given noisy image. In this paper, we show how
to combine explicit priors on patches of natural images in order to sample from
the posterior probability of a full image given a degraded image. We prove that
our algorithm generates correct samples from the distribution $p(x|y) \propto
\exp(-E(x|y))$ where $E(x|y)$ is the cost function minimized in previous
patch-based approaches that compute a single restoration. Unlike previous
approaches that computed a single restoration using MAP or MMSE, our method
makes explicit the uncertainty in the restored images and guarantees that all
patches in the restored images will be typical given the patch prior. Unlike
previous approaches that used implicit priors on fixed-size images, our
approach can be used with images of any size. Our experimental results show
that posterior sampling using patch priors yields images of high perceptual
quality and high PSNR on a range of challenging image restoration problems.

in part, the geometry of generic supersymmetric compactifications to
five-dimensional Minkowkski space. We define an ECS as an integrable
$\mathrm{U}^{*}(6)\times \mathbb{R}^{+}$ structure and show it is equivalent to
a particular form of involutive subbundle of the complexified generalised
tangent bundle $L_{1} \subset E_{\mathbb{C}}$. We also define a refinement, an
$\mathrm{SU}^{*}(6)$ structure, and show that its integrability requires in
addition a vanishing moment map on the space of structures. We are able to
classify all possible ECSs, showing that they are characterised by two numbers

the output values corresponding to the actual speed of the vehicles. Data
collection in this context requires a complex and costly setup to capture the
images from the camera synchronized with a high precision speed sensor to
generate the ground truth speed values. In this paper we explore, for the first

CARLA) to address vehicle speed detection using a learning-based approach. We
simulate a virtual camera placed over a stretch of road, and generate thousands
of images with variability corresponding to multiple speeds, different vehicle
types and colors, and lighting and weather conditions. Two different approaches
to map the sequence of images to an output speed (regression) are studied,
including CNN-GRU and 3D-CNN. We present preliminary results that support the
high potential of this approach to address vehicle speed detection.

electrostatic and Lorentz forces. Axial momentum gains per ion and electron are
directly calculated from the kinetics of charged particles, indicating that
electrons in the magnetic nozzle obtain the net axial momentum by the Lorentz
force even though they are decelerated by the electrostatic force. Whereas ions
are also accelerated by the electrostatic force, the axial momentum gain of
electrons increases significantly with increasing the magnetic field strength
and becomes dominant in the magnetic nozzle. In addition, it is clearly shown
that the axial momentum gain of electrons is due to the electron momentum
conversion from the radial to axial direction, resulting in the significant
increase in the thrust and the exhaust velocity.

with a validation accuracy of 99.37%. Moreover, the neural network generalizes
well over the data of a player excluded from the training and validation

Various model architectures using machine learning and deep learning based

been compared and benchmarked. Inferences such as performance monitoring and
stroke comparison of the players using the model have been discussed.

two-dimensional asymmetric channel in the presence of an external periodic
driving force. The periodic driving force can break the thermodynamic
equilibrium and induces rectification of particles (or finite average
velocity). The spatial variation in the shape of the channel leads to entropic
barriers, which indeed control the rectification of particles. We find that by
simply tunning the driving frequency, driving amplitude, and shape of the
asymmetric channel, the average velocity can be reversed. Moreover, a short
range interaction force between the particles further enhances the
rectification of particles greatly. This interaction force is modeled as the
lubrication interaction. Interestingly, it is observed that there exists a
characteristic critical frequency $\Omega_c$ below which the rectification of
particles greatly enhances in the positive direction with increasing the
interaction strength; whereas, for the frequency above this critical value, it
greatly enhances in the negative direction with increasing the interaction
strength. Further, there exists an optimal value of the asymmetric parameter of
the channel for which the rectification of interacting particles is maximum.
These findings are useful in sorting out the particles and understanding the
diffusive behavior of small particles or molecules in microfluidic channels,
membrane pores, etc.

Different from existing studies, we characterize the performance while

worthwhile to increase the antenna directivity at the APs than at the UEs, to

leads to the upscale energy transfer. Recent numerical simulations show that
under certain conditions, the energy is accumulated at the largest scales of
the system, forming coherent vortex structures known as condensates. We
analytically describe the interaction of a strong condensate with weak
small-scale turbulent pulsations and obtain an equation that allows us to
determine the radial velocity profile $U(r)$ of a coherent vortex. When
external rotation is fast, the velocity profiles of cyclones and anticyclones
are identical to each other and are well described by the dependence $U(r)
\propto \pm r \ln (R/r)$, where $R$ is the transverse size of the vortex. As
the external rotation decreases, this symmetry disappears: the maximum velocity
in cyclones is greater and the position of the maximum is closer to the axis of
the vortex in comparison with anticyclones. Besides, our analysis shows that
the size $R$ of the anticyclone cannot exceed a certain critical value, which
depends on the Rossby and Reynolds numbers. The maximum size of the cyclones is
limited only by the system size under the same conditions. Our predictions are
based on the linear evolution of turbulent pulsations on the background of the
coherent vortex flow and are accompanied by estimates following from the
nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation.

context of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). Conventionally, the SBIR schema
mainly considers simultaneous mappings among the two image views and the
semantic side information. Therefore, it is desirable to consider fine-grained
classes mainly in the sketch domain using highly discriminative and
semantically rich feature space. However, the existing deep generative
modeling-based SBIR approaches majorly focus on bridging the gaps between the
seen and unseen classes by generating pseudo-unseen-class samples. Besides,
violating the ZSL protocol by not utilizing any unseen-class information during
training, such techniques do not pay explicit attention to modeling the
discriminative nature of the shared space. Also, we note that learning a
unified feature space for both the multi-view visual data is a tedious task
considering the significant domain difference between sketches and color
images. In this respect, as a remedy, we introduce a novel framework for
zero-shot SBIR. While we define a cross-modal triplet loss to ensure the
discriminative nature of the shared space, an innovative cross-modal attention
learning strategy is also proposed to guide feature extraction from the image
domain exploiting information from the respective sketch counterpart. In order
to preserve the semantic consistency of the shared space, we consider a graph
CNN-based module that propagates the semantic class topology to the shared
space. To ensure an improved response time during inference, we further explore
the possibility of representing the shared space in terms of hash codes.
Experimental results obtained on the benchmark TU-Berlin and the Sketchy
datasets confirm the superiority of CrossATNet in yielding state-of-the-art
results.

the rotation of CMB polarization, the plenitude of axions appearing in the

cosmological overproduction of relic axions and moduli by the misalignment
mechanism, more pronounced in regions where the signals mentioned above may be
observable, that is for large axion decay constant. In this work, we study the
minimal requirements to soften this problem and show that the fundamental
requirement is a long period of low-scale inflation. However, in this case, if
the inflationary Hubble scale is lower than around $O(100)$ eV, no relic DM
axion is produced in the early Universe. Cosmological production of some axions
may be activated, via the misalignment mechanism, if their potential minimum
changes between inflation and today. As a particular example, we study in
detail how the maximal-misalignment mechanism dilutes the effect of dangerous
axions and allows the production of axion DM in a controlled way. In this case,
the potential of the axion that realises the mechanism shifts by a factor
$\Delta\theta=\pi$ between the inflationary epoch and today, and the axion
starts to oscillate from the top of its potential. We also show that axions
with masses $m_a\sim O(1-100)\, H_0$ realising the maximal-misalignment
mechanism generically behave as dark energy with a decay constant that can take
values well below the Planck scale, avoiding problems associated to
super-Planckian scales. Finally, we briefly study the basic phenomenological
implications of the mechanism and comment on the compatibility of this type of
maximally-misaligned quintessence with the swampland criteria.

fundamental aspect of distributed source coding. As such, it is necessary to
provide a framework with which to model more practical scenarios with respect
to the arrangement of nodes in order to make Slepian-Wolf coding more suitable
for multi-node Wireless Sensor Networks. This paper provides two practical
scenarios in order to achieve this aim. The first is by grouping the nodes
based on correlation while the second involves simplifying the structure using
Markov correlation. It is found that although the bounds of these scenarios are
more restrictive than the original Slepian-Wolf bound, the overall model and

$L^1$-regularity wave front set for scalar and vector distributions. Our main
result is a proper microlocal characterisation of the support of the singular
part of tempered Radon measures and of their polar functions at these points.
The proof is based on De Philippis-Rindler's approach reinforced by microlocal
analysis techniques and some extra geometric measure theory arguments. We
deduce a sharp $L^1$ elliptic regularity result which appears to be new even
for scalar measures and which enlightens the interest of the techniques from
geometric measure theory to the study of harmonic analysis questions. For
instance we prove that $ \Psi^0 L^1\cap \mathcal M_{loc}\subseteq L^1_{loc},$

L^1_{loc}, D^2 u \in \mathcal M_{loc} \Longrightarrow D^2 u\in L^1_{loc}.$ We
also deduce several consequences including extensions of the results in [10]

two CWRs are nonlinearly coupled through a superconducting quantum interference
device embedded in one of the CWRs. This is equivalent to replacing the

CWR, which makes it possible to drive the JPA by a quantized microwave field.
Owing to this design, the PDC coefficient can be considerably increased to be
about tens of megahertz, satisfying the strong-coupling condition. Using the
Heisenberg-Langevin approach, we numerically show the enhancement of the

becomes stable around the critical point and can generate stronger transient
squeezing. In addition, the strong-coupling PDC can be used to engineer the

valid down to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). This
leads to an undetermined boundary condition at the ISCO, known as the inner
stress of the disc, which sets the luminosity of the disc at the ISCO and
introduces considerable ambiguity in accurately determining the mass, spin and
accretion rate of black holes from observed spectra. We resolve this ambiguity
by self-consistently extending the relativistic disc solution through the ISCO
to the black hole horizon by calculating the inspiral of an average disc
particle subject to turbulent disc forces, using a new particle-in-disc
technique. Traditionally it has been assumed that the stress at the ISCO is
zero, with material plunging approximately radially into the black hole at
close to the speed of light. We demonstrate that in fact the inspiral is less
severe, with several (~4-17) orbits completed before the horizon. This leads to
a small non-zero stress and luminosity at and inside the ISCO, with a local
surface temperature at the ISCO between ~0.15 and 0.3 times the maximum surface
temperature of the disc, in the case where no dynamically important net
magnetic field is present. For a range of disc parameters we calculate the
value of the inner stress/surface temperature, which is required when fitting
relativistic thin disc models to observations. We resolve a problem in
relativistic slim disc models in which turbulent heating becomes inaccurate and
falls to zero inside the plunging region.

present a simple, sparse, and explainable frame sampler, termed as
Motion-Guided Sampler (MGSampler). Our basic motivation is that motion is an
important and universal signal that can drive us to adaptively select frames
from videos. Accordingly, we propose two important properties in our MGSampler

motion representations to enable us to efficiently distinguish the
motion-salient frames from the background. Then, we devise a motion-uniform
sampling strategy based on the cumulative motion distribution to ensure the
sampled frames evenly cover all the important segments with high motion
salience. Our MGSampler yields a new principled and holistic sampling scheme,

distribution function is solved through the direct quadrature method of
moments. The newly established approach includes the uptake of electrostatic
charge by the particles when contacting a solid wall and the exchange of charge
in-between particles during collisions. The electrostatic field induced by the
charge of the particles and the drag forces of the surrounding gas affect the
particle dynamics. Test cases of two-dimensional steady channel flows
demonstrate the charging of the flow from the walls towards the center and in
downstream direction. Further, the method predicts the effect of variations of
the particle size and initial velocity distribution and the charge diffusion
coefficient. The ability to handle polydispersity is a step towards the
simulation of the electric charge build-up of real powder flows in full-scale

clustering procedure also leads to randomly ordered object representations, but
without the need of initialising a fixed number of clusters a priori. This is
used to develop a new model, GENESIS-v2, which can infer a variable number of

contribution of zero-point vibrations of ions into the ground-state energy. We
show that the bcc lattice forms the ground state for any charge number $Z$ of

for all $i$, the $i$-th letter of $w$ belongs to $\ell_i$. The result of Thue
of 1906 implies that there is an infinite square-free word if all the $\ell_i$
are identical. On the other, hand Grytczuk, Przyby{\l}o and Zhu showed in 2011
that it also holds if the $\ell_i$ are of size $4$ instead of $3$.
  In this article, we first show that if the lists are of size $4$, the number
of square-free words is at least $2.45^n$ (the previous similar bound was
$2^n$). We then show our main result: we can construct such a square-free word
if the lists are subsets of size $3$ of the same alphabet of size $4$. Our
proof also implies that there are at least $1.25^n$ square-free words of length
$n$ for any such list assignment. This proof relies on the existence of a set
of coefficients verified with a computer. We suspect that the full conjecture
could be resolved by this method with a much more powerful computer (but we
might need to wait a few decades for such a computer to be available).

surveys. It refers to the coherent distortion of distant galaxy images due to
weak gravitational lensing along the line of sight. It can be used as a tracer
of the matter distribution in the Universe. The unbiased estimation of the
local value of the cosmic shear can be obtained via Bayesian analysis which
relies on robust estimation of the galaxies ellipticity (shape) posterior
distribution. This is not a simple problem as, among other things, the images
may be corrupted with strong background noise. For current and coming surveys,
another central issue in galaxy shape determination is the treatment of
statistically dominant overlapping (blended) objects. We propose a Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network based on Monte-Carlo Dropout to reliably estimate
the ellipticity of galaxies and the corresponding measurement uncertainties. We
show that while a convolutional network can be trained to correctly estimate
well calibrated aleatoric uncertainty, -- the uncertainty due to the presence
of noise in the images -- it is unable to generate a trustworthy ellipticity
distribution when exposed to previously unseen data (i.e. here, blended
scenes). By introducing a Bayesian Neural Network, we show how to reliably
estimate the posterior predictive distribution of ellipticities along with
robust estimation of epistemic uncertainties. Experiments also show that
epistemic uncertainty can detect inconsistent predictions due to unknown
blended scenes.

in an immutable blockchain. To solve this issue, we exploit a legal property of
pseudonymized data: They are only regarded personal data if they can be
associated with an individual's identity. We make use of this fact by
presenting P3, a pseudonym provisioning system for secure usage logs including
a protocol for recording new usages. For each new block, a one-time transaction
pseudonym is generated. The pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees
unlinkability and enables proof of ownership. These properties enable
GDPR-compliant use of blockchain, as data subjects can exercise their legal

non-repudiation, and therefore accountability and liability. Most importantly,
our approach does not require a trusted third party and is independent of the

2018). For general graphs, however, even deciding whether such representations
exist is often $NP$-hard. We consider apex graphs, i.e., graphs that can be
made planar by removing one vertex from them. We show, somewhat surprisingly,
that deciding whether geometric representations exist for apex graphs is
$NP$-hard.
  More precisely, we show that for every positive integer $k$, recognizing
every graph class $\mathcal{G}$ which satisfies $\textsc{PURE-2-DIR} \subseteq
\mathcal{G} \subseteq \textsc{1-STRING}$ is $NP$-hard, even when the input
graphs are apex graphs of girth at least $k$. Here, $PURE-2-DIR$ is the class
of intersection graphs of axis-parallel line segments (where intersections are
allowed only between horizontal and vertical segments) and \textsc{1-STRING} is
the class of intersection graphs of simple curves (where two curves share at
most one point) in the plane. This partially answers an open question raised by
Kratochv{\'\i}l \& Pergel (2007).
  Most known $NP$-hardness reductions for these problems are from variants of
3-SAT. We reduce from the \textsc{PLANAR HAMILTONIAN PATH COMPLETION} problem,
which uses the more intuitive notion of planarity. As a result, our proof is
much simpler and encapsulates several classes of geometric graphs.

introduction of self-supervised learning has greatly helped many methods
including anomaly detection where simple geometric transformation recognition
tasks are used. However these methods do not perform well on fine-grained
problems since they lack finer features. By combining in a multi-task framework
high-scale shape features oriented task with low-scale fine features oriented

biHomE minimizes the distance in the feature space between the warped image
from the source viewpoint and the corresponding image from the target
viewpoint. Since we use a fixed pre-trained feature extractor and the only
learnable component of our framework is the homography network, we effectively
decouple the homography estimation from representation learning. We use an
additional photometric distortion step in the synthetic COCO dataset generation
to better represent the illumination variation of the real-world scenarios. We
show that biHomE achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic COCO
dataset, which is also comparable or better compared to supervised approaches.
Furthermore, the empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach

pulsar survey. Follow-up observations have been made with the MWA, the upgraded
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), and the Parkes 64 m telescopes,
spanning a frequency range from $\sim$150 MHz to 4 GHz. The pulsar is faint,
with an estimated flux density ($S$) of $\sim$1 mJy at 400 MHz and a spectrum
$S(\nu)\,\propto\,\nu^{-2.0 \pm 0.2}$, where $\nu$ is frequency. The DM-derived
distance implies that it is also a low-luminosity source ($\sim$ 0.1 ${\rm

that the pulsar's mean flux density varies by up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 on
timescales of several weeks to months. By combining MWA and uGMRT data, the
pulsar position was determined to arcsecond precision. We also report on
polarization properties detected in the MWA and Parkes bands. The pulsar's
nondetection in previous pulsar and continuum imaging surveys, the observed

reach a dichotomous clinical decision, a threshold would be imposed to
distinguish subjects with disease from non-diseased individuals. Among various
performance metrics for a continuous biomarker, specificity at a controlled
sensitivity level (or vice versa) is often desirable for clinical utility since
it directly targets where the clinical test is intended to operate. Covariates,
such as age, race, and sample collection, could impact the controlled
sensitivity level in subpopulations and may also confound the association
between biomarker and disease status. Therefore, covariate adjustment is
important in such biomarker evaluation. In this paper, we suggest to adopt a
parsimonious quantile regression model for the diseased population, locally at
the controlled sensitivity level, and assess specificity with
covariate-specific control of the sensitivity. Variance estimates are obtained
from a sample-based approach and bootstrap. Furthermore, our proposed local
model extends readily to a global one for covariate adjustment for the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve over the sensitivity continuum. We
demonstrate computational efficiency of this proposed method and restore the
inherent monotonicity in the estimated covariate-adjusted ROC curve. The
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation
studies show favorable performance of the proposal. Finally, we illustrate our
method in biomarker evaluation for aggressive prostate cancer.

been suspected to make important contributions to early metal enrichment, as
features in the nucleosynthesis of such `spinstars' are consistent with the
chemical abundance patterns of some metal-poor stars in the local Universe.
Particularly, stellar winds rich in light elements can provide another pathway
towards explaining the carbon enhancement in carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)
stars. In this work, we focus on the feedback of Pop III stellar winds combined
with supernovae (SNe), and derive the resulting chemical signatures in the
enriched medium. We explore a large parameter space of Pop III star formation,
feedback, yields from winds and SNe with a semi-analytical model. The predicted
pattern of carbon and iron abundances of second-generation stars agrees well
with observations of CEMP-no stars ($[\rm Ba/Fe]<0$) at $[\rm Fe/H]\lesssim -3$
and $A(\mathrm{C})\lesssim 7$, under the optimistic assumption of significant
mass loss by winds from massive ($\gtrsim 25\ \rm M_{\odot}$) stars that
collapse into BHs without SNe. In this scenario, carbon-rich but iron-free
second-generation stars can form in systems dominated by enrichment from winds,
gaining trace amounts of iron by accretion from the interstellar medium, to
become the most iron-poor and carbon-enhanced stars seen in observations ($[\rm
Fe/H]\lesssim -4$, $[\rm C/Fe]\gtrsim 2$). We conclude that the observed
CEMP-no stars can be explained by both our winds + ISM accretion channel as
well as the well-studied faint SN scenario. Wind feedback from Pop~III
spinstars deserves more detailed modelling in early cosmic structure formation.

  In this work, we evaluate four recent geometric deep learning approaches that

  These approaches can be grouped into template-free and template-based

contents based on natural language descriptions. The key to this problem is to
measure text-video similarities in a joint embedding space. However, most
existing methods only consider the global cross-modal similarity and overlook
the local details. Some works incorporate the local comparisons through
cross-modal local matching and reasoning. These complex operations introduce
tremendous computation. In this paper, we design an efficient global-local
alignment method. The multi-modal video sequences and text features are
adaptively aggregated with a set of shared semantic centers. The local
cross-modal similarities are computed between the video feature and text
feature within the same center. This design enables the meticulous local
comparison and reduces the computational cost of the interaction between each
text-video pair. Moreover, a global alignment method is proposed to provide a
global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective.
The global aggregated visual features also provide additional supervision,
which is indispensable to the optimization of the learnable semantic centers.
We achieve consistent improvements on three standard text-video retrieval
benchmarks and outperform the state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

on large-scale datasets. In a sketching phase, the data is first compressed to
a lightweight sketch vector, obtained by mapping the data samples through a
well-chosen feature map, and averaging those contributions. In a learning
phase, the desired model parameters are then extracted from this sketch by
solving an optimization problem, which also involves a feature map. When the
feature map is identical during the sketching and learning phases, formal
statistical guarantees (excess risk bounds) have been proven.
  However, the desirable properties of the feature map are different during
sketching and learning (e.g. quantized outputs, and differentiability,
respectively). We thus study the relaxation where this map is allowed to be
different for each phase. First, we prove that the existing guarantees carry
over to this asymmetric scheme, up to a controlled error term, provided some
Limited Projected Distortion (LPD) property holds. We then instantiate this
framework to the setting of quantized sketches, by proving that the LPD indeed
holds for binary sketch contributions. Finally, we further validate the

typically built based upon simplified turbine models that characterise the
turbine with rigid blades. Large model mismatch, particularly in the power
coefficient, could lead to degradation in estimation performance. Therefore, in
order to effectively reduce the adverse impact of parameter uncertainties in
the estimator model, this paper develops a wind sped estimator based on the
concept of interacting multiple-model adaptive estimation. The proposed
estimator is composed of a bank of extended Kalman filters and each filter
model is developed based on different power coefficient mapping to match the
operating turbine parameter. Subsequently, the algorithm combines the wind
speed estimates provided by each filter based on their statistical properties.
In addition, the proposed estimator not only can infer the rotor-effective wind

Simulation results demonstrate the proposed estimator achieved better
improvement in estimating the rotor-effective wind speed and power coefficient

postselection. A general postselection that is decided after communication
between parties can mimic nonlocality, even though the complete data are local.
Here, we establish conditions under which GMN is demonstrable even if
observations are postselected collectively. Intriguingly, certain postselection
strategies that require communication among several parties still offer a
demonstration of GMN shared between all parties. The results are derived using
the causal structure of the experiment and the no-signalling condition imposed

once disparate source signals are decoupled, their trial-to-trial fluctuations
become more accessible, and cross-population correlations become more apparent.
To decouple sources we introduce a general framework for estimation of current
source densities (CSDs). In this framework, the set of LFPs result from noise
being added to the transform of the CSD by a biophysical forward model, while
the CSD is considered to be the sum of a zero-mean, stationary, spatiotemporal
Gaussian process, having fast and slow components, and a mean function, which
is the sum of multiple time-varying functions distributed across space, each
varying across trials. We derived biophysical forward models relevant to the
data we analyzed. In simulation studies this approach improved identification
of source signals compared to existing CSD estimation methods. Using data
recorded from primate auditory cortex, we analyzed trial-to-trial fluctuations
in both steady-state and task-evoked signals. We found cortical layer-specific
phase coupling between two probes and showed that the same analysis applied
directly to LFPs did not recover these patterns. We also found task-evoked CSDs
to be correlated across probes, at specific cortical depths. Using data from
Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we again found evidence for

to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) that are maliciously perturbed
variants of legitimate inputs. While there has been a vast body of research to
defend against AE attacks in the literature, the performances of existing
defense techniques are still far from satisfactory, especially for adaptive
attacks, wherein attackers are knowledgeable about the defense mechanisms and
craft AEs accordingly. In this work, we propose a multilayer defense-in-depth
framework for AE detection, namely MixDefense. For the first layer, we focus on
those AEs with large perturbations. We propose to leverage the `noise' features
extracted from the inputs to discover the statistical difference between
natural images and tampered ones for AE detection. For AEs with small
perturbations, the inference result of such inputs would largely deviate from
their semantic information. Consequently, we propose a novel learning-based
solution to model such contradictions for AE detection. Both layers are
resilient to adaptive attacks because there do not exist gradient propagation
paths for AE generation. Experimental results with various AE attack methods on
image classification datasets show that the proposed MixDefense solution
outperforms the existing AE detection techniques by a considerable margin.

object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have
revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density
does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that
implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way,
enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified
perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability
to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on
the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments
demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while
performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.

capture some fundamental and dynamical concepts of the environment but suffer
from cognitive bias. In this work, we propose to combine the best of the two
techniques by selecting various model-based approaches thanks to Model-Free
Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using not only past performance and volatility, we
include additional contextual information such as macro and risk appetite
signals to account for implicit regime changes. We also adapt traditional RL
methods to real-life situations by considering only past data for the training
sets. Hence, we cannot use future information in our training data set as
implied by K-fold cross validation. Building on traditional statistical
methods, we use the traditional ""walk-forward analysis"", which is defined by
successive training and testing based on expanding periods, to assert the
robustness of the resulting agent.
  Finally, we present the concept of statistical difference's significance
based on a two-tailed T-test, to highlight the ways in which our models differ
from more traditional ones. Our experimental results show that our approach
outperforms traditional financial baseline portfolio models such as the
Markowitz model in almost all evaluation metrics commonly used in financial
mathematics, namely net performance, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, maximum

chord within a circle, is well known and commonly taught in school curricula.
In this paper, we present a generalisation of this result (and other related
circle theorems) to the rectangular hyperbola. The notion of angle is replaced
by pseudo-angle, defined via the Minkowski inner product. Indeed, in Minkowski
space, the unit hyperbola is the set of points a unit metric distance from the
origin, analogous to the Euclidean unit circle. While this is a result of pure
geometrical interest, the connection to Minkowski space allows an
interpretation in terms of special relativity where, in the limit $c\to\infty$,
it leads to a familiar result from non-relativistic dynamics. This
non-relativistic result can be interpreted as an inscribed angle theorem for
the parabola, which we show can also be obtained from the Euclidean inscribed
angle theorem by taking the limit of a family of ellipses ananlogous to the
non-relativistic limit $c\to\infty$. This simple result could be used as a
pedagogical example to consolidate understanding of pseudo-angles in
non-Euclidean spaces or to demonstrate the power of analytic continuation.

development of fictitious self-forces. Existing particle splitting methods are
largely empirical and their accuracy in preserving the distribution function
has not been evaluated in a quantitative way. Here we present a new method
specifically designed for codes using adaptive mesh refinement. Although we
point out that an exact, distribution function preserving method does exist, it
requires a large number of split particles and its practical use is limited. We
derive instead a method that minimizes the cost function representing the
distance between the assignment function of the original particle and that of
the sum of split particles. Depending on the interpolation degree and the
dimension of the problem, we provide tabulated results for the weight and
position of the split particles. This strategy represents no overhead in
computing time and for a large enough number of split-particles it
asymptotically tends to the exact solution.

characterize the growth rate of an epidemic outbreak. In this paper, we
investigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the
city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and
high-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control
measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations
is characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to
include the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic
strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we
exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of
deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic
strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without
regard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize
control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three
heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target
value for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value.
This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the
entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that
maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic
strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease.
The model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain
point greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective
reproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining
cost-effective control strategies.

target in the scenario. To solve these challenges, we model the movement of the
target by using a trajectory function of time (T-FoT). Data-driven T-FoT
initiation and termination strategies are proposed for identifying the
(re-)appearance and disappearance of the target. During the existence of the
target, real target measurements are distinguished from clutter if the target
indeed exists and is detected, in order to update the T-FoT at each scan for
which we design a least-squares estimator. Simulations using either linear or
nonlinear systems are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in comparison with the Bayes optimal Bernoulli filters. The results
show that our approach is comparable to the perfectly-modeled filters, even
outperforms them in some cases while requiring much less a-prior information
and computing much faster.

while simultaneously having higher spectral efficiency. It also results in
better sensitivity than PPM for orders up to 64 with ideal direct detection

locking system, a set of printed circuit board shimming coils, a sample
exchange system, a set of compact $\beta$-detectors and a custom experimental
vacuum chamber were developed. The main magnetic field was stabilized down to
the ppm level by the locking system while allowing the direct determination of
the absolute magnetic field. The homogeneity of the magnetic field was improved
to $\leq$~5~ppm over the sample volume by the shimming coils. Time spent on
changing samples was reduced by a factor of five by the liquid sample exchange
system. During experiments it was possible to continuously observe the liquid
sample thanks to the custom chamber and compact $\beta$-detectors. The absolute
field determination allows for a novel way to reference $\beta$-NMR
measurements, removing the need for time consuming reference measurements. The
improved accuracy and resolution resulting from these innovations allows the
study of the distribution of nuclear magnetization and (bio)chemicals using

Sensitive photoacoustic gas sensors based on incoherent light sources are

photoacoustic detection and performing a two-channel relative measurement. A
white-light LED is used as a light source and the spectrum is divided into two
wavelength channels with a dichroic filter. The photoacoustic signals generated
by the two wavelength channels are measured simultaneously and used to solve
the NO$_2$ concentration. The background signal is highly correlated between
the two channels and its variations are suppressed in the relative measurement.
A noise level below 1 ppb is reached with an averaging time of 70 s. This is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first time a sub-ppb detection limit is
demonstrated with an LED based photoacoustic NO$_2$ sensor. As LEDs are
available at wide selection of emission wavelengths, the results show great
potential for development of cost-effective and sensitive detectors for a

how to manage the applicable therapeutic resources judiciously to combat this
vital infection. This is a different study that reveals the cancer patients'
viewpoint about how health care practices have been changed in their opinion
during this pandemic year? Are they satisfied with their treatment or not? To
serve the purpose, we gathered more than 60000 relevant tweets from Twitter to
analyse the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings
demonstrate that there is a surge in argument about cancer and its treatment

surely not negative. It is a piece of modest statistical evidence in support of
how natural language processing (NLP) can be accepted to better understand the

Related researches range from annotation tasks description to emotions
detection tools. Visualisation of such emotions is traditionally carried out
using the most popular layouts, as bar plots or tables, which are however
sub-optimal. The classic representation of the Plutchik's wheel follows the
principles of proximity and opposition between pairs of emotions: spatial
proximity in this model is also a semantic proximity, as adjacent emotions
elicit a complex emotion (a primary dyad) when triggered together; spatial
opposition is a semantic opposition as well, as positive emotions are opposite
to negative emotions. The most common layouts fail to preserve both features,
not to mention the need of visually allowing comparisons between different
corpora in a blink of an eye, that is hard with basic design solutions. We
introduce PyPlutchik, a Python library specifically designed for the
visualisation of Plutchik's emotions in texts or in corpora. PyPlutchik draws
the Plutchik's flower with each emotion petal sized after how much that emotion
is detected or annotated in the corpus, also representing three degrees of
intensity for each of them. Notably, PyPlutchik allows users to display also
primary, secondary, tertiary and opposite dyads in a compact, intuitive way. We
substantiate our claim that PyPlutchik outperforms other classic visualisations
